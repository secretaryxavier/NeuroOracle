1. One-third of the world’s population 
is infected with TB, and the prevalence rate of LTBI in low- or 
middle-income countries is estimated to be as high as 51.5%, 
while that in high-income countries is 28.1%

Active TB has a greater burden of TB bacilli than latent TB, 
and acts as an infection source for contacts. Preventing TB 
infection by bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccination, and de-
tecting and treating early-stage TB in high-burden countries 
through an active case-finding strategy are used as the main 
strategies for eradicating TB. Conversely, an active treatment 
strategy for LTBI is used in low TB-burden countries. Human 
immunodeficiency virus–infected patients or household TB 
contacts <6 years of age are candidates for LTBI treatment in 
high TB-burden countries
2. However, the main candidates for 
LTBI treatment in low TB-burden countries are immigrants 
from TB-endemic areas
2,3. Moreover, it has been reported that 
most new TB diagnoses originate from progression of recent 
LTBI rather than remote TB reactivation
4,5. Diagnosis and 
treatment for LTBI is a major strategy for reducing TB preva-
lence, but it must be pursued on the precondition that active 
TB is not missed. Investigation of close household contacts 
is supposed to reduce TB prevalence by 2% per year

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease that has existed 
throughout human history. However, Mycobacterium tuber-
culosis was confirmed as the causative pathogen by Robert 
Koch only in the early 19th century, and the airborne nature 
of TB infection was proved objectively even later, in the 1950s. 
TB develops in only 10% of humans exposed to M. tubercu-
losis. Moreover, TB generally develops within 1–2 years of M. 
tuberculosis infection in 5% of those infected, and at any other

Active tuberculosis (TB) has a greater burden of TB bacilli than latent TB and acts as an infection source for contacts. 
Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is the state in which humans are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis without 
any clinical symptoms, radiological abnormality, or microbiological evidence. TB is transmissible by respiratory droplet 
nucleus of 1–5 μm in diameter, containing 1–10 TB bacilli. TB transmission is affected by the strength of the infectious 
source, infectiousness of TB bacilli, immunoresistance of the host, environmental stresses, and biosocial factors. 
Infection controls to reduce TB transmission consist of managerial activities, administrative control, engineering control, 
environmental control, and personal protective equipment provision. However, diagnosis and treatment for LTBI as a 
national TB control program is an important strategy on the precondition that active TB is not missed. Therefore, more 
concrete evidences for LTBI management based on clinical and public perspectives are needed.

sion from basic and clinical perspectives as well as the broad 
outlines for TB infection control to reduce TB transmission.
Transmission of TB
TB bacilli can be transmitted as droplet nuclei that are resi-
dues of dried respiratory droplets. Droplet nucleus that con-
tain 1–10 TB bacilli is 1–5 μm in diameter. These droplets can 
remain in the air for several hours and can be inhaled into the 
alveoli. On the other hand, respiratory droplets that are >100 
μm in diameter will fall to the ground within 1 m of the origin, 
and will be impacted to the upper airway. Typical droplet 
nuclei-derived infections are measles and TB, while respira-
tory droplets cause staphylococcus and respiratory syncytial 
virus infections. Fluid lining the respiratory tract and TB ba-
cilli contained in it may become aerosolized by high-velocity 
airflow during coughing or sneezing. Moreover, implantation 
of TB bacilli from droplet nuclei can occur after aerial trans-
portation, even though the infectiousness of TB is relatively 
weaker than that of measles. Respiratory secretions surround-
ing droplet nuclei variably protect TB bacilli from dehydration, 
oxygen injury, natural irradiation, and other environmental 
stresses. Experiments have revealed that the half-life of aero-
solized TB bacilli is about 6 hours
6. 
Laboratory experiments using guinea pigs as quantita-
tive air samplers for human TB in TB wards with six single 
rooms proved the following five important facts about TB 
transmission
7: (1) TB is a true airborne infection, requiring 
only air contact for transmission, (2) TB patients vary greatly 
in infectiousness, (3) infectiousness is rapidly reduced by ef-
fective treatment, (4) the average concentration of infectious 
droplet nuclei is low, and (5) ultraviolet irradiation is a highly 
effective method of air disinfection. TB bacilli are engulfed by 
alveolar macrophages, and infection appears to be aborted 
without immunological stigma if the organisms are destroyed 
before they replicate to 10–15 generations
8. Transmission of 
TB bacilli is influenced by strength of the infectious source, 
infectiousness of virulent TB bacilli, immunoresistance of the 
host, environmental stresses, and biosocial factors, as shown 
in Figure 1
8. 
Mathematical Models of Transmission
The most representative quantitative study for airborne in-
fection through droplet nuclei is the school measles outbreak 
study. However, Edward Riley modified Wells’s use of the 
Soper mass balance equation
9 for TB ward experiments
10 as 
follows, while TB infectiveness through casual contact was as-
sumed to be relatively lower than that of measles: 
C=S(1–e
-Iqpt/Q)
, where, C=Number of new cases, S=Number of susceptibles 
exposed, e=Natural logarithm, I=Number of infectious sources, 
q=Number of quanta (infectious doses) generated per unit 
min, p=Human ventilation rate (L/min), t=Exposure duration, 
Q=Infection-free ventilation (L/sec) (assumption: uniform 
susceptibility of exposed persons to infection, uniform viru-
lence of organisms from one outbreak to another).
According to experiments using guinea pigs and inbred rab-
bits, it was reported that a single droplet nucleus containing 
more than three TB bacilli is enough to cause TB infection

Although TB susceptibility varies among different human 
races and individuals, it is estimated to be nearly the same as 
in the animal experiments.
TB Outbreaks and Infection Control
Recently, TB outbreaks have been reported frequently in 
middle and high schools, military locations, work places, and 
dormitory settings in South Korea
12. Therefore, LTBI treat-
ment has become an important policy for reducing the TB 
prevalence rate in South Korea, and LTBI control guidelines 
have been strengthened by the revision of the 2014 Korean 
guidelines for TB
13. Many guidelines for TB infection control 
have been published internationally as follows: Guidelines for 
Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
in Health-Care Settings (US Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, CDC)
14; World Health Organization (WHO) Policy 
on TB Infection Control in Health-Care Facilities, Congregate 
Settings, and Households (WHO)
15; Guidelines for Design and 
Construction of Health-Care Facilities (American Institute of 
Architects)
16; and additional updates for personal protective 
equipment guidelines (US Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration, 2003). WHO guidelines for TB infection con-
trol describe national and subnational activities as managerial 
activities, administrative control, engineering control, environ-
mental control, and personal protective equipment provision 
for the implementation of TB infection control in health-care 
facilities, congregate settings, and households, respectively

Guidelines regarding managerial activities provide policy 
makers at the national and subnational levels with a com-
prehensive framework that can support and facilitate the 
implementation, operation, and maintenance of TB infec-
tion control in health-care facilities, congregate settings, and 
households. Administrative controls mean activities that are 
intended to reduce the risk of exposure to persons with infec-
tious TB. These controls include policies and procedures for 
the early identification, evaluation, isolation, and treatment of 
patients likely to have TB. Environmental controls mean the 
use of engineering technologies to reduce the concentration 
of airborne infectious droplet nuclei to prevent the spread 
of TB. Personal protective equipment is the last level of TB 
control and concerns the use of respiratory protection that 
can reduce the risk of exposure to infectious droplet nuclei for 
health-care workers. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention propose guidelines for inpatient settings (patient 
rooms, emergency departments, intensive care units, surgical 
suites, laboratories, bronchoscopy suites, sputum induction 
or inhalation therapy rooms, autopsy suites, and embalming 
rooms), outpatient settings (TB treatment facilities, medical 
offices, ambulatory-care settings, dialysis units, and dental-
care settings), and nontraditional facility-based settings (med-
ical settings in correctional facilities, long-term care settings, 
and emergency medical services)
14. Homeless shelters should 
follow the same TB infection control measures, but LTBI 
screening for homeless people is not recommended because 
of concerns about cost-effectiveness and compliance
17. New 
immigrants from countries with a high TB incidence must 
also be screened for active TB
18.
Clinical Perspective of the Infectiousness 
of TB
Patients with pulmonary, laryngeal, or endobronchial TB 
are highly contagious, and the infectiousness is increased 
in the following conditions: (1) presence of lung cavities, (2) 
positive acid-fast bacillus smear or culture for sputum, and (3) 
presence of respiratory symptoms like cough. On the other 
hand, infectiousness is rapidly reduced by anti-TB chemother-
apy. TB bacilli burden is reduced to 1/25th of the initial level 
within 2 days of anti-TB chemotherapy, and to 1/100th within 
2–3 weeks of anti-TB chemotherapy in drug-sensitive TB 
patients
19,20. The infectious period is over when the following 
criteria are satisfied: (1) effective treatment (as demonstrated 
by M. tuberculosis susceptibility results) for >2 weeks, (2) 
diminished symptoms, and (3) mycobacteriologic response 
(e.g., decrease in grade of sputum smear positivity detected 
on sputum-smear microscopy). Even though the start of the 
infectious period cannot be determined with precision, an 
assigned start that is 3 months before a TB diagnosis is recom-
mended based on the characteristics of an index TB patient 
(Table 2)
20.
TB Infection of Contacts and Risk of 
Active TB Development
The risk of TB infection of contacts is different depending 
on the proximity and duration of contact. TB contacts are clas-
sified as close and casual contacts according to the intensity 
of contact. Close contacts are those who spend a long time 
(more than 8 hours) with infectious TB patients in a closed 
space
18; they are further divided into close household and 
close non-household contacts. Close household contacts are 
those who share the patient’s breathing space daily (bedroom, 
kitchen, bathroom, or living room) and live with infectious TB 
patients. Close non-household contacts are those who share 
breathing space with an index TB patient outside the house-
hold (e.g., workplace, school, etc.). In contact investigation, 
higher priority is given to close contacts including household 
contacts as well as to risk groups; casual contacts are the next 
priority. When M. tuberculosis is inhaled, alveolar macro-

phages kill the TB bacilli. When humans are infected with M. 
tuberculosis, 10% of infected hosts progress to active TB and 
the remaining 90% sustain LTBI. High-risk groups such as hu-
man immunodeficiency virus–infected patients and contacts 
<2 years old, and moderate-risk groups such as children and 
adolescents between 2–18 years of age and patients with end-
stage renal disease or diabetes mellitus can easily progress to 
active TB if exposed to infectious TB. Therefore, these groups 
must have higher priority for the diagnosis of LTBI (Figure 2)
21.
Active TB Progression and LTBI Treatment
Cell-mediated immune response develops 2–10 weeks af-
ter infection by M. tuberculosis and is identified by tuberculin 
skin test conversion; this accelerates granuloma formation in 
the body
22. The infected person can show no clinical manifes-
tation or mild respiratory symptoms including febrile sensa-
tions. In primary TB disease (recent infection), some young 
children can show infiltration on chest radiographs suggesting 
active TB, but this manifestation is frequently spontaneously 
resolved leaving calcified scar lesions. In contrast, reactiva-
tion of latent TB caused by a weakened immune status and 
presenting as cavities in the lung apex or superior segment 
of the lower lobe is known as secondary TB disease (remote 
infection). However, according to recent reports, different 
presentations of primary TB disease, which shows pulmonary 
infiltration at the lower lobe, and secondary TB disease, which 
presents as pulmonary cavities in the apex or superior seg-
ment, seem to be related to the host’s immune status rather 
than time
23. It seems that active TB generally develops within 
a year after LTBI, and the rate of active TB cases decreases 
sharply after the first year and continues to decrease slowly 
thereafter in the following 10 years
24. Meanwhile, pleural TB, 
meningeal TB, and military TB seem to be reactivated in the 
earlier period. In addition, it was reported that previous TB ex-
posure provides protective immunity against further infection 
(reinfection) in 16%–40% of cases
25. 
There is a subclinical borderline phase with uncertain ra-
diological manifestations prior to symptomatic presentation
26. 
In this obscure subclinical phase, which can last for months 
between latent and active clinical TB, molecular diagnostic 
methods or computerized tomography scans can be used 
to prevent infectious TB from going unnoticed
27, but cost-
effectiveness must also be considered. To reduce the TB prev-
alence rate effectively, the range of candidates for LTBI treat-
ment must be expanded. However, treatment interruption and 
overtreatment for unnecessary candidates must be avoided. 
In other words, shorter treatments with fewer adverse events 
must be performed and the number of candidates needed to 
be treated for preventing one additional active TB progression 
from latent TB must be minimized by mutual agreement be-
tween policymakers and clinicians
26. 
Conclusion
TB can be transmitted by respiratory droplet nuclei. The 
factors that influence the transmission of TB bacilli are the 
strength of the infectious source, infectiousness of virulent TB 
bacilli, immunoresistance of the host, environmental stresses, 
and biosocial factors. Infection controls to reduce TB trans-
mission consist of national and subnational activities, which 
include managerial activities, administrative control, engi-
neering control, environmental control, and personal protec-
tive equipment provision, in health-care facilities, congregate 
settings, and households, respectively. Active TB progression 
from LTBI is influenced by the age and immune status of 
the host. To reduce the TB prevalence rate, the range of can-
didates for LTBI treatment, including those in the high-risk 
group, needs to be expanded. However, consensus between 
clinical and public aspects must be achieved based on definite 
domestic evidences.
