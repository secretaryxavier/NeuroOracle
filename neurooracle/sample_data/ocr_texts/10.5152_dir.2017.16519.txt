chizophrenia is a chronic disorder with abnormalities in perception, thinking, and be-
havior and presentation of negative symptoms (1). Though there have been many 
advances in the treatment of schizophrenia, it is still difficult to achieve recovery and 
current treatments may only alleviate some of the symptoms of schizophrenia, instead of 
treating the underlying pathology (2). Schizophrenia patients are heterogeneous  in their 
clinical findings and a well-defined, common pathology was not elucidated to allow for 
identification of curative treatments. 
The neuroimaging studies about the neurobiology of schizophrenia have focused on 
brain connectivity, brain function, and changes in grey matter volumes (3). Meta-anal-
ysis of imaging studies suggest that the bilateral insula, thalamus, dorsolateral prefron-
tal cortex, medial frontal gyrus and posterior cingulate gyrus, superior temporal cortex,

PURPOSE  
Grey matter and white matter changes within the brain are well defined in schizophrenia. How-
ever, most studies focused on either grey matter changes or white matter integrity separately; 
only in limited number of studies these changes were interpreted in the same frame. In addition, 
the relationship of these findings with clinical variables is not clearly established. Here, we aimed 
to investigate the grey matter and white matter changes in schizophrenia patients and exhibit 
the relation of these imaging findings with clinical variables. 
METHODS
A total of 20 schizophrenia patients and 16 matched healthy controls underwent magnetic reso-
nance imaging to investigate the grey matter and white matter alterations that occur in schizo-
phrenia patients using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and whole brain voxel-wise analysis 
of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters with SPM8, respectively. While the preprocessing 
steps of VBM were performed with the default parameters of VBM8 toolbox, the preprocessing 
steps of DTI were carried out using FSL. Additionally, VBM results were correlated with clinical 
variables.
RESULTS
Bilateral insula showed decreased grey matter volume in schizophrenia patients compared with 
healthy controls (P < 0.01). The opposite contrast did not show a significant difference. Psychi-
atric scores, duration of illness, and age were not correlated with the decreased grey matter 
volume of insula in schizophrenia patients. DTI analysis revealed a significant increase in mean, 
radial, and axial diffusivity, mainly of the fibers of bilateral anterior thalamic radiation and supe-
rior longitudinal fasciculus with left predominance, which intersected with bilateral subinsular 
white matter (P < 0.05). 
CONCLUSION
Our findings suggest that insula may be the main affected brain region in schizophrenia, which 
is also well supported by the literature. Our results were independent of disease duration and 
schizophrenia symptoms. White matter alterations were observed within bilateral anterior tha-
lamic radiation and superior longitudinal fasciculus that intersects with subinsular white matter. 
Studies with larger sample sizes and more detailed clinical assessments are required to under-
stand the function of insula in the neurobiology of schizophrenia.

Combined VBM and DTI study of schizophrenia • 391
bilateral hippocampal–amygdala region, 
middle frontal and left medial temporal 
lobe show decreased grey matter vol-
umes in schizophrenia (2, 4, 5). Decreased 
volume in each region may be related to 
a different clinical presentation of schizo-
phrenia. Some studies showed that su-
perior temporal lobe changes were cor-
related with formal thought disorders (6), 
hallucinations, and the duration and type 
of antipsychotic treatment (7), while left 
prefrontal cortex volume was correlated 
with functioning (8). 
On the other hand, schizophrenia pa-
tients may also show white matter disinteg-
rity even in very early stages (9), and some 
of these white matter changes were also 
reported to correlate with clinical measures 
as neurocognitive symptoms and negative 
symptoms (10, 11). However, white matter 
analysis showed that multiple circuits were 
involved in the disorder (12), and they may 
be related to different phenotypes of the 
disorder or converging functions of these 
circuits.
Because of different hypotheses, meth-
ods, and regions of interest used in the 
studies, the results have not always been 
reproducible. Therefore, it is important to 
accumulate new evidence from different 
patient groups and study the clinical cor-
relates of the observed volumetric differ-
ences. 
In this study, we aimed to present our im-
aging findings of 20 schizophrenia patients 
and 16 matched healthy participants and 
study the correlation of grey matter volume 
differences with clinical variables.
Methods
Participants
Participants were selected from inpa-
tients and outpatients that were treated 
at the Department of Psychiatry. Our local 
ethics committee approved the study. Pa-
tients who accepted a magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scan and signed a written in-
formed consent were included in the study. 
For inpatients, a family member also con-
tributed to the consent of the patient. 
We matched 16 healthy controls for edu-
cation, gender, marital status, work status, 
and handedness with 20 schizophrenia pa-
tients whose diagnoses were given based 
on DSM-IV criteria.
For schizophrenia patients, study inclu-
sion criteria were schizophrenia diagnosis 
according to DSM-IV criteria; duration of 
illness for >1 year; lack of substance abuse 
history. Study exclusion criteria were age 
below 18 years, any additional axis I or II 
diagnosis, history of a complicated medical 
disorder or any neurologic disorder includ-
ing history of head trauma that might re-
sult in cognitive dysfunction or grey matter 
loss. Clinical assessment of schizophrenia 
patients included the scale for the assess-
ment of positive symptoms (SAPS), scale 
for the assessment of negative symptoms 
(SANS), brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), 
and global assessment of functioning (GAF) 
scores. These tests were either extracted 
from concurrent hospital registry data or 
were performed as part of physician eval-
uations at the day of imaging. Additional 
information was gathered through the hos-
pital’s registry database. All patients were 
on neuroleptic treatment (5 of them were 
using clozapine) and they had illness dura-
tion more than 1 year. 
Healthy controls were chosen from a 
community sample after a face-to-face 
structured interview with H.Y.E. interview-
ers who were not diagnosed with any psy-
chiatric disorders and did not have any 
first-degree relatives with any psychiatric 
disease were chosen as controls. 
Sociodemographic variables of patients 
and controls are given in Table 1.
Structural MRI 
All subjects were scanned with 1.5 T GE 
Signa MRI scanner and 8-channel phase ar-
ray coil. The examination protocol included 
volumetric scans and diffusion tensor im-
aging (DTI). The imaging parameters of DTI 
were as follows: single shot EPI sequence, 
TR, 100000 ms; TE, 104.6 ms; flip angle, 90; 
FOV, 100 cm; slice thickness, 4 mm; number 
of direction, 25. Volumetric scans were ob-
tained using a three-dimensional volumetric 
spoiled gradient recalled-echo sequence in 
sagittal plane with the following parame-
ters: TE, 5.448 ms; TR, 12.392 ms; flip angle, 
20; matrix size, 256×160 mm; FOV, 80 cm; 
voxel size: 1.0×1.0×1.0 mm; slice thickness, 
1.0 mm. Volumetric scans were oriented per-
pendicular to the anterior posterior commis-
sure line. 
Analysis of grey matter volume
Image preprocessing was performed by 
VBM8 using SPM 8 (SPM; Wellcome Depart-
ment of Cognitive Neurology; www.fil.ion.
ucl.ac.uk) running on MATLAB 13 (www.

mathworks.com). Files that were originally 
in DICOM format were converted to analyze 
format. All of the naive T1-weighted images 
were manually reorientated by setting the 
coordinate origin of each image on anteri-
or commissure. The default parameters of 
VBM8 toolbox were used for preprocessing 
steps. Briefly, the T1-weighted images were 
bias-corrected and a spatially adaptive 
non-local means filter was used to eliminate 
MRI inhomogeneities and avoid noise, re-
spectively. A classical Markov random field 
model was performed as a spatial constraint 
in order to provide further improvement in 
signal-to-noise ratio. Registration into stan-
dard MNI space comprised a linear affine 
transformation and nonlinear deformation 
using high dimensional DARTEL normal-
ization. Non-brain tissues were stripped off 
and brain tissue were segmented into grey 
matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal 
fluid. Afterwards, segmented grey matter 
and white matter images were multiplied 
by the nonlinear components that were de-
rived from normalization matrix. Eventually, 
modulated grey matter and white matter 
images were generated to calculate the ac-
tual grey matter and white matter volumes. 
Normalization quality of the unsegmented, 
normalized images was visually inspected. 
We calculated the covariance between nor-
malized segmented images to identify any 
outliers for artifacts or preprocessing errors. 
Modulated and segmented images were 
spatially smoothed by using a Gaussian 
kernel filter set at 8 mm full with half maxi-
mum (FWHM). An absolute threshold mask-
ing value of 0.3 was selected for grey mat-
ter volumes. Regions with significant grey 
matter volume differences between schizo-
phrenia patients and controls were tested 
using two-sample t-test in SPM8 based on a 
voxel-level and cluster-level height thresh-
old of P < 0.05 (FWE-corrected).
Regions-of-interest (ROIs) of clusters that 
showed a significant group difference were 
extracted using MarsBar 0.41 (http://mars-
bar.sourceforge.net/) and mean grey matter 
volumes of the significant ROI was calculat-
ed for each patient using log_roi_batch v2.0 
function in Matlab (http://www.aimfeld.ch).
 
Diffusion tensor imaging
The preprocessing of DTI data was per-
formed by FSL (version 5.0.6), the FM-
RIB 
Software 
Library 
(http://fsl.fmrib.
ox.ac.uk/fsl) (Smith et al., 2004). Firstly, dif-
fusion-weighted data were corrected for 
motion and eddy current artifacts by using 
FMRIB’s diffusion toolbox. Then, brain ex-
traction tool was used to extract images 
for removing non-brain tissue and for each 
subject a binary brain mask was created. 
Next, a diffusion tensor model was fitted 
in each voxel and diagonal elements (λ1, 
λ2, λ3), fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean 
diffusivity (MD) images were generated us-
ing FSL’s DTIFIT. Axial diffusivity (AD) maps 
were created from λ1 and radial diffusivity 
(RD) maps were calculated with λ23 = (λ2 + 
λ3)/2. All subjects’ maps were aligned to FM-
RIB58-FA template in Montreal Neurologi-
cal Institute (MNI) 152 standard space and 
re-sampled to a spatial resolution 1×1×1 
mm3 using FMRIB’s nonlinear registration 
tool FNIRT. In the same manner, the trans-
formations were applied to the AD, MD, and 
RD
 
maps for each subject. Finally, the qual-
ity of the normalized images was checked 
by visual inspection. 
Statistical analysis 
Statistical analysis was performed us-
ing SPSS (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, 
version 21.0, IBM Corp.). Nonparametric 
t-test or chi-square test was used in com-
paring demographical differences between 
groups for continuous variables and cate-
gorical variables, respectively. 
Correlation analysis of behavioral and 
grey matter ROI data was performed as 
follows. First, data were examined for nor-
mality with visual histograms and both the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov 
and 
Shapiro-Wilk 
tests. Correlation coefficients were calculat-
ed to assess bivariate associations between 
individual mean volume of the ROIs and 
clinical variables such as age, duration of 
illness, SAPS, SANS, BPRS, and GAF scores 
using Pearson correlation test for normally 
distributed data, and Spearman’s rank-or-
der correlation test for non-normally dis-
tributed data. P values smaller than 0.004 
were considered significant using Bonfer-
roni adjusted alpha level of 0.05/12 = 0.004 
for multiple comparisons.
Whole-brain voxel-wise analysis of whole 
brain white matter integrity was performed 
using statistical parametric mapping (SPM 
8) software (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/
spm). A Gaussian kernel of 8 mm FWHM 
was used to smooth the FA, AD, MD, and RD 
maps. In order to eliminate voxels of grey 
matter and cerebrospinal fluid, a group-av-
eraged map was created from normalized 
but unsmoothed FA maps of each subject 
and then binarized using a cutoff value of 
0.2. In this way, only voxels surviving this 
threshold were included in the group anal-
yses. The significance of the differences 
between the schizophrenia patients and 
healthy controls were calculated by apply-
ing general linear models to FA, AD, MD, 
and RD maps, separately using a voxel-wise 
height threshold of P value less than 0.0005 
combined with a cluster-level family-wise 
error (FWE) correction for multiple compar-
isons. 
Results
Schizophrenia patients demonstrated 
decreased grey matter volume only in bi-
lateral insula (Table 2, Fig. 1). VBM analysis 
revealed right insula predominance in grey 
matter decrease at cluster forming height 
threshold FWE-corrected P < 0.05 com-
bined with a cluster-level FWE correction. In 
whole-brain comparisons, larger decreases 
were observed in grey matter volume of 
right insula (cluster-level FWE-corrected  
P = 0.001; cluster size: 111 voxels, MNI peak 
coordinates: 39 12 0) compared with left in-
sula (cluster-level FWE-corrected P = 0.009; 
cluster size: 26 voxels, MNI peak coordi-
nates: -45 3 1). In contrast, healthy control 
subjects did not have any grey matter re-
gions with a decreased volume compared 
with schizophrenia patients. 
None of the clinical variables (SANS, SAPS, 
BPRS, and GAF scores, age, and duration of 
illness) were significantly correlated with 
grey matter volume of insula in patients 
diagnosed with schizophrenia (P > 0.004;

sociation of subtypes of schizophrenia with 
the grey matter measurements because of 
the small sample size.
FA values were not significantly differ-
ent between schizophrenia patients and 
healthy controls. However, in whole-brain 
comparisons, the SPM two-sample t-test 
revealed that patients with schizophrenia 
displayed increased AD in left superior lon-
gitudinal fasciculi (t=4.56, P = 0.016; Fig. 2), 
increased MD in bilateral superior longitu-
dinal fasciculus with left predominance and 
bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (cluster 
in left hemisphere: t=5.81, P < 0.001; clus-
ter in right hemisphere: t=5.03, P = 0.006;  
Fig. 3), and increased RD in left anterior 
thalamic radiation (t=4.63, P = 0.027; Fig. 4) 
compared with healthy subjects (Table 4). 
The localizations of significant white matter 
differences corresponded to bilateral ante-
rior thalamic radiation and superior longi-
tudinal fasciculus, which intersected with 
bilateral subinsular white matter (Fig. 5). 
Discussion
Our study showed that schizophrenia pa-
tients have decreased grey matter volume 
in bilateral insula. Besides its role in addic-
tion, insula has been recently found to be 
related to impulsivity, interceptive aware-
ness (13), cognition (14), and emotion reg-
ulation (15). Studies with larger samples 
showed that depression w associated with 
bilaterally decreased insula volumes (16). 
In our study, insula volume was found de-
creased bilaterally in patients with schizo-
phrenia compared with normal controls, 
consistent with other reports (2, 17, 18). De-
creased insula volumes were reported even 
in first episode schizophrenia cases (19–21). 
We found that decreased insula volume 
was not associated with total positive and 
negative symptom scores, disease duration 
or functionality. However, we did not mea-
sure the insight or quality of life. Keeping in 
mind that our study did not have measures 
for mood and functionality symptoms, it 
may be concluded that grey matter de-
crease in insula may be the main pathology 
in schizophrenia patients independent of 
the clinical presentation. In previous stud-
ies, decreased insula volume was found 
to be associated with poor functional out-
come (7), somatic delusions (22), severity 
of auditory hallucinations (23), reduced 
insight of the illness (24), and quality of life 
(25). However, reduced insular volume was 
also reported to differentiate schizophrenia

patients from their healthy relatives (26), 
and it was even present in first episode psy-
chosis (27). Decreased right anterior insula 
volume in schizophrenia patients was also 
shown to be independent of ethnicity and 
duration of illness, positive and negative 
scores and antipsychotic treatments (28). 
In our patient sample this result has been 
replicated. Though we have a very small 
sample size to generalize our results, our 
suggestion that decreased insula volume 
could be the main pathology in schizophre-
nia patients was supported by Lee et al. 
(29) who showed that antipsychotic-naive 
first episode schizophrenia patients have 
decreased bilateral insula volume and this 
decrease was progressive during the course 
of the disorder (29). 
In our study, we showed that white 
matter adjacent to insula was disrupted in 
schizophrenia patients. Although there are 
a number of published articles on white 
matter disintegrity, to our knowledge most 
studies focused on a specific region-of-in-
terest based on their hypothesis and it was 
not commonly replicated. In addition, most 
of the studies applied VBM and DTI analysis 
separately. In this study, we found that pa-
tients diagnosed with schizophrenia had in-
creased AD, MD, and RD values correspond-
ing to left and right superior longitudinal 
fasciculus and anterior thalamic radiation. 
By combining VBM and DTI techniques, 
we showed the correspondence of altered 
white matter tracts to subinsular white mat-
ter bilaterally.
Most of the DTI studies focused on FA val-
ues conducting voxel-based analysis of FA 
only (30, 31). In whole brain analysis studies, 
even early cases of schizophrenia showed bi-
laterally decreased FA values, which may be 
associated with illness duration (32, 33). In 
addition to this, a meta-analysis which com-
bined findings from 15 DTI studies reported 
two main regions in schizophrenia patients: 
left frontal and temporal white matter in-
cluding anterior thalamic radiation (33). 
However, FA is not the only value that shows 
the decreased white matter integrity; three 
other measures of MD, AD, and RD both give 
a different estimate of the underlying mo-
lecular pathology. Though FA decrease and 
MD increase may be correlated (27), MD val-

Increase in MD value in the insula has also 
been reported (36, 37). In addition, these pa-
rameters are not always correlated with each 
other (38). In our study, non-FA measures of 
DTI showed consistently increased values in 
the overlapping regions compared with con-
trols, which suggested a consistent white 
matter disintegrity.
The results of our study showed increased 
MD values within bilateral anterior tha-
lamic radiation and superior longitudinal 
fasciculus, in addition to greater RD values 
within the left anterior temporal lobe and 
greater AD within the left superior longitu-
dinal fasciculus. Anterior thalamic radiation 
provides connection between mediodorsal 
thalamic nuclei and the frontal cortex, as 
well as connection between anterior tha-
lamic nuclei and the anterior cingulate cor-
tices (39). It has a role in memory encoding 
and executive functioning (40). On the oth-
er hand, superior longitudinal fasciculus is 
the main white matter tract that connects 
frontal-parietal regions. Recently, reduced 
integrity in anterior thalamic radiation and 
superior longitudinal fasciculus has been 
reported (41–45). Besides, a correlation has 
been found between negative symptoms, 
cognitive impairment, and white matter 
disintegrity within these white matter tracts 
(46, 47). Thus, in accordance with the previ-
ous literature, our results point to disinteg-
rity within cortico-striato-thalamic circuit in 
schizophrenia.
Although the results of our study are in 
agreement with the literature and there are 
some limitations. First, although the patients 
were strictly matched with healthy controls 
for age, gender, educational status and dom-
inant hand, our study has a relatively small 
sample size that may have introduced type 
II error in correlation analyses between insu-
lar grey matter volume and clinical analyses. 
Figure 3. a–d. Voxel-wise group comparison of mean diffusivity (MD): right sagittal (a), left sagittal (b), 
axial (c), and coronal (d) images show increased MD (height threshold uncorrected, P < 0.0005; cluster 
level FWE-corrected, P < 0.001) in patients with schizophrenia within left and right subinsular white 
matter. Clusters are superimposed on the FMRIB58_FA (1 mm) image (MNI peak coordinate, -26 -14 18; 
cluster size, 12474 voxels and MNI peak coordinate, 30 -15 15; cluster size, 2428 voxels, respectively).

Second, since we included schizophrenia 
patients diagnosed >1 year ago they have 
been on antipsychotic treatment and we 
could not rule out medication effect on the 
observed grey matter differences. Neverthe-
less, our results of decreased grey matter vol-
ume in bilateral insula may be independent 
from antipsychotic treatment since a recent 
study with a small sample size showed that 
use of antipsychotics may increase bilateral 
insula volume. Third, we did not assess anxi-
ety and depressive symptoms in the patient 
group; therefore we could not distinguish 
the effect of these symptoms on the neuro-
pathology of the disease. Lastly in VBM anal-
ysis, morphology of insula was assessed as 
a whole but its various subdimensions may 
also be analyzed separately. 
In conclusion, based on the findings of 
this study, we suggest that insula may be 
the main affected brain region in schizo-
phrenia. The role of the insula in patho-
physiology of schizophrenia, its functional 
connectivity with other brain regions, in 
addition to time-dependent volumetric 
changes should be further investigated in 
studies with larger number of patients with 
schizophrenia.

Figure 5. a–c. Significant grey matter and white matter MD differences were superimposed on the FMRIB58_FA (1 mm) image. Areas in blue color indicate 
significantly decreased grey matter volume, while hot colors indicate significantly increased MD in white matter of bilateral anterior thalamic radiation 
and superior longitudinal fasciculus in schizophrenia compared with healthy controls. It should be noted that the localizations of significant white matter 
differences intersect with bilateral subinsular white matter.
