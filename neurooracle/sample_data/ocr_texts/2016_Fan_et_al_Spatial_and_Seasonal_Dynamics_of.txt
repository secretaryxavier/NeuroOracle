Where LFm is ME load factors; ActSpeed is the actual speed when ship is cruising; 
MaxSpeed is the maximum speed designed for the ship; Em is emissions from ME (g)，
Pm is the installed power of ME (kw); LLAM is low load adjustment multipliers of 
ME; T is operation time(h); EFm is ME emissions factors(g/kwh); FCFm is fuel 
correction factors of ME; CFm is ME control factors.; Ea is emissions from AE (g); Pa 
is the installed power of AE (kw); LFa is AE load factors; T is operation time(h); EFa 
is AE emissions factors (g/kwh); CFa is AE control factors; Eb is emissions from AB 
(g); Pb is the installed power of AB (kw); LFb is AB load factors; T is operation 
time(h); EFb is AB emissions factors (g/kwh); CFb is AB control factors; E is the total 
emissions of ship. For ships available in Lloyd's register, the following data was 
derived from Lloyd's database including: ship name, ship type, date of construction, 
flag name, revolutions per minute (RPM) of the main engine, speed, total kilowatts of 
the main engines (ME), total power of the auxiliary engines (AE) and gross tonnage. 
For some domestic ships unavailable in Lloyd's database, the engine data are assumed 
to be 7000 kw by default, based on the East China Sea-going ships in Lloyd's register 
(with an ME power mainly ranging from 11000 kw to 14000 kw) and domestic ships 
from the CCS (with an ME power mainly ranging from 4000 kw to 6000 kw).  
S.2 Emissions Factors 
The Sulphur content of RO is about 2.7%, and MD 0.5%.The factors for SO2, 
NOx, CO, NMVOCs, PM10, PM2.5 come primarily from the data published in Cooper 
and Gustaffson(1), ICF international(2), Goldsworthy (3). Emissions factors for OC, 
EC, V and Ni are obtained from published data in Agrawal (4), Agrawal (5), Petzold 
(6), Moldanová, J (7). Table1 lists emissions factors used in the present study.

S4 
 
S.3 Low load adjustment multipliers for main engine emission factors 
Emissions factors are adjusted for loads below 20% using tables from oversea 
studies (2, 8). OC, EC, V and Ni use the same LLAM as the PM in the present study. 
Table S2 represents low load adjustment multipliers for main engine emission factors. 
S.4 Control factors 
For all marine engines over 130 kilowatts (kW) for engines built on or after 
January 1, 2000, NOX limits in Annex VI applied. We use a factor of 0.9024 for main 
engine and a factor of 0.906 for auxiliary engine to adjust the NOX emission. For 
vessels built after 2010, and thus complying with “IMO Tier 2”. We use a main engine 
control factor of 0.875 and an auxiliary engine control factor of 0.8767 to adjust it. 
The control factor data come from ICF international (2). 
S.5 Sources of uncertainty 
The original AIS data obtained from the Marine Department were reliable; thus, 
the estimation and statistics for the year’s emissions according to the existing AIS 
data are relatively reliable. The accuracy of the AIS data was only limited to the 
accuracy of the AIS receiver and the base stations. Most of the basic ship information 
was obtained from Lloyd's database, while it is the most used and complete source for 
the basic ship information. The main engine information in Lloyd's database is 
relatively complete, but the auxiliary engine information is relatively limited. 
Moreover, almost no information exists on boilers. Considering the accuracy of the 
emission inventory, we calculated the main engine and auxiliary engine emissions in 
this paper. Because certain ships involved in this research were inland and were 
therefore not included in Lloyd's database, default values for the ship type were used 
as the installed power of the equipment and the maximum speed of these ships. 
Parameters used in module were combined from the Lloyd's database and China 
Classification Society (CCS) database. And we interviewed experienced members of

S5 
 
the Marine Department to verify the typical values. These parameters carry 
uncertainties.  
Different emission factors; ME, AE and ME control factors; low-load control 
factors; and ME fuel correction factors were acquired from the other literature. 
Selection of emission factors may also contain uncertainties. In this research, the ME 
emission factors assumed the use of RO (2.7% sulfur content). According to the 
matching of the static ship information with Lloyd's database, we divided the vessels 
into inland vessels and ocean-going vessels. According to the CMB’s data, we 
adjusted the sulfur content of the main engine’s fuel used by domestic vessels to 1.5%. 
The AE emission factors assumed the use of MD (0.5% sulfur content), and ships’ 
auxiliary engines were assumed to be medium speed diesel (MSD). Strictly speaking, 
some AEs use HFO (~2.7% sulfur content), this may contains a certain degree of 
uncertainty.
