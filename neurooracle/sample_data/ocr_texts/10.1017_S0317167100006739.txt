Clinical and electrophysiological studies reveal a high
incidence of nervous system dysfunction in patients treated in
major medical and surgical intensive care units (ICU’s).1,2 This
dysfunction is especially common in patients who suffer from a
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) as a critical
illness.3 Systemic inflammatory response syndrome occurs in at
least 50% of patients who are treated on ventilators in the ICU
for more than one week.4 Septic encephalopathy and critical
illness polyneuropathy (CIP) both occur in 70% of SIRS
patients.5 Critical illness myopathy is especially prominent in
patients who, in addition to suffering from SIRS, receive
neuromuscular blocking agents and steroids.6 The amplitude of
the QRS complex in the electrocardiogram is reduced in
critically ill patients.7
ABSTRACT: Background and Purpose: The central and peripheral nervous systems are often affected
in intensive care unit (ICU) patients, especially those with prolonged assisted ventilation and sepsis or
systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). The autonomic nervous system, however, has been
under-investigated in such patients. We evaluated autonomic nervous system (ANS) function in 29 ICU
patients with various neurological disorders. Methods: Testing involved cardiac R-R variation (CRRV)
as an index of parasympathetic function and the sympathetic skin response (SSR) for sympathetic
assessment. Results: Only those 8 patients with sepsis-related neuropathy or encephalopathy had
abnormal CRRV, while the SSR was absent in all but 2 patients. Conclusions: Our preliminary study
revealed a high incidence of autonomic dysfunction in ICU patients with various neurological disorders.
RÉSUMÉ: La variation cardiaque R-R et la réponse cutanée sympathique chez des patients de l’unité de soins
intensifs.  Contexte et objectif : Le système nerveux central et le système nerveux périphérique sont souvent atteints
chez les patients hospitalisés à l’unité de soins intensifs (USI), surtout chez ceux qui sont sous ventilation assistée
prolongée et ceux qui sont atteints de septicémie ou d’un syndrome de réaction inflammatoire généralisée (SIRS).
Cependant, le système nerveux autonome (SNA) a été peu étudié chez ces patients.  Nous avons étudié la fonction
du SNA chez 29 patients de l’USI atteints de différents problèmes neurologiques.  Méthodes : Nous avons étudié la
variation de l’intervalle R-R (VIRR) comme indice de la fonction parasympathique et la réponse cutanée
sympathique (RCS) pour la fonction sympathique. Résultats : Seuls les 8 patients atteints de neuropathie ou
d’encéphalopathie reliée à une septicémie avaient une VIRR anormale et la RCS était présente chez deux patients
seulement. Conclusions : Cette étude préliminaire a révélé une incidence élevée de dysfonction autonome chez les
patients atteints de différents troubles neurologiques qui sont hospitalisés à l’USI.

ORIGINAL ARTICLE
Since SIRS has widespread central and peripheral nervous
system effects, we decided to examine the autonomic nervous
system prospectively. The parasympathetic nervous system can
be assessed by measuring the cardiac R-R variation (CRRV) and
the sympathetic pathways are evaluated by using the

sympathetic skin response (SSR) that mediates cutaneous
cholinergic (sudomotor) function via both central and peripheral
pathways.8-10 The CRRV and SSR have been shown to be
abnormal in patients outside the ICU who have a wide variety of
disorders affecting these pathways.9,11
Methods
Studies were performed on patients in a 30 bed medical-
surgical 
ICU. 
Neurological 
and 
electrophysiological
consultations were requested to investigate a variety of possible
central and peripheral nervous system (CNS and PNS) disorders
according to previously documented techniques.12 Limb
temperature was monitored routinely. For CNS disorders,
somatosensory evoked potentials were utilized. For PNS
disorders motor and sensory nerve conduction and the needle
electrode myography were used.  There were 18 men and 15
women ranging in age from 19 to 83 years of age; 11 patients
were over 60 years of age. The predominant neurological
diagnoses were septic encephalopathy (2), anoxic- ischemic
encephalopathy (1), Parkinson disease (1), drug induced extra-
pyramidal syndrome (1), traumatic encephalopathy (3),
traumatic quadriplegia (2), critical illness polyneuropathy (14),
and myopathy (5).  At the time of testing patients were not
receiving adrenergic blockers or drugs with anticholinergic
properties that might affect the CRRV and SSR. Critically ill
patients had widespread organ dysfunction, glucose intolerance
and other manifestations of SIRS. They had a variety of reasons
for ICU admission.
Both the CRRV and the SSR were measured according to the
technique of Shahani et al,10 and were performed on an

Advantage EMG system (Advantage Medical, London, Ontario,
Canada) with special software designed for these procedures.
Each patient was on a ventilator and testing was done while the
ventilator was operating. The SSR was tested before any other
stimulus was given to the patient to avoid habituation. The
stimulus was applied to the left median nerve at the wrist
randomly with duration of 0.2 milliseconds and 15-50 milliamps
intensity. Five sets of stimuli were given at greater than 30
second intervals.  Responses were recorded simultaneously with
surface electrodes over the contralateral palm and sole of the
foot. Sympathetic skin response was performed at filter settings
between 0.5 and 100 Hz and gain between 200 and 500 µV/div.
Sympathetic skin response was considered abnormal only if it
was entirely absent at both the hand and the foot. Cardiac R-R
variation was then tested, with filter settings between 0.5 and 100
Hz and gain from 100-500 µV/div, and expressed as a percentage
of the average RR interval and was considered abnormal if the
variation was less than either 12% or less than 5% for patients
over 60 years of age.
Two patients, who had been studied while on ventilators in
the ICU and were found to have absent SSR’s, were tested one
month after discharge from the ICU while off the ventilator.  
RESULTS
Eight of the 29 patients had an abnormal CRRV (Figure). Six
of these had CIP (mild in 5 and moderate in 1) and 2 had mild
septic encephalopathy.1
The SSR was absent (Figure) in all
patients (see list in methods) except for a 73 year old female with
anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and a 54 year old female who
was on the ventilator briefly for a drug-induced extrapyramidal
syndrome.  
The median nerve sensory action potential (SNAP) recorded
at the index finger from wrist stimulation was normal in 21,
reduced in 1, absent in 1 and, for several technical reasons, not
tested in 6 patients.
Two patients with moderate/severe CIP had absent SSRs
while on the ventilator in the ICU and when tested one month
later, while off the ventilator.
The typical results of the CRRV and the SSR for healthy
persons and patients are shown in the Figure. 
DISCUSSION
The study revealed a high incidence of dysfunction in
critically ill patients involving both the parasympathetic
(measured by the CRRV) and sympathetic (measured by the
SSR) pathways, in the central and peripheral nervous systems.  It
is known that sepsis SIRS causes widespread dysfunction of the
brain, peripheral nerve and muscle in the form of septic
encephalopathy, critical illness polyneuropathy and myopathy.13
It has been shown that cardiac muscle is also involved
manifested as reduction in the amplitude of the QRS complex of
the electrocardiogram.7 Examination of the sympathetic chain at
autopsy in critically ill patients reveals axonal degeneration.12
However, studies have not been previously performed on the
parasympathetic connections to the heart and it has not been
previously determined whether unmyelinated fibres of the
peripheral nervous system are involved. There is dysfunction of
the parasympathetic and sympathetic systems in critically ill
patients, which may relate to septic encephalopathy and CIP.
The absent SSR may explain the tendency to hypotension in the
critically ill patients.9 Dysfunction of sympathetic pathways in
the CNS probably explains the absent SSR in patients with
anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, traumatic encephalopathy,
traumatic quadriplegia and Parkinson’s disease who did not have
SIRS.
It seems unlikely that habituation from the repetitive action of
the ventilator stimulating the lungs would cause the absent SSR
since two of our patients with moderate to severe critical illness
polyneuropathy continued to have an absent SSR one month
after discharge from the ICU and off the ventilator. The median
nerve SNAP was normal in 21 patients, making it unlikely that
dysfunction of the afferent limb of the SSR accounted for the
absent SSR. Furthermore, none were on adrenergic blockers or
drugs with anticholinergic properties that would block or blunt
the SSR. This was a preliminary study; prospective studies
should include repeat testing during and after the ICU stay in
well defined patient groups. Recording of the quantitative
sudomotor axon reflex8 would further establish the presence of
sympathetic dysfunction and determine if it is proximal or distal
to the sympathetic ganglia.
