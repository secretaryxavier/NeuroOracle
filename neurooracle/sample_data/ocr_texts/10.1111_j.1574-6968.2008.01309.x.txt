Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) alters the host response to infection by secreting protein
factors. Mtb produces two secreted protein tyrosine phosphatases, PtpA and PtpB, which are
thought to interfere with host signaling. Deletion of ptpA or ptpB attenuates bacterial growth in
activated macrophages. To address the in vivo function of PtpA, we generated a genetic deletion
mutant, DptpA. The mutant was not defective when grown in vitro, consistent with the presumed
role of PtpA in the host. The ptpA mutant, however, also showed no growth defect in a mouse
infection model. The absence of a growth defect in mice suggests that the requirement for PtpA
differs in mouse and human infections, and that mice are not a suitable infection model for the
study of PtpA.
Introduction
The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) PtpA and PtpB
are thought to manipulate host cell signaling (Koul et al., 2000). Consistent with functions
within host cells, no cognate tyrosine kinase has been identified in the Mtb genome.
Moreover, PtpA and PtpB are secreted proteins (Koul et al., 2000). Deletion of ptpA
attenuates bacterial growth in human macrophages (Bach et al., 2008), and deletion of ptpB
reduces Mtb growth in activated mouse macrophages and guinea pigs (Singh et al., 2003).
Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that the Mtb PTPs play crucial roles in
mycobacterial survival during infection.
Sequence analysis and the crystal structure identify PtpA as a low molecular weight (LMW)
PTP (Madhurantakam et al., 2005). PtpA shows 37% sequence identity and high structural
similarity (Ca root mean square deviation = 0.99A °) to the human LMW PTP, but there are
notable differences in active-site residues of these enzymes. PtpA overexpression in murine
macrophages leads to slight changes in actin polymerization and decreases phagocytosis
(Castandet et al., 2005). Vacuolar protein sorting protein 33B (VPS33B), was recently
identified as a human substrate of PtpA. These data implicated PtpA in the manipulation of
normal vesicle maturation (Bach et al., 2008), but the physiologic functions of PtpA are
poorly understood.
The potential role of PtpA as a secreted virulence factor, akin to the Yersinia PTP YopH
(Viboud & Bliska, 2005), has prompted attempts to design specific PtpA inhibitors (Weide
et al., 2003; Manger et al., 2005; Noren-Muller et al., 2006). Targeting secreted proteins that
are important for infection outside of the bacterium circumvents bacterial resistance
mechanisms and eliminates the need to traverse the bacterial cell envelope, a particularly
difficult hurdle for the treatment of Mtb infection. This interest in PtpA as an inhibitor target
magnified the importance of establishing the effects of attenuating PtpA activity in vivo.

Here we examine the effects of a ptpA deletion on Mtb growth in vitro, and in the mouse
model of Mtb infection. We find that the ptpA deletion mutant grows like the parental wild-
type strain in all of these conditions, implying that the murine model fails to recapitulate
effects reported in infections of human macrophages (Bach et al., 2008).
Materials and methods
The DptpA deletion mutant was generated by homologous recombination using a specialized
transducing phage (Glickman et al., 2000). The ptpA gene was replaced by a hygromycin
expression cassette, preserving the 8-bp overlap of the upstream Rv2232 gene with the PtpA
ORF. The allelic exchange substrate was constructed by amplifying the flanking regions of
ptpA by PCR from Mtb genomic DNA. The flanking regions were amplified to contain
restriction sites for SpeI and HindIII at the 50 and 30 end of the upstream flank, and AflII
and KpnI sites for the downstream flanking region, cloned with the TA cloning kit
(Invitrogen), and sequenced. The flanking regions were cloned successively upstream and
downstream of the hygromycin expression cassette of pJSC407, also containing a l cos site
and a unique PacI site. The PacI-digested pJSC407 was ligated into the unique PacI site of
phAE87, a temperature-sensitive mutant of the mycobacteriophage TM4, and packaged
using the Gigapack XL kit (Stratagene). High titer transducing phages were prepared in
Mycobacterium smegmatis at 30 1C and used to infect Mtb at 37 1C. Recombinants were
selected on medium containing hygromycin, and correct insertion was confirmed by
Southern blot analysis using alkaline transfer onto Hybond N membrane (Amersham).
Radioactive probes for Southern blotting were prepared with Ready To Go DNA labeling
beads (Pharmacia).
All strains were cultured in 7H9 medium containing 0.05% Tween 80, 10% oleic acid
albumin dextrose catalase, and 0.5% glycerol. The in vitro growth rate was monitored by
measuring the cultures at OD600nm. For aerosol mouse infections, bacteria were grown to
mid-log phase, sonicated using a Branson Sonifier 250 at 90% power for 15 s, spun for 5
min at 50g to pellet clumpy bacteria, and diluted to the desired inoculum in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS). Female C57BL/6 mice were infected via nebulization for 15 min
using a custom built aerosolization chamber (Mechanical Engineering Shops, University of
Wisconsin, MA). For CFU assays, the upper lobe of the right lung, the right lobe of the
liver, and half of the spleen were harvested and homogenized in PBS containing 0.1%
Tween-80. The homogenates were plated in serial dilutions on 7H10 plates supplemented
with 10% oleic acid albumin dextrose catalase, 0.5% glycerol, 100 mgmL_1 ampicillin and
50 mgmL_1 cycloheximide, and colonies were counted after 3.5 weeks. Mice were housed
under pathogen-free conditions, and mouse experiments were conducted according to a
University of California, San Francisco, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-
approved protocol.
Results and discussion
To explore the roles of PtpA in growth in vitro and in a mouse infection model, we
generated a ptpA deletion mutant in the virulent Erdman strain of Mtb by allelic exchange
(Glickman et al., 2000). Southern blotting of mutant and wild-type genomic DNA confirmed
the correct insertion of the hygromycin-resistance cassette into the PtpA site (Fig. 1).
Replacement of ptpA by the gene coding for hygromycin produced a 600-bp larger XbaI
fragment when compared with the wild-type chromosome. A probe specific for the region
directly upstream of ptpA (probe A) hybridized to a 2.6-kb fragment in genomic wild-type
DNA and a 3.2-kb fragment in the mutant genomic DNA. Insertion of the hygromycin-
resistance cassette was also detected by Southern blotting using a hygromycin-specific probe
(probe C). The expected 3.2-kb fragment was detected in the DptpA mutant, but not the

wild-type sample. Conversely, a 2.6-kb fragment was detected in the wild type, but not the
mutant sample using a probe specific for ptpA (probe B).
No difference in the growth rates of the mutant and the wild-type strains was observed in
liquid 7H9 culture medium (Fig. 2a). The ptpA deletion mutant showed a slightly higher
propensity to form clumps in liquid culture, suggesting that PtpA might have an effect on
cell surface properties. This qualitative difference did not lead to a difference in growth
rates, suggesting that PtpA does not have a vital function in intrinsic bacterial signaling.
To test the effect of PtpA on Mtb survival in vivo, we infected female C57BL/6 mice with
wild-type and the ptpA deletion mutant by aerosol infection. Between 200 and 250 bacteria
were deposited in the lungs of infected animals, as determined by a CFU assay of whole
lungs of five animals per group on the day of infection. At weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 after
infection, groups of five mice were sacrificed and lungs, livers, and spleens were harvested
for CFU assays. In the lung, the numbers of bacteria recovered were similar for wild type
and the ptpA deletion mutant (Fig. 2b). Mtb dissemination to the liver and the spleen was
observed starting at week two after infection. No difference in bacterial loads in liver and
spleen were observed between wild-type- and DptpA-infected mice (Fig. 2c and d).
Several lines of evidence point to a role of PtpA in the manipulation of the host response to
Mtb infection. The lack of an in vitro growth phenotype of the PtpA deletion mutant also
supports this notion. Surprisingly, no growth defect was observed in mice, raising questions
about the true in vivo function of PtpA. Cowley et al. (2002) showed increased expression of
a PtpA-GFP fusion upon infection of the human macrophage-like cell line THP-1 and Bach
et al.(2008) showed reduced virulence of a ptpA deletion mutant in THP-1 cells. These
results preclude the possibility that the lack of an in vivo phenotype in the deletion mutant
results from a lack of PtpA expression even in wild-type Mtb during infection.
Instead, the mouse model may not faithfully reveal the role of PtpA in human tuberculosis.
A number of factors could contribute to the absence of an in vivo growth defect in mice. The
human substrates of PtpA, for example, might not be conserved in mice. Alternatively,
higher levels of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in mouse macrophages compared with
human cells (Liu et al., 2007) would be expected to selectively reduce the role of PtpA by
oxidizing the catalytic cysteine to levels higher than that found in a human infection. In the
absence of full wild-type PtpA function, differences caused by the ptpA deletion mutant
might be obscured. PtpB, on the other hand, resists oxidative inactivation, because the active
site is buried in the protein (Grundner et al., 2005).
Although the normal growth characteristics of the ptpA deletion mutant in vitro and in mice
provide little insight into the in vivo functions of PtpA, the results suggest that the mouse is
not an appropriate infection model for the study of PtpA function. Further development of
PtpA inhibitors hinges on the discovery of a suitable animal model in which to assay for the
attenuation of PtpA activity.
