Running head: Long term externalising behaviour following childhood traumatic brain injury 
Abstract 
26 
Objectives: To investigate rates of clinically significant externalizing behavior in young adult 
27 
survivors of pediatric TBI, and evaluate the contribution of pre- and post-injury risk and 
28 
resilience factors to externalizing behaviour outcomes 16 years after injury. 
29 
Setting: Melbourne, Australia 
30 
Participants: Fifty-five young adults (M age = 23.85; Injury Age: 1.0 - 12 years) admitted to 
31 
an emergency department following TBI between 1993 and 1997.  
32 
Design: Longitudinal prospective study with data collected at the acute, 10-year and 16-year 
33 
post-injury time points. 
34 
Main Measures: Severity of TBI, adaptive functioning, family functioning, full scale IQ, 
35 
executive functioning, social communication, and symptoms of externalizing behavior (EB). 
36 
Results: One of every four young people with a history of pediatric TBI demonstrated clinical 
37 
or sub-threshold levels of EB in young adulthood. More frequent externalizing behavior was 
38 
associated with poorer pre-injury adaptive functioning, reduced full scale IQ and more 
39 
frequent pragmatic communication difficulty. 
40 
Conclusion: Pediatric TBI is associated with elevated risk for externalizing disorders in the 
41 
transition to adulthood. Results underscore the need for screening and assessment of TBI 
42 
among young offenders, and suggest that early and long-term targeted interventions may be 
43 
required to address risk factors for EB in children and young people with TBI.

Running head: Long term externalising behaviour following childhood traumatic brain injury 
Introduction 
50 
A growing number of research studies, undertaken within various national contexts, 
51 
consistently demonstrate a disproportionately high prevalence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
52 
amongst youth and adult offending populations. Studies estimate that between 12% and 24% 
53 
of the general population have experienced a head injury resulting in loss of consciousness1-4. 
54 
This compares to equivalent reported rates of between 32% and 46% amongst young people 
55 
in custody 5-8, with several studies suggesting over 60% of adult prisoners have experienced a 
56 
head injury with loss of consciousness 9-11. 
57 
Studies of adult offending populations seldom indicate whether TBI was sustained in 
58 
childhood or adulthood. Nonetheless research has repeatedly demonstrated that ‘life-course 
59 
persistent’ offending typically begins in childhood and is commonly associated with 
60 
‘neurocognitive impairments’ 12,13.  This would suggest that children experiencing pediatric 
61 
TBI are at elevated risk for persistent offending beyond adolescence, and that their 
62 
experiences run counter to the norm of desistence from criminality during young adulthood 
63 
14,15. Despite this apparent association between TBI and persistent adult offending, to date 
64 
there is insufficient research regarding such behavior in the transition into young adulthood 
65 
amongst those who experience pediatric TBI. 
66 
There is considerable evidence that pediatric TBI contributes to impairments in 
67 
executive functions, cognitive skills and EB (such as aggression, hyperactivity, bullying and 
68 
defiance) that are commonly identified as risk factors for antisocial behavior and criminality.  
69 
TBI commonly involves pathology to anterior brain regions implicated in executive 
70 
functioning, as well as traumatic axonal injury that may contribute to deficits in social 
71 
cognition, attention, learning difficulties and pragmatic communication 16-18.  Impairments in 
72 
executive functioning have been detected soon after injury and appear to persist or even 
73 
worsen with time since injury 19-21, likely reflecting a failure to develop and acquire skills at 
74

Running head: Long term externalising behaviour following childhood traumatic brain injury 
an age appropriate rate 22. It may be that such deficits contribute to antisocial or offending 
75 
behavior through decreased inhibition, poor anticipation of the consequences of specific 
76 
actions, or an inability to recognise when certain behavior is inappropriate in a given social 
77 
context 23,24. 
78 
Reduced cognitive empathy implies an inability to see the consequences of antisocial 
79 
behavior or to empathize with victims 25. These deficits are a common consequence of 
80 
pediatric TBI, particularly among children with frontal injuries 26. In addition, children and 
81 
adolescents with TBI experience persisting difficulty interpreting non-verbal emotion cues 
82 
from facial expressions and prosody, as well as impairments in social or pragmatic 
83 
communication 22,27. These deficits are likely to contribute to reduced interpersonal 
84 
effectiveness, which may in turn lead to frustration and distress, reflected in EBs that are 
85 
shown to persist or even worsen with time since injury 28-31.  
86 
Though persisting injury-related neurocognitive impairments may elevate risk for 
87 
antisocial or offending behavior after TBI, criminological research suggests that such injuries 
88 
may influence offending via exposure to social and environmental experiences that may 
89 
exacerbate the neurological consequences of brain injury32-34. For example, studies have 
90 
linked permissive or authoritarian parenting styles, poor parental mental health and lower 
91 
socio-economic status to long-term behavioral problems following TBI 35-38. Persistent 
92 
problems in academic performance, including specific difficulties in reading, spelling and 
93 
arithmetic are commonly reported after TBI 39-42, and are likely to have a cumulative impact 
94 
on educational opportunities, leading to challenges in engaging in later stages of education, 
95 
particularly in the transition to secondary school 43-46.  
96 
The Heuristic Model of Social Competence (HMSC) 47 provides a useful framework 
97 
for conceptualizing how such a range of injury and non-injury related risk and resilience 
98 
factors may contribute to variability in social functioning after TBI, and can therefore be 
99

Running head: Long term externalising behaviour following childhood traumatic brain injury 
usefully applied to the study of crime and antisocial behavior.  Injury related factors, 
100 
including injury severity and pathology location, are conceptualized as factors that increase 
101 
the likelihood of deficits in social cognition and atypical social interaction, while 
102 
environmental factors may further heighten risk or represent sources of resilience that buffer 
103 
against the negative long term consequences of TBI.  In addition, the model posits reciprocal 
104 
interactions between various components of social information processing (SIP; cognitive-
105 
executive functions, social cognition, social problem solving), social interaction, and social 
106 
adjustment, such that deficits in any one component in SIP may contribute to impaired social 
107 
interaction and poor social adjustment, including EB.  
108 
In order to address limited understanding of the links between criminality and 
109 
pediatric TBI, further research is required to investigate factors that may contribute to 
110 
maladaptive or antisocial behavior among young adult survivors of pediatric TBI. In 
111 
conceptualizing EB as a marker of risk for delinquency and/or criminal behaviour, it may be 
112 
that injury-related neurocognitive impairments and environmental factors confer risk for 
113 
criminality via their influence on EB.   
114 
The objectives of the present investigation were to (1) examine the prevalence of 
115 
clinically significant EB problems in young adult survivors of pediatric TBI and (2) evaluate 
116 
the respective contributions of a variety of injury and non-injury related risk and resilience 
117 
factors at various time points to variability in EB outcomes 16 years after pediatric TBI. More 
118 
specifically, guided by the HMSC model47, we aimed to examine relationships between long-
119 
term externalizing symptoms and a variety of individual and environmental factors including: 
120 
pre-injury individual and family functioning; injury severity and acute intellectual 
121 
functioning; executive functioning; and social cognitive and affective functions, including 
122 
social perception and pragmatic communication. 
123

Running head: Long term externalising behaviour following childhood traumatic brain injury 
We predicted that relative to population expectations, a significantly greater 
124 
proportion of young adults with TBI would show clinically significant EB. Furthermore, we 
125 
hypothesized that more frequent EBs would be related to (a) greater injury severity; (b) 
126 
poorer pre-injury adaptive and family functioning; (c) poorer acute intellectual functioning; 
127 
(d) poorer executive function at 10-years post injury; and (e) reduced emotional perception 
128 
and more frequent pragmatic communication difficulty at 16-years post-TBI.   
129 
 
130 
Method 
131 
Participants 
132 
This longitudinal study followed up a sample originally recruited from consecutive 
133 
admissions to the emergency department at The Royal Children’s Hospital, Melbourne, 
134 
Australia (RCH), between 1993 and 1997 for traumatic brain injury 48.  Inclusion criteria for 
135 
the original study were: (1) age at injury 1.0 to 12.0 years; (2) documented evidence of TBI, 
136 
including a period of altered consciousness; (3) sufficiently detailed medical records for 
137 
diagnosis of injury severity.  Exclusion criteria were: penetrating or non-accidental head 
138 
injury; history of previous closed head injury; or pre-existing physical, neurological, 
139 
psychiatric or developmental disorder.   
140 
During the initial recruitment period, 172 children aged under 12 years were admitted 
141 
to hospital with a diagnosis of TBI and participated in the initial data collection.  At 16 years 
142 
post-TBI, 66 participants could not be located, and 38 declined to participate (not interested / 
143 
too busy), 2 were deceased and 11 had incomplete datasets. Thus for the current paper 55 
144 
young adults (m age = 23.82 years; range = 16.25 - 30.58 years; SD = 3.85) from the original 
145 
TBI sample yielded data across the acute, 10-year and 16-year time points and were included 
146 
in analyses.   Participating and non-participating samples were compared on demographic 
147 
and injury characteristics, including socio-economic status, gender, age at injury and the 
148

Running head: Long term externalising behaviour following childhood traumatic brain injury 
length of period of altered consciousness, to examine potential biases in the 16-year follow-
149 
up sample, with no significant differences identified (p>.05).  
150 
 
151 
Measures 
152 
Details of the child’s medical and developmental history, and family demographic 
153 
information were collected at study enrolment.  Severity groups were derived from a 
154 
combination of measures, including period of altered consciousness on the Glasgow Coma 
155 
Scale (GCS) 49, and presence of radiological and neurological abnormalities.  This resulted in 
156 
the following groups: (i) mild TBI (n = 15): GCS on admission 13–15, no evidence of mass 
157 
lesion on CT/MRI scans, and no neurologic deficits; (ii) moderate TBI (n = 29): GCS on 
158 
admission 9–12, and/or mass lesion or other evidence of specific injury on CT/MRI, and/or 
159 
neurological impairment; and (iii) severe TBI (n = 11): GCS on admission 3–8, and mass 
160 
lesion or other evidence of specific injury on CT/MRI, and/or neurological impairment.  
161 
 
162 
Pre-injury. 
163 
The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS) 50 provides parent report of a child’s 
164 
level of adaptive function and was collected at time one to represent the child’s pre-injury 
165 
functioning.  The present study utilised the Total Adaptive Behavior score (M = 100, SD = 
166 
15), and the Daily Living Skills and Socialization indexes as measures of pre-injury function. 
167 
Pre-injury family environment was measured using the parent-report Family 
168 
Functioning Questionnaire (FFQ) 51.  Each item was rated on a 6-point scale where 1 = 
169 
totally agree to 6 = totally disagree.  Three factors are derived from the measure: Conflict, 
170 
Intimacy and Parenting Style, with higher scores reflecting more of that characteristic.  The 
171 
Intimacy factor was utilised for statistical analyses because it represents a measure of family 
172 
cohesion 52.   
173

Running head: Long term externalising behaviour following childhood traumatic brain injury 
 
174 
Acute post-injury.  
175 
The IQ assessment employed at the acute time point varied depending on the child’s 
176 
age.  Thus Bayley Scales of Infant Development children aged <30 months; Wechsler 
177 
Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Revised 54 for children aged 30 months to 6.5 
178 
years; and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children - Third Edition 55 children aged >6.5 
179 
years were all used.   Full scale IQ scores (FSIQ), were used in analyses (M = 100, SD = 15). 
180 
Daniel's Scale of Occupational Prestige 56 was used as a rating of family socio-
181 
economic status (SES) at the acute time-point.  Ratings are made on a seven-point scale 
182 
where a higher score denotes lower SES. 
183 
 
184 
10 years post injury. 
185 
Based on previous findings from the longitudinal study two measures of executive 
186 
functioning were used to explore its role in prediction of problem behaviour 57. The Behavior 
187 
Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) 58, Metacognition and Behavioral 
188 
Regulation index scores, and the General Executive Composite Score (M = 50, SD = 10) 
189 
were calculated on the basis of parent or close other ratings at the 10 year time-point.  Higher 
190 
scores represent greater dysfunction, and scores >65 indicate functioning at a level of clinical 
191 
concern. 
192 
The 20 Questions Task from the DKEFS test (20Q) 59 was used as a direct assessment 
193 
of abstract reasoning as it measures abstract thinking as well as problem solving and the 
194 
utilization of feedback.  The abstraction scaled score was used in analyses (M = 10, SD = 3).  
195 
 
196 
16 years post-injury. 
197

The Adult Behavior Checklist (ABCL) 60 consists of 126 behavior problem items that 
198 
are evaluated by a significant other for the preceding six months.  Statements are scored on a 
199 
three-level rating scale ranging from not true to very true (M=50; SD=10; borderline/clinical 
200 
range if score >65 for the syndrome scales; >60 for the domain) with a higher score 
201 
indication of greater impairments.  As the outcome measure in the present study, the domain 
202 
Externalizing Behavior was used.  It comprises three syndrome scales: Rule Breaking (13 
203 
items; e.g., gets drunk, in trouble with law), Aggressive Behavior (16 items; e.g., mean to 
204 
others, threatens people) and Intrusive Behavior (6 items; e.g., brags, demands attention, 
205 
shows off).  The ABCL has been proven reliable in terms of test-retest correlations and 
206 
internal consistency of scales 60, and has good inter-rater reliability for most scales 61. 
207 
The Latrobe Communication Questionnaire (LCQ) 62 is a 30-item subjective 
208 
assessment that reflects the four domains Quantity, Quality, Relation and Manner of everyday 
209 
communication.  Each item has four levels of response ranging from (1) "Never or rarely" to 
210 
(4) "Usually or always" with a higher score reflecting more frequent communication 
211 
difficulty.  Data analyses employed a total score, reflecting overall communication perceived 
212 
by a significant other.   
213 
The Advanced Clinical Solutions Social Perception subtest (ACS) 63 measures skills 
214 
associated with the comprehension of social communication.  It consists of three emotion 
215 
perception tests yielding four scores: Affect Naming, Prosody-Faces, Prosody-Pairs, and, 
216 
collectively, the Emotion Perception Total score.  Age-adjusted scaled scores (M=10, SD=3) 
217 
for each of these test scores were employed in analyses. 
218 
  In addition, respondents were asked whether they had ‘received intervention of any 
219 
kind (e.g. speech and language, motor, cognitive)’. Those who stated that they had received 
220 
an intervention were asked to specify the intervention through an open-ended response.  
221

Procedure 
223 
The current study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of RCH, 
224 
Melbourne, Australia. Children were enrolled in the study during their initial hospital 
225 
admission, and were evaluated at various time points: 0-3 (acute), 6, 12, and 30 months, and 
226 
5, 10 and 16-years post injury.  At each wave of data collection, young people and families 
227 
enrolled in the original study were sent tracing letters that included a detailed description of 
228 
the study, and were asked to provide written informed consent, in keeping with hospital 
229 
ethics procedures.  Neuropsychological assessments and questionnaires were administered at 
230 
each time point by a qualified child psychologist over a two hour period.  
231 
 
232 
Data analysis 
233 
All data were entered into SPSS statistical software (Version 21.0; SPSS, Inc., 
234 
Chicago, IL) and screened for violations of normality. An alpha level of p < 0.05 was used to 
235 
indicate significance, and effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d.  
236 
The calculation of individual impairment ratings was based on the ABCL 
237 
Externalizing Behavior composite scale, and Chi-square tests were employed to examine the 
238 
proportion young adults in each severity group demonstrating impairment at 16–years post 
239 
injury. For the broadband scales, scores > 63 are considered clinically significant and scores 
240 
of 60-63 are in the borderline range for clinical significance.  
241 
Predictors of 16-year behavioral outcomes were examined using a series of regression 
242 
analyses as follows;  
243 
(1). Preliminary univariate regressions were employed to examine relations between 
244 
EB and all independent variables. Variables that were unrelated to EB at this step were 
245 
excluded from subsequent analyses.  
246 
(2). Four separate multivariate adjusted regression models were employed to 
247

Running head: Long term externalising behaviour following childhood traumatic brain injury 
investigate relationships between EB and variables related to (a) pre-injury adaptive 
248 
functioning; (b) injury-related factors/acute intellectual functioning; (c) executive 
249 
functioning/interventions at 10-years post-TBI; and (d) social cognition and communication 
250 
at 16-years post injury.  
251 
(3). Variables that remained statistically significant in each of the adjusted models 
252 
were entered into the final adjusted multivariate regression model.

256 
 There were no significant differences across severity groups with respect to age at

16-year assessment, age-at-injury, pre-injury adaptive abilities, FSIQ, SES or family function 
258 
(Table 1). Groups differed on gender (χ2(2, 55) = 7.51, p = .023),  such that there were a 
259 
significantly greater proportion of males in the severe TBI group than the mild and moderate 
260 
TBI groups. As expected, all severity groups differed for GCS-24 hours, F(2,48) =  21.92,

Due to high colinearity between measures of pre-injury adaptive functioning (Table

318 
As shown in Table 7, Model 1 was highly significant, F(4,36) = 9.03, p<.001, with

more frequent externalizing behavior related to poorer adaptive functioning, lower FSIQ

(time 1) and more frequent social communication difficulty.

Discussion 
329 
The aim of the present longitudinal prospective study was to 1) investigate rates of EB 
330 
in young adults with pediatric TBI; and 2) evaluate the respective contributions of a variety 
331 
of injury and non-injury related risk and resilience factors at various time points to variability 
332 
in EB outcomes 16 years after pediatric TBI.  
333 
There was partial support for all hypotheses. Relative to population expectations, rates 
334 
of EB were significantly elevated among young adult survivors of pediatric TBI. Moreover, 
335 
more frequent EB at 16-years post-injury was associated with poorer pre-injury adaptive 
336 
functioning, reduced acute intellectual functioning and poorer pragmatic communication 
337 
skills.   
338 
 
339 
Outcomes  
340 
Our results show that, by young adulthood, one of every four young people with a 
341 
history of pediatric TBI had developed clinical or sub-threshold levels of externalising 
342 
behaviour. Rates of EB in our sample compare to reported prevalence rates of 5-10% in the 
343 
general population 64,65, indicating a heightened risk of EB in young adulthood following 
344 
pediatric TBI and mirroring previously identified associations between pediatric TBI and life-
345 
course persistent offending behaviors 13. 
346

Running head: Long term externalising behaviour following childhood traumatic brain injury 
In keeping with the premises of the HMSC model, EB was linked to a range of pre-
347 
injury and post-injury risk factors, discernible in the acute, adolescent and young adult 
348 
phases. The contribution of pre-injury adaptive functioning to very long term social outcome 
349 
is consistent with previous reports 66, and may indicate that the influence of early brain injury 
350 
interacts with a pre-existing vulnerability (i.e., ‘double hazard theory’ 67) to heighten risk for 
351 
maladaptive behavior in the very-long-term post TBI. Moreover, the relationship between EB 
352 
and FSIQ converges with previous literature in non-clinical samples 68,69 to suggest that 
353 
higher levels of intellectual functioning may represent a source of resilience that buffers the 
354 
risk of behavioral dysfunction in the long-term post injury.  
355 
In keeping with previous research 30, pragmatic communication was the strongest and 
356 
most significant predictor EB in young adults with pediatric TBI. The finding that poorer 
357 
pragmatic communication was associated with more frequent EB may be interpreted from a 
358 
diathesis stress perspective 47. In line with the HMSC model, it may be that difficulty using 
359 
and ascribing meaning to everyday social discourse contributes to rejection or alienation by 
360 
interactive partners at the level of the social interaction. In this context, failure to negotiate 
361 
the complex demands of everyday discourse is likely to elicit distress, reflected in EBs (e.g., 
362 
aggression, rule breaking, intrusive conduct) which further limit the individual’s capacity to 
363 
negotiate the normative developmental goals of young adulthood.   
364 
Contrary to expectations, clinical or sub-threshold levels of EB problems were not 
365 
associated with injury severity but were instead equally apparent across young adults with 
366 
TBI of all severity levels. This finding is counter to previous studies that link more severe 
367 
TBI to elevated risk for violent offending 6,70 and custodial sentences 5,9, and suggests that 
368 
early clinical indicators of injury severity have limited prognostic utility for longer term 
369 
behavioral outcomes at least where injuries are sustained during childhood, where the brain is 
370 
rapidly developing and has potential for reorganization.  
371

Running head: Long term externalising behaviour following childhood traumatic brain injury 
Moreover, while previous reports have linked EB and/or persistent offending to 
372 
factors such as social disadvantage and poorer executive functioning 32-34, these factors did 
373 
not significantly contribute to EB in the final adjusted model. While these non-significant 
374 
relationships may to some extent reflect small sample size, they may also indicate that, after 
375 
prolonged recovery and increasing time since injury, executive function and indices of pre-
376 
injury environment become less important prognostic indicators of outcome.  
377 
 
 
378 
Limitations 
379 
Sample. Attrition and sample bias are potential risks with this prospective, 
380 
longitudinal study. Due to work commitments, travel distance or current life events, some 
381 
young adult participants were not able to participate. Nevertheless, comparison of the 
382 
participating and non-participating families indicated no systematic differences with the 
383 
exception that the non-participant group had lower SES.  
384 
Measures. The source of information, proxy-report completed by the significant 
385 
(either parent or partner/close friend), may also affect the level of reported externalizing 
386 
symptoms. As young people become more independent, parents may be less knowledgeable 
387 
about the young person’s psychosocial functioning.  While Green et al. 71 reported a fair-to-
388 
excellent agreement on psychosocial functioning between the adolescent with a pediatric TBI 
389 
and their parent, Rosema et al. 72 showed that, during the transition into adulthood, the young 
390 
adult with pediatric TBI did agree with parent report on the more observable behaviors, such 
391 
as drug and alcohol use, social and communication skills, however, they did not concur on 
392 
levels of internalizing symptoms, aggressive behavior and thought problems. Therefore self-
393 
report as well as direct such as a structured interview is recommended to obtain a more 
394 
complete representation of risk and resilience factors of EBs following pediatric TBI.  
395 
 
396

Clinical implications and future research 
397 
 
Relative to population expectations 64,65, a greater proportion of young adults with 
398 
TBI demonstrated clinical or sub-threshold levels of EBs, which may in turn place these 
399 
young people at greater risk for maladaptive behavior trajectories characterized by rule 
400 
breaking, anti-social behaviour and offending. These findings have implications for policy 
401 
implementation in the youth justice system. For example, screening and assessment for TBI 
402 
within youth justice services may increase understanding of factors that may lead young 
403 
people to offend, and assist in identifying young offenders who may benefit from relevant 
404 
interventions, such as psycho-education and rehabilitation programs that specifically target 
405 
social communicative dysfunction that persists into the long-term post injury 30. Surprisingly, 
406 
and in contrast to the largely medical model used to predict outcomes post-injury, injury 
407 
characteristics were less important than environmental and pre-injury factors in determining 
408 
outcome.  Environmental factors, in particular, may be seen as potentially modifiable risk 
409 
factors, offering an opportunity for early intervention to reduce risk of long term problems in 
410 
this group. 
411 
The heightened prevalence of clinical or sub-threshold levels of EB in our sample 
412 
underscores the need for provision of such early preventative interventions, as well as long 
413 
term follow up and psycho-education for young people with TBI. For example, initial 
414 
assessments in the acute and chronic stages of injury may assist to identify children 
415 
presenting with risk factors, such as poorer pre-injury adaptive functioning and reduced IQ, 
416 
and direct these children to appropriate services. An awareness of such factors should be 
417 
shared with primary health care providers and schools, so as to support follow-up provision 
418 
and further monitoring of relevant factors.  This will also offer the means to provide 
419 
continued engagement with parents and young people regarding the potential medium and 
420

Running head: Long term externalising behaviour following childhood traumatic brain injury 
long term impact of TBI on behavioural and functional difficulties that they may not readily 
421 
associate with the injury. 
422 
In addition, further research is needed to identify factors that may be protective 
423 
against problematic levels of externalising behaviour despite the presence of pre-injury and 
424 
acute risk factors. Person-oriented, qualitative case study approaches can complement group-
425 
level analyses, and offer an opportunity to evaluate how injury and non-injury related risk 
426 
and resilience factors may interact to contribute to externalising behaviour in young 
427 
adulthood. 
428 
 
429 
Conclusion 
430 
In summary, results suggest that young adults with pediatric TBI are at elevated risk for 
431 
externalizing trajectories characterized by aggression, rule breaking and intrusive conduct. In 
432 
line with the HMSC model, more frequent externalizing behaviour was linked to a range of 
433 
pre-and post injury risk and resilience factors, including poorer pre-injury adaptive 
434 
functioning, reduced IQ and more frequent pragmatic communication difficulty. These 
435 
findings underscore the need for screening and assessment of TBI among young offenders, 
436 
and suggest that early and long-term targeted interventions may be required to address risk 
437 
factors for EBs in children and young people with TBI.
