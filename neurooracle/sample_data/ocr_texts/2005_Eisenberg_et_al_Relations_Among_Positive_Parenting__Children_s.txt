and Externalizing Problems: A Three-Wave Longitudinal Study

Abstract
In a 3-wave longitudinal study (with assessments 2 years apart) involving 186 early adolescents
(M ages of approximately 9.3, 11.4, and 13.4), the hypothesis that parental warmth/positive
expressivity predicts children’s effortful control (EC) (a temperamental characteristic contributing
to emotion regulation) 2 years later, which in turn predicts low levels of externalizing problems
another 2 years later, was examined. The hypothesis that children’s EC predicts parenting over time
was also examined. Parents were observed interacting with their children; parents and teachers
reported children’s EC and externalizing problems; and children’s persistence was assessed
behaviorally. Children’s EC mediated the relation between positive parenting and low levels of
externalizing problems (whereas there was no evidence that children’s EC predicted parenting).
The development of externalizing problems has been linked to both heredity and environmental
factors (Dodge, Coie, & Lynam, in press). In regard to the latter set of influences, one of the
more consistent findings is that parental warmth and support are associated with relatively low
levels of children’s externalizing problems (Caspi et al., 2004; Rothbaum & Weisz, 1994; see
Dodge et al., in press). Similarly, parental expressions of positive emotions in the home and
in children’s presence (albeit not necessarily directed at the child) have been related to low
levels of externalizing problems (Eisenberg et al., 2001b; see Halberstadt, Crisp, & Eaton,
1999).
Some investigators (Eisenberg, Cumberland, & Spinrad, 1998; Gottman, Katz, & Hooven,
1997) have suggested that one reason for the association between parental warmth/positive
expressivity and children’s externalizing behavior is through its effects on children’s emotion-
related regulation, which includes the modulation of emotion-related physiological responses,
motivational states, felt experience, and associated behaviors. According to this view, warm,
positive parents rear better-regulated children, who are, in turn, less likely to experience anger
or frustration or display externalizing problems such as aggression that stem from these
emotional responses.
Effortful control (EC), an aspect of temperament defined as “the efficiency of executive
attention, including the ability to inhibit a dominant response and/or to activate a subdominant
response, to plan, and to detect errors,” is believed to play a fundamental role in the regulation
of emotion (Rothbart & Bates, in press) and often is used as an index of this capacity (Eisenberg,
Fabes, Guthrie, & Reiser, 2000). EC includes the abilities to voluntarily focus and shift
attention and to inhibit or initiate behavior—processes used to modulate both internal emotion-
related experience and the overt expression of emotion. The purpose of this study was to

examine the hypothesis that EC mediates the relation between parental positive expressivity
and children’s externalizing problems using a prospective 3-wave longitudinal design in which
parenting, children’s EC, and children’s externalizing problems were assessed at three time
points (with 2-year intervals).
Although EC is believed to have a temperamental, and hence, partly genetic and constitutional
basis, most theorists believe that EC, and emotion regulation more generally, are shaped by
experience in the social world, including interactions with parents (Campos, Campos, &
Barrett, 1989; Gottman et al., 1997; Rothbart & Bates, in press). Consistent with this view,
Goldsmith, Buss, and Lemery (1997) found that the environment contributed the majority of
the variance in three 8-year-old twins’ EC.
Warm, supportive parenting, in contrast to harsh parenting, is likely to foster EC, and hence
broader emotion-related self-regulation, in multiple ways. Hoffman (2000) has argued that
parents’ hostile or punitive negative expressivity is likely to produce affective overarousal in
their children, which could undercut regulation and learning in the specific context. When
children are overaroused, they are likely to have difficulties focusing and/or shifting their
attention as needed, and their developing attentional and behavioral self-regulation skills may
be compromised. For example, negatively aroused children are less likely to take advantage
of parental attempts to scaffold their emerging attentional and behavioral regulatory skills (e.g.,
through joint attention in the early years; Raver & Leadbeater, 1995). Similarly, parental
negativity is likely to elicit negative emotions in children, and as Blair (2002, p. 119) has
argued, “young children characterized by negative emotionality are likely to experience
difficulty in the application of higher order cognitive processes simply because their emotional
responses do not call for reflective planning and problem solving, and these skills are underused
and consequently under-developed” (also see Raver, 1996). In contrast, when parents are warm
and supportive, children are unlikely to be overaroused and are better able to respond to parental
efforts to focus their attention and guide their behavior. This view is consistent with Vygotsky’s
(1978) view that cognitive skills are socially constructed through interactions with supportive,
responsive adults.
Secondly, consistent with the arguments of Dix (1991) and Grusec and Goodnow (1994),
children are likely to be more disposed to process their parents’ messages, internalize parents’
requests for desirable behavior (e.g., inhibiting undesirable behavior and paying attention), and
control their emotions and behaviors when their parents are positive and supportive rather than
negative. Thus, they may be more motivated, as well as better able, to attend to and learn from
interactions with, and scaffolding provided by, warm parents. Moreover, warm, positive
parents are likely to evoke positive emotion in their children. Because positive mood promotes
creativity and flexibility in thinking and problem solving (Fredickson, 2001; Isen & Daubman,
1984; Isen, Daubman, & Nowicki, 1987), it is likely to foster EC (which is viewed as flexible
in its use and as involving higher order cognitive abilities) and active attempts to regulate. In
addition, because positive affect facilitates the processing of self-relevant information (Trope
& Pomerantz, 1998) and broadens attention (Derryberry & Tucker, 1994; Fredickson, 2001),
positive affect induced by positive parents may enhance children’s capacity to modulate their
own behavior and affect.
In addition, parents who express relatively high levels of positive emotion and are supportive
are likely to model constructive ways to manage stress and relationships, including the
regulation of emotional responses to stress (Power, 2004) and inappropriate behavior
(Halberstadt et al., 1999). Moreover, they may facilitate children’s regulation by promoting
the predictability of the environment (Brody & Ge, 2001) and by protecting children from
exposure to potentially stressful events (Power, 2004).

Parents’ warmth and positive expressivity may also be linked to children’s regulation and
externalizing behavior because of its effects on the quality of the parent–child relationship.
Parental warmth and positive expressivity have been linked to a secure attachment (Contreras,
Kerns, Weimer, Gentzler, & Tomich, 2000), and this security is believed to foster regulated
behavior (Cummings & Davies, 1996), in part because the child has greater psychological
resources for dealing with negative emotions and events. In addition, children with more secure
attachments are likely to be better at understanding others’ emotions (e.g., Laible & Thompson,
1998, 2002), are less prone to negative emotion than insecurely attached children (Kochanska,
2001), and are relatively mature in the development of conscience (Laible & Thompson,
2002), all of which could result in greater EC of behavior and lower levels of antisocial
behavior.
There is some initial evidence consistent with the suggestion that children’s regulation
(including EC) at least partially mediates the relation of parental emotional expressivity in the
family to children’s adjustment. Researchers have found an association between maternal
responsivity to infants’ emotional cues and infants’ use of self-regulatory behaviors (Cohn &
Tronick, 1983; Gable & Isabella, 1992), mothers’ reported positive expressivity in the family
and higher levels of toddlers’ self-soothing behavior (Garner, 1995), and maternal acceptance/
support and children’s successful coping (Hardy, Power, & Jaedicke, 1993; Kliewer, Fearnow,
& Miller, 1996) or self-regulation (Brody & Ge, 2001). Moreover, parents who are accepting
of children’s emotions and are supportive in regard to encouraging them to talk about emotions
tend to rear children who are relatively able to modulate their internal arousal and down-
regulate as required (Gottman et al., 1997). Furthermore, a composite index of adult-reported
and observed regulation has been related to parents’ positive expression of emotion in the
family and with their child (Eisenberg, Gershoff, et al., 2001, Eisenberg, Valiente, et al.,
2003).
Also consistent with the mediation hypothesis (i.e., parenting → children’s EC → children’s
externalizing problems), investigators frequently have found that better regulated children
(including those higher in EC) are better adjusted than their less regulated peers (e.g.,
Eisenberg, Cumberland, et al., 2001; Kochanska & Knaack, 2003; NICHD, 2003; see Rothbart
& Bates, in press). Children who can modulate their negative emotions and inhibit the behaviors
associated with those emotions would be expected to be less emotionally aroused and more
appropriate in their expression of negative emotions, as well as more likely to comply with
adults’ expectations.
Only a few investigators have explicitly examined regulation as a mediator between parental
warmth or positive expressivity and children’s adjustment. Brody and Ge (2001) assessed
parental nurturance/support versus negativity and found that supportive parenting predicted
children’s self-control at two points in time; children’s self-control, in turn, was negatively
related to children’s problems with adjustment (hostility, depression, and low self-esteem).
The data did not support the possibility that children’s self-regulation predicted later parenting.
Although not assessing family expressivity per se, Gottman et al. (1997) found that parents
who were supportive in regard to encouraging the appropriate expression of emotion and
coaching children about their emotions had children who were relatively high in regulation
and, in turn, low in aggression. Gottman et al. did not, however, find a relation between
children’s regulation and parental scaffolding/praising (at least when other variables were
controlled in a structural model). Although the NICHD Childcare Network (2003) found that
impulsivity (errors of commission on a reaction test) mediated the relation of family
environment (including quality of the home environment, maternal sensitivity, and maternal
cognitive stimulation) to externalizing problems, they did not find support for sustained
attention (low levels of errors of omission, which likely tap regulation) as a mediator (although
they were significantly correlated with low levels of externalizing problems). Eisenberg et al.

(Eisenberg, Gershoff, et al., 2001, Eisenberg, Valiente, et al. 2003), using both concurrent data
and data from two time points that were 2 years apart, found a pattern of results consistent with
the hypothesis that children’s EC mediated the negative relation between parental positive
expressivity (with the child and in the family) and children’s externalizing problems. However,
in the second assessment, those findings were nonsignificant when controlling for prior levels
of the variables in structural equation modeling and were significant only in regression analyses
(when controlling for initial levels of externalizing problems). Moreover, this analysis involved
only two time points, so some variables in the mediational sequence were assessed
concurrently, and thus the estimation of mediated effect may be biased (Cole & Maxwell,
2003).
Brody and Ge’s (2001) study was the only study that we located in which two of the three
variables (parenting and regulation, but not adjustment) were assessed at three different times
(1 year apart). However, in this study, indicators of adjustment included depression, low self-
esteem, and hostility or indices of alcohol use, not externalizing problems, and initial levels of
adjustment were not controlled in the analyses. It is possible that findings vary for different
indices of adjustment; indeed, EC seems to be more strongly related to low levels of
externalizing problems than internalizing problems (Eisenberg, Cumberland, et al., 2001).
Moreover, bidirectional, across-time relations between parenting and children’s regulation
were not tested simultaneously. Cole and Maxwell (2003) suggested that the optimal way to
test mediation is to use at least three points in time and to include omitted paths (e.g., the child-
driven paths in a socialization model) in one version of the model. In addition, the participants
in the Brody and Ge study were in early adolescence; we know of no study assessing
bidirectional relations (across time) among parents’ warmth/positivity, children’s regulation,
and children externalizing problems in younger children. It is possible that regulation is a more
important mediator of parenting in adolescence than in middle childhood because of heightened
negative conflict between parent and children in adolescence (Collins & Steinberg, in press)
and/or because of the emergence of externalizing problems in adolescence for some youth (see
Dodge et al., in press). Alternatively, because EC develops at a relatively fast pace in the earlier
years and is fairly well established by age 4 (Posner & Rothbart, 1998), parental effects on
regulation may be relatively stable by age 5. Moreover, parents’ positivity may have a stronger
influence on children’s regulation at a younger than at an older school age because of a decline
of interactions between parent and child with age.
In the present study, we examined whether children’s emotion-related regulation mediated the
relation between parental warmth/positive expressivity and externalizing problems using three
points in time, each two years apart. The sample in this study was different from the sample
used in two prior tests of the relation of parental positive expressivity to children’s regulation
and adjustment (Eisenberg, Gershoff, et al., 2001, Eisenberg, Valiente, et al., 2003). We hoped
to replicate the relations of parental positive expressivity to EC and adjustment obtained with
that sample, but using both an older and more normative sample than the at-risk sample (for
externalizing and internalizing problems) in the other studies and 3 waves of data (rather than
concurrent or 2-wave data). It is quite possible that parental warmth/positive expressivity has
effects on children’s EC and social functioning in the preschool and elementary school years,
but not in adolescence (e.g., because of habituating to the level of these variables or because
of the heightened importance of other influences such as peers). Alternatively, the influence
of parental warmth/positive expressivity on adolescents’ regulation and adjustment may be
because of either the consistency of its effects on youth at younger ages or the continuing (as
well as past) influence of this aspect of parenting on adolescents’ regulation and adjustment.
We examined not only the hypothesized role of regulation as a mediator of the relation between
parenting and externalizing behavior, but also if regulation predicted parenting across time.
We expected positive parenting to predict higher regulation; we also thought that regulation

might predict positive parenting across time (as it has for punitive parenting; Eisenberg et al.,
1999). We expected to obtain these relations despite considerable stability in each of the three
major constructs (i.e., parenting, regulation, and externalizing problems) over time. Such a
pattern of relations would suggest that associations among these variables are not thoroughly
established in early childhood. Although we recognize that even structural equation modeling
cannot prove causality, it can be used to test the plausibility of causal associations, especially
when the data are longitudinal and when the key variables are tested at three or more time
points.
Finally, we examined whether children’s sex, age, and family socioeconomic status (SES)
moderated the pattern of relations. The direct relation of family or parental expressiveness to
child outcomes often varies with the sex of the child and the dependent measure (e.g., Boyum
& Parke, 1995). However, sex did not moderate the pattern of relations in previous studies
(Eisenberg, Gershoff, et al., 2001, Eisenberg, Valiente, 2003) and parental positivity is
expected to foster regulation for both sexes.
Although EC increases in the school years (Murphy, Eisenberg, Fabes, Shepard, & Guthrie,
1999), we did not expect the relations of interest to vary in strength for children varying only
a few years in age (tests of moderation by age assess differences in patterns because of the age
of the child at a given assessment, not across assessments), and no moderation was found for
children in early elementary school in another study of parental expressivity, children’s
regulation, and children’s adjustment (Eisenberg, Gershoff, et al., 2001, Eisenberg, Valiente,
et al., 2003). Finally, SES was examined as a moderator. SES was not expected to affect the
pattern of relations between the parenting and child variables because relations among
socialization, children’s regulation, and their adjustment in lower SES samples often have been
similar to those found in higher SES samples (Raver, 2002). Nonetheless, relations of parenting
to regulation occasionally have been found to be stronger in more disadvantaged populations,
particularly in studies of young children (see Dodge et al., in press; Raver, 2004), and relations
between parenting and externalizing problems sometimes vary across SES or racial groups
(Dodge et al., in press).
Methods
Participants
Participants were from an ongoing study of emotional and social development (Eisenberg et
al., 1996, Eisenberg, Losoya, et al., 2001; Zhou et al., 2002). At Time 1 (T1), 199 children
(49% girls, age range = 64 – 125 months, mean age = 89.5 months, SD = 13.9) and their parents
recruited from four public schools participated in a laboratory visit. Seventy-nine percent of
the T1 sample were European American, 4% were African American, 10% were Hispanic
American, .5% were Asian American, 2% were American Indian, and 4.5% were classified as
other. The participants were mostly from working and middle-class families (mean family
income at T1 = $46,000, SD = $24,000, mean years of education = 14.60 and 14.99 for mothers
and fathers, respectively, SDs = 2.00 and 2.55). Of those who participated in the T1 study, 169
were assessed 2 years later (T2), 169 participated 4 years later (T3), and 159 had data from
parent reports, teacher reports and/or laboratory assessments 6 years later (T4; and another 7
had only very limited data from fathers).
The present study used data from T2 to T4; relevant measures of parenting were not available
at T1. The sample used included 186 participants (51% girls) who had data from at least 1 of
the 3 waves (T2, T3, and T4; we continue to use these designations rather than labeling the
three assessments as T1, T2, and T3 to be consistent with terminology in prior articles). Sample
characteristics at T2 and T3 were reported elsewhere (Eisenberg, Losoya, et al., 2001; Zhou,
et al., 2002). The children’s mean age at T4 was 13.4 years (range = 11.3–16.4 years, SD =

1.2). At T4, the sample was 78% European American, 13% Hispanic, 3% American Indian,
2% Asian American, .5% African American, and 2% others; 72% lived in two-parent
households. At T4, 88.4% of mothers and 85.4% of fathers had at least some college education.
Family yearly income was coded into 1 of 6 levels: 1 = “less than $20,000” (6.0%), 2 =
“$20,000–$40,000” (13.3%), 3 = “$40,000–$60,000” (28.0%), 4 = “$60,000–
$80,000” (20.7%), 5 = “$80,000–$100,000” (17.3%), and 6 = “more than $100,000” (13.3%).
We compared the individuals who dropped out after the T1 assessment with those who were
included in the current sample on the demographic variables, as well as on the other variables
used in this study that were also available at T1 (i.e., parents’ and teachers’ reports of children’s
attention focusing and shifting and externalizing problems, and children’s persistence on
puzzle box task). Families who attrited from T1 assessment and were not involved in any
subsequent assessment (N = 13), as compared with those who were included in the current
sample, had a higher proportion of African Americans, Pearson χ2(5) = 43.21, p<.001, and
lower maternal and paternal education and family income, ts(195, 180, 186) = 2.58, 2.61, and
2.53, ps = .012, .011, and .013. Children who attrited were rated as higher in externalizing
problems by teachers and were less persistent on the puzzle box task at T1 than those in the
current sample, ts(197, 196) = −2.18 and 2.01, ps<.032 and .047. Thus, attrition may have
introduced some bias into the sample.
Procedures
At each wave, the primary caregiving parent and child came to the laboratory (155 at T2, 152
at T3, and 140 at T4); all but 9 at T2, 14 at T3, and 15 at T4 were mothers. For families that
moved out of town after T1 and a few other families that could not come in, and parent and
child questionnaire data were collected through mail (Ns = 16, 17, and 22 at T2, T3, and T3,
respectively). Parents completed several questionnaires assessing children’s EC and
externalizing problems. Children participated in a behavioral task designed primarily to
measure EC (the puzzle box task at T2 and T3, and the origami task at T4). Moreover, the
parent and child participated in one of the two interactive tasks (the parent–child watching
emotion-evocative slides at T2 and T3; and the parent–adolescent origami task at T4). Of the
parents who filled out the questionnaires (Ns = 165, 167, and 157 at T2, T3, and T4,
respectively), all but 9 at T2, 10 at T3, and 6 at T4 were mothers. Parents, children, and teachers
provided written consent and were paid for participation. At each wave, teachers completed
similar measures of children’s EC and externalizing problems after the lab session, near the
end of the semester (the return rates were 95%, 91%, and 93% at T2, T3, and T4, respectively).
Measures
Parental Warmth and Positive Expressivity
Parental positive expressivity and warmth during the slide interactions (T2 and T3): The
child and the primary caregiving parent viewed a series of eight slides (using a procedure
similar to Buck, Losow, Murphy, & Costanzo, 1992), including four pleasant and four
unpleasant slides. Details regarding this task were reported in Eisenberg, Losoya, et al.
(2001), and Zhou et al. (2002). Parents were told to look at each slide and to explain to the
child what was happening in it (for up to 45 s). Parents’ positive facial expressivity was
operationalized as the intensity of the parent’s facial emotional responses when viewing the
slides with the child, but not talking with the child. Only parents’ positive facial expressivity
when viewing the four pleasant slides was used. As in procedures used by Buck et al. (1992)
to assess encoding of emotion, undergraduates (8 at T2 and 6 at T3) used a 9-point scale
(ranging from unpleasant [from 1 to 3] to neutral [4–6] to pleasant [7–9]) to indicate how they
thought each slide made the parent feel. Parents’ facial reactions to the slides during the first
8 s of the procedure or until the parent turned from the slide to the child were rated (after this

time, parents were likely to be interacting with their children). Therefore, these scores reflected
positive versus negative facial expressivity in view of, but not directed toward, the child and
likely reflected, in part, the emotional atmosphere that the parent wished to maintain. The
volume was turned off during coding to keep the observers naïve to the content of the slides.
Ratings across raters and across the four pleasant slides were averaged to create the composite
for parental positive expressivity to pleasant slides. Another seven observers at T2 and six at
T3 coded the parents’ facial reactions for reliability. The interrater reliabilities (rs) between
the two groups of coders (based on coding all participants) were .83 at T2 and .92 at T3.
At both T2 and T3, parents’ overall warmth directed at the child (i.e., the degree of smiling,
laughing, positive voice of tone, and verbal and physical affection) during the parent–child
slide discussion (not when the parent was initially viewing the slide) also was rated by a coder
who had no other part in the study. The rater viewed the videotape of all eight slides and then
made one global rating on a 7-point scale (1 = very low warm to 7 = very high warm). A
reliability coder coded 26% of the data at T2 and 19% at T3 (interrater rs = .86 and .89 at T2
and T3, respectively). The above measures of parental positive expressivity/warmth were
moderately, positively correlated within time (rs = .40 and .50 at T2 and T3, respectively)
(Eisenberg et al., 2001c, 2003b).
Parental positive expressivity and warmth during the origami puzzle interaction (T4):
At T4, the adolescent and the parent were asked to complete an origami task following
guidelines in an instruction sheet. Parents were told that they could help their children as much
or as little as they wanted on the task. Adolescents were told that they would receive points
toward a prize if they completed this task in the allotted time (4½ min).
The interaction was videotaped and coded by two graduate students for parental global warmth
and positive expressivity. Parental warmth was rated on a 7-point scale from a low to a very
high degree of warmth. Warmth included displays of closeness, friendliness, encouragement,
and positive affect (smiling and laughing). In addition, warmth reflected the degree of physical
affection and quality of the conversation. The interrater reliability, computed with a correlation
for 48 participants, was .71. In addition, intensity and duration of parents’ positive expressivity
(smiling and laughing) was rated every 30 s on a 5-point scale (from 1 = no positive affect to
5 = smiling and laughing for a majority of the time). A composite score was constructed by
averaging the scores for positive affect during each 30 s (interrater reliability r for 49
participants = .74).
Children’s EC—At each wave, children’s EC was assessed with the inhibitory control,
attention shifting, and attention focusing subscales of the Child Behavioral Questionnaire
(Rothbart, Ahadi, & Hershey, 1994; Rothbart, Ahadi, Hershey, & Fisher, 2001) and with a
behavioral measure. Parents and teachers rated each item on a 7-point scale (1 = extremely
untrue of my/this child; 7 = extremely true of my/this child). The inhibitory control subscale
consisted of 13 items assessing the child’s ability to regulate his or her behavior (e.g., “Can
lower his/her voice when asked to do so”). Four items from the teacher-reported inhibitory
control subscale (i.e., “Is good at games like “Simon Says”, “Mother, May I,” and “Red Light,
Green Light”, “Prepares for trips and outings by planning things s/he will need”, “Approaches
places s/he has been told are dangerous slowly and cautiously,” and “Is not very careful and
cautious in crossing streets and other potentially dangerous situations”) were dropped because
more than 25% of the teachers at T2, 30% at T3, and 50% at T4 failed to respond to these items.
The αs for the final 9-item teacher-reported inhibitory control scale at T2, T3, and T4 were .
90, .90, and .82, respectively; the αs for the 13-item parent-reported scale were .81, .86, and .
85.

The attention shifting subscale consisted of 10 items assessing children’s ability to move
attention from one activity to the next (e.g., “Has an easy time leaving play to come inside for
school work”); αs for teachers’ and parents’ reports = .87 and .78 for T2, .88 and .83 for T3,
and .83 and .78 for T4, respectively. The attention focusing subscale included 11 items
assessing the ability to concentrate on a task when needed (e.g., “When drawing or reading a
book, shows strong concentration”; αs for teachers’ and parents’ reports = .89 and .82 for T2, .
86 and .86 for T3, and .90 and .84 for T4, respectively).
For both parents’ and teachers’ reports, the concurrent scale scores of inhibitory control,
attention shifting, and attention focusing were positively correlated (within-time and within-
reporter rs ranged from .50 to .83 for teachers, and from .26 to .69 for parents). To reduce the
number of variables, two composite scores—parents’ and teachers’ reports of children’s EC
—were created within each wave by averaging the scores on the 3 scales.
Behavioral measure of EC: At T2 and T3, children’s regulation was also assessed with a
puzzle box task. Children were instructed to try to assemble a wooden puzzle in a large box
without looking at it. A cloth covered the front; children slipped their arms through sleeves to
get into the box. The cloth could be lifted up so that a child could cheat by looking. Children
were told that if they finished the puzzle within 5 min, they would receive an attractive prize
and that they could call the experimenter back by ringing a bell if they finished in less than 5
min. An unseen observer timed children’s persistence on the puzzle box (i.e., working on the
puzzle without cheating) when alone. A second observer timed 76 children at T1 and 78
children at T2; interrater reliabilities (rs) were .99 and .98. An index reflecting the degree of
children’s persistence on a task was calculated as the proportion of time spent persisting on
the puzzle (i.e., the number of seconds persisting divided by the total time spent with the task).
At T4, the behavioral measure of children’ regulation was a child-alone origami task (which
occurred before the origami task with the parent). During the experiment session, children were
asked to complete an origami task—folding a frog from a piece of paper following the
directions in the instruction sheet. They were given 3 min to complete the task and were told
they would get an attractive prize if they finished. Research assistants timed children’s total
persistence during the times they were allowed to work (interrater r for 67 children = .99). An
index reflecting the degree of children’s persistence on the task was calculated as the proportion
of time working on the origami task divided by the total amount of time spent with the task.
Children’s Externalizing Problems—At T2, T3, and T4, children’s externalizing
problems were assessed with the 24-item Child Behavioral Checklist (Lochman et al., 1995;
e.g., “lies”, “aggressive to adults”). Parents and teachers rated each item from 1 = never to 4
= often. One item (“set fires”) was dropped because it might be offensive to parents and was
also low frequency. The αs for teachers’ and parents’ reports were .97 and .91 for T2, .96 and .
93 for T3, and .96 and .92 for T4, respectively.
Results
After examining the relations of child age and gender to the T4 variables, we computed the
zero-order correlations among the variables from T2 to T4. Following Cole and Maxwell’s
(2003) suggestions, several steps were taken to examine our hypotheses. First, the measurement
models were tested with confirmatory factor analyses, which examine whether the manifest
variables relate to one another in the ways prescribed by the theory. Next, we tested a
longitudinal model (Figure 1a) in which parental warmth/positive expressivity at earlier waves
predicted children’s higher EC (controlling for the prior level of EC), which in turn predicted
lower externalizing problems at later waves (controlling for the prior level of externalizing

problems). Finally, we tested a longitudinal model (Figure 1b) with the child-driven paths (i.e.,
the paths from prior levels of child EC to later parental warmth/expressivity) added.
Age, Sex, and Family SES Differences on T4 (Adolescence) Variables
Because age and sex differences on T2 and T3 variables were reported elsewhere (e.g.,
Eisenberg, Zhou, et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2002), only analyses for T4 variables are presented.
To examine sex differences on T4 variables, three single-factor (sex) MANOVAs were
computed for (1) parental warmth and positive expressivity in the parent–adolescent origami
interaction; (2) parents’ and teachers’ reports of adolescents’ EC and adolescents’ persistence
on origami task; and (3) parents’ and teachers’ ratings of adolescents’ externalizing problems.
Significant sex differences were found on T4 measures of adolescents’ EC, multivariate F(3,
119) = 6.80, p<.001. Both parents and teachers rated adolescent girls as higher on EC than
adolescent boys, the univariate Fs(1, 121) = 12.91 and 14.23, ps<.001, although no sex
difference was found on adolescents’ persistence (see means in Table 1). There were also sex
differences on adults’ reports of adolescents’ externalizing problems, multivariate F(2, 143) =
12.28, p<.001. Both parents and teachers rated adolescent girls as lower in externalizing
problems than adolescent boys, univariate Fs(1, 144) = 5.72 and 24.39, ps<.01. No sex
differences were found for parental warmth and positive expressivity at T4.
We also calculated the zero-order correlations between child age and family SES and the T4
variables. The family SES variable was created by first averaging maternal and paternal
education levels (at T2), and then averaging the standardized scores for parental education and
family income (at T2). Only one significant correlation was found between family SES and
teachers’ reports of adolescent regulation, r(132) = .21, p = .02.
Correlation Analyses
Because many of the correlations among the T2 and T3 (but not T4) variables were presented
elsewhere (Eisenberg, Valiente, et al., 2003; Eisenberg, Zhou, et al. 2003; Zhou, et al., 2002),
we only report in text the correlations among T4 variables and between T4 variables and T2
or T3 variables (although the full correlation matrix is presented in Table 2). Within T4, parental
warmth and positive expressivity during the parent–adolescent origami interaction were
positively correlated, and both were negatively associated with parents’ and/or teachers’
reports of adolescent externalizing problems (although they were unrelated to adults’ reports
of adolescents’ concurrent EC).
Positive cross-time correlations were found among measures of parental warmth and positive
expressivity (especially at consecutive time points), among parents’ and teachers’ reports of
children’s EC, and among measures of externalizing problems. However, children’s
persistence on the puzzle task at T2 and T3 was unrelated to their persistence at T4. There were
some significant correlations between parenting at T2 or T3 and measures of children’s EC at
T4: T2 parental warmth (but not positive expressivity) was positively related to T4 parents’
and teachers’ reports of children’s EC, whereas T3 parental warmth and positive expressivity
were positively related to parents’ (but not teachers’) reports of EC. Moreover, T2 and T3
(especially the latter) parental warmth and positive expressivity were negatively related to T4
reports of externalizing problems. In general, parental warmth and negative expressivity related
similarly to other variables. Finally, both within- and across-reporter associations were found
between adults’ reports of children’s EC at T2 and T3 and their reports of externalizing
problems at T4; children’s behavioral persistence at T2 and T3 were negatively related to
mothers’ (but not teachers’) reports of T4 externalizing problems.

Testing the Measurement Models for Parental Warmth/Positive Expressivity, Children’s EC,
and Externalizing Problems: Confirmatory Factor Analyses
Confirmatory factor analyses were used to examine the factor structures for measures of
parenting, children’s EC, and children’s externalizing problems from T2 to T4. Before
conducting the factor analyses, the variables were screened for normality and outliers. No
variables exceeded the cutoff values of 2 for skewness and 7 for kurtosis (West, Finch, &
Curran, 1995) and no outliers were identified with Cook’s (1977) test using the cutoff point of
1 (Stevens, 1984). We also calculated Box’s M statistics (Winer, 1971) to test the homogeneity
of the variance–covariance matrices among all variables included in the SEM analyses across
boys and girls, between older and younger children (classified based on a median-split of age),
and between children from higher and lower SES families (classified based on a median-split
of the continuous SES variable). The Box’s M tests for sex and SES were nonsignificant.
Because the Box’s M is a sensitive test of the group differences in the variance–covariance
matrices (Tabachnick & Fidell, 1996), this result suggested that sex and SES did not moderate
the relations among variables in the larger models. In contrast, the Box’s M for age differences
was significant, Box’s M = 385.3 p = .03. Therefore, moderation by child’s age was further
tested using multiple-group SEM.
In the first model (Figure 2a), the latent factors for parental warmth/positive expressivity at T2
and T3 were each indicated by parental positive expressivity to pleasant slides and parental
warmth during parent–child slide discussion; parental warmth/positive expressivity at T4 was
indicated by the ratings of parental positive expressivity (affect) and warmth during the parent–
youth origami interaction. In the second model (Figure 2b), the latent factors for EC were each
indicated by parents’ and teachers’ reports as well as children’s observed persistence on the
behavioral task. In the third model (Figure 2c), children’s externalizing problems at T2–T4
were each indicated by parents’ and teachers’ reports. In all these models, the latent factors
were allowed to correlate with each other. Moreover, as suggested by Cole and Maxwell
(2003), the measurement errors of the same measures from the same reporter/index at different
time points (e.g., mothers’ reports of externalizing problems at T2, T3, and T4, or parental
positive expressivity during slide discussions at T2 and T3) were allowed to correlate with
each other if doing so significantly improved the overall model fit. The models were tested
using Mplus 2.10 (Muthen & Muthen, 2001).
The measurement model for parental warmth/positive expressivity fit the data marginally,
χ2(df = 5, N = 171) = 11.5, p = .04, comparative fit index (CFI) = .98, root-mean-square error
of approximation (RMSEA) = .087, and standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR) = .
027 (Figure 2a). Hu and Bentler (1999) recommended the values close to .95 for CFI, .08 for
SRMR, and .06 for RMSEA as cutoff criteria for a relatively good fit between the hypothesized
model and the observed data. However, the RMSEA criterion is less preferable at small sample
sizes (e.g., N ≤ 250) because it tends to overreject true-population models (Hu & Bentler, 1999).
The original measurement model for child emotion-related regulation fit the data adequately,
χ2(df = 20, N = 186) = 33.42, p = .03, CFI = .98, RMSEA = .060, and SRMR = .051. All the
model-estimated loadings were significant in a positive direction except for the loading of
adolescent persistence at T4. Thus, this indicator was dropped and the model was re-estimated.
The revised model fit the data fairly well, χ2(df = 13, N = 186) = 20.16, p = .09, CFI = .99,
RMSEA = .054, and SRMR = .040 (Figure 2b). Finally, the measurement model for Child
Externalizing Problems fit the data adequately, χ2(df = 3, N = 186) = 5.08, p = .16, CFI = 1.00,
RMSEA = .061, SRMR = .014. All the model-estimated loadings were significant and positive
(and the latent constructs were each correlated across time).
For these models, we also examined the invariance in factor loadings across waves by testing
the model in which the factor loadings of the corresponding manifest variables were
constrained to be equal across time and comparing the chi-square difference between the model
Eisenberg et al.

with and without the invariance constraint. The difference in chi-square was significant for all
three models, Δχ2s(2, 4, and 2) = 14.76, 18.95, and 9.39 for parental warmth/positive
expressivity, child EC, and child externalizing problems, respectively, ps<.01, suggesting that
the hypothesis of an invariant pattern of factor loadings was untenable and that the meanings
of either the latent variables or the indicators may have changed with age (Cole & Maxwell,
2003). Thus, any comparisons in relations across age are somewhat difficult to interpret
because of the lack of strict comparability of the various indicators of variables.
Structural Equation Modeling
As tests of measurement models suggested that the manifest variables related to the latent
factors as we expected, we then tested the longitudinal model (Figure 3) in which parental
warmth/positive expressivity at prior waves was hypothesized to predict children’s EC at later
waves, which, in turn, predicts later externalizing problems, above and beyond the
autoregressive effects. As shown in Figure 3, in addition to the measurement models, we
included the autoregressive paths (i.e., paths predicting a latent construct from its prior level),
as well as the cross-time paths from the latent factors of parenting to child EC, and then to
child externalizing problems. The within-time latent constructs (at T2) were included and their
disturbances (at T3 or T4) were allowed to correlate with each other if they significantly
improved the model fit. As recommended by Cole and Maxwell (2003), to control for shared
method variance, we allowed the error variance of the indicators assessed by the same reporter
either within or across time (e.g., parents’ reports of EC at T2 with parents’ reports of
externalizing at T3) to be correlated.
The hypothesized longitudinal model fit the data adequately, χ2(df = 141, N = 186) = 227.441,
p<.01, CFI = .96, RMSEA = .052, and SRMR = .090. All the auto-regressive paths but one
were significant and positive (the path from T3 Child Externalizing to T4 Child Externalizing
was positive and marginal), indicating cross-time consistency of these latent constructs. As
predicted, controlling for the autoregressive paths, Parental Warmth/Positive Expressivity at
T2 predicted higher Child EC at T3, which, in turn, predicted lower Externalizing Problems at
T4. Analyses were conducted to test whether the indirect (mediated) effect of Parental Warmth/
Positive Expressivity at T2 on Child Externalizing Problems at T4 through EC at T3 was
significant. The conventional approach to test an indirect effect is by dividing the estimate of
the indirect effect by its standard error and comparing the resulting z statistic with a critical
value from the standard normal distribution. Because the distribution of the indirect effect is
rarely normal, this method is usually inaccurate. To accommodate the non-normal distribution
of the indirect effect, MacKinnon, Lockwood, Hoffman, West, and Sheets (2002), MacKinnon,
Lockwood, and Williams (2004) developed a method to calculate the confidence interval (CI)
of the indirect effect based on the distribution of the product of two normal random variables.
If the CI does not include zero, the intervening variable effect is significant. The CI for the
indirect effect of T2 parental warmth/positive expressivity on T4 child externalizing problems
through T3 child EC at p = .05 was [−.0441, −.0004], indicating that this effect was significant.
In addition, to examine the possible impact of missing data on the above results, we recomputed
this model by including only the children with data at all three time points (n = 141); the model
fit was good and the same significant paths were found.
To test the hypothesis that prior child EC predicts later parental warmth/positive expressivity,
we computed the hypothesized model in which the two cross-time paths from child EC to
parenting were added (see Figure 1b). The chi-square difference between the models with and
without the two child-driven paths was not significant; the model-estimated path coefficients
for the two child-driven paths were also not significant. Similarly, when we added paths from
externalizing problems to subsequent parenting in the model in Figure 1b, the new paths were
not significant. Finally, we computed another longitudinal model with the two cross-time paths

from externalizing to parenting (i.e., T2 externalizing → T3 parenting, T3 externalizing → T4
parenting) added. Although this model fit the data adequately, χ2(df = 139, N = 186) = 211.79,
p<.001, RMSEA = .053, CFI = .96, neither of the two cross-time child-driven paths was
significant. Therefore, no evidence was found for the child-driven paths.
Testing for Moderation
Finally, because the Box’s M test indicated that the variance–covariance matrix among the
variables in the analyses differed between the younger and older age groups, moderation by
age was tested for both the measurement models and the longitudinal structural model. Each
measurement model in Figure 2 was fitted to the younger and older groups simultaneously.
The loadings of the manifest variables were constrained to be equal across groups. The
measurement models for parenting, child EC, and child externalizing problems did not differ
across the two age groups, all χ2s were nonsignificant, all CFIs were .99 or higher; all RMSEAs
<.057, all SRMRs<.069. Because of our sample size constraint, we could not test moderation
by age group in the full longitudinal model (in Figure 3). Therefore, we created a composite
for each latent factor by aggregating its indicators using the loadings estimated from the
measurement models, and tested moderation by child age group in the reduced longitudinal
model (in which each latent factor had one single indicator). In the multiple-group analysis by
child age group, the model was fitted to the younger and older groups simultaneously, and the
path coefficients were constrained to be invariant across groups. The model assuming
invariance in path coefficients linking the latent factors across age groups fit the data
adequately, χ2(df = 42, Ns = 74 and 86 for younger and older children, respectively) = 56.61,
p = .07, CFI = .96, RMSEA = .066, SRMR = .09, suggesting that the relations among the latent
factors did not differ across age group. Thus, although the Box’s M test identified a significant
age difference in the variance–covariance matrix, there was no evidence for moderation in the
multiple-group analyses. This was not surprising because the Box’s M is a relatively sensitive
test (Tabachnick & Fidell, 1996).
Discussion
The findings in this study provide perhaps the strongest support yet for the hypothesis that
children’s EC or regulation mediates the relation of parental (primarily maternal) warmth and
positive expressivity to children’s externalizing problems. Observed parental warmth/positive
expressivity in mid-elementary school predicted children’s EC 2 years later, which in turn
predicted low externalizing problems in adolescence. This pattern of findings was obtained
despite controlling for the relatively strong stability of all three constructs over time. In
addition, there was no evidence that the causal relation between parental warmth/expressivity
and children’s EC might be reversed in the model. This pattern of findings is, in general,
consistent with those of Brody and Ge (2001) in regard to the prediction of internalizing
problems and alcohol-related problems.
Support for the mediating role of children’s EC in the relation between parental warmth/
positive expressivity and level of children’s externalizing behavior is fairly strong for several
reasons. First, this mediated path was significant even when controlling for the stability of
relations over time. Second, the fact that the predictor, mediating variable, and outcome
variables were assessed at three time points increases the likelihood that causal processes are
in play (Cole & Maxwell, 2003). Although mediation was supported for the T2 parenting →
T3 EC → T4 externalizing problems sequence, in the SEM model, T2 EC did not predict T3
externalizing. Moreover, T3 parenting did not predict T4 EC. Thus, support for mediation was
only partial. However, this pattern of findings should be interpreted with the often strong
autoregressive paths in mind. In fact, correlations supported these relations even if they were
not significant in the model: T2 EC was consistently significantly negatively correlated with

T3 externalizing problems, whereas T3 parenting was significantly correlated with one
indicator of T4 EC. These significant relations were lost in the model when controlling for the
consistency of these variables as the path from T3 parenting to T4 EC reflected the unique
effect of T3 parenting on T4 EC above and beyond the effect of T3 EC, and the path from T2
EC to T3 externalizing reflected the unique effect of EC above and beyond the effect of T2
externalizing. It is possible that the relation of EC to externalizing problems increases with
age; however, the pattern of correlations between EC and externalizing problems was similar
for the T2–T3 and the T3–T4 relations. A more likely explanation for the lack of a unique
relation between T3 EC and T4 externalizing problems is that the consistency of externalizing
problems over time was greater from T2 to T3 than from T3 to T4, so there was more variance
in T4 than T3 externalizing problems to be accounted for by EC above and beyond the prior
level of externalizing. Similarly, the finding that T3 parenting had no unique effect on T4 EC
(controlling for prior level of EC) may also be because of the greater consistency of EC from
T3 to T4 than from T2 to T3. Consistent with this interpretation, in a study examining
developmental trajectories of EC from ages 5 to 10 years (which included the T1–T3 sample
from the present one), we found that EC (attention focusing and behavioral persistence) tended
to become stabilized by middle childhood (Zhou et al., 2005). It is also possible that the effects
of positive parenting are especially strong in the earlier years when children are more vulnerable
and parents are highly salient socializers compared with other socialization influences such as
peers, and that later relations between parenting and EC may be because of earlier relations
between these variables.
The three measures of children’s EC (teacher-reported, parent-reported, and the behavioral
task) at the initial assessment in this paper (T2) did correlate (at p<.10 or better) with parental
expressivity (but not warmth) at the middle (T3) assessment. Thus, children’s EC could have
some weak effect on parents’ positive expressivity that was masked by combining warmth and
parental positive expressivity. In addition, because of the relatively small sample size and the
stability of the constructs, it was relatively difficult to identify paths across constructs (e.g.,
from parenting to EC), much less paths going in both directions across time. Thus, it is possible
that bidirectional relations between parental warmth/positive expressivity and children’s EC
would be identified if the sample were larger and the time gaps were larger (which might
decrease stability of the three variables). Nonetheless, our findings are consistent with the
conclusion that the prediction of children’s EC from parenting is considerably stronger than
the over-time child effect on this association. This finding argues against a genetic explanation
in which hereditary child characteristics merely evoke parenting behavior (although heredity
might still partly account for the pattern of relations). Moreover, the findings indicate that the
relation of children’s EC to externalizing problems continues to emerge in the elementary
school years, despite the stability of these constructs at a younger age.
As already mentioned, children’s EC was found to mediate the relation of parental warmth/
positive expressivity to children’s externalizing problems in another longitudinal sample
(Eisenberg, Valiente, et al., 2003). However, in that study, the mediator and outcome variables
were assessed at the same time. In addition, the sample in that study was selected by
oversampling children with adjustment problems. Thus, the mediated relation in that study
may have been because of the relatively large variability in participants’ externalizing problems
and may not have been observed in a sample of typical school children. Because the present
sample was recruited from schools without selecting children for any specific characteristics,
we can be more confident that any effects of positive parenting are not confined to comparisons
involving a relatively large number of children with significant problems. In addition, the other
study involved children first assessed in early to mid-elementary school and 2 years later, not
at age 11–14 years. Thus, the present findings indicate that youths’ regulation is still a mediator
of the relation between parenting and externalizing problems as they move through early
adolescence.

The pattern of findings in the present study was not moderated by children’s sex, age, or family
SES. This is not surprising: positive parenting would be expected to relate to optimal outcomes
for children of both sexes and the relation between high regulation and low externalizing
problems appears to hold for both sexes (e.g., Eisenberg et al., 1996). Moreover, the 4-year
age span of children at each assessment may not have been sufficient to produce any significant
variation in the pattern of relations (recall the moderation taps variation within the sample in
age at an assessment). In addition, no evidence was found for moderation by family SES in
this study, which might be partly because of the fact that the sample included primarily
working- to middle-class Caucasian families. The lack of moderation suggests that the
associations examined are relatively robust, although moderation may have been found if the
sample size were larger or if the variability in age or SES were greater.
The findings also provide evidence that parental warmth/positive expressivity and children’s
EC, as well as their externalizing problems, were relatively stable from mid-elementary school
into late elementary school or middle school. The findings in regard to the stability of EC are
consistent with those of Murphy et al. (1999) using children of similar age. However, the
consistency of EC may have been underestimated because the behavioral measure of
persistence at T4 (on the origami task) differed from those at T2 and T3 (on a puzzle task).
Indeed, the behavioral persistence measure did not load on the latent construct at T4, perhaps
because there was little variability in persistence at T4 (most youth persisted the entire time).
The consistency in parents’ positive expressivity over 4 years has not, to our knowledge, been
demonstrated. Again, the degree of consistency may have been attenuated to some degree
because parental warmth was assessed in a somewhat different situation at T4 than at T2 and
T3. Nonetheless, this consistency, combined with the concurrent relations of parental warmth/
expressivity with EC and low externalizing problems at the initial assessment in this paper,
suggests that many of the potential effects of parental positivity may be in place by mid-
elementary school. Nonetheless, as already noted, the data are consistent with the existence of
additional effects of parenting (e.g., at T3) on EC over time.
In summary, the findings suggest that effortful regulatory processes may mediate the relation
between warm, positive parenting and children’s externalizing problems. These findings are
important for prevention research because they suggest the possibility to foster children’s
regulation and decrease externalizing or antisocial behaviors by promoting parental warmth
and positive expressivity. The strengths of this study include the use of a prospective
longitudinal design and multiple measures (multiple reporters and/or observed measures) of
all constructs. A limitation of the study was the fact that the measure of warmth was not identical
at all assessments, although the difference between the T4 measure of parenting and that at T2
and T3 was not crucial to the model because T4 parental warmth/expressivity was not used to
predict other variables. Another limitation is that children with problem behaviors and those
from low income and minority families were somewhat more likely to drop from the sample
(which also was not a representative community sample). In addition, the number of extremely
low-income families was small and the percent of participants from ethnic minority families
was not large. Thus, the findings in this study may not generalize to samples of low-income
or ethnic minority families. This is an important issue to examine in future work.
