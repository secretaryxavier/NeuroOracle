Components of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) envelope such as lipoproteins,
lypoglycans, lipids, and glycolipids act as Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns
and/or antigens, hence contributing in different ways to the bacillus recognition,
phagocytosis,
and to immune responses modulation.
However, Mtb envelope
components are not only encountered at the bacillus-host direct contact but can
act remotely from the bacillus envelope. Indeed, they are also released from the
bacillus envelope and are detected in different compartments such as the infected cells
endosomal compartments or in extracellular vesicles produced by the bacillus itself or by
infected cells. Characterizing their trafﬁcking is of main importance for our understanding
of their role in host-pathogen interactions and consequently for their potential use as
vaccine components. This review aims at providing an overview of the current knowledge
of the nature of Mtb envelope components shuttled within extracellular vesicles, the
interaction of these vesicles with host immune cells and the remaining black holes.

INTRODUCTION
Nowadays tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide with an
estimated 1.4 million deaths in 2018 (1). The causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),
is an airborne pathogen that infects alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells primarily. The
bacillus recognition by innate immunity receptors induces its phagocytosis and the initiation
of the inﬂammatory response. Mtb has evolved strategies to adapt to the host intracellular
environment and to modulate bactericidal activity of phagocytes to avoid killing, such by
inhibiting the phagosome acidiﬁcation and fusion with lysosome (2, 3). However, macrophage
production of chemokines and pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (IL-12, IL-1β, and TNF) induces the
recruitment at the infection site of diﬀerent cellular populations, including T lymphocytes, that
form a characteristic granuloma restraining the bacillus (4). The bacillus has also evolved evasion
mechanisms to delay the onset of this adaptative immunity by modifying the balance of pro- and
anti-inﬂammatory immune responses, in part by inducing the production of the anti-inﬂammatory

cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β (5–8). Nevertheless, the presentation
of bacterial antigens by dendritic cells in the lymph nodes leads to
the recruitment of T cells with diﬀerent eﬀector properties, which
also contribute in balancing the inﬂammation in the granuloma.
This includes TH1 CD4+ T cells, which play an important
role by producing IFN-γ that synergize with TNF in activating
antimicrobial functions of macrophages like the inducible nitric
oxide synthase (iNOS), phagosomal maturation or autophagy,
and in maintaining the granuloma (9–12).
Finally, an arm wrestling match establishes between the host
defenses and Mtb’s evasion strategies. In 90% cases of infection,
the bacillus is restrained in a latent state rather than killed. A
better understanding of the intimate interaction between the host
and the pathogen and the identiﬁcation of immune correlates of
protection are today needed to design new and eﬀective anti-TB
vaccine strategies (13).
Several fatty acid-containing components of the bacillus
envelope,
such
as
lipoproteins,
lipoglycans,
lipids,
and
glycolipids, are key players in these interactions (14–17).
As modulators of both innate and adaptative arms of the
immune response, they represent interesting candidates to
integrate the formulation of new sub-unit vaccines against
TB. The selection of the best candidates would intimately rely
on a deep understanding of their biological properties and
contribution in the orchestration of immune responses. The
role of the bacillus envelope components in TB infection is a
lot conceived within the envelope at the direct contact between
the bacillus and the host cells. However, a new aspect of the
biology of these components has emerged with the discovery
that they traﬃc within the infected cells and within extracellular
vesicles produced by the bacillus itself and by infected cells, here
called bacterial membrane vesicles (BMV) and host extracellular
vesicles (HEV), respectively. Both types of vesicles display
important immunomodulatory properties on host cells. The
characterization of the composition of these vesicles in Mtb
envelope’s components remains incomplete, especially regarding
Mtb lipids and glycolipids. However, this traﬃcking might
represent a key process by which bacterial factors contribute
to host-pathogen interactions and TB pathogenesis, thank
to long-distance eﬀect beyond the infected cells. Indeed, the
macrophage initially infected by Mtb being severally disabled,
the modulation of potent non-infected cells is decisive for the
outcome of the infection. Bacterial components of vesicles have
the potential to favor or, in contrary, to impair the control of the
infection, depending on their immunomodulatory properties.
Such transfer of bacterial material could explain how only few
bacteria can have such an intense inﬂuence on host tissue at the
infection site, as within the granuloma.
During Mtb infection, BMV and HEV are also released.
Not unexpectedly, their characterization has progressively
highlighted that they shuttle diverse mycobacterial PAMPs
and antigens and regulate host immune responses (Figure 2).

and how this traﬃcking extends our understanding of the role of
Mtb envelope components in host-pathogen interactions, beyond
the infected cells.
LIPOPROTEINS, LIPOGLYCANS, AND
(GLYCO)LIPIDS OF MYCOBACTERIA’S
ENVELOPE DISPLAY VARIOUS
IMMUNOMODULATORY PROPERTIES
Mycobacteria are characterized by a thick and protective
envelope composed of diﬀerent layers; an inner plasma
membrane and an outer membrane (or mycomembrane),
separated
by
the
periplasm,
the
peptidoglycan
and
the
arabinogalactan (18, 19) (Figure 1A). This envelope encloses
lipoproteins, lipoglycans, and dozens of lipid and glycolpid
families that distribute diﬀerently within the plasma membrane
and the mycomembrane (20, 21). The plasma membrane
is mainly
composed
of
phospholipids, phosphatidyl-myo-
inositol
di-,
and
hexa-mannosylated
(PIM2
and
PIM6),
triglycerides (TAG), lipoproteins such as LprG and LppX, and
lipoarabinomannan (LAM). The mycomembrane is made of
an inner leaﬂet composed of the characteristic mycolic acids
(MA) (up to 90 carbon-long fatty acids) that are covalently
bound to the arabinogalactan, itself linked to the peptidoglycan.
The outer leaﬂet of the mycomembrane encloses, besides the
LAM and lipoproteins such as LpqH, an impressive diversity
of unique lipid and glycolipid families (Figure 1A). Among
the envelope (glyco)lipidic components, mycolyl esters such as
trehalose mono- and dimycolates (TMM and TDM) are found
for all mycobacteria. In contrast, phthiocerol dimycocerosate
(PDIM), phenolic glycolipids (PGL) or sulfoglycolipids (SGL)
are strain-speciﬁc (glyco)lipid families.
Many
of
them
have
potent
immuno-stimulatory
or
-suppressing properties on host cells by acting as (i) Pathogen-
Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) recognized by the
Pathogen Recognition Receptors (PRRs) such as the Toll-Like
Receptors (TLR) or the C-type lectins (DC-SIGN, Mincle,
Dectin-2, DCAR), (ii) as antigens presented to unconventional
CD1-restriced T cells or (iii) as virulence factors. By interacting
with PRR, Mtb envelope components contribute to the
bacillus recognition, which is followed by its phagocytosis
and diﬀerential modulation of the inﬂammatory response
(Figure 1B). For instance, the lipomannan (LM) (22, 23),
the mycobacterial lipoproteins such as LpqH (24) and, to a
weaker
extent,
the
phosphatidyl-myo-inositol
mannosides
(PIM)
(25),
induce
the
production
of
pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines through their interaction with Toll-like receptor
2 (TLR2). The interaction of Mtb envelope components
with diﬀerent C-type lectin(-like) receptors also initiates
the
bacillus
phagocytosis
and
subsequently
modulates
inﬂammation.
The
mannose-capped
lipoarabinomannan
(Man-LAM) modulates immune response through several
phagocytes receptors. Its recognition by Dectin-2 (dendritic
cell-associated C-type lectin-2) leads to the production of

FIGURE 2 | Trafﬁcking of M. tuberculosis factors within vesicles and their immunomodulatory properties. Mycobacteria release bacterial membrane vesicles (BMV) in
broth culture and within infected cells. It has been proposed that BMV are released from infected cells through exocytosis. Bacterial material released from the
mycobacterial phagosome trafﬁcs toward multivesicular endosomes (MVE) and the plasma membrane and is released within host extracellular vesicles (HEV),
including exosomes and microvesicles. BMV and HEV containing mycobacterial material are capable to modulate many arms of the host immune response.

immunity
(26,
27).
In
contrast,
its
interaction
with DC-SIGN (dendritic cell-speciﬁc intercellular adhesion
molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin) is described to mediate
immunosuppressive activities (27–29). The ManLAM also
contributes to the inhibition of the phagosome-lysosome fusion
and inhibits the production of IL-12 through its interaction with
the mannose receptor (29, 30).
Besides the lipoglycans and the lipoproteins, most of
the (glyco)lipids families of the envelope modulate immune
responses as ligands of PRR and/or as T cells antigens. One of
the most abundant mycolic acid ester, the trehalose dimycolate
(TDM), which also participates in the phagosome maturation
arrest (31, 32), triggers a pro-inﬂammatory response (IL-8, IL-
6, CCL2-4) through its interaction with Mincle and induces
granulomatogenesis (27, 33, 34). The biosynthesis intermediate
of TDM, the trehalose monomycolate (TMM) has been less
studied but also binds to Mincle and displays similar adjuvant
and granulomatogenic properties (35, 36).
Many mycobacterial (glyco)lipids activate unconventional T
cells through their presentation by the CD1 proteins (CD1a,
CD1b, and CD1c isoforms) (16). This includes mycolic acids
and mycolyl esters (glucose/glycerol monomycolate), diacylated
sulfoglycolipids, and PIM, which are presented by the CD1b
isoform. CD1-restricted T cells are activated during the
course of Mtb infection. They display cytotoxic functions or
secrete pro-inﬂammatory cytokines that promote macrophage
bactericidal activity. Evidences support that they contribute
to the control of mycobacteria infection (37). Presentation of
mycobacterial glycolipids requires accessory proteins that act as
lipid tranfer proteins that assist antigen processing and loading
onto transmembrane CD1 isoforms. The CD1e protein, unique
soluble CD1 isoform, has been shown to assist the enzymatic
hydrolysis of PIM6 into antigenic PIM2 in late endosomal
compartiments and their subsequent loading in the CD1b
isoform hydrophobic channels (38–40).

been proposed to induce phagosome damage by inserting into
host membrane and to alter TLR2 detection, and subsequent
bactericidal and immune response, by masking cell wall exposed
Mtb PAMPs (7, 41). The sulfoglycolipids (SGL) act through a
diﬀerent mechanisms, as a TLR2 antagonist (42), and have been
recently shown to play intricate role with PDIM in inhibiting
autophagy (43). Finally, phenolic glycolipids (PGL), which are
produced by hypervirulent strains (44), would exploit the lectin
receptor CR3 to promote bacterial uptake and to inhibit TNF-α
secretion by human macrophages (45).
TYPES OF EXTRACELLULAR VESICLES
RELEASED DURING MYCOBACTERIAL
INFECTION
Vesicles are produced in all three domains of life under
physiological and pathological conditions. They shuttle various
types of cargos including cytoplasmic/cytosolic and membrane-
associated proteins, lipids, glycoconjugates, and nucleic acids.
Vesicles release is, besides cell-cell contact and exchange of
soluble mediators, an additional mechanism of intercellular
communication leading to the regulation of a plethora of
functions in recipient cells. During Mtb infection, vesicles are
released by the bacillus itself and by infected cells.
The Release of Bacterial Membrane
Vesicles (BMV) by Mycobacteria
It is today known that Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria
release 20–400 nm vesicles, which are involved in cell physiology,
such as stress response and detoxiﬁcation, as well as in host-
pathogen interactions and pathogenicity by shuttling PAMPs,
toxins, or virulence factors (46). For Gram-negative bacteria
or diderm bacteria, vesicles are released by a blebbing and
pinching-oﬀprocess from the LPS-containing outer membrane,
therefore referred to as outer-membrane vesicles (47). However,
outer-inner vesicles containing both cytoplasmic and periplasmic
components have also been described to be produced by diderm
bacteria (48). Although doubted for a long time, Gram-positive
bacteria also produce vesicles, which release from the plasma
membrane toward the extracellular space would involve cell wall-
degrading enzymes that destabilize the peptidoglycan layer (49).
First
described
for
M.
ulcerans
in
2007
(50),
the
vesiculogenesis
has
been
next
observed
for
all
tested
mycobacteria including Mtb and M. bovis BCG (51). First,
observed for in vitro cultures, vesicles were later described in
the phagosomes of infected macrophages (51, 52). Given the
diﬃculty to isolate BMV from the phagosome of infected cells,
the composition and properties of mycobacterial BMV have
been essentially studied using vesicles isolated from broth culture
supernatants. These vesicles cannot be assigned to artifact lipid
aggregates or debris that would come from cell lysis for the
reasons that their in vitro release requires bacillus viability and,
although constitutive, is a regulated process. Indeed, in low
iron medium, a challenging deprivation encountered within
host cells, BMV production is stimulated and their content
is enriched in the cell-associated mycobactin siderophore to
support the essential needs in iron of neighboring bacteria
(53). The release of vesicles is therefore a physiological process
used by the bacillus to adapt to environment clues, notably
by modifying the composition of these vesicles. In addition,
vesiculogenesis regulators working independently have been
highlighted to date: virR (vesiculogenesis and immune response
regulator) (54) and the SenX3-RegX3 two-component system
(55). The deletion of the ﬁrst one or the activation of the second
one leads to a hypervesiculation phenotype. The mechanisms
of action of these regulators are still poorly understood because
the characterization of the vesiculogenesis mechanism itself
is still in its infancy in mycobacteria. Their high content in
cytoplasmic proteins, lipoproteins, and phospholipids, which are
also abundant components of the plasma membrane, supports
the hypothesis that BMV originate from the plasma membrane
of the mycobacterial envelope. How these vesicles traﬃc across
the above layers of the envelope to reach the extracellular space
is a question widely opened (Figure 1A). As for Gram-negative
bacteria it might include the action of degrading enzymes. In
this sense, in a recent preprint article the groups of M. Rodriguez
and R. Prados-Rosales are describing that vesiculogenesis is
accompanied of peptidoglycan alterations and that the dynamin
like proteins IniA and IniC are required for Mtb-EV biogenesis
in culture and during macrophage infection (56).
The Release of Host Extracellular Vesicles
(HEV) by Mycobacteria-Infected Cells
Eukaryotic cells release three main types of vesicles classiﬁed
based upon their biogenesis, release pathway, size, and content:
exosomes (30–150 nm) are released following the fusion of
multivesicular endosomes (MVE) with the plasma membrane
and are characterized as tetraspanins positive vesicles (CD9,
CD63, CD81), microvesicles (100 nm−1 micron) originate
from the outward budding of the plasma membrane and carry
selectins and integrins at their surface and apoptotic bodies
(1–5 microns) result from apoptotic cells disassembling and
can be diﬀerentiated by the presence of histones and cellular
organelles (57). Hence, the diﬀerent types of vesicles can be
puriﬁed from cell culture supernatant or biological ﬂuids based
on their physical properties. The most commonly used protocols
for the separation of these main types of vesicles consist of
diﬀerential centrifugation allowing the successive sedimentation
of apoptotic bodies (∼2,000 g), microvesicles (∼10,000 g) and
the smallest vesicles such as exosomes (∼100,000 g). The
centrifugation if often followed by an extra puriﬁcation step
on density gradient to remove co-precipitated HEV-associated
proteins and nucleic acids (58). However, progress in the ﬁeld of
vesicles puriﬁcation and characterization keep highlighting the
existence of multiple sub-populations among these main types
of vesicles with overlapping in size and markers, which add a
level of complexity for their individual separation and functional
characterization (59).
As
every
eukaryotic
cells,
macrophages
infected
by
mycobacteria release exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic
bodies. Although their content in mycobacterial factors is
currently characterized to diﬀerent extent, all these vesicles

are endowed with important immunomodulatory properties
(Figure 2).
MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION OF
MYCOBACTERIAL MEMBRANE VESICLES
The (glyco)lipid content of BMV released by the 14C-labeled
BCG or Mtb strains was analyzed by 2D-TLC (51). The analysis
of retention factors highlighted a high abundance of PIM2Ac2,
PIM2Ac1, and phospholipids (PG, PE, PI, and cardiolipin) and
lower amount of polyacylated trehalose and phenolic glycolipids
but several lipids remained unassigned. In addition, MALDI-
Tof analysis of Mtb and BCG BMV extracts has also identiﬁed
PIM6Ac1. The high abundance of plasma membrane lipids
supports the hypothesis that BMV originate from the inner
membrane of mycobacteria envelope.
Besides lipids and glycolipids, proteomic analyses of the BMV
released by Mtb and M. bovis BCG, have identiﬁed hundreds
of mycobacterial proteins including virulence-associated proteins
and immunodominant antigens (superoxide dismutase, catalase,
Ag85, and CFP10) and have revealed an enrichment in
lipoproteins (LprG, LpqH, LprA, PstS1, and LppX), which are
strong TLR2 agonists (51, 60). Interestingly, this enrichment
in lipoproteins was not observed for the BMV released by the
avirulent strain M. smegmatis, suggesting that BMV composition
and therefore subsequent biological properties, diﬀer between
mycobacterial strains.
IN VIVO AND IN VITRO
IMMUNOMODULATORY PROPERTIES OF
BMV RELEASED BY MYCOBACTERIA
Mycobacteria BMV are capable to regulate both innate and
adaptative immune responses in vitro. Mouse bone marrow-
derived macrophages (BMM) stimulated with puriﬁed BCG
BMV produce IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, TNF, CXCL1 in a TLR2-
dependent way as well as MIP-1α and IL-10, independently of
TLR2 (51, 52). In addition, BMV are capable to deliver antigens
to dendritic cells leading to T cells stimulation (61). In contrast,
Mtb BMV were described as inhibiting CD4+ T cells activation
in vitro (62) through the direct delivery of LAM, which has been
previously shown to repress TCR signaling (63).
Biological properties of mycobacterial BMV have also been
evaluated in vivo. The intra-tracheal administration of BCG BMV
to mice prior to Mtb infection, leads to a local exacerbation
of the disease with an alteration of the pulmonary myeloid
populations, an increased granulomatous inﬂammation in the
lungs and higher bacterial loads in lungs and spleens (51, 60).
BMV released by the avirulent M. smegmatis strains, which
are not enriched in lipoproteins, do not induce such intense
inﬂammation. In contrast, the subcutaneous immunization of
mice with Mtb BMV induces humoral response and a strong
splenic Th1 cellular response that is directed against cell wall
and plasma membrane components of the bacillus but essentially
against lipoproteins. Finally, this immunization allowed the
control of Mtb replication in lungs, as eﬃciently as the BCG
vaccination (64). The contradiction between these two in vivo
studies regarding the beneﬁcial or deleterious impact of BMV
immunization on the infection control can be explained by
diﬀerences in immunization protocols. Notably, the vesicles
are not inoculated through the same route and the ﬁrst study
used doses of BMV 10 times higher, which may explain the
exacerbated inﬂammation.
MYCOBACTERIAL COMPONENTS
SHUTTLED BY HEV RELEASED BY
INFECTED CELLS
Exosome-Like Vesicles
Among
HEV
released
by
mycobacteria-infected
cells,
exososome-like vesicles are the most characterized category
of vesicles, at the molecular and functional levels, essentially
due to chronological reasons. The release of mycobacterial
material from the phagosome, where the bacillus resides, and its
intracellular traﬃcking within host cells was ﬁrst described by the
laboratory of D. Russell in 1994 for M. avium and later extended
to other mycobacterial species (65–69). Using global radioactive
or ﬂuorescent labeling of the surface compounds of Mtb
H37Rv, Mtb H37Ra, M. bovis BCG (BCG), or M. avium strains,
the authors described the release of mycobacterial material
from the macrophage phagosome toward other intracellular
compartments. As soon as 4 h post-infection, labeled bacterial
material is detected in the perinuclear space, the Golgi network,
and accumulate in late endosomes and lysosomes of the infected
cells, including LAMP-1 and MHC class II positive MVE
(Figure 2). Finally, as soon as 16 h post-infection, an estimated
12% of the labeled material initially associated to the bacillus
are released within 100–200 nm extracellular vesicles. These
vesicles were deﬁned at the time as being exosomes because
of their link with the MVE and because following studies
highlighted exosomal host proteins like LAMP1, LAMP2,
MHC-I, and MHC-II and tetraspanins (CD81, CD86, CD63,
and CD9) (70, 71). According to the current state of the art,
these criteria might not be suﬃcient to name these vesicles as
bona ﬁde exosomes, as stressed by the International Society of
Extracellular Vesicles (72). However, for simplicity reason, the
term “exosomes” is conserved thereafter to refer to the properties
of the vesicles that sediment at high-speed centrifugation
(100,000 g).
The mycobacterial components shuttled by these exosome-
like vesicles have been investigated through several approaches.
Immunogold electron microscopy experiments and western
blot analyses have identiﬁed the PIM2, LAM, LM, and
the LpqH (19kDa) and LprG (27kDa) lipoproteins as part
of the material associated to the membrane of MVE and
released in exosomes (65, 68). However,
14C acetate or
ﬂuorescein/biotin hydrazide-based labeling approaches globally
target a wide number of envelope components including
lipids, glycolipids, glycoproteins, lipoproteins, and lipoglycans.
Bacterial (glyco)lipids present in MVE or in exosomes released
by infected cells could not be harvested in suﬃcient quantity
at the time to undertake their structural characterization.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis Lipidome Within Vesicles
Nevertheless, their analysis by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC)—autoradiography showed the presence of molecules with
retention factors similar to the ones of trehalose dimycolate,
trehalose monomycolate, PIM2Ac2, PIM2Ac1, monoglycosylated
PGL (mycoside B), cardiolipin, and phosphatidylethanolamine
besides many unassigned components (65, 67). The release
of mycobacterial (glyco)lipids from the phagosome and their
intracellular traﬃcking was further supported by Fisher et al.,
who also highlighted that cardiolipin is processed in lyso-
cardiolipin by the lysosomal Phospholipase A2 during its
traﬃcking (73).
Proteomic analyses were later performed on exosomes
isolated from in vitro culture and from patients blood and
have identiﬁed up to 41 mycobacterial proteins including highly
immunogenic ones such as the antigen 85A, B and C, MPT64,
and ESAT-6 (74, 75). Finally, exosomes released from Mtb-
infected RAW264.7 macrophages or BMM were recently shown
to shuttle several mycobacterial transcripts (76–78).
Apoptotic Bodies and Microvesicles
The mycobacterial components of others type of HEV released by
mycobacteria-infected macrophages have not been characterized
in such details. Nevertheless, using macrophages infected by
[14C] palmitic acid and [14C] amino acids labeled-M. bovis
BCG, Schaible et al. described in 2003 by similar 2D TLC and
western blot analyses that the 19kDa lipoprotein and trehalose
dimycolate, mycoside B, lysocardiolipin, and PIM are shuttled by
extracellular vesicles (79). The authors identiﬁed these vesicles
as apoptotic bodies based on large diameter (>2 microns) and
the absence of the late endosome/lysosome marker cathepsin D.
MHC-II, CD1, and the mannose receptors were present at the
surface of these vesicles. The bacterial components shuttled by
the microvesicles released by Mtb-infected macrophages have not
yet been deciphered although mycobacterial protein antigens are
expected given the fact that microvesicles have the capacity to
activate speciﬁc-T cells as detailed later.
TRAFFICKING OF MTB ENVELOPE
COMPONENTS WITHIN BMV AND WITHIN
HEV - NOT SUCH AN OBVIOUS
CONNECTION
There is today an important body of data showing that
mycobacterial material exits the phagosome where the bacillus
resides within infected cells. However, the diﬀerent steps of
this intracellular traﬃcking are not fully dissected including
(i) the mechanisms responsible for the release/dissociation
of mycobacterial components from the bacillus and (ii) the
routes taken by these compounds and their intersection with
the biogenesis pathways of the diﬀerent extracellular vesicles
(Figure 2). Although the release of BMV may appear to be the
obvious source of mycobacterial compounds that feeds HEVs,
their connection is currently not easy to establish. First, if
the release of BMV requires bacillus viability, the detection of
labeled mycobacterial surface compounds in the MVE, from
which exosomes originate, does not (67). In addition, BMV and
HEV likely release distinct Mtb factors. Indeed, the (glyco)lipid
proﬁles of exosomes and BMV on TLC do not overlap.
Currently available data are highlighting that BMV contain
a predominance of mycobacterial plasma membrane lipids as
compared to cell wall lipids, while exosomes proﬁles show a
wider diversity of (glyco)lipids including several families of the
mycomembrane (52, 67). It is likely that parallel mechanisms of
release from the bacillus coexist. In parallel to the release of BMV,
uncovalently bound surface components might also shed from
the bacillus envelope, naturally or as the result of the envelope
degradation in the enzymatic and mildly acidic environment
in the phagosome but this still needs to be demonstrated.
Once released from the bacillus, the mechanisms by which
Mtb components leave the phagosome to intercept the HEV
biosynthesis pathways is not understood. Recycling event from
the phagosome and membrane exchange with endosomes might
contribute in addressing mycobacterial envelope components
toward the plasma membrane and endosomal compartments,
from which microvesicles and exosomes originate, respectively
(80–82). In addition, it has been described that mycobacteria are
capable to damage the phagosomal membrane, which can also
contribute to the leakage of mycobacterial molecules outside of
the phagosome (83, 84).
Therefore, BMV, exosomes, and microvesicles might shuttle
diﬀerent repertoires of Mtb immunomodulatory molecules.
In addition, vesicles composition in mycobacterial cargos is
dynamic and evolves over the course of Mtb infection. Indeed,
the capacity of exosomes, derived from cell cultures or from
biological ﬂuids, to induce cytokines/chemokines production
depends on the time they were collected post-infection (71).
In the same vein, initial work performed by the laboratory of
D. Russell described that labeled mycobacterial lipidic material
is released from the phagosome and detected in exosomes as
soon as time as 16 h post-infection but the LAM and the
LprG lipoprotein are only detected in the pellet of exosome-
like vesicles after 48 h post-infection (66, 85). The recent
work of Athman et al. also illustrated that small vesicles of
varying composition co-exist. Studying vesicles released from
RAW264.7 cells 24 h post-infection, authors described that
the pool of the so called “exosomes” sedimented at 100,000 g
and previously described as containing mycobacterial envelope
components encloses two vesicle sub-populations that can be
separated on continuous sucrose gradient, (i) vesicles carrying
the LAM and LM but devoid of ones of the exosomal markers
CD9 and CD63 and inversely (ii) vesicles bearing the CD9,
CD63, and CMH-II host proteins but devoid of LAM and
LM (52). The detection of the LAM and LM positive vesicles
was dependent on the bacillus viability. Hence, Athman et
al. proposed that the LAM and LM-containing vesicle sub-
population are BMV produced by the bacillus and subsequently
exocytosed into the extracellular environment, rather than
exosomes (Figure 2). The second LAM and LM-negative vesicles
may also correspond to a sub-population of HEV that shuttle
diﬀerent mycobacterial components. Indeed, the limits between
the main types of vesicles released by eukaryotic cells is becoming
thinner due to overlap in size, density, and even in markers
and vesicles subpopulations appeared to be more and more

diverse (59). Indeed, diﬀerent subpopulations co-purifying with
bona ﬁde exosomes have been described, including CD9−CD63−
vesicles (86).
MODULATION OF INNATE IMMUNE
RESPONSES BY HEV RELEASED BY
MYCOBACTERIA-INFECTED CELLS
The possible internalization of exosomes by neighboring non-
infected cells in vitro garnered signiﬁcant interest into the
characterization of the immunomodulatory potential of these
vesicles in the following years, in which the laboratory of J. S.
Schorey had a major contribution. Most of the studies were
performed using the so called exosomes puriﬁed from the
supernatants of in vitro cultures of monocytic cells infected
by M. avium, BCG, or H37Rv strains through diﬀerential
centrifugation, by sedimentation at 100,000 g, combined to
sucrose density gradient (70, 71, 85, 87, 88). However, exosomes
puriﬁed from mice biological ﬂuids or released by human
neutrophils (89) have also been studied. Overall, isolated from
in vitro cultures of infected cell lines or from biological ﬂuids of
infected animals, exosomes are capable to induce a general pro-
inﬂammatory response in naïve macrophages in vitro and in vivo.
Indeed, exosomes released by mice or human monocytic cell lines
infected by Mtb H37Rv or BCG induce the iNOS expression and
several cytokines and chemokines production in vitro including
TNF-α, RANTES, MIP−1α, MIP−1β, MIP−2, and IL1-Ra (68,
70, 71). The induction of TNF-α production is completely
dependent on MyD88 and partially but signiﬁcantly dependent
on TLR2 or TLR4. These properties of exosomes are likely due
to the presence of bacterial factors rather than host mediators
produced by activated macrophages because exosomes released
by macrophages activated by the LPS or infected by heat-killed
mycobacteria failed to induce the same responses (85). Similarly,
exosomes released by Mtb infected-human neutrophils contain
TLR2/6 ligands and strongly induce the production of TNF-
α, IL-6, superoxide anion and the expression of co-stimulatory
molecules (CD80, CD86) by autologous macrophages (89). Like
cell culture–derived vesicles, exosomes isolated from biological
ﬂuids (BALF or the serum of BCG-infected mice) promote a
pro-inﬂammatory response of BMM such as the production of
cytokines and chemokines, including TNF-α, RANTES MIP−1β,
MIP−2, IL1-Ra, and IL-27 (71, 85). Exosomes derived from
Mtb-infected cells or from infected mice serum also stimulate
inﬂammation of endothelial cells by increasing monolayers
permeability and inducing the expression of TLR2, VCAM1,
and CCL2 (90). Exosome-induced pro-inﬂammatory response
has also been described in vivo. Indeed, the intranasal injection
of exosomes released by H37Rv- or BCG-infected THP-1 cells
leads to a robust production of IL-12p40 and TNF-α and the
increase of neutrophils in the BALF and lungs of BALB/c mice,
respectively (71, 85). The treatment of infected mice with a
combination of moxiﬂoxacin and vesicles released by H37Rv-
infected BMM also leads to higher serum levels of TNF-α, IL1-β
and IFN-β, the later one being dependent on the MAVS RNA-
sensing pathway.
Exosomes containing Mtb material also modulate the
microbicidal potential of infected-cells and have a positive eﬀect
on the overall control of the infection. Exosomes released by Mtb-
infected BMM or neutrophils are capable to promote autophagy,
which is a key mechanism of intracellular pathogen clearance (77,
89). Indeed, treatment of BMM with a combination of IFN-γ and
Mtb-infected cell exosomes leads to an increased colocalisation
of bacteria with LC3 or LAMP-1 positive compartments,
in a RIGI/MAVS RNA sensing pathway dependent manner
(77). The induction of Mtb-containing phagosome maturation
contributes, in part, to the reduced intracellular survival of
Mtb observed when host cells are treated by Mtb-infected cell
exosomes (77, 89).
The functional characterization of microvesicles released by
Mtb-infected cells highlighted in vitro and in vivo similar
immunomodulatory properties as for exosomes, including
enhanced cytokines, and chemokines production, permeability
of epithelial monolayers and neutrophils and dendritic cells
recruitment (91).
HEV RELEASED BY
MYCOBACTERIA-INFECTED CELLS
MODULATE ADAPTATIVE IMMUNITY
HEV released by Mtb-infected cells have been shown to modulate
adaptative immune response in 2 ways, by regulating (i)
the activation of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and (ii) the
stimulation of T cells.
It has been reported that exosomes released by Mtb-
infected macrophages display immunosuppressive properties
on the activation of antigen-presenting cells. Indeed, they
suppress the IFN-γ mediated activation of naïve BMM by
inhibiting the expression of MHC class II and CD64 in a
TLR2- and MyD88-dependent way (88). However, exosomes
containing Mtb components promote the activation of antigen-
speciﬁc MHC-restricted CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vitro
and in vivo (87, 92, 93). Microvesicles derived from Mtb-
infected BBM are also capable to stimulate Ag85 speciﬁc-T
cells (93). Interestingly, dendritic cell-derived exosomes bearing
MHC and co-stimulatory molecules as well as MHC-II positive
microvesicles are capable of direct in vitro activation of T cells in
absence of APC (87, 92, 93). Finally, the intranasal administration
of exosomes released from macrophages treated with BCG
culture ﬁltrate proteins (CFP) have been shown to prime a
protective immune response and to boost a prior vaccination in
mice, with a protecting eﬀect that is at least as good as the BCG
vaccine (94).
Activation of MHC- and CD1 (a,b and c)-restricted T cells
was also demonstrated to be mediated by the apoptotic bodies
released by Mtb-infected macrophages in vitro and in vivo (79,
95). However, it is to note that if the exosome and microvesicle
release is enhanced during mycobacterial infection (85, 93) it
has been described that Mtb has developed strategies to evade
apoptosis (96, 97). Finally, if exosomes shuttle antigens of CD1-
restricted T cells such as PIM, their capacity to activate CD1-
restricted T cells has not been tested so far.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis Lipidome Within Vesicles
While Mtb is sequestered in the phagosome of host
macrophages and inhibits its maturation, it isolates itself from the
antigen processing and presentation pathways necessary for the
activation of T cells, which play a key role in infection control. By
shuttling mycobacterial factors outside of the disabled infected
cells, the vesicle release therefore provides an alternative pathway
to activate MHC- and likely CD1-restricted T cells by uninfected
bystander APC, also called cross-presentation.
BIOLOGICAL RELEVANCE AND BENEFITS
OF MTB ENVELOPE COMPONENTS
RELEASE WITHIN VESICLES FOR THE
CONTROL OF MTB INFECTION
There is no longer any doubt that during infection, cytosolic
and envelope components of Mtb travel within BMV and HEV
between the bacillus, the infected cells and the uninfected
bystander cells, impacting both the innate and adaptive immune
responses. However, it is still diﬃcult to say whether the release
of mycobacterial compounds through vesiculogenesis beneﬁts
the host or the bacillus because several important questions
remain opened. The truth is probably halfway since vesicles have
shown properties that go both ways. If the protective eﬀect of
immunization assays performed with puriﬁed BMV or HEV are
supporting beneﬁcial eﬀects of vesicles release, these assays do
not reﬂect the heterogeneity of vesicles encountered during Mtb
infection, which is not fully deciphered and turns out to be more
and more complex according to recent studies (52).
One way to evaluate the impact of a biological process is to
repress it. However, it would be necessary to characterize the
diﬀerent populations of released vesicles and to gain knowledge
of their biosynthetic pathways. If our understanding of the
vesiculogenesis mechanisms in Mtb is at its premise, the
biogenesis pathways of eukaryotic vesicles were revealed to be
diverse and complex (57). For instance, exosome biogenesis and
release utilize several machineries depending on cell type or
physiological status. In addition, repressing vesiculogenesis is a
debatable strategy because vesiculogenesis shares pathways with
essential cellular processes like cellular membrane traﬃcking
and secretion. Hence, its repression might lead to additional
adverse eﬀects on the overall physiology of the cell. Nevertheless,
Smith et al. have tested such approach by studying the
traﬃcking of mycobacterial peptide antigens within exosomes
and subsequent T cells activation, in mice that are deﬁcient
in Rab27a (92), a GTPase involved in the MVE docking to
the plasma membrane during exosomes release (98). Authors
observed in this genetic background a diminished traﬃcking
of extracellular mycobacterial proteins, a reduced concentration
of exosomes in mice serum and a reduced T cell activation
that is associated to an increase bacterial burden. This study
further supports the beneﬁcial eﬀect of exosomes release in
the control of Mtb infection. Similarly, future investigation of
the phenotype of Mtb strains deﬁcient for the IniA and IniC
dynamins recently identiﬁed as involved in BMV biogenesis
(preprint article of Gupta et al.) (56) would provide insights into
the eﬀect of BMV release on bacterial recognition vs. evasion and
whether dynamin-like proteins can be candidate target for the
development of new anti-TB therapeutic strategies.
POTENTIAL OF EXTRACELLULAR
VESICLES AS ANTI-TB VACCINE AND
BIOMARKERS
Extracellular vesicles content reﬂects the physiological state of
the releasing cells by shuttling microbial PAMPs or tumor
antigens. From microbes or eukaryotic cells, released vesicles
detected in biological ﬂuids, and capable to modulate immune
responses, have been proposed as platforms for the development
of diagnostic or vaccine tools in diﬀerent ﬁelds (99, 100). Same
perspectives can be transposed in the Tuberculosis ﬁeld.
Indeed, exosomes are detected in human and mice biological
ﬂuids during mycobacterial infection, more than 100 days
post infection (101). Their abundance is shown to correlate
with bacterial burden and proteomic analyses have identiﬁed
mycobacterial protein components that are consistently detected
in patients’ serum (75). Therefore, detection of exosomal
mycobacterial proteins show great promise for the development
of diagnostic test, which could be further reinforced by the
detection of mycobacterial envelope components and transcript
cargos as well as host factors.
Given their adjuvant and antigenic properties described
above, BMV and exosomes may also appear as interesting vaccine
candidates. However, moving from animal immunization assays
to clinical trials still requires further characterization of the
diﬀerent vesicles subpopulations and of their composition. In
particular, the current characterization of the exosomes and
BMV content in Mtb envelope compounds remains based on
conventional biochemical approaches of moderate sensitivity.
The use of latest-generation methods would make possible to
establish a ﬁner composition of these vesicles especially regarding
(glyco)lipids described as virulence factors, which hold risks of
provoking toxic adverse eﬀects.
Lastly, besides incomplete molecular characterization and
the potential problem of non-autologous antigens for HEV, the
use of native vesicles in clinical trials might face the technical
challenge of the reproducibility of vesicles preparations as
previously reported (64). Indeed, previous studies have shown
that their composition in mycobacterial components and in
protein involved in antigen presentation such as MHC molecules,
depend on the releasing-cell type, the time of collection related
to infection or the purity of vesicles, which are protocol-
and laboratory-dependent.
Nevertheless, knowledge coming from the molecular and
functional characterization of BMV and HEV populations
can
inspire
the

of

(102). Vesicle-based delivery system of bioactive molecules
present several advantages: (i) to allow the simultaneous

delivery of molecules of various nature in a concentrated
and protective way, (ii) to have the capability to overcome
natural barriers, (iii) to display natural cell-targeting abilities,
(iv) to provide a physiological membrane environment that
is important for membrane protein stability as well as for
the biological activities of Mtb (glyco)lipids. Indeed, it has
been described that in vitro immunomodulatory properties
of Mtb (glyco)lipids diﬀer with the way they are formulated.
For instance, diﬀerences in the induction of cytokines release
have been observed whether the lipids are resuspended in
solution or coated on beads of diﬀerent size (35, 103). Such
diﬀerences might also exist when shuttled within diﬀerent
vesicle sub-populations.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Our knowledge of the released populations of vesicles and
their immunomodulatory properties during Mtb infection
has enormously progressed over the last 15 years. Vesicles
study has highlighted the large diﬀusion, beyond the infected
cell, of Mtb envelope components already known to have
important
immunomodulatory
properties.
Among
various
other cargos, Mtb envelope lipoproteins, lipoglycans, and
(glyco)lipids certainly contribute to vesicles immunomodulatory
properties in particular in the regulation to the inﬂammation
process. However, direct connections need to be demonstrated,
which could be achieved by analyzing the properties of
vesicles released during infection by biosynthesis mutant Mtb
strains (if available).
Further, progress in our understanding of the role of, both,
vesicles and immunomodulatory components of Mtb envelope,
in host-pathogen interactions and in the outcome of the infection
will require a better characterization of (i) the diversity of the
subpopulations of released HEV, (ii) the content of BMV and
HEV in immunomodulatory mycobacterial (glyco)lipids and
(iii) the variation of vesicles composition depending on the
encountered mycobacteria strains and on the releasing-cell type.
It would also be of great relevance to perform detailed molecular
investigations on vesicles that better reﬂect the subpopulations
encountered in vivo, working with biological ﬂuids, which is
today conceivable thanks to the high sensitivity of all the “omic”
methodologies. In addition, means to regulate the biogenesis of
BMV and HEV will allow determining the overall beneﬁcial or
deleterious eﬀect of vesicles release during Mtb infection.
Finally, research on vesicles released during tuberculosis
infection will likely inspire future development of new diagnostic
tools and cell-free vesicle/liposome-based vaccine strategies.
