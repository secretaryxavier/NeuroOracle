Mycobacterium tuberculosis releases membrane vesicles packed with molecules that can modulate the immune response. Be-
cause environmental conditions often inﬂuence the production and content of bacterial vesicles, this study examined M. tuber-
culosis microvesicles released under iron limitation, a common condition faced by pathogens inside the host. The ﬁndings indi-
cate that M. tuberculosis increases microvesicle production in response to iron restriction and that these microvesicles contain
mycobactin, which can serve as an iron donor and supports replication of iron-starved mycobacteria. Consequently, the results
revealed a role of microvesicles in iron acquisition in M. tuberculosis, which can be critical for survival in the host.
T
he production of extracellular vesicles and vesicle-mediated
communication is evolutionarily conserved among unicellu-
lar and multicellular organisms. Bacteria release membrane vesi-
cles (MVs) containing proteins, genetic material, and lipids as a
way to interact with prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells in their en-
vironment. Mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
the causative agent of tuberculosis, release MVs in culture, in mac-
rophages, and in the lungs of infected mice (1). MVs released by
M. tuberculosis in culture are packed with immunologically active
molecules that can modulate the immune response to the beneﬁt
of the bacterium (1). MV production by M. tuberculosis has re-
cently been shown to be under genetic control (2).
Environmental factors, including those encountered by patho-
gens during infection, often inﬂuence the production and compo-
sition of outer membrane vesicles released by Gram-negative bac-
teria (3). Iron limitation is a well-recognized hallmark of the host
environment. Due to its poor solubility in water in the presence of
oxygen and at neutral pH, ferric iron is not found free but rather is
sequestered in complexes with host iron binding proteins, such as
transferrin, lactoferrin, and ferritin (4). For this reason, and be-
cause iron is essential for cell vitality, high-afﬁnity iron acquisition
systems are critical for pathogens to proliferate during infection.
In fact, competition for iron deeply inﬂuences host-pathogen in-
teractions. On one hand, rapid withdrawal of accessible iron is the
most prominent example of “nutritional immunity”; on the other
hand, iron deﬁciency in the host is a signal for pathogens to induce
the expression of toxins and other virulence factors in conjunction
with iron acquisition systems (5). To obtain iron, M. tuberculosis
synthesizes and secretes high-afﬁnity iron chelators or sidero-
phores named mycobactins, which are essential for virulence (6,
7). Two forms of mycobactins are produced: carboxymycobactin,
an amphiphilic molecule that is secreted into the medium, and
mycobactin, a lipophilic molecule that remains cell associated (8).
These two siderophores share a core but differ mainly in the length
of an alkyl substitution; carboxymycobactin has a short one (2 to 9
carbons), whereas a long one (10 to 21 carbons) characterizes
mycobactin. Carboxymycobactin effectively sequesters ferric iron
from the environment and transfers it to mycobactin (9) or brings
it into the cell via the iron-regulated transporter IrtAB (10, 11).
The fate of iron bound by mycobactin, the precise location of this
siderophore on the cell surface, and its overall contribution to iron
uptake remain unclear.
In this work, we examined how iron limitation, such as that
encountered by M. tuberculosis in the host, affects M. tuberculosis
MV production. Our results show that iron deﬁciency stimulates
MV release and inﬂuences the lipid content of MVs, suggesting
potential complex patterns of MV-mediated communication
modulated by the host environment. Signiﬁcantly, we report that
MVs produced during iron limitation can deliver iron and sup-
port proliferation of iron-deﬁcient bacteria. The results unveiled a
function for mycobactin and a novel way by which M. tuberculosis
could overcome iron restriction and enhance its capacity to persist
in the host.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Media and bacterial cultures. M. tuberculosis strains were maintained in
7H10 agar (Difco) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80,
0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 0.2% dextrose, and 0.085% NaCl
(ADN). Minimal medium (MM) was used to grow M. tuberculosis under
iron-deﬁned conditions. MM contains 0.5% (wt/vol) asparagine, 0.5%
(wt/vol) KH2PO4, 0.2% glycerol, 10% ADN, and 0.05% Tyloxapol or
Tween 80, with the pH adjusted to 6.8. To lower the trace metal contam-
ination, the medium was treated with Chelex-100 (Bio-Rad) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Chelex was removed by ﬁltration, and
then the medium was supplemented with 0.5 mg ZnCl2/liter, 0.1 mg/liter
MnSO4, 40 mg/liter MgSO4, and 50 mg/liter ferric chloride. Low-iron
minimal medium (LIMM) was supplemented with all metals except iron.
This medium contains less than 2 M residual iron, as determined by
atomic absorption spectroscopy.
The siderophore-deﬁcient mbtB mutant strain (ST142) provided by
Cliff Barry (6) and the ideR mutant (ST22) (12) were grown in the pres-
ence of hygromycin (Hyg), 100 g/ml, and kanamycin (Kan), 10 g/ml,
respectively.
When indicated, the iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO) (Sigma) was
added at a ﬁnal concentration of 50 M.

MV preparation. MVs were isolated as described previously (1).
Brieﬂy, 1,000 ml-cultures were centrifuged (3,450  g for 15 min, 4°C),
and the supernatants were ﬁltered (0.45 m; Millipore, Billerica, MA) and
concentrated approximately 20-fold using an Amicon (Millipore) ultra-
ﬁltration system with a 100-kDa exclusion ﬁlter. Protein and other mate-
rial aggregates formed during concentration were removed by centrifug-
ing them at 15,000  g (15 min, 4°C). MVs were then pelleted by
centrifugation at 100,000  g for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in
1 ml of 10 mM HEPES–0.15 M NaCl and mixed with 2 ml of Optiprep
solution (Sigma) in 10 mM HEPES and 0.15 M NaCl (yielding a ﬁnal
Optiprep concentration of 35% [wt/vol]). The MV suspension was then
overlaidwithaseriesofOptiprepgradientlayerswithconcentrationsranging
from 30 to 5% (wt/vol). The gradients were centrifuged (100,000  g, 16 h),
and 1-ml fractions were removed from the top. The fractions were then
dialyzed separately in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight, and
MVs were recovered again by sedimentation at 100,000  g for 1 h. Fi-
nally, the vesicles were suspended in PBS. The MV amount was deter-
mined based on protein concentration, which was measured using the
Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad).
Dynamic light scattering. The average hydrodynamic radius (Rh) of
vesicle samples was determined by dynamic light scattering using a 90
Plus Particle Sizing analyzer (Brookhaven Instruments Corp). The av-
erage Rh was calculated from 10 individual measurements. MV solu-
tions were adjusted to a concentration of 0.1 mg ml1 in PBS in a ﬁnal
volume of 100 l.
MV labeling. To study MV production, 10 ml of MM or LIMM cul-
tures was inoculated with M. tuberculosis. Cultures were grown to reach
stationary phase and then diluted (1:100) in fresh MM or LIMM supple-
mented with 1 Ci ml1 [1,2-14C]acetate (50 to 62 mCi mmol1;
Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA). Cultures were grown at 37°C for up to
12 days. Growth was monitored based on increase in the optical density
(OD) at 550 nm. At different time intervals, the cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 4,000  g for 10 min. The supernatants were ﬁltered
(0.45 m) and ultracentrifuged (60,000 g for 1 h). The MV-containing
pellets were resuspended in PBS, and radioactivity was measured in a
scintillation counter.
Growth assays. Frozen stocks of mycobacterial strains were inocu-
lated onto 7H10 agar plates. An aliquot was taken to inoculate MM or
LIMM to an initial OD at 540 nm of 0.05. The cultures were incubated at
37°C with agitation. The siderophore mutant (ST142) was preincubated
in LIMM for 24 h before incubation with MVs (1 to 3 g/ml). Cell growth
was monitored by measuring the OD at 540 nm.
Electron microscopy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was
used to analyze the morphology and integrity of extracellular vesicles iso-
lated from culture supernatants as well as mycobacterial cells to visualize
vesicle release events. MVs were ﬁxed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M
cacodylate at room temperature for 2 h and then incubated overnight in
4% formaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde, and 0.1% PBS. Fixed samples were
stained for 90 min in 2% osmium tetroxide and then serially dehydrated
in ethanol and embedded in Spurr’s epoxy resin. Thin sections were ob-
tained on an Ultracut UCT ultramicrotome (Reichert) and stained with
0.5% uranyl acetate and 0.5% lead citrate (Reichart, Depew, NY). Samples
were observed in a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope oper-
ating at 80 kV. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), cells were ﬁxed
with 2.5% glutaraldehyde, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, 0.2 M sucrose, and 5
mM MgCl2 (pH 7.4) and dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol
solutions. Critical point drying was assessed using liquid carbon dioxide
in a Tousimis Samdri 795 critical point drier (Rockville, MD). Sputter was
coated with gold-palladium in a Vacuum Desk-2 sputter coater (Denton,
Cherry Hill, NJ). Samples were examined in a Zeiss Supra ﬁeld emission
scanning electron microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC North Amer-
ica), using an accelerating voltage of 5 kV. MV size distribution was cal-
culated by measuring the diameter of isolated MV on EM pictures using
the program ImageJ (U.S. National Institutes of Health [http://imagej.nih
.gov/ij/index.html]).
UPLC-MS analysis of membrane vesicle lipid constituents. Low-
and high-iron vesicles were puriﬁed, their lipids were extracted with chlo-
roform-methanol (2/1, vol/vol; 3 ml) overnight at room temperature and
centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatants were removed
and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. Analysis was performed as
published previously with minor modiﬁcations (13). Lipid extracts were
dissolved in isopropanol-acetonitrile-water (2:1:1, vol/vol/vol; 0.75 ml). A
Waters Acquity ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) system
coupled to a Waters Synapt G2 quadrupole-time of ﬂight hybrid mass
spectrometer (MS) was used to separate and detect lipids using the
method detailed in a Waters Application Note (14).
A C18 ethylene bridge hybrid (EBH) column, 1.7 m (2.1 by 50 mm),
was used instead of a C18 charged surface hybrid column.
The column was heated to 55°C and eluted at 0.4 ml/min with mobile
phase A, acetonitrile-water (60:40, vol/vol), and mobile phase B, isopro-
panol-acetonitrile (90:10, vol/vol), both containing 10 mM ammonium
formate and 0.1% formic acid. The gradient began at 40% B and was
ramped to 43% B at 2 min, 50% B at 2.1 min, 54% B at 12 min, 70% B at
12.1 min, 99% B at 18 min, and then back to 40% B at 18.1 min until the
end of the run at 20 min. The mass spectrometer was operated in positive-
ion resolution mode with electrospray ionization source conditions: cap-
illary voltage, 2 kV; cone voltage, 30 V; desolvation gas temperature,
550°C; ﬂow, 900 liter/h; source temperature, 120°C. Mass spectra were
acquired in MSE centroid mode over the range 100 to 3,000 m/z. Scan time
was 0.5 s, and 0.2 ng/l leucine enkephalin was used for lock mass and
detected at 556.2771 m/z.
Total ion chromatograms of three biological replicates of each sample
type were aligned in Waters Masslynx software, and markers of exact
mass-retention time pairs were extracted with intensities normalized to
the total ion current. Waters/Umetrics Extended Statistics software was
used to generate an orthogonal projections to latent structures discrimi-
nant analysis (OPLS-DA) model to determine the most differentially
abundant lipid species between samples. Differentially abundant lipids
were identiﬁed using the Mycomass database (15, 16) (see http://www
.brighamandwomens.org/research/depts/medicine/rheumatology/labs
/moody/default.aspx) and the Mtb LipidDB (17) (see http://www.mrl
.colostate.edu).
RESULTS
Release of MVs by M. tuberculosis under iron-limiting condi-
tions. To examine the inﬂuence of iron limitation in M. tubercu-
losis vesicle production, MVs were isolated from the culture su-
pernatants of M. tuberculosis grown in low (LIMM) or high-iron
medium (MM) as previously described (1). Transmission electron
microscopic (TEM) analysis of vesicle pellets revealed intact
spherical vesicles, with diameters ranging from 60 to 300 nm in
low- and high-iron culture supernatants (Fig. 1). Samples were
also analyzed by dynamic light scattering to get a size distribution
of the vesicles in their native state. The average diameters ( stan-
dard deviation) of the vesicles measured by laser diffraction were
181.1  14.1 nm and 177  22.4 nm for MM- and LIMM-isolated
MVs, respectively. Detailed observation of the bacteria, however,
indicated enhanced vesiculation in M. tuberculosis cultured in
LIMM (Fig. 2), suggesting that iron limitation stimulated vesicle
generation. To conﬁrm this, we monitored vesicle production in
cells that were metabolically labeled with [C14]acetate (as de-
scribed in Materials and Methods) and assessed MV production
based on the amount of radioactivity incorporated in the MV-
containing supernatant. Radioactivity incorporated into vesicles
generated in LIMM was considerably greater than in those pre-
pared from cells grown in MM. Since the sizes of MVs released in
MM and LIMM were similar, this result indicates increased MV

production by M. tuberculosis in response to iron limitation, in
agreement with the microscopic observations.
MV lipid content. M. tuberculosis synthesizes mycobactins
when facing low-iron conditions. Given our ﬁnding that iron lim-
itation increased the release of MVs, we investigated whether MVs
released under iron limitation contained mycobactin. Conse-
quently, we analyzed the lipid content of MVs released in low- and
high-iron medium by UPLC-MS. The results of these analyses
demonstrated that LIMM MVs were enriched in Fe-loaded myco-
bactin (Fig. 3; also see Table 1 posted at http://www.phri.org
/research/pdf/Suppl_Mat_Prados-Rosales_JB.pdf), whereas the
mycobactin precursor dideoxymycobactin, which has low iron
binding capacity, accounted for most of the siderophore found in
MM MVs. This result suggests induced maturation of mycobactin
under iron limitation. As mentioned before, the precise location
of mycobactin in the cell is not known with certainty. Finding
mycobactin associated with MVs supports the conclusions of early
microscopic analysis that localized this siderophore in or in very
close proximity to the plasma membrane (18). Regarding other
lipids, LIMM MVs were enriched in diacyl and triacyl glycerides as
well as phosphatidylethanolamines, whereas they were slightly de-
pleted in diacyl trehaloses compared to MM MVs (see Fig. 1
posted at http://www.phri.org/research/pdf/Suppl_Mat_Prados
-Rosales_JB.pdf).
MVs as iron transporters. The presence of iron-loaded myco-
bactin in LIMM MV and the enhanced vesicle generation under
iron limitation lead us to hypothesize that M. tuberculosis can
transport iron via MVs. To test this possibility, we examined
whether MVs were active as iron delivery vehicles. For this pur-
pose, we used an mbtB mutant (ST142) that cannot synthesize
siderophores and consequently does not multiply in low-iron me-
dium unless a suitable source of iron such as Fe3-siderophore is
supplied exogenously (19). Addition of MVs puriﬁed from H37Rv
LIMM cultures restored growth of ST142 in low-iron medium. In
contrast, MVs recovered from MM H37Rv cultures failed to re-
store the growth of this strain (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate
that MVs produced by M. tuberculosis under iron limitation could
serve as iron donors and support the idea that mycobactin synthe-
sized under iron limitation and packed into MVs can bind iron
and provide it to other bacilli. To further investigate the role of
mycobactin as the iron carrier in the vesicles, we recovered MVs
from an ideR mutant strain (ST22). IdeR represses transcription
of mbt genes in the presence of iron and thereby suppresses sid-
erophore synthesis under iron sufﬁciency. As a consequence of the
ideR mutation, ST22 produces mycobactin even when cultured in
high-iron medium (12). In contrast to MVs produced by wild-
type M. tuberculosis, the vesicles produced by ST22 in high-iron
medium supported the growth of iron-deprived ST142 (Fig. 4).
This result links mycobactin production to the iron-donating ac-
tivity of the vesicles. Moreover, vesicles isolated from the sidero-
phore mutant had no ability to serve as iron donors (Fig. 5), con-
ﬁrming that mycobactin is required to transport iron in MVs.
We next examined whether MV utilization as an iron source
was restricted to the siderophore mutant or whether a wild-type
siderophore-producing mycobacterium could also beneﬁt from
iron in MVs. For this purpose, it was necessary to generate condi-
tions in which even a siderophore-producing mycobacterium
would experience iron deﬁciency. To achieve this, H37Rv was iron
depleted by sequential passages in LIMM and then the iron chela-
tor DFO was added to diluted cultures. DFO does not permeate
the cells, is not utilized by M. tuberculosis as an iron donor, and
effectively competes with carboxymycobactin for iron, which re-
sults in inhibition of M. tuberculosis growth in LIMM (Fig. 6). We
then tested whether LIMM MVs produced by H37Rv could sup-
press the iron deﬁciency generated by DFO. Figure 6 shows that
LIMM MVs efﬁciently delivered iron to wild-type M. tuberculosis,
allowing proliferation under iron deprivation.
Taken together, the results presented here show that iron lim-
itation prompts M. tuberculosis to release vesicles that are packed
with mycobactin and capable of assisting other mycobacteria to
overcome iron deﬁciency.
DISCUSSION
Studies of MVs produced by diverse bacteria indicate a common
function: bacteria release vesicles to interact with prokaryotic and
eukaryotic cells in their environment. Pathogens frequently re-
lease vesicles containing toxins, adhesins, immunomodulatory
molecules, and other effectors that allow them to manipulate
host-pathogen interactions to their own beneﬁt. Bacteria also em-
ploy MVs for collaborative as well as competitive interactions with
other bacteria. For instance, vesicle fusion can deliver bacterioly-
sins to eliminate competitors (20), transfer antibiotic-resistance
enzymes to siblings (21), or mediate coaggregation in drug-toler-
ant bioﬁlms (22). Previously, we demonstrated that M. tuberculo-
sis has also adopted this secretory pathway for exporting mole-
cules that can modulate the immune response. In this study, we
showed that under iron limitation, M. tuberculosis also uses MVs
to export concentrated mycobactin and enhance iron acquisition
capacity.
Studies in Escherichia coli have shown that approximately 0.2%
to 0.5% of outer membrane and periplasmic proteins are packed
in vesicles (23). Considering that this is an energy-consuming
process, it is likely that bacteria produce vesicles in a regulated

fashion in response to external and/or internal signals. Indeed,
numerous examples support this hypothesis. Lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) serotype switching, oxygen stress, and antibiotics are some
of the factors that inﬂuence vesicle production and content in
Gram-negative bacteria (24–26). Pathogenic bacteria generally
produce more vesicles than their nonpathogenic counterparts (27,
28), which is consistent with the idea that vesicle production may
be part of the adaptive response that promotes dissemination of
virulence factors and propagation in the host.
Iron availability is a critical factor that affects all bacteria living
within a host. Because basic cellular metabolic activities require
iron, this metal is absolutely essential. However, due to its poor
solubility and potential toxicity under aerobic conditions, free
iron is not available in the host. Successful pathogens must be able
to obtain iron and to adapt their metabolism according to iron
availability. However, the inﬂuence of iron availability in patho-
genic bacterial MV production has not been extensively exam-
ined. In one study, Helicobacter pylori vesicles produced in low-
iron medium were found to contain reduced VacA toxin levels
and increased concentrations of vesicle-associated proteases, al-
though the production of MVs was not affected (29).
In this work, we initiated the characterization of M. tuberculosis
MV production under iron limitation. An increase in vesicle pro-
duction was detected when M. tuberculosis was cultured under
iron deﬁciency, indicating that a higher rate of vesicle production
is part of the strong response of M. tuberculosis to iron restriction.
It is possible that reduced iron availability is a trigger for MV
production in other bacteria as well. E. coli, Vibrio cholerae, and
Brucella melitensis each manifest maximal production of vesicles
at the end of log phase, a time that may coincide with decreased
iron available in the medium (23, 30, 31).
Production and secretion of soluble siderophores are common

to many microorganisms. However, production of a cell-associ-
ated siderophore is restricted mainly to mycobacterial and Nocar-
dia species, suggesting an important role for this type of sidero-
phore in these microorganisms. Mycobactin can bind iron
transferred from carboxymycobactin or other iron chelators able
to penetrate the cell envelope but is not required for utilization of
Fe3-carboxymycobactin (19). In the absence of mutants lacking
only mycobactin and not carboxymycobactin, it is not possible to
determine the precise contribution of mycobactin to iron acqui-
sition. Nevertheless, mycobactin was hypothesized to function as
a temporary iron storage molecule (8), and liposomes packed with
mycobactin have been shown to deliver iron when added to M.
tuberculosis-infected macrophages (32). Our results suggest a very
important role for mycobactin that makes use of its unique prop-
erties, i.e., high afﬁnity for iron and hydrophobicity. Mycobactin
synthesized during iron limitation reaches high local concentra-
tions, and being in close proximity or associated with the cell
membrane makes it well suited for incorporation into the MVs.
Once secreted as part of the vesicle, mycobactin has access to ex-
tracellular iron and can deliver it via the MVs to the bacterium that
released the vesicles or to its neighbors. MV-mediated iron acqui-
sition may be critical during infection, especially in the context of
FIG 3 MV-associated siderophores. (A) Relative abundance of the MV-associated siderophores with differences between LIMM MVs and MM MVs, according

intense iron deprivation, as it may take place in the granuloma
where activated macrophages restrict bacterial access to iron and
free iron is not available. In addition, immune cells release sidero-
calin, which binds carboxymycobactin (33) and thereby compro-
mises its role in iron acquisition. It is possible that vesicular my-
cobactin is not accessible to siderocalin. If that were the case, by
“disguising” mycobactin in the MVs, M. tuberculosis would be able
to overcome the interference of siderocalin with iron acquisition.
Although we focused here on the presence of Fe-mycobactin in
low-iron-medium-produced MVs, it is worth noting that iron
availability also inﬂuenced the content of other lipids in the MVs
such as triacyl glycerols and diacyl trehaloses, which may be rele-
vant for host-pathogen interactions. The lipid content of MVs
from both MM and LIMM cultures was consistent with their
plasma membrane origin, but surprisingly, lipids from the outer
membrane (mycomembrane) were not detected in MVs re-
gardless of the concentration of iron in the medium. At this
time we have no explanation for this observation and recognize
the need for additional studies to address the mechanism of
vesicle synthesis.
The presence of dideoxymycobactins in MM-derived vesicles
suggests that the cell maintains mycobactin precursors even under
iron sufﬁciency and that maturation is induced under iron deﬁ-
ciency. This may serve to increase the efﬁcacy of siderophore pro-
duction during iron limitation. Interestingly, dideoxymycobac-
tins are antigens presented by CD1 molecules (34). Considering
the possibility that bacterial MVs may deliver their cargo to host
cells as well as to other bacteria, antigen-presenting cells could
obtain and present MV-derived antigens. Therefore, the antigenic
content of MVs could be a relevant determinant for stimulation of
the immune system. This may have implications in the design of
ways to deliver antigenic molecules, which when presented to T
cells induce a protective immune response. Additionally, it is
tempting to speculate that bacteria residing in different microen-
vironments could release MVs whose content could transmit a
signal when taken up by other bacteria. Thus, MV release could
potentially be a way by which mycobacteria communicate.
In summary, this study unveiled the inﬂuence of iron availabil-
ity on the production and content of M. tuberculosis MVs and
revealed the ability of MVs to transport the essential nutrient (Fe).
This constitutes the ﬁrst demonstration of a role for M. tubercu-
losis MVs that can beneﬁt the local community, potentially con-
tributing to the survival and persistence of this pathogen in the
host.

FIG 5 Siderophore mutant MVs do not donate iron. The siderophore synthe-
sis mutant (ST142) was cultured in LIMM () or LIMM with MVs isolated
form H37Rv grown in low iron () or MVs isolated from ST142 cultured in
MM (Œ). Error bars represent standard deviations from the means of biolog-
ical triplicates.
FIG 6 Wild-type, iron-deﬁcient mycobacteria can utilize iron from MVs.
H37Rv was cultured in LIMM in the presence of DFO (Œ) or in the same
medium supplemented with LIMM H37Rv derived MVs (). Shown are the
results from one representative experiment. The experiment was repeated
twice with similar results.
