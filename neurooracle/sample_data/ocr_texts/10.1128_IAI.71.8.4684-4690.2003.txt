Lipids that are found only in the cell envelope of pathogenic mycobacteria, such as those containing multiple
methyl-branched fatty acids, have long been thought to play a role in pathogenesis. Among these complex
lipids, sulfolipids have been the most extensively studied over the last 50 years. The numerous biological effects
exhibited by puriﬁed sulfolipids on phagocytic cells led to the idea that these molecules are probably important
virulence factors facilitating the intracellular survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, deﬁnitive evi-
dence to support this concept has been lacking. The recent construction of an isogenic sulfolipid-deﬁcient
mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Sirakova et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:16833–16839, 2001) has for the ﬁrst time
provided the opportunity to directly assess the contribution of these complex lipids to pathogenesis. In the
present study, we show that against all expectations, sulfolipid deﬁciency does not signiﬁcantly affect the
replication, persistence, and pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in mice and guinea pigs or in cultured
macrophages.
Tuberculosis remains a major health problem worldwide
(26). Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of this
disease in humans, has the capacity to infect, replicate in, and
persist inside host macrophages. The virulence factors en-
abling M. tuberculosis to escape the bactericidal mechanisms of
these cells, notably by blocking phagosome-lysosome fusion,
are essentially unknown (6). A study conducted some 55 years
ago by Middlebrook and collaborators (21) recognized that the
curious ability of the tubercle bacillus to grow in culture as
serpentine cords was relatively restricted to virulent strains.
Dubos and Middlebrook (7) also observed that the virulent
cord-forming strains invariably absorbed the cationic dye neu-
tral red, while most attenuated strains of M. tuberculosis and
saprophytic mycobacteria did not.
In a search for the component of virulent mycobacteria that
induced uptake of the dye, Middlebrook and coworkers (20)
isolated sulfolipids. This family of molecules is composed of
sulfated trehalose esters acylated with three to four acyl groups
consisting of one short saturated fatty acid (palmitic acid or
stearic acid) and different combinations of long-chain multiple
methyl-branched fatty acids (the phthioceranic and hydroxyph-
thioceranic acids) (for a review, see references 9 and 11).
Consistent with their suspected role in virulence, sulfolipids
are found only in the human pathogen M. tuberculosis (9).
Interestingly, sulfolipids are present in the virulent laboratory
strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv but absent from the avirulent
strain M. tuberculosis H37Ra (20).
Examination of some 60 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis
from different geographical origins suggested a highly signiﬁ-
cant statistical correlation between the production of sulfolip-
ids in culture and the rank order of virulence for the guinea pig
(8, 12, 15, 18). The most virulent strains were generally proliﬁc
producers of sulfolipids, whereas attenuated strains were no-
tably deﬁcient in sulfolipid production. However, the observa-
tion that some attenuated strains were proﬁcient in sulfolipid
synthesis and that a few virulent strains were devoid of these
molecules led the authors to the careful conclusion that the
presence of sulfolipids may not be a sufﬁcient requirement for
the expression of virulence (8, 12).
In parallel with this work carried out on M. tuberculosis ﬁeld
isolates, other studies conducted on puriﬁed sulfolipid mole-
cules showed that the principal sulfolipid SL-I, although com-
pletely innocuous when injected even at high doses into mice,
exhibited a synergistic potentiation of the toxicity of cord fac-
tor administered simultaneously (19). In vitro, SL-I induced
swelling and disruption of mitochondrial membranes and
strongly inhibited mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(19). Goren and collaborators (14) showed that M. tuberculosis
sulfolipids are capable of preventing phagosome-lysosome fu-
sion in cultured macrophages, suggesting a major role for sul-
folipids in one of the most distinctive pathogenic functions of
the tubercle bacillus. Other remarkable properties of sulfolip-
ids drawn from in vitro studies include their ability to modulate
the oxidative response and the cytokine secretion of human
monocytes and neutrophils (2, 22, 27, 28). Finally, since most
of the biological activities of sulfolipids were invoked from
their amphiphilic and anionic properties, it was also proposed
that sulfolipids may disturb the functions of phagosomal and
lysosomal membranes by distorting their structure and that

they may inactivate lysosomal hydrolases by interacting with
the cationic sites of these enzymes (12).
Therefore, since 1947, a considerable wealth of in vivo and
in vitro data that point to a role of sulfolipids in the virulence
of the tubercle bacillus have been published. However, because
of the lack of an isogenic strain of M. tuberculosis deﬁcient in
the production of sulfolipids, the precise contribution of these
complex sulfated glycolipids to pathogenesis could not be mea-
sured and their biological activities in an infected host could
not be directly tested.
Recently, Sirakova and collaborators (24) constructed a pks2
knockout strain of M. tuberculosis H37Rv that is deﬁcient in
the synthesis of phthioceranic and hydroxyphthioceranic acids
and, consequently, devoid of sulfolipids. In the present study,
we analyzed the virulence of this sulfolipid-deﬁcient mutant in
different cellular and animal models (mouse and guinea pig),
using the same virulence evaluation criteria as those used in
the early studies describing the virulence attenuation of sulfo-
lipid-deﬁcient clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and growth conditions. M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC
25618) and the M. tuberculosis H37Rv pks2 mutant (strain msl2) were grown at
37°C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) supplemented with 10% ADC enrich-
ment (5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 2% dextrose, 0.003% beef catalase)
and 0.05% Tween 80 or on agar Middlebrook 7H11 medium (Difco) supple-
mented with OADC (0.05% oleic acid, 5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 2%
dextrose, 0.004% beef catalase, 0.85% NaCl). Hygromycin B was added to the
culture medium of the msl2 strain at a concentration of 50 g/ml.
Preparation and infection of murine bone marrow macrophages. Bone mar-
row cells were ﬂushed from the femurs and tibias of 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c
mice (CERJanvier, Le Genest St. Isle, France) and suspended in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle’s medium with 1 g of D-glucose, 3.7 g of NaHCO3, and 1.0289 g
of N-acetyl-L-alanyl-L-glutamine (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) per liter, enriched
with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Dominique Dutscher) and 10%
L-cell-conditioned medium. Macrophages were seeded in 24-well plates (TPP,
Geneva, Switzerland) (105 cells per well in a volume of 1 ml) and allowed to
differentiate for 7 days. For experiments with activated macrophages, 100 U of
gamma interferon (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn.) per ml and 10 ng of
tumor necrosis factor alpha (R&D Systems) per ml were added to the medium
24 h before infection and maintained throughout the infection process.
The infection assay was performed as follows. Glycerol stocks of the H37Rv
wild-type and msl2 strains were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4)
with 0.05% Tween 80, and bacterial concentrations were adjusted to 5  104
bacteria per ml in cell culture medium. An aliquot of the bacterial suspensions
used to infect the macrophages was plated onto Middlebrook 7H11 agar to
establish the exact number of bacteria in the inoculum. Cells were then infected
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere for 4 h at a multiplicity of infection of 1
bacterium to 2 macrophages. Infection was terminated by removing the overlay-
ing medium and washing each well three times with Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s
medium before 1 ml of fresh culture medium was added per well. At 4 h and 3,
6, and 8 days, the infected macrophage monolayers (three wells per strain) were
lysed in 200 l of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Lyon, France), and the
number of viable intracellular CFU was evaluated upon plating of the lysis
solution onto 7H11 or 7H11 plus hygromycin.
Preparation and infection of THP-1 monocytes. THP-1 cells were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection and grown at 37°C in a 5% CO2
atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies) containing 0.446 g of
L-alanyl-L-glutamine per liter, 2 g of sodium bicarbonate per liter, 2 g of glucose
per liter, 10 mM HEPES (Life Technologies), and 10% fetal bovine serum.
THP-1 cell suspensions were adjusted to a concentration of 2  105 cells per ml
in warm RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 ng of phorbol 12-myristate
13-acetate (Sigma) per ml, seeded in tissue culture plates (1 ml per well), and
allowed to differentiate for 24 h. The medium was then removed and replaced by
1 ml of bacterial suspension in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2  104 CFU per
ml (multiplicity of infection, 1:10 bacterium/macrophage ratio). After 24 h at
37°C, the medium was removed and the wells were washed three times with
RPMI 1640 medium to remove extracellular bacteria. At 24 h and on days 2, 5
and 7, cells (three wells per strain) were lysed with 200 l of cell culture lysis
reagent (Promega), and the number of viable intracellular CFU was counted by
plating serial dilutions of the lysis solution onto Middlebrook 7H11 or 7H11 plus
hygromycin agar.
M. tuberculosis growth and persistence in mice. Female BALB/c mice (6 to 8
weeks old) purchased from CERJanvier (Le Genest St. Isle, France) were in-
fected via the aerosol route with the M. tuberculosis H37Rv wild-type and msl2
mutant strains. M. tuberculosis aerosols were generated from bacterial suspen-
sions consisting of 2  107 CFU per ml in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4)
with 0.05% Tween 80. Mice were exposed to the aerosols for 15 min. Five mice
were used per experimental point and per strain. At various times after infection
(days 1, 7, 14, 21, 42, 63, and 105), lungs and spleens were removed aseptically
and homogenized in Sauton medium diluted 1:4 and supplemented with Middle-
brook OADC. Viable bacteria in the organs of infected animals were enumer-
ated by plating serial dilutions of the organ homogenates onto solid 7H11 or
7H11 plus hygromycin medium.
M. tuberculosis growth and persistence in guinea pigs. Forty female Hartley
guinea pigs were obtained from Charles River Laboratories (Willmington,
Mass.). For aerosol infections, thawed aliquots of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and
sulfolipid-deﬁcient strain msl2 were diluted in double-distilled sterile water to
the desired inoculum concentrations. The 40 guinea pigs were randomly sepa-
rated into two groups of 20. Each group was then infected via the aerosol route
with a low dose of either the wild-type or the mutant bacteria. Brieﬂy, the
nebulizer compartment of a Middlebrook air-borne infection apparatus (Glas-
Col, Terre Haute, Ind.) was ﬁlled with 5 ml of distilled water containing a
suspension of bacteria known to deliver approximately 20 to 50 bacteria into the
lungs. All animals were weighed once a week. Means and standard errors of the
mean values for each group were calculated and compared over time. Five
guinea pigs from each group were sacriﬁced 11, 31, 65, and 100 days after aerosol
infection. No animal died unexpectedly.
At necropsy, all lung lobes were removed from the thorax individually to
enable separate manipulations with each lobe. In addition, the tracheobronchial
lymph nodes, the left quadrate sublobe of the liver, and the spleen were removed.
The number of viable bacteria in the lungs was monitored over time by plating
serial 10-fold dilutions of right cranial lung lobe homogenates onto nutrient
Middlebrook 7H11 agar. Bacterial load was assessed in the same way in half of
each lymph node, liver, and spleen sample. Bacterial colony formations were
counted after 21 days of incubation at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. The data
were expressed as the log10 value of the mean number of bacteria recovered.
Means and standard errors of the mean values for each group were calculated
and compared over time.
Assessment of intradermal reaction to M. tuberculosis puriﬁed protein deriv-
ative in guinea pigs. At 29, 63, and 98 days postinfection, ﬁve guinea pigs from
each group were shaved along the dorsum and received an intradermal injection
of 1 g of M. tuberculosis puriﬁed protein derivative suspended in 100 l of
sterile saline. At the same time, 100 l of sterile saline was injected at a caudal
site to act as a negative control. At 48 h after injection, the diameter of the
erythema associated with the injections was measured independently by two
people. Means and standard errors of the means of the values recorded by the
two people were calculated and compared.
Histopathological assessment of guinea pig tissues. The right middle lung lobe
was ﬁrst slowly infused through the major vessels at the hilus with 10% neutral
buffered formalin to prevent alveolar collapse and assist in histopathological
interpretation. The lobe was then submerged in the formalin. Half of each of the
lymph node, liver, and spleen samples was also submerged in formalin. After a
minimum of 48 h, the tissue was prepared and sectioned for light microscopy with
lobe orientation designed to allow maximum surface area to be seen. Consecu-
tive sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Sections were examined by
a veterinary pathologist without prior knowledge of the experimental groups and
evaluated at least twice to verify the reproducibility of the observations.
Immunohistochemistry. Mouse anti-guinea pig monoclonal antibodies speciﬁc
for guinea pig CD4 (clone CT7), and CD8 (clone CT6) were purchased from
Serotec (Oxford, England). In each case, the Serotec mouse immunoglobulin
G1-negative control (clone W3/25) was used as the isotype control. F(ab)2 rabbit
anti-mouse immunoglobulin-biotin, also from Serotec, was used as the secondary
antibody. At necropsy, the left cranial lung lobe was ﬁrst slowly infused with 20%
optimal cutting temperature compound (OCT; Tissue-Tek, Inc. Torrance, Calif.)
in phosphate-buffered saline solution through the major vessels at the hilus. Lung
lobes were then placed in a tissue mold, completely surrounded by OCT, frozen
in a bath of liquid nitrogen, and stored at 70°C until used. Serial sections from
each lung, 5 m thick, were cut in a cryotome (CM 1850; Leica, Bannockburn,
Ill.), employing the Instrumedics Inc. (Hackensack, N.J.) Tape Transfer System,
ﬁxed in cold acetone for 5 to 10 min, and then air dried. Next, the sections were

washed in APK buffer solution (Vetana Medical Systems, Tucson, Ariz.) for 15
to 20 min and incubated in a 1:50 (CD4) or 1:100 (CD8) solution of Protein
Block-goat serum (Biogenex, San Ramon, Calif.) and primary antibody for 30
min. The sections were then placed on a Nexus automated immunostainer
(Ventana Medical Systems, Tucson, Ariz.). The labeled avidin-alkaline phospha-
tase and Fast Red-naphthol detection kit was employed. The secondary antibody
diluted 1:100 in APK buffer was incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
Sections were counterstained with Meyer’s hematoxylin. Sections of spleen were
also examined to act as positive controls.
Photomicroscopy and morphometry. Photomicroscopy was performed with an
Olympus AH-2 microscope linked to a Sony SKC-DK5 digital camera and Adobe
Photoshop 6.0 software.
Statistics. Statistical analysis was performed with Student’s t test (Satterth-
waite, unequal variances method) on the SAS system. Differences were signiﬁ-
cant considered a P of 0.05.
Biochemical analysis of sulfolipid content in wild-type and msl2 mutant of M.
tuberculosis. Radiolabeling with [1-14C]propionate was used to check the sulfo-
lipid content of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv and msl2 strains grown under axenic
conditions or recovered from the lungs of guinea pigs 65 days postinfection. For
this purpose, sodium [1-14C]propionate (0.5 Ci per ml; speciﬁc activity, 50
mCi/mmol; ICN) was added to 5 ml of 7H9 cultures of M. tuberculosis H37Rv
and msl2 (optical density at 600 nm of 1), and incubation was continued at 37°C
under agitation for a further 24 h. Lipids were then extracted from bacterial
pellets and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography and autoradiography as de-
scribed previously (24).
RESULTS
Growth characteristics of a sulfolipid-deﬁcient mutant in
murine and human macrophages. The numerous demon-
strated biological effects of puriﬁed sulfolipid molecules on the
activation and phagocytic functions of cultured murine and
human macrophages suggested that the production of sulfo-
lipids supports the intracellular growth of M. tuberculosis. In
order to test this hypothesis, activated and nonactivated bone
marrow macrophages from BALB/c mice and human THP-1
monocyte-derived macrophages were infected with the M. tu-
berculosis sulfolipid-deﬁcient strain (msl2) or with the wild-
type parental strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and the survival of
intracellular mycobacteria was assessed by enumeration of
CFU over time. In nonactivated mouse bone marrow macro-
phages, the mutant and wild-type strains exhibited no signiﬁ-
cant difference in growth over a period of 8 days (Fig. 1A).
Over the same period of time, the two strains did not show any
difference in persistence in activated mouse bone marrow mac-
rophages (Fig. 1B). Likewise, in human THP-1 monocyte-de-
rived macrophages, the sulfolipid-deﬁcient strain and the wild-
type H37Rv replicated similarly over a period of 7 days (data
not shown). Therefore, sulfolipids are unlikely to be involved
in the survival of M. tuberculosis inside phagocytic cells or in its
resistance to the respiratory burst that accompanies macro-
phage activation.
Multiplication and persistence of sulfolipid-deﬁcient mu-
tant in mice. After performing virulence assays on cultured
macrophages, the in vivo mouse model of infection was used to
analyze the effect of sulfolipid deﬁciency on virulence. The
ability of the wild-type and mutant strains to replicate and
survive in the lungs and spleen of BALB/c mice was studied by
CFU analysis after aerosol exposure. Figure 2 shows that after
air-borne infection with bacterial inocula that implanted 1,000
bacilli in the lungs (as assessed by CFU counts the day after
infection), the bacterial organ burdens in the mice infected
with the sulfolipid-deﬁcient mutant and the parental strain
H37Rv were identical throughout a 105-day period. The two

strains proliferated in lungs and spleen for 6 weeks and then
persisted in both tissues. Therefore, sulfolipid deﬁciency does
not compromise the growth of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in the
lungs or spleens of BALB/c mice.
Multiplication and persistence of sulfolipid-deﬁcient mu-
tant in guinea pigs. We then assessed the in vivo growth char-
acteristics of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv wild-type and sulfo-
lipid-deﬁcient strains in guinea pigs. As in BALB/c mice, the
mutant and wild-type strains replicated equally well in guinea
pigs, giving rise to comparable bacterial burdens in the lungs
(Fig. 3), thoracic lymph node, liver, and spleen (data not
shown) at all time points of the infection. Consistent with these
observations, the mass changes of msl2-infected guinea pigs
followed the same progression as that of H37Rv-infected
guinea pigs over the 100 days of the infection (Fig. 4) with no
statistically signiﬁcant differences between the two groups.
In order to check whether the msl2 mutant had reverted to
the wild-type phenotype in the course of infection, the sulfo-
lipid content of the H37Rv and msl2 strains recovered from the
lungs of guinea pigs 65 days postinfection were analyzed by
thin-layer chromatography. For this purpose, H37Rv and msl2
colonies recovered from the lungs of guinea pigs were grown in
7H9 medium and radiolabeled with [1-14C]propionate prior to
lipid extraction and analysis. No sulfolipids were detected in
the msl2 strain (Fig. 3), indicating that no reversion of the
phenotype had occurred and that sulfolipid production in the
pks2 knockout strain was catalyzed by no other M. tuberculosis
polyketide synthase.
Histopathologic analysis. There were no signiﬁcant differ-
ences in the lung, lymph node, liver, and spleen pathologies of
H37Rv- and msl2-infected guinea pigs over time. In the lung,
a similar progression through the previously described (25)
histopathological stages of pulmonary tuberculosis in the
guinea pig was observed in each group of animals. Figure 5
demonstrates a typical stage 4 lesion from each group observed
in the chronic stage of the disease characterized by necrotizing
granulomatous pneumonia with central mineralization. The
spectra of lesions in the other organs were also similar between
groups, with characteristic granulomatous inﬂammation and
tissue destruction which increased with increasing duration of
the disease (data not shown).
Cellular immune responses in infected guinea pigs. Both
the distributions and the numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells
were similar in lung lesions at all time points for both groups of
guinea pigs (Fig. 6). Typically, the lymphocytes were scattered
evenly around the central area of each granuloma.
Delayed-type hypersensitivity induced by sulfolipid-deﬁ-
cient mutant in infected guinea pigs. In order to assess the
immunogenicity of the H37Rv and msl2 strains, the cutaneous
delayed-type hypersensitivity response to puriﬁed protein de-
rivative in ﬁve guinea pigs from each group was evaluated at
29, 63, and 98 days postinfection. There were no statistically
signiﬁcant differences in the mean induration diameters be-
tween the two groups at any of the time points examined

DISCUSSION
Lipids that are found only in the cell envelope of patho-
genic mycobacteria such as those containing multiple methyl-
branched fatty acids have long been thought to play a role in
pathogenesis (11). With the recent availability of genetic tools
for performing insertional mutagenesis in M. tuberculosis (1,
23), mutant libraries were constructed and screened for viru-
lence attenuation in mice by signature-tagged transposon mu-
tagenesis. With this approach, phthiocerol dimycocerosate
were the ﬁrst methyl-branched fatty acid-containing lipids to
be positively recognized as important for the multiplication of
the tubercle bacillus in the lungs of mice (3, 4). Although
the envelope of M. tuberculosis contains other similar complex
lipids, such as diacylated trehaloses, triacylated trehaloses,
polyacylated trehaloses, and sulfolipids, the lack of isogenic
mutants deﬁcient in their synthesis prevented studies on their
involvement in pathogenesis.

Among these complex lipids, sulfolipids have most fre-
quently been postulated to play a role in the virulence of M.
tuberculosis. Certainly the most remarkable, and also contro-
versial, biological activity associated with puriﬁed sulfolipids is
their ability to prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion in murine
peritoneal macrophages (5, 14, 16). More recently, the ﬁnding
that the polyketide synthase gene pks2, involved in the synthe-
sis of the methyl-branched fatty acid constituents of sulfolipids
(24), is strongly upregulated upon phagocytosis of M. tubercu-
losis by cultured human primary macrophages (17) further
strengthened the idea that sulfolipids are produced to lessen
the effectiveness of activated phagocytic cells.
The construction of a sulfolipid-deﬁcient strain of M. tuber-
culosis H37Rv by Sirakova and collaborators (24) enabled di-
rect tests for the role of sulfolipids in pathogenesis to be
conducted for the ﬁrst time. To assess the residual virulence of
this particular sulfolipid-deﬁcient mutant of M. tuberculosis
H37Rv, we used different models of infection and different
virulence evaluation criteria. The occurrence of sulfolipid mol-
ecules in the human pathogen M. tuberculosis but not in any
other mycobacteria from the tuberculosis complex suggested
that the toxicity of sulfolipids might be directed only toward
speciﬁc hosts. Therefore, the virulence of the sulfolipid-deﬁ-
cient mutant was analyzed not only in the mouse model but
also in the guinea pig model in which the initial observations
on the virulence attenuation of sulfolipid-deﬁcient strains were
made (8, 12). Similarly, the intracellular growth of the sulfo-
lipid-deﬁcient mutant was monitored in both murine and hu-
man macrophages. All animals were infected via the aerosol
route, and the ability of the wild-type and sulfolipid-deﬁcient
strains to replicate in the lungs and to disseminate to other
organs was monitored over a 100-day period by CFU count.
Because organ CFU analysis is not an absolute measure of
virulence, weight loss, histopathology, and cellular immune
responses induced by each bacterial strain were also assessed
in the guinea pig model over the same time period.
In striking contrast to the published data that suggested a
major role for sulfolipids in the in vivo replication of M. tuber-
culosis from the very ﬁrst weeks of infection (8, 12, 15, 18), our
data indicate that sulfolipid deﬁciency does not affect the mul-
tiplication and persistence of M. tuberculosis H37Rv in either
mice or guinea pigs over a 100-day period. The sulfolipid-
deﬁcient mutant was as proﬁcient as wild-type H37Rv at rep-
licating in infected animals. In guinea pigs, the two strains did
not differ in their abilities to induce the formation of granulo-
mas and the recruitment of CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes at
the site of infection. In addition, at all times examined, the
sulfolipid-deﬁcient mutant induced a delayed-type hypersensi-
tivity response to puriﬁed protein derivative that was equal in
intensity to that induced by the wild-type strain, indicating that
it retained its immunogenicity.
There are a number of reasons that might explain the pre-
vious results that were not expected from previously published
observations. Most of the previous studies, although providing
indisputable evidence of the powerful biological activities of
sulfolipids, were performed with puriﬁed sulfolipid molecules
in cellular models. Important factors to be taken into consid-
eration when interpreting the role of sulfolipids in pathogen-
esis from the in vitro studies are the conditions under which
the biological activities of puriﬁed sulfolipids were tested. The
stimulating effects of these glycolipids on the activation of
phagocytic cells were found to be dose dependent (2, 22, 28).
Hence, the intracellular concentration of sulfolipids appears to
be critical to their biological activities. From the puriﬁcation
data provided by Goren (10), 1 g of sulfolipid can be ex-
tracted from 1 to 1.3 mg of wet H37Rv bacilli (approximately
108 bacilli). The equivalent multiplicity of infection required to
expose cells to concentrations of sulfolipids similar to that used
in the in vitro studies (1 to 100 g/ml) would therefore be on
the order of 100 to 1,000 bacteria per cell. Such values are
unlikely to be reached during the natural process of infection.
In addition to the intracellular concentration, the localization
of sulfolipids inside cells might affect their biological activities.
The study by Goren and collaborators (14) showed that mouse
macrophages exposed to sulfolipids take up these molecules by
endocytosis and sequester them in secondary lysosomes. Since
M. tuberculosis does not normally reside in this compartment,
conclusions derived from this biological system may not all be
relevant to M. tuberculosis infection in vivo.
Regarding the guinea pig experiments, an important differ-
ence between the studies published between 1948 (7) and 1982
(15) and our study is that our work was performed with an
isogenic mutant strain of M. tuberculosis. Differences in the cell
envelope compositions of the clinical isolates used by Goren
and collaborators (12) other than those affecting sulfolipids
might have been responsible for virulence attenuation. An-
other potential attenuation indicator was actually recognized
by Goren and colleagues (13) when they analyzed more thor-
oughly the lipid composition of the 40 clinical isolates used in
the sulfolipid study (12). Twenty-two of the 25 strains of re-
duced virulence were characterized by the presence of an at-
tenuation indicator lipid that was not seen in any of the more
virulent strains. This observation that the distribution of the
attenuation indicator lipid (a methoxyphenolphthiocerol dimy-
cocerosate) is restricted to attenuated strains was later ex-
tended by Goren and colleagues (15) to a larger number of M.
tuberculosis clinical isolates. In the light of our results, it now
seems that the presence of the attenuation indicator lipid was
a more potent indicator of virulence attenuation than the ab-
sence of sulfolipids.
Finally, sulfolipids are complex molecules, and one cannot
exclude the possibility that some biosynthetic precursors pro-
duced by the msl2 mutant in the absence of phthioceranic and
hydroxyphthioceranic acids, such as trehalose-2-sulfate, retain
most of the toxicity of the entire sulfolipid molecules. The
pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis H37Rv mutants deﬁcient in

ROLE OF SULFOLIPIDS IN M. TUBERCULOSIS VIRULENCE

other steps of sulfolipid synthesis (e.g., sulfation of trehalose)
will be required to address this issue. Virulence is a complex
phenotypic trait, and it is also possible that other factors in the
M. tuberculosis H37Rv sulfolipid-deﬁcient mutant compensate
for the lack of sulfolipids. For instance, it was shown that the
methylmalonyl-coenzyme A that is not used for the synthesis of
phthioceranic and hydroxyphthioceranic acids in the mutant
was channeled into mycocerosic and mycolipanoic acids found
in phthiocerol dimycocerosates and acyl trehaloses, respec-
tively (24). Since most of the biological activities of sulfolipids
were invoked from their amphiphilic and anionic properties, it
is plausible that other envelope lipids and glycolipids with
similar physical properties can exert the same biological activ-
ities as sulfolipids. In support of this assumption, it is known
that other glycolipids share with sulfolipids the ability to pro-
mote the toxicity of cord factor when injected simultaneously
into mice (19).
In conclusion, our study sheds light on an issue raised some
55 years ago. In spite of the powerful biological activities of
sulfolipids in vitro and of a remarkable correlation between
the virulence of M. tuberculosis ﬁeld isolates and their ability
to elaborate sulfolipids, these molecules on their own do not
contribute signiﬁcantly to the virulence of M. tuberculosis
H37Rv in the mouse and guinea pig models of infection used
in this study. In view of the restricted distribution of sulfolipids
to the human pathogen M. tuberculosis, one cannot exclude the
possibility that these complex lipids play an important role in
human pathogenesis. Moreover, it would be interesting to
study whether these complex lipids play a more signiﬁcant role
in the virulence of other strains of M. tuberculosis with different
cell envelope compositions and sulfolipid contents.
