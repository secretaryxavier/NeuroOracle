Abstract
Objective—To evaluate the relationship of family and parenting factors to long-term executive
dysfunction and attention problems after early childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI). We
hypothesized that the magnitude of executive dysfunction and attention problems would be
moderated by family and parenting factors.
Design—A multicenter, prospective cohort study that included an orthopedic injury (OD
reference group.
Setting—Three tertiary academic children’s hospital medical centers and one general medical
center.
Participants—Children, ages 3—7 years, hospitalized for OI, moderate TBI, or severe TBI.

Methods and Outcome Measurements—Parental ratings of family functioning and
parenting styles were obtained 18 months after the injury occurred. The main outcome
measurements, which were parental ratings of children’s executive function and attention, were
performed at least 24 months after the injury occurred (mean, 39 months; range, 25-63 months).
Analysis—Group comparisons were conducted with use of ¢tests, y* analysis, analysis of
variance, and Pearson and Spearman correlations. Regression analysis was used to examine
associations of the outcomes with family functioning and parenting styles and to test moderating
effects of these factors on group differences.
Results—Participants with severe TBI demonstrated increased executive dysfunction and
attention problems compared with those who sustained moderate TBI or OI. Lower levels of
family dysfunction were associated with better executive function and attention across groups but
did not moderate group differences. However, attention deficits after severe TBI were exacerbated
under conditions of more permissive parenting relative to attention deficits after OIs.
Conclusions—Executive function and attention problems persisted on a long-term basis (>24
months) after early childhood TBI, and positive global family functioning and nonpermissive
parenting were associated with better outcomes. Better characterization of the optimal family
environment for recovery from early childhood TBI could help target future interventions.
INTRODUCTION
Traumatic brain injury (TBD) is a major public health concern [1,2]. An estimated 1.7
million people sustain a TBI annually in the United States [2]. In children 0-14 years of age,
an estimated 473,947 emergency visits, 35,136 hospitalizations, and 2174 deaths are related
to TBI each year [2]. Pediatric TBI has a long-term impact among survivors, with
neurocognitive and behavioral deficits predominating after the injury occurs [3-8].
In early childhood TBI (ie, in children aged 2-6 years), more severe injuries and younger
age at injury are associated with poorer outcomes across multiple behavioral, cognitive, and
educational domains [9-11]. In general, executive dysfunction and attention problems are
common after pediatric TBI [12-17]. Executive function is associated with various cognitive
and behavioral constructs, including attentional control, cognitive flexibility, goal setting,
and information processing [18]. Executive functions begin developing in early childhood
and continue to mature and develop through adolescence and young adulthood [18,19].
Because the development of executive functions and problem-solving skills is important for
children to succeed academically, socially, and behaviorally, an important goal is to
characterize the effect TBI has on executive function and attention outcomes in children.
TBI has lasting negative effects on school-aged children. In an investigation of children
aged 7-15 years who sustained a moderate or severe TBI, executive dysfunction was present
1 year after the injury occurred, especially in children who sustained an injury at a younger
age [20]. In addition, executive dysfunction and attention problems measured 2 years after a
childhood TBI (in children aged 8—12 years) were most pronounced in those who sustained
a severe injury [21,22]. Executive dysfunction also has been associated with decreased
social problem-solving skills and poorer social outcomes in young adults who sustained a
TBI in late childhood or early adolescence (ie, from ages 8-12 years), which suggests that
the effects of a TBI extend to critical aspects of everyday functioning [23].
Emerging research that is examining long-term executive dysfunction after early childhood
TBI is providing evidence of persistent effects, particularly among younger children and
those with more severe injuries. Specifically, Ewing-Cobbs et al [16] demonstrated that
working memory and inhibitory control measured approximately 1—2 years after injury were
adversely affected, especially after moderate and severe TBI that occurred before the age of
PM R. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 April 02.

6 years. Similarly, Anderson et al [24] reported attention impairments 30 months after early
childhood TBI (ie, in children aged 2—7 years), with the most pronounced effects following
more severe injuries and those occurring at a younger age.
Family environment, socioeconomic status (SES), and availability of resources play
important roles in moderating recovery after pediatric TBI [11,25]. TBI is known to lead to
increased family stressors and injury-related family burden [26-32]. Conversely, family
functioning, both before and after the injury, also affects the recovery process [33-35].
Previous work has demonstrated main and moderation effects of family environment on
recovery after early childhood TBI. Poor family functioning is associated with increased
executive dysfunction across different severities of injury (main effects); however, the
combination of more severe injuries with poor family functioning is associated with a
greater increase in executive dysfunction (moderation effects) [36]. When TBI occurs in
later childhood, the family environment also moderates recovery most significantly in
persons with severe TBI [25]. Maladaptive parenting styles, family dysfunction, and low
SES predict clinical elevations in executive dysfunction and externalizing behaviors
longitudinally across the initial 18 months after early childhood TBI [37]. Favorable family
environments were associated with better outcomes over an 18-month period across multiple
domains, including global cognitive function, memory, spatial reasoning, and executive
function, regardless of the nature (TBI versus orthopedic injury [OI]) or severity of the
injury [38].
Further elucidation of the joint effect that early childhood TBI and environmental factors
have on long-term executive function and attention is necessary to improve the
understanding of recovery after early childhood TBI. In this study, we built upon previous
work that evaluated outcomes of early childhood TBI up to 18 months after the injury
occurred [37,38]. We examined the relationship of family functioning and parenting
practices assessed 18 months after the time of the injury to long-term (>24 months after
injury) attention and executive function deficits after moderate and severe pediatric TBI in
early childhood (ages 3-6 years). We tested 2 alternative models of environmental
influence. First, we examined the hypothesis that positive global family functioning and
effective parenting are associated with less executive dysfunction and fewer attention
problems long term, not only after early childhood TBI for children with both moderate and
severe injuries, but also for children with OI. An alternative possibility is that family
function and parenting would moderate the association of injury severity with executive
dysfunction and attention problems. Specifically, the effects of family functioning and
parenting on executive dysfunction and attention problems would be more evident in
children with more-severe TBI than in children with moderate TBI or OI. Previous research
supports both main and moderating effects of the social environment on recovery of
executive function and attention after early childhood TBI [36-39]. This study provides an
opportunity to distinguish these alternate models of influence.
METHODS
Participants
Participants were recruited from a broader prospective, longitudinal study that evaluated
recovery from early childhood TBI. Participants in this study were recruited from 3
children’s hospitals and one general hospital in Ohio. As part of the original study, the
participants underwent assessments at multiple time points, including the immediate
postacute period (O-3 months after injury) and 6, 12, and 18 months after the injury
occurred. The assessment at 18 months after the time of the injury included measures of
parenting style and family functioning completed by the parents. For the current study, the
parents completed an additional follow-up assessment by mail an average of 39 months after

the injury occurred (range, 25-63 months). As part of that assessment, they completed
ratings of children’s executive functioning and attention.
Inclusion criteria included hospitalization overnight for traumatic injury (TBI or OD)
sustained between the ages of 36 and 83 months, no evidence of child abuse as the cause of
the injury, no history of documented neurologic problems or developmental delays before
the injury, and English as the primary language in the home. The participants were divided
into 3 groups: severe TBI, moderate TBI, and OI. We used the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)
to characterize TBI severity [40]. The severe TBI group had a GCS score less than or equal
to 8 as the lowest postresuscitation score. The moderate TBI group had a GCS score of 9-12
or a GCS score of 13-15 in association with abnormal brain imaging. Children with mild
TBI, defined as a GCS of 13-15 without evidence of abnormal brain imaging, were
excluded from the current analysis to focus on the more-severe injuries. The OI group
included children who sustained a bone fracture (not including skull fractures), had an
overnight stay in the hospital, and did not exhibit alterations in consciousness or other signs
or symptoms of head trauma or brain injury.
Procedures for the Extended Mail Follow-up Study
Upon approval by each site’s institutional review board, all the parents or guardians of the
participants enrolled in the initial study were contacted by telephone and/or mail by a
research coordinator at the initial recruitment site. The participants who had previously
withdrawn from the parent study or asked not to be contacted in the future were not
recruited for this study. During the initial contact, the study was explained to the primary
caregiver (parent or guardian), who then was invited to participate. Once parents and/or
guardians verbally agreed to participate, a research coordinator sent out a packet of
questionnaires, a cover letter that outlined all the required elements of consent, a telephone
number for use if the parent or guardian had any questions concerning participation, and a
self-addressed, stamped envelope in which to return the questionnaires. The mailing
procedures also were approved by the institutional review boards of all the participating
institutions. Upon completion and return of the questionnaires, the parents were paid a
modest amount for their time and effort.
Family Functioning and Parenting Assessments
The 12-item General Functioning subscale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device
(FAD-GF) was used to assess family functioning. The FAD-GF has shown good reliability
and validity [41,42] and has been used previously in the evaluation of pediatric TBI to
assess family functioning [43]. Lower scores represent better family functioning. The
Parenting Practices Questionnaire (PPQ) was used to assess the extent to which parents
characterize themselves as engaging in authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive parenting
behaviors [44]. The PPQ is a 62-item instrument that uses a 5-point Likert scale. We used
the raw total score for each of these dimensions to characterize parenting styles, which
originally were described by Baumrind [45,46]. The permissive parent allows the child to
regulate his or her own activities, avoids control, and uses reason and manipulation but not
power to parent the child. The authoritarian parent shapes and controls the child in
accordance with a set standard and often restricts the child’s autonomy. The authoritative
parent directs the child in a rational manner, encourages give and take, and both autonomy
and disciplined conformity are valued. Permissive and authoritarian parenting styles are
generally considered maladaptive, whereas authoritative parenting is considered an effective
parenting style.

Executive Function and Attention Measures
The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) is a parent-rated measure of
executive dysfunction [47-50]. A school-age version is used for children aged 5-18 years
[50] and a preschool version is used for children aged 2-5 years [49]. The measure has good
internal consistency, interrater reliability, and test-retest reliability and has been validated in
children with TBI [47]. The Global Executive Composite score was used to measure global
executive functioning in this study. Higher scores indicate increased executive dysfunction,
with a score of 65 or higher indicating clinical impairment. In addition, inconsistency scores
on the BRIEF were reviewed, and none of the questionnaires met the criteria for
inconsistency; therefore, all questionnaires were determined to be valid.
The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) is a widely used measure that assesses a child’s
competencies and adjustment. It includes school-age [51] and preschool versions [52]. In
this study, we used the CBCL Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) rating scale
to specifically assess attention problems. Higher scores indicate more attention problems,
with a score of 65 or higher defining clinical impairment. During the immediate postacute
period (O—3 months) after injury, parents were asked to rate the child based on preinjury
behavior on the BRIEF and CBCL ADHD rating scale to assess preinjury executive function
and attention. The BRIEF and CBCL were completed at the extended follow-up more than
24 months after the injury occurred to assess longer-term postinjury functioning.
Rationale for Use of Measures and Assessments at Specified Follow-up Time Points
We used FAD-GF and PPQ scores that were obtained 18 months after the time of the injury
in the analysis to prospectively examine the relationship of family functioning and parenting
styles to later executive dysfunction and attention problems. We chose to use measures of
family functioning and parenting styles obtained 18 months after the injury occurred
because they best addressed our hypothesis that family functioning and parenting styles
would potentially influence executive functioning and attention in the future, 24 months
after the time of the injury. Longitudinal analyses suggest substantial stability in FAD-GF
and PPQ scores over time, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.56-0.77.
Data Analysis
The two-tailed test and Sa were used to examine possible differences between participants
and nonparticipants with regard to demographic and injury characteristics, including mean
age at the time of the injury, the mean injury severity score, gender, race, SES, type of
injury, mean GCS, and percentage of abnormal computed tomography scans. An index of
SES was constructed by averaging z scores for caregiver education and census tract income.
Analysis of variance was used to compare executive function measures (BRIEP), attention
measures (CBCL Attention Deficit Hyper-activity Problems scale), quality of family
functioning (FAD-GP), and parenting style (PPQ) among the OI, moderate TBI, and severe
TBI groups. The Bonferroni method for multiple comparisons with analysis of variance was
used to conduct post hoc comparisons of the individual groups. A xv analysis was used to
compare the proportion of individuals within the OI, moderate TBI, and severe TBI groups
that scored in the impaired range on the BRIEF and CBCL Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Problems scale. Pearson or Spearman correlations were used to evaluate the association of
the primary outcome measures (BRIEF and CBCL Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Problems
scores), covariates (baseline BRIEF, baseline CBCL Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Problems scores, race, SES, and time since injury), and quality of family functioning (FAD-
GF) with parent practices. General linear regression was performed by using the BRIEF and
CBCL Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Problems scores as dependent variables. The TBI
injury group was divided into a moderate group and a severe group based on the severity of
injury, with the OI group serving as a reference category. Dummy coding was used to

contrast the moderate and severe TBI groups with the OI reference group. Interaction terms
were created to allow us to examine whether the relationship of family functioning and
parenting styles to executive function and attention problems varied as a function of the
nature (OI versus TBI) and severity (moderate versus severe TBI) of the injury (moderation
hypothesis). Initially, all covariates, FAD-GF, parenting style ratings, and interaction terms
were included in the model. Factors that did not demonstrate an influence (P> .15) were
trimmed from the final model. These factors included race, time since the injury occurred,
parenting style, and all interaction terms for both models, except for the permissive
parenting interactions term, which was significant in the CBCL Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Problems scale model. Therefore the permissive parenting rating and
interactions terms between permissive parenting and injury severity were included in the
final model for this variable only. SPSS 15 for Windows was used to perform all analyses
(SPSS for Windows, 2006; SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL).
Analysis of Demographics
Of the 221 families initially recruited into the broader study, 154 agreed to participate and
completed the questionnaires in the extended follow-up study. Persons who participated in
the study included 68 parents of children with moderate-to-severe TBI and 75 parents of
children with OI. Demographic variables were compared between participating and
nonparticipating families (Table 1). A significant difference was noted in the mean age at
the time of the injury, in that participants were significantly younger at the time the injury
occurred than were nonparticipants. In addition, a higher percentage of participants
sustained a TBI (47.6%) than did the nonparticipants (30.2%).
Comparison of Primary Outcome and Environmental Measures Between Groups
As reported in Table 2, children with severe TBI have significantly higher scores on the
BRIEF and CBCL Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Problems scale than did those with
moderate TBI (BRIEF: P= .02, CBCL: P< .005) or OI (BRIEF: P< .005, CBCL: P< .005),
based on Bonferroni post hoc comparisons. No significant differences were found between
the OI and moderate TBI groups on the BRIEF and CBCL Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
Problems scale. Significant differences were found between groups in the proportion of
persons who scored above the clinical cutoffs for the BRIEF and CBCL Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Problems scales (Figure 1). A significantly higher percentage of persons in the
severe TBI group were in the impaired range on the BRIEF (P= .02) and CBCL Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Problems scale (P= .04) compared with the OI and moderate TBI
groups. The groups did not differ on measures of global family functioning (FAD-GF) or
parenting practices.
Correlation of Measures of Executive Function and Attention With Family Measures
As shown in Table 3, higher levels of executive dysfunction on the BRIEF at extended
follow-up were associated with higher levels of executive dysfunction before the injury,
lower SES, greater family dysfunction on the FAD-GF, and greater endorsement of both
authoritarian and permissive parenting styles. However, executive dysfunction was unrelated
to race, time since the injury occurred, or authoritative parenting. A similar pattern of
associations was found for the attention problems at follow-up. This finding was expected
because the BRIEF and CBCL Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Problems scores were
positively correlated with each other.

Regression Models
Executive Function Model (BRIEF Global Executive Composite Score)—Quality
of family functioning (FAD-GP) accounted for significant variance in executive functioning
(BRIEF); specifically, higher levels of family dysfunction at 18 months after the injury were
associated with more executive difficulties at long-term follow-up (Table 4). With family
functioning in the model, parenting style did not account for significant variance in
executive function, and thus parenting style was trimmed from the model. The interaction
terms between TBI severity and quality of family function or parenting styles also were not
significant, and thus the interaction terms were trimmed from the model.
Attention Problems Model (The Child Behavior Checklist Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale)—Quality of family functioning (FAD-GF) also
accounted for significant variance in attention (Table 4). Again, higher levels of family
dysfunction at 18 months after the injury were associated with more attention problems at
long-term follow-up. The interaction between permissive parenting and TBI severity also
was significant. Therefore, permissive parenting and interaction terms with permissive
parenting were kept in the final attention problems model (Table 4; Figure 2). Higher ratings
of permissive parenting were associated with more attention problems after severe TBI but
not moderate TBI or OI (Figure 2). Put differently, the difference between the severe TBI
and OI groups was larger at higher levels of permissive parenting. Authoritarian and
authoritative parenting practices did not account for significant variance in either model.
Overall, these findings indicate that lower family dysfunction is associated with less
executive dysfunction and attention problems regardless of the severity or type of injury (OI
versus TBI). The findings also provide evidence that permissive parenting moderates the
association of injury severity with long-term attention problems, specifically exacerbating
the adverse effects of severe TBI.
DISCUSSION
We found that executive dysfunction and attention problems, as rated by parents or
guardians after early childhood TBI, persisted in children with severe TBI an average of 39
months after the time of the injury compared with children who had OI and moderate TBI.
Children from more dysfunctional families, regardless of parenting styles or severity of
injury, also had greater difficulties with executive function and attention. We failed to find
evidence that family functioning moderated the association of injury severity with either
long-term executive function or attention. However, permissive parenting moderated the
association of severe TBI with long-term attention problems. Higher ratings of permissive
parenting were associated with more attention problems after severe TBI. At least 2
explanations for this finding exist. Permissive parenting may exacerbate the negative effects
of TBI on attention problems, or it may be that because attention problems in severe TBI are
difficult to control effectively, parents become more permissive in their approach to
managing the child. In other words, parenting could affect attention problems in the child or
the child’s inattentiveness could affect parenting. Previous research provides evidence of a
bidirectional relationship between the family’s functioning and the child’s behavioral
adjustment after TBI and points to the possibility of complex reciprocal relationships over
time [53].
Because the TBI-related family burden may increase over time [54], the nature of the
reciprocal relationship of family functioning to child behavior also is likely to change over
time. Family functioning and social resources also moderate the relationship of TBI-related
burden and caregiver distress [31]; therefore, changes in social resources over time also may
influence the bidirectional relationship between parenting and child executive function and

behavior. In this project, our measures of family function and parenting styles remained
stable over time. However, unmeasured relationships or influences that change on a more
incremental basis may exist, and if so, they were not captured in this study. Nadebaum et al
[36] examined executive functions 5 years after early TBI and demonstrated that executive
dysfunction was greatest after severe TBI and that a positive family environment contributed
to better outcomes. Their study included 54 subjects in the TBI group and 17 “healthy
controls.” The current study adds to these findings by demonstrating long-term effects on
executive function and attention in children with severe TBI relative to an “other injury”
comparison group. The current study also extends findings from a previous follow-up of
children from the same cohort at 18 months after the time of the injury [37,38] by
demonstrating persistent executive dysfunction and attention deficits more than 3 years after
the injury occurred on average.
Many correlations were significant among the primary outcome measures of executive
function and attention, covariates, and the social environmental measures. Consistent with
our hypotheses and prior research, lower SES, maladaptive parenting styles (permissive and
authoritarian), and poorer global family functioning were each associated with long-term
executive dysfunction and attention problems. These findings may reflect a complex
interplay among multiple factors that determines the ideal environment to promote long-
term recovery of executive function and attention problems.
In multivariate regression models, global family functioning demonstrated main effects on
long-term executive function and attention measures after accounting for the effects of
parenting, SES, and injury severity. This finding is in agreement with previous studies that
demonstrated that better family functioning was associated with better executive functioning
after pediatric TBI [36-38]. The association of preinjury psychosocial difficulties with
attention deficits after TBI observed in this study is also consistent with past research
[12,55]. We found no evidence that global family functioning moderated the effects of
injury severity on executive functioning or attention. Although these findings are contrary to
our hypothesis, they are consistent with those of Yeates et al [39], who found evidence that
social moderation effects diminished with increasing time since the injury in the same
cohort. Thus although the social environment broadly and family functioning specifically
continue to be important to executive functioning and attention problems in early childhood
TBI, the association holds true regardless of the type or severity of the injury. However, we
did find that permissive parenting moderated the association of severe TBI with attention
problems more than 3 years after the injury occurred, which is in agreement with findings
from Chapman et al [37], who demonstrated that permissive parenting was associated with
increased behavioral dysfunction in the same cohort up to 18 months after the time of the
injury [39]. Although our primary outcome measures of attention and executive function
were correlated with each other, permissive parenting only moderated the effect of group (ie,
TBI severity) on our attention measure. It is not surprising that our measures of executive
function and attention are correlated, because attention is a component of executive function
(ie, poor attention is likely to lead to executive dysfunction). The BRIEF score incorporates
various constructs of executive function, including areas of emotional control, initiation,
working memory, and organization, whereas the CBCL ADHD scale measures the
symptoms of ADHD more specifically. The finding of moderation effects only with the
ADHD scale in persons with severe TBI deserves further consideration. It is possible that
permissive parenting has a more significant impact on the emergence of ADHD
symptomatology after severe TBI, but the impact is of smaller magnitude when considering
the more global construct of executive function. In addition, although we evaluated a
relatively large cohort of persons with moderate or severe TBI, we still may not have had
sufficient power to detect subtle moderation effects.

The persistence of problems more than 3 years after the injury occurred suggests that
persons who sustained an early childhood TBI should be followed up into later childhood
and adolescence. In this study, more than 50% of children who sustained a severe TBI in
early childhood exhibited clinically impaired executive function or attention. Family
function was important in determining long-term executive and attention functioning across
injury types and severity. In addition, parenting styles could affect the association of severe
TBI with long-term attention problems.
LIMITATIONS
One limitation of the study is that children who sustained an injury at a younger age were
more likely to participate in the long-term follow-up than were children who sustained an
injury at an older age. This differential attrition could potentially limit the generalizability of
the results to the slightly younger individuals in the current cohort; however, the difference
in average age at time of injury between the participants and nonparticipants was only 4
months. This difference is unlikely to be of clinical significance, especially because the
development of executive function occurs on a continuum throughout childhood and
adolescence [18]. In addition, attrition was greater within the OI group, which could
potentially limit our power to detect subtle differences. Our preinjury measures of executive
function and attention were subjected to recall bias because the measures were obtained 0-3
months after the injury occurred. As a consequence, the association of these baseline
measures with long-term outcomes after injury may be artificially inflated. Moreover, by
statistically controlling for preinjury functioning, we may be statistically reducing the
likelihood of finding differences and associations after the injury occurred. In addition,
because our primary outcome measures of executive dysfunction and attention problems
were based on caregiver ratings, a potential bias related to these ratings exists.
Caregivers of children with TBI are likely emotionally involved in the care of their children,
and ratings could potentially yield different results if assessments were performed by
individuals not directly involved in caretaking responsibilities. However, the outcome
measures used, BRIEF and CBCL, have been well validated with other widely accepted
measures of executive dysfunction and attention problems [49-52]. Furthermore, caregivers
likely have the most significant interaction with their children and will likely provide the
most accurate assessment of executive and attention functioning on an everyday basis. The
BRIEF was specifically developed to assess “real-world” manifestation of executive
function [47], and it does not necessarily correlate with performance-based measures of
executive function [56].
Finally, our family assessment measures and parent practice questionnaires also were based
on caregiver self-ratings. Collection of parenting and/or family variables and child outcomes
from a single informant, the primary caregiver, may artificially inflate associations.
However, the FAD-GF and PPQ are commonly used in the literature and have been well
validated as assessment tools [42,46]. Thus, despite these limitations, the primary findings
that caregiver ratings of executive dysfunction and attention problems persist long term after
early childhood TBI and that improved family function is associated with improved
outcomes remain valid.
CONCLUSION
Executive function and attention problems rated by caregivers persist on a long-term basis
after early childhood TBI, and positive global family functioning is associated with
improved outcomes for all injury types. These findings extend previous research on
outcomes of TBI in young children by demonstrating these associations in a relatively large

cohort of young children with TBI compared with children who have OI. The findings
indicate that executive dysfunction and attention problems persist long after early childhood
TBI and that family functioning is important in determining the overall outcome. Future
research is needed to determine specific family functions that are associated with better
recovery. Numerous potentially important environmental factors that were not examined in
the current study (eg, parental health status, number of siblings, community resources, and
the presence of an extended family) influence family functioning and, ultimately, recovery
and reintegration of the child with TBI into the family. In addition, further elucidation of the
bidirectional relationship between family functioning and child behavior after an injury
occurs is warranted and should be extended to additional outcomes (eg, cognitive,
behavioral, and psychosocial) beyond those evaluated here. A more detailed characterization
of the optimal family environment for recovery from early childhood TBI could help target
future interventions. Long-term rehabilitation programs that facilitate management of
executive function and attention will be critical for these children to be as successful as
possible. Family and parental training and education would likely be an important
component in these programs.
