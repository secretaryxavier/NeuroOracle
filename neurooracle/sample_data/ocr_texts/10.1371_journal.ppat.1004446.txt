Abstract
ESAT-6, an abundantly secreted protein of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis) is an important virulence factor,
inactivation of which leads to reduced virulence of M. tuberculosis. ESAT-6 alone, or in complex with its chaperone CFP-10
(ESAT-6:CFP-10), is known to modulate host immune responses; however, the detailed mechanisms are not well
understood. The structure of ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex does not suggest presence of enzymatic or DNA-binding
activities. Therefore, we hypothesized that the crucial role played by ESAT-6 in the virulence of mycobacteria could be due
to its interaction with some host cellular factors. Using a yeast two-hybrid screening, we identified that ESAT-6 interacts with
the host protein beta-2-microglobulin (b2M), which was further confirmed by other assays, like GST pull down, co-
immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance. The C-terminal six amino acid residues (90â€“95) of ESAT-6 were found
to be essential for this interaction. ESAT-6, in complex with CFP-10, also interacts with b2M. We found that ESAT-6/ESAT-
6:CFP-10 can enter into the endoplasmic reticulum where it sequesters b2M to inhibit cell surface expression of MHC-I-b2M
complexes, resulting in downregulation of class I-mediated antigen presentation. Interestingly, the ESAT-6:b2M complex
could be detected in pleural biopsies of individuals suffering from pleural tuberculosis. Our data highlight a novel
mechanism by which M. tuberculosis may undermine the host adaptive immune responses to establish a successful
infection. Identification of such novel interactions may help us in designing small molecule inhibitors as well as effective
vaccine design against tuberculosis.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) has remained a major cause of death
worldwide despite the availability of a vaccine and several
chemotherapeutic agents [1]. Global emergence of multi-drug
resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis besides synergy with
HIV [1] warrants a better understanding of the host-M.
tuberculosis interaction in order to develop effective strategies for
containing the disease. Successful infection of macrophages by
pathogenic mycobacteria involves modulation of several immune
functions, which allows them to survive and persist inside the host
[2]. Crucial host cell functions required for development of anti-
mycobacterial immunity like phagosome-lysosome fusion, autoph-
agy, antigen presentation, apoptosis and bactericidal innate
immune responses are known to be inhibited by the pathogenic
mycobacteria [2]. Particularly, the proteins secreted by virulent
mycobacteria are found to play important roles in modulation of
host immune responses [3]. In addition to the classical Sec and Tat
secretion pathway, M. tuberculosis possesses the ESX secretion
system, a Type VII secretion system (T7SS) which is found to be
non-essential for growth in vitro, but is required for bacterial
virulence [4]. Mycobacteria possess at least five ESX secretion
systems, namely ESX-1 through ESX-5 [5]. The first and the most
characterized member of the ESX secretion system family, ESX-1
is encoded by region of difference (RD) 1 which is absent in all
vaccine strains of avirulent M. bovis BCG, but present in the
virulent laboratory and clinical strains of M. bovis and M.
tuberculosis [5]. The RD1 region is also absent in M. microti which
seldom causes disease in immunocompetent individuals [6].
Interestingly, deletion of RD1 results in attenuation of M.
tuberculosis and it is hence implicated to play an important role
in mycobacterial pathogenicity [4,7]. RD1 complemented aviru-
lent M. bovis BCG and M. microti strains were shown to grow
better in severe combined immunodeficient mice and persist
longer in organs of immunocompetent mice corroborating the fact
that deletion of RD1 resulted in attenuation of these strains [8].

Mutants defective for ESX-1 secretion system are found to exhibit
a range of diverse phenotypes, including defects in immune
modulation, tissue invasion, phagosomal trafficking and growth
inside the macrophages [4,9,10].
In M. tuberculosis, the early secretory antigenic target (ESAT)-6
or Rv3875 and the culture filtrate protein (CFP)-10 or Rv3874 are
abundantly produced and secreted in culture. They are also
known to be the most immunogenic molecules found in the culture
filtrate [11,12]. These proteins lack the classical Sec YEG
secretory signal sequences and their secretion was found to be
dependent on ESX-1 [4,8,10]. ESAT-6 and CFP-10 together form
a tight dimer and are dependent on each other for their stability
and secretion [9,13,14]. Along with the ESX-1 secretion system,
ESAT-6 and CFP-10 have been implicated in several virulence
mechanisms of mycobacteria. They are capable of modulating
both innate and adaptive immune responses and inactivation of
ESAT-6 results in dramatically reduced virulence of M. tubercu-
losis [4,8,9]. Interestingly, specific mutations in ESAT-6 that did
not affect functioning of the ESX-1 secretion system caused a loss
of virulence of mycobacteria [13,15]. This implies that ESAT-6
itself is crucial in mediating the virulence functions associated with
the ESX-1 secretion system. ESAT-6 was found to induce
apoptosis of macrophages by activating caspase expression [16].
ESAT-6, CFP-10 and the ESAT6:CFP-10 complex can inhibit
LPS-induced NF-kappaB dependent gene expression by suppress-
ing production of reactive oxygen species [17]. ESAT-6 alone or in
complex with CFP-10 has also been shown to interact with host
proteins like laminin on the basolateral surface of pneumocytes
leading to lysis of these cells that aid in the dissemination of M.
tuberculosis in the human lung [18]. Moreover, ESAT-6 has been
shown to interact directly with toll like receptor (TLR) 2 resulting
in reduced interleukin (IL)-12 p40 secretion in macrophages,
probably favouring a T helper 2 phenotype that helps intracellular
persistence and survival of M. tuberculosis [19]. However, the
exact mechanism of virulence of ESAT-6 is not well understood.
It has been shown that at lower pH, characteristic of the acidic
phagosomal environment, the secreted ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex
can dissociate and once dissociated, ESAT-6 alone can destabilize
and lyse the phagosomal membrane [20]. Therefore, it appears
that the ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex provides the bacteria or its
components the tools necessary to escape from the phagosomal
compartments to interact with the host cellular proteins and
modulate their functions [20]. Based on the solution structure, no
DNA binding or enzymatic function could be ascribed to the
ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex [14] as the surface of the complex was
found to be devoid of any acidic or basic patches characteristic of
DNA-binding proteins and many transcription factors. Similarly,
absence of significant clefts on the surface of the structure,
indicative of an enzyme active site, suggests a non-catalytic role for
this complex. Therefore, we hypothesized that the crucial role
played by ESAT-6 in the virulence of mycobacteria could be due
to its interaction with some host cellular factors, the identification
of which is likely to provide better understanding of the role played
by ESAT-6 in modulation of host immune responses. Accordingly,
the aim of the present study was to identify ESAT-6 interacting
partners of host origin by employing a yeast two hybrid assay
system. Here, we report that ESAT-6 can specifically interact with
beta-2-microglobulin (b2M), a small ,13 kDa protein found to be
associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I
family of proteins that are involved in antigen presentation and
iron regulation. We found that ESAT-6 was able to enter the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it interacts with b2M and
inhibits its association with MHC-I molecules leading to reduced
surface expression of MHC-I-b2M complex and consequently
inhibits loading of antigen-derived peptides to the MHC-I
complex. Data presented in this study highlight the existence of
a novel mechanism by which M. tuberculosis ESAT-6 protein
exerts its virulence by undermining the host adaptive immune
responses to establish a successful infection and these findings may
aid in the development of novel therapeutics against the deadly
disease.
Results
ESAT-6 interacts with human b2M
We carried out yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screening to identify the
probable ESAT-6 interacting proteins from the host. ESAT-6
cloned in the bait vector pGBKT7 was used to screen a human
leukocyte cDNA library cloned into the prey vector pACT2. The
suitability of ESAT-6 for use as bait was confirmed by measuring
its expression as GAL4-ESAT-6 fusion protein and also by
assessing the toxicity of the fusion protein as well as auto-activation
of interaction markers. Yeast strain AH109 expressing the Gal4-
ESAT-6 fusion protein had normal growth kinetics and auto-
activation of the reporter genes was not observed in these
transformants. For Y2H screening, Mat-a strain AH109 harboring
the bait vector pGBKT7-ESAT-6 was mated with Mat-a strain
Y187 transformed with prey library plasmid and the mating
mixture was plated on QDO plates (SD/â€“Ade/â€“His/â€“Leu/â€“Trp)
for high stringency of selection. The prey plasmids, rescued from
the colonies that appeared on selection plates, were sequenced
using 39 AD Sequencing Primer and were identified by querying
these sequences against the NCBI GenBank database using the
MegaBlast program. One of these cDNA sequences in the prey
plasmid was found to have very high similarity with human beta-2-
microglobulin (Figure S1). The interaction was found to be truly
positive as the prey plasmid carrying the b2M cDNA sequence
(pACT2-b2M) failed to grow in the presence of empty bait vector
pGBKT7 alone (Figure 1A).
The physical interaction between ESAT-6 and b2M was
confirmed by a co-purification assay. ESAT-6 was cloned into
the first multiple cloning site (MCS) with an N-terminal His-tag
Author Summary
M. tuberculosis is a dangerous and highly successful
pathogen
that

evolved
several
mechanisms
to
manipulate the host immune regulatory network. Proteins
secreted by M. tuberculosis play important roles in
virulence. One such protein is ESAT-6, which is secreted
along with its chaperone CFP-10. Despite a host of studies
highlighting modulation of immune responses by ESAT-6,
there have not been many that identified host proteins
interacting with ESAT-6. We have now found that the host
protein b2M interacts very specifically with ESAT-6 at its C-
terminal region. The soluble ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex was
found to be trafficked into the endoplasmic reticulum, and
treatment with recombinant ESAT-6:CFP-10 or the over-
expression of ESAT-6 reduced cell surface expression of
b2M and molecules which remain associated with it like
HLA-I. Recombinant ESAT-6:CFP-10 was also found to
reduce classical and cross presentation of peptide antigens
by MHC-I molecules. In summary, our data indicate that
interaction between ESAT-6 and b2M can reduce the levels
of available free b2M that associate with HLA/MHC-I
molecules. This could be an interesting mechanism by
which M. tuberculosis inhibits classical and cross presenta-
tion of peptide antigens in order to prevent or delay the
onset of anti-mycobacterial adaptive immune responses.

and b2M cDNA from the prey plasmid was cloned into the second
MCS without any tag in a dual expression vector pETDuet-1.
When the over-expressed His-tagged ESAT-6 protein was purified
from the transformed Escherichia coli using TALON affinity
binding resin, b2M was found to be co-purified along with His-
tagged ESAT-6, indicating a positive interaction between ESAT-6
and b2M (Figure 1B, Lane 5). b2M is known to possess a 20
amino acid endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localization sequence at
its N-terminal which is removed from the mature protein during
post-translational modifications. Since the prey plasmid cDNA
encoding b2M contained the signal peptide sequence, any
interaction with ESAT-6 through this region would be most likely
Figure 1. ESAT-6 protein interacts with b2M. (A) Interaction between ESAT-6 and b2M in a yeast two-hybrid system was studied by mating yeast
strain AH1109 transformed with bait plasmid pGBKT7-ESAT-6 with yeast strain Y187 transformed with a human leukocyte cDNA prey library on a
synthetic dropout plate (â€“Ade/â€“His/â€“Leu/â€“Trp). Prey cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers encompassing the cDNA insert in pACT2 and
sequenced and identified to be b2M. The AH109 yeast strain transformed with pGBKT7-ESAT-6 and pACT2-b2M shows Ade and His interaction
reporter activation on QDO plates. AH109 transformed with pGBKT7 and pACT2-b2M was used as a negative control while AH109 transformed with
pGBKT7-p53 and pGADT7-T was used as a positive control for the yeast two-hybrid screening. (B) Untagged b2M was cloned along with His-tagged
ESAT-6 in the pETDuet vector system and was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. The transformed cultures were induced with IPTG and the over-
expressed proteins were purified using TALON resin. Purified proteins were separated on a 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and visualized by silver
staining. Lane 1 is a molecular weight marker. (C) b2M with no N-terminal signal sequence (ESAT-6:b2M NSS) and the full length b2M with the N-
terminal signal sequence (ESAT-6:b2M WSS) were cloned in pETDuet vector along with 66His-tagged ESAT-6. Clones were over-expressed in E. coli
BL21. Protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG and over-expressed proteins were purified using metal affinity TALON resin. Purified
proteins were separated on 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with anti-b2M Ab to detect b2M
and anti-His Ab to detect ESAT-6. The bands corresponding to b2M (upper panel) and ESAT-6 (lower panel) were visualized by chemiluminescence.
(D) GST pre-cleared THP-1 macrophage extract was mixed and incubated with Glutathione-agarose bead bound-GST or GST-ESAT-6 and washed. The
bound proteins were eluted and resolved on a 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted for b2M protein using rabbit anti-human b2M Ab
and HRP conjugated anti-rabbit Ab. Blots were visualized by chemiluminescence. Whole cell extracts from THP-1 cells was used as positive control for
b2M expression. (E) In another experiment, purified recombinant 66 His-tagged ESAT-6 was incubated with THP-1 macrophage lysate and
immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-His Ab bound to protein A/G agarose beads. Control immunoprecipitation was carried out without the addition of
His-tagged ESAT-6 protein (IP control). The eluted protein mixture is resolved on a 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted (IB) for b2M
protein using a rabbit anti-human b2M Ab and HRP conjugated anti-rabbit secondary Ab and the blots were visualized by chemiluminescence. Lane 1
is input control. (F) Direct interaction of b2M with ESAT-6 was monitored using a BIACORE 3000 Biosensor where b2M was immobilized on the sensor
chip and recombinant ESAT-6 at different concentrations was injected in the running buffer. The changes in the refraction index at the surface due to
interactions between immobilised b2M and fluid phase ESAT-6 were detected and recorded as RU (Resonance Units). Curves generated from the RU
trace were evaluated using a curve-fitting algorithm. ESAT-6 was found to bind specifically to b2M and no binding was observed in a control cell
which did not have any immobilized b2M. Results are representative of three different experiments.

physiologically
irrelevant.
Therefore,
we
examined
whether
ESAT-6 could actually interact with the mature b2M devoid of
the signal peptide. The N-terminal signal sequence (20 amino
acids) of b2M was therefore truncated and co-expressed along with
His-tagged ESAT-6. It was found that the mature b2M could be
co-purified along with His-tagged ESAT-6 (Figure 1C) indicating
that the N-terminal signal peptide of b2M is not involved in the
interaction with ESAT-6 protein.
We also examined whether ESAT-6 could interact with the
b2M naturally present within mammalian cells. For this, GST-
tagged ESAT-6 was used to pull down b2M from the whole cell
extract prepared from PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages. It
was found that the GST-ESAT-6 fusion protein was able to pull
down b2M while GST alone failed to do so (Figure 1D) indicating
that ESAT-6 can physically interact with mature b2M naturally
expressed in macrophages. To further confirm this observation, a
co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was carried out where
recombinant His-tagged ESAT-6 protein was incubated with
THP-1 whole cell lysate and then anti-His antibody (Ab) coupled
to protein A/G beads was added to the mixture to immunopre-
cipitate the interacting complex. The immunoprecipitated com-
plex was separated by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting
using anti-human b2M Ab. A b2M specific band was detectable in
the His-tagged ESAT-6-immunoprecipitated complex indicating
that ESAT-6 interacts with b2M present in the THP-1 macro-
phages (Figure 1E). Physical interaction of ESAT-6 and b2M was
further confirmed by using surface plasmon resonance (Figure 1F).
The Kd value of the ESAT-6:b2M complex as determined from
the surface plasmon resonance data was 1.0361026 M.
b2M interacts with the C-terminal extreme of ESAT-6
The extreme C-terminus of ESAT-6 is a floppy, structurally ill
defined region, away from the helical core and is not known to be
involved in the interaction with CFP-10 [14]. Mutant M.
tuberculosis expressing a truncated ESAT-6 having residues
deleted from the C-terminal end was found to be attenuated.
However, these mutant strains had a functional ESX-1 system
with normal secretion of the ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex [13,15]
indicating that the residues at the C-terminal end of ESAT-6 are
not required for a structural role in the formation of a heterodimer
with CFP-10 but crucial for the virulence functions of ESAT-6.
Therefore, we speculated that the free C-terminus of ESAT-6 is
probably involved in the interaction with b2M and such an
interaction is possibly critical for M. tuberculosis virulence [21].
Once again using the yeast two hybrid assay, we observed that
deletion of the last 6 amino acids (valine, threonine, glycine,
methionine, phenylalanine and alanine) from the C-terminal end
of ESAT-6 (Figure S2) was sufficient to prevent the interaction of
ESAT-6 and b2M (Figure 2A). To further validate the yeast two
hybrid data, we used a C-terminally truncated ESAT-6 (ESAT-
6DC) to carry out GST pull down assay. The GST-tagged full
length ESAT-6 protein (ESAT-6-GST) as well as the GST-tagged
ESAT-6DC (ESAT-6DC-GST) protein were incubated with THP-
1 extract and the pulled down fractions were probed for the
presence of b2M using anti-b2M Ab. It was found that only the
full length ESAT-6 protein was able to interact with b2M
(Figure 2B). To further confirm our observations, we carried out a
Co-IP assay where THP-1 lysates were incubated with full length
His-tagged ESAT-6 or His-tagged ESAT-6DC and b2M-com-
plexes
were
immunoprecipitated
using
anti-b2M
Ab.
The
immunoprecipitated complexes were resolved on SDS-PAGE
and probed with either anti-His Ab to detect ESAT-6/ESAT-6DC
(Figure 2C, upper panel) or anti-b2M Ab to detect b2M
(Figure 2C, lower panel). The data shown in Figure 2C clearly
demonstrate that anti-b2M antibody can immunoprecipitate the
full length ESAT-6 (Figure 2C, Lane 3), but not the mutant
ESAT-6DC (Figure 2C, Lane 4), indicating that the C-terminal
(90â€“95) residues of ESAT-6 are important for its interaction with
b2M. Lane 5 of Figure 2C is negative control where Protein A/G
beads were used to rule out any non-specific adsorption to the
beads. Lanes 1 and 2 of Figure 2C are input controls showing the
presence of b2M (lower panel) and ESAT-6 (Lane 1, upper panel)
or ESAT-6DC (Lane 2, upper panel) in the reaction mixture
containing THP-1 lysate and His-tagged ESAT-6 or ESAT-6DC.
ESAT-6 is predominantly secreted by M. tuberculosis as a tight
1:1 heterodimeric complex with CFP-10 through the ESX-1
secretion system [22]. Earlier we found that the C-terminal end of
ESAT-6 (amino acid residues 90â€“95) is involved in interaction
with b2M (Figure 2, Aâ€“C). Since the C-terminal end of ESAT-6 in
the ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex is essentially exposed [14] (Figure
S3), it is possible that ESAT-6 while in complex with CFP-10 can
still interact with b2M. Therefore, the ability of the ESAT-6:CFP-
10 complex to interact with b2M was examined by a co-
immunoprecipitation assay. Affinity purified His-tagged ESAT-
6:CFP-10 or ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 or CFP-10 alone was incubated
with THP-1 macrophage lysate. Mouse anti-human b2M Ab was
then added to these mixtures and detection of b2M-bound His-
tagged ESAT-6 protein was carried out using rabbit anti-His Ab.
We were able to detect a band corresponding to the size of His-
tagged ESAT-6 in the reaction mixture containing ESAT-6:CFP-
10 (Figure 2D, Lane 6), however, ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 or CFP-10
does not interact with b2M present in the THP-1 extract
(Figure 2D, Lanes 7 and 8). Similarly, ESAT-6:CFP-10 was also
found to interact with mouse b2M (Figure S4). These results
suggest that ESAT-6 alone or in complex with CFP-10 is capable
of interacting with b2M and the C-terminal six amino acid
residues (90â€“95) of ESAT-6 are crucial for this interaction.
So far we observed that the C-terminal end of ESAT-6 was
involved in interaction with b2M. Since b2M is an integral part of
the functional MHC class I molecules, we next examined whether
ESAT-6 can interact with HLA-bound b2M also. Therefore,
PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophage lysate was mixed and
incubated with either recombinant ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10
and the interacting complexes were pulled down using mouse anti-
human HLA class I and probed with anti-His as well as anti-b2M
antibodies. It was found that b2M but not ESAT-6 could be
immunoprecipitated along with HLA-I (Figure S5). These results
indicate that ESAT-6 binds only to the free b2M, but not to that
already in complex with HLA-I heavy chain.
ESAT-6:b2M interaction is not affected by high salt
concentrations and pH
Interestingly, the interaction between ESAT-6 and b2M was
found to be significantly stable at high ionic concentrations. The
b2M in the ESAT-6:b2M complex immobilized to talon beads
failed to dissociate from the His-tagged ESAT-6 protein even after
washing with buffers containing NaCl as high as 2 M (Figure 3A).
Stability of the ESAT-6:b2M complex in the presence of high salt
and the neutral nature of the amino-acids indicate that the ESAT-
6:b2M complex is stabilized by hydrophobic rather than ionic
interactions.
By changing the protonation state of the charged residues, the
pH can significantly influence the nature of protein-protein
interactions. pH can considerably dictate the strength and
geometry
of
electrostatic
interactions,
conformation
of
the
interacting proteins, as well as protein hydration which are critical
in stabilization of protein-protein interactions. Therefore, the
effect of pH was examined on the stability of ESAT-6:b2M

complex. The stability of the ESAT-6:b2M complex at various pH
was confirmed by glutaraldehyde cross-linking of ESAT-6 and
b2M. Covalent cross-linking of two proteins is usually considered
to be a convincing evidence of their physical proximity and
interaction. Glutaraldehyde was found to covalently cross-link
ESAT-6 and b2M at pH 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and 8.0. The covalently
cross-linked ESAT-6:b2M protein complex was detectable as a
,24 kDa band on a denaturing SDS gel (Figure 3B). These
observations further confirm the stability of the ESAT-6:b2M
complex across a wide pH range.
ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 is trafficked into the ER
The functional implications of protein-protein interactions
depend on the spatial and temporal localization of the interacting
partners within the cell. Therefore, in order to have a pathophys-
iological role in the host-pathogen interaction, ESAT-6 and/or
ESAT-6:CFP-10 must find its way to the cellular compartments
where b2M is present. b2M is known to be present in high
concentration within endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where it is
synthesized and undergoes necessary post-translational modifica-
tions and associates with the alpha chain of the MHC-I, as well as
other class I like molecules like CD1 and hemochromatosis protein
(HFE) that are transported to the cell surface via the golgi
apparatus [23,24].
Interestingly, ESAT-6 and/or ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex secret-
ed by the M. tuberculosis bacilli in the phagosome or cytoplasm
can make its way out by lysing the cell membranes [25,26] which
can be taken up by the surrounding macrophages and dendritic
cells. Another possible source of soluble ESAT-6 and/or ESAT-
6:CFP-10 is mycobacteria surviving in the extracellular milieu of
Figure 2. ESAT-6 with a deletion of six C-terminal amino acids (ESAT-6DC) fails to interact with b2M. (A) Yeast strain AH109 transformed
with ESAT-6/ESAT-6DC bait along with b2M prey plasmid were streaked on interaction selection QDO plates (SD/â€“Ade/â€“His/â€“Leu/â€“Trp) along with
the controls and monitored the growth resulting from positive interactions. (B) ESAT-6 or ESAT-6DC expressed as GST fusion protein was incubated
with THP-1 lysate and precipitated using glutathione-agarose. Presence of b2M in the precipitated complexes was detected by Western blotting
using anti-b2M Ab. (C) Recombinant His-tagged ESAT-6 or His-tagged ESAT-6DC protein was mixed and incubated with THP-1 cell extracts and b2M
was immunoprecipitated using mouse anti-human b2M Ab and protein A/G beads. Presence of ESAT-6/ESAT-6DC and b2M in the
immunoprecipitated complexes were detected by Western blotting using rabbit anti-His Ab and rabbit anti-human b2M Ab respectively. Lanes 1
and 2 are input controls. (D) THP-1 macrophage whole cell extract was mixed and incubated with recombinant ESAT-6:CFP-10 or mutant ESAT-
6DC:CFP-10 or CFP-10 protein. b2M was immunoprecipitated using protein A/G bound mouse anti-human b2M Ab and the immune complexes were
subjected to Western blotting using rabbit anti-His Ab to detect ESAT-6:CFP-10 or mutant ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 or CFP-10. The lanes 1â€“3 are input
controls for these recombinant proteins (upper panel). In the lower panel, the lanes 1â€“3 indicate the levels of b2M in the input controls as determined
by Western blotting using rabbit anti-human b2M Ab.

caseating
granulomas
where
the
proteins
secreted
by
the
extracellular bacilli are available for uptake by antigen presenting
cells present in these granulomas [27]. Interestingly, studies have
indicated that soluble proteins can gain direct access to the ER
lumen of dendritic cells [28]. Therefore, soluble ESAT-6 and/or
ESAT-6:CFP-10 taken up by macrophages and dendritic cells may
be retrotranslocated directly to the ER of these cells which would
enable it to interact with b2M and modulate b2M-dependent
responses. To test this, THP-1 macrophages were incubated for
2 hours with FITC-labelled ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 and their
localization was tracked along with the ER-specific marker
calnexin by confocal microscopy. The ESAT-6:CFP-10 was found
to be present in the ER (Figure 4B). Similarly, FITC-labelled
ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex was also found to be present within the
ER-tracker dye-positive regions in THP-1 macrophages (Fig-
ure 4D) as well as in mouse peritoneal macrophages (Figure 4E).
Similarly, FITC-labelled ESAT-6 alone was found to be present in
the ER-tracker dye-positive regions of KG-1 dendritic like cells
(Figure 4C). FITC-labelled ESAT-6:CFP-10 was incubated with
THP-1 macrophages at 4uC as a negative control for internalisa-
tion (Figure 4A). These observations suggest that soluble ESAT-6
and ESAT-6:CFP-10 can translocate into the ER lumen from the
extracellular milieu to interact with the resident b2M in KG-1 cells
and macrophages. From the confocal microscopy data, it appears
that ESAT-6:CFP-10 is able to enter the vesicles of the phagocytic
pathway as well as other cellular compartments since all the FITC
signal emanating from labelled ESAT-6:CFP-10 did not superim-
pose with the signal
emanating from ER-specific
markers
(Figure 4). However, as is evident from the data, sufficient
quantities of ESAT-6/ESAT-6:CFP-10 are able to translocate to
the ER where the complex is available for possible interaction with
b2M.

glutaraldehyde treatment for 15, 20 and 30 minutes at 37uC and resolved on a 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gel and visualized by silver staining. Protein

ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 inhibits surface expression of
b2M
In the ER lumen, b2M associates with MHC class I molecules
to form class I complexes which are then loaded with peptide and
transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation to CD8+ T
cells. It is possible that once translocated to the ER, ESAT-6:CFP-
10 can interact and sequester b2M and thereby reduce the
availability of free b2M to form complex with HLA class I
molecules. In such situations, the surface levels of both MHC and
b2M molecules are likely to be decreased. Expectedly, when THP-
1 macrophages were incubated with recombinant ESAT-6:CFP-
10 protein at two different concentrations [17,25], surface b2M
levels were found to be decreased in a concentration dependent
manner (Figure 5A and Figure S6). Interestingly, no significant
changes in the surface expression of b2M were noticed in the
presence of mutant ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 complex or CFP-10 alone
(Figure 5A), indicating that suppression of b2M surface expression
was possibly due to its sequestration by the intact C-terminal
region of ESAT-6. To rule out the possibility that the reduction in
surface b2M levels was due to toxicity of the ESAT-6:CFP-10
complex, an MTT viability assay was performed with THP-1
macrophages treated with ESAT-6:CFP-10. We found that the
viability of the ESAT-6:CFP-10 treated cells was not affected
(Figure S7). Another possibility is that incubation with ESAT-
6:CFP-10 may have caused general trafficking defects to reduce
the surface expression of b2M. To rule out this, we examined the
surface expression of other cell surface markers like Mac-1, TLR4,
MHC-II and CD14 using flow cytometry. Levels of all these
molecules were found to remain unchanged in ESAT-6:CFP-10
treated cells (Figure S8). ESAT-6:CFP-10 also did not affect b2M
expression at the protein and mRNA level (Figure S9). These data
indicate that the reduction of surface b2M levels was possibly due
to physical sequestration of b2M by ESAT-6 inside the ER. M.
tuberculosis may escape from the phagosome to the host cytoplasm
of infected cells in an RD1 dependent manner and secrete ESAT-
6:CFP-10 directly into the cytoplasm of infected cells [26] which
may find its way into the ER lumen to interact with the resident
b2M. To test this hypothesis, we over-expressed FLAG- or GFP-
tagged ESAT-6 in cells in an attempt to mimic physiological
conditions where ESAT-6 is secreted directly into the cytosol. We
transfected HEK-293 cells with pcDNA 3.1(+)-FLAG-esat-6 and
studied localization of ESAT-6 (stained with anti-FLAG Ab) in ER
by confocal microscopy and was found to be present in the
calnexin-positive ER compartments (Figure 5B) suggesting that
intracellular ESAT-6 can also find its way into the ER. We also
performed co-immunoprecipitation studies in cells over-expressing
full length ESAT-6 or ESAT-6DC cloned with an N-terminal
EGFP tag in pEGFP-C1. ESAT-6 and b2M complexes could be
pulled down from the whole cell lysates of HEK-293 cells over-
expressing pEGFP-C1-esat-6 but not from cells transfected with
pEGFP-C1 vector alone or pEGFP-C1-esat-6DC (Figure 5C).
Also, we were able to pull down the ESAT-6:b2M complex from
the enriched ER fraction of HEK-293 cells transfected with
pEGFP-C1-esat-6 but not from cells transfected with the vector
alone, indicating that ESAT-6:b2M complex was present inside
the ER (Figure 5D). These data suggest that intracellular ESAT-6
is not only able to enter the ER but also can interact with the ER-
resident b2M. We next examined, whether such interaction of
ESAT-6 with b2M in ER has any effect on the surface b2M levels.
Therefore, THP-1 cells were nucleofected and HEK-293 cells
were transfected with pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-C1-esat-6 or pEGFP-
C1-esat-6DC. Nucleofection efficiency for THP-1 was found to be
,30% and transfection efficiency for HEK-293 was found to be
,50%. Surface b2M expression on GFP positive cells was
measured by flow cytometry using PE conjugated anti-human
b2M Ab. It was observed that the intracellular expression of
ESAT-6 resulted in reduction of surface b2M levels in THP-1
(Figure 5E) and HEK-293 (Figure 5F) cells when compared to the
cells transfected with pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-esat-6DC.
ESAT-6:CFP-10 treatment affects expression of HLA class I
molecules
Beta-2-microglobulin remains associated with HLA class I, CD1
and HFE molecules on the cell surface. Any change in the levels of
b2M would probably lead to changes in the cell surface expression
of HLA class I, CD1 and HFE. As ESAT-6:CFP-10 treatment
leads to reduction in surface expression of b2M (Figure 5), we next
examined whether it has any effect on HLA class I expression. For
this purpose, we utilized two different types of anti-HLA
antibodies: HC-10 and W6/32. HC-10 is a monoclonal Ab that
can detect only the free HLA-I heavy chain molecules not
complexed with b2M [29]. Newly synthesized HLA molecules
form a tri-molecular complex with b2M and antigenic peptide
which is transported to the surface to present the peptide to its
cognate T cell receptor (TCR) [30]. In contrast, it has been
reported that heavy chains of MHC class I alleles can also progress
to the cell surface alone without being associated with b2M. Such
free MHC class I heavy chains are present normally on cells,
especially in activated lymphocytes [31], dendritic cells and
macrophages and have been found to be upregulated in patients
suffering from spondyloarthropathy [32]. Interestingly, we ob-
served an increased binding of HC-10 Ab in THP-1 macrophages
treated with ESAT-6:CFP-10 but not with ESAT-6DC:CFP-10
(Figures 6A and 6B). Increased HC-10 staining upon addition of
ESAT-6:CFP-10 was observed also by confocal microscopy where
intracellular levels of the free HLA molecules can also be
determined (Figure 6C). These data clearly suggest that the levels
of b2M-free HLA class I molecules were increased on the surface
as well as intracellularly after treatment with ESAT-6:CFP-10.
Free HLA class I molecules are not only transported to the cell
surface but a portion may also undergo proteasomal degradation
since addition of MG-132 (a proteasomal inhibitor) to THP-1
macrophages resulted in increased HC-10 staining which was
further intensified in the presence of ESAT-6:CFP-10 (Figures 6D
and 6E). Therefore, it appears that once ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex
sequesters b2M inside the ER, the number free HLA class I heavy
chain molecules are increased due to less availability of free b2M
molecules to associate with them. This would possibly explain the
increase in HC-10 staining observed in the presence of ESAT-
6:CFP-10.
Figure 4. Exogenously added ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex can enter into ER. PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages were
incubated with FITC-labelled ESAT-6:CFP-10 (green) either at 4uC (A) or 37uC (B) for about 120 minutes. Cells were then washed, fixed, permeabilised
and stained for an ER marker calnexin using rabbit anti-calnexin Ab and Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated anti-rabbit secondary Ab (red). In another set of
experiments KG-1 dendritic like cells (C) or PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages (D) or thioglycolate-elicited C57BL/6 mouse peritoneal
macrophages (E) were treated with FITC-labelled ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 (green) for about 100 minutes at 37uC and then incubated with ER-Tracker
dye (blue) for another 20 minutes and observed under the LSM 510 Meta confocal microscope. Results are representative of three different
experiments.

On the other hand, when the surface expression of b2M-
complexed HLA class I molecules was measured with the help of
W6/32, (a monoclonal Ab that recognizes a conformation specific
epitope on the HLA class I molecules only when associated with
b2M [33,34]) we observed a significant decrease in staining in
ESAT-6:CFP-10-treated but not in ESAT-6DC:CFP-10-treated
cells (Figures 7A and 7B). Also, a pull down assay with W6/32
yielded lesser amount of b2M in ESAT-6:CFP-10 treated cells,
indicating that less amount of b2M was complexed with HLA class
I molecules in these cells compared to untreated as well as those
treated with ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 (Figure 7C). Data from Figures 6
and 7 indicate that ESAT6:CFP-10 can sequester free b2M in ER
resulting in reduced HLA class I-b2M complex formation and
consequently increasing the levels of free HLA class I heavy chain
molecules.
ESAT-6:CFP-10 inhibits MHC-I presentation of SIINFEKL
peptide derived from cytoplasmic and soluble ovalbumin
Most cytoplasmic antigens are processed by the proteasomal
machinery and the derived restricted peptides are presented by the
MHC-I molecules to CD8+ T cells. We have observed earlier that
surface expression of b2M and MHC-I molecules is reduced in
macrophages treated with ESAT-6:CFP-10 (Figures 5A, 7A and
7B). We also found that ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex is able to enter
Figure 5. Exogenous addition of ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex or transient expression of ESAT-6 downregulates expression of surface
b2M. (A) PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophages were treated with ESAT-6:CFP-10 or ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 or CFP-10 protein for 2 hours and stained
with PE conjugated anti-human b2M Ab for measuring surface expression of b2M by flow cytometry. Median fluorescence intensities of the b2M
levels of various groups were calculated and the results are shown as mean 6 SD of 3 different experiments. (B) HEK-293 cells were transfected with
either pcDNA 3.1 (+)-FLAG control plasmid or pcDNA 3.1 (+)-FLAG-esat-6 and after 20â€“24 hours, cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with anti-
calnexin Ab followed by Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated anti-rabbit secondary Ab (red) to visualize the endoplasmic reticulum and anti-FLAG Ab followed
by Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated secondary anti-mouse Ab (green) to visualize intracellular ESAT-6. Nucleus was visualized by DAPI staining (blue). Cells
were observed under confocal microscope. (C) Lysates prepared from the HEK-293 cells transfected with either pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-C1-esat-6 or
pEGFP-CI-esat-6DC were incubated with anti-GFP Ab bound to protein A/G agarose beads. Immunoprecipitated complexes (Lanes 4â€“6) were
separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane which was probed with anti-b2M Ab. About 10% of the lysates were
loaded as input control (Lanes 1â€“3). (D) HEK-293 cells were transfected with either pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-C1-esat-6 and after 20â€“24 hours, cells were
used to prepare enriched rough endoplasmic reticulum fractions (RER). Equal amounts of proteins extracted from the enriched RER fractions were
incubated with anti-GFP Ab bound to protein A/G agarose beads (Lanes 3 and 4). Immunoprecipitated complexes were separated on a 15% SDS-
PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and was probed with anti-b2M Ab. About 10% of the lysates of enriched RER fractions (Lanes 1
and 2) were loaded as input controls. (E) THP-1 cells were nucleofected and (F) HEK-293 cells were transfected with either pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-C1-

was measured by flow cytometry for EGFP-positive cells. Results are representative of three different experiments.

vesicles of the phagocytic system and ER network (Figure 4 and
Figure 5B) and by interacting and sequestering b2M can reduce
b2M-MHC-I complex formation (Figure 7C). Therefore, we
expected a reduction in the amount of peptides derived from the
cytoplasmic antigens to be presented on MHC-I-b2M complex at
the cell surface leading to inefficient presentation of antigen-
derived peptides to CD8+ T cells. Therefore, thioglycolate-elicited
mouse peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice (H-2Kb) were
cytosolically loaded with native ovalbumin (OVA) and the levels of
ovalbumin-derived SIINFEKL peptide (OVA257â€“264) presented by
H-2Kb was examined by flow cytometry in the absence or
presence of ESAT-6:CFP-10 or ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 complex.
Our data indicate that the surface levels of SIINFEKL in complex
with H-2Kb were significantly reduced in cells treated with ESAT-
6:CFP-10 protein when compared with ovalbumin-pulsed cells
treated with either medium or ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 protein
(Figure 8A). We also confirmed the staining experiment with an
IL-2 assay as a read out for T cell function. The results show that
the decreased SIINFEKL staining in cells treated with ESAT-
6:CFP-10 actually correlates with a functional defect in presen-
tation of ovalbumin antigen (Figure 8B).
Cross-presentation is a process by which endocytosed antigens
are processed and presented by the MHC-I system. Cross-
presentation is thought to be highly relevant to the development of
adaptive immunity against M. tuberculosis infection [35]. There-
fore, presence of ESAT-6 in the ER can also affect cross-
presentation of exogenously added antigens. When peritoneal
macrophages from C57BL/6 mice were pre-treated with soluble
ESAT-6:CFP-10, washed and incubated with soluble ovalbumin
antigen, cross-presentation of SIINFEKL peptide derived from the

macrophages were treated with either ESAT-6:CFP-10 or ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 protein (12.5 mM each). After 2 hours, cells were washed and incubated
with anti-HLA class I heavy chain mAb HC-10 followed by FITC conjugated anti-mouse secondary Ab. Surface expression of free HLA class I heavy
chain molecules were studied by flow cytometry. Cells stained with appropriate isotype Ab were used as control. (B) Median fluorescence intensities
of different experimental groups described in Figure 6A were calculated and the results are shown as mean 6 SD of 3 different experiments. (C) THP-

DAPI staining (blue). The stained cells were observed under a confocal microscope. (D) In another set of experiments, THP-1 macrophages were pre-
treated for 30 minutes with 5 mM MG-132 followed by incubation with either ESAT-6:CFP-10 or ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 protein (12.5 mM each) for 2 hours.
Free HLA class I molecules on the cell surface were stained with HC-10 Ab followed by staining with FITC conjugated anti-mouse secondary Ab and

soluble ovalbumin on MHC-I was poor as compared to the cells
treated with either medium or ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 protein
(Figure 8C). This study indicates that ESAT-6:CFP-10 also affects
the cross-presentation of endocytosed antigens.
The ESAT-6:b2M complex exists in the pleural biopsy of
individuals suffering from pleural TB
Pleural TB is known to be the second most common form of
extra-pulmonary TB. Rupture of caseous granulomas into the
pleura marks the beginning of pleural tuberculosis. The conditions
manifested in pleural TB resemble those observed in a delayed
type hypersensitivity reactions [36]. It has been reported that the
pleural fluid in the pleural TB patients contains considerably
higher amounts of b2M [37]. ESAT-6 and CFP-10 were also
found to be present in the pleural effusions [38]. Indeed, we were
able to find significantly higher levels of b2M in the pleural biopsy
of the pleural TB patients as compared to those suffering from
non-TB pleuritis (Figure 9A). The presence of ESAT-6:b2M
complexes in these samples were detected by using a sandwich
enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) where anti-b2M Ab
was used for capture and anti-ESAT-6 Ab was used for detection.
The pleural TB positive samples with higher b2M levels were also
found to have higher ESAT-6:b2M complexes compared to the
patients suffering from non-tuberculous pleuritis (Figure 9B).
Results of the sandwich ELISA indicate that the ESAT-6:b2M
complex can also exist in pathophysiological settings like pleural
fluid of individuals suffering from pleural TB.

Discussion
ESAT-6 and CFP-10 of M. tuberculosis are secreted by the
ESX-1 system into the host and believed to contribute to
mycobacterial virulence [20]. However, the exact molecular
mechanism by which ESAT-6 exerts its virulence effects is not
well understood. Using a yeast two hybrid screening, where
ESAT-6 was used as bait to screen a human leukocyte prey cDNA
library, we were able to identify b2M as an interacting partner of
ESAT-6. The yeast two-hybrid data for ESAT-6:b2M interaction
was further confirmed by surface plasmon resonance analysis, co-
purification, GST pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays.
The data from all these studies point to a strong interaction
between ESAT-6 and b2M. The ESAT-6:b2M interaction was
found to be stable across a wide pH range and salt concentrations
as high as 2M indicating interaction between these two proteins is
stabilized by hydrophobic interactions.
b2M is a ,13 kDa polypeptide that is found in the serum as
well as in tight association with MHC-I heavy chain on the surface
of nearly all nucleated cells [39]. b2M is also associated with CD1,
involved in the presentation of lipid antigens to T cells [40] and
HFE which is known to regulate intracellular iron concentration
[41]. Association of b2M with the a chain of HLA/MHC-I, CD1
and HFE is a prerequisite for the cell-surface expression of these
receptors [39â€“42]. We observed that over-expression of ESAT-6
in the cell cytoplasm or exogenous addition of ESAT-6:CFP-10
complex reduced the cell surface translocation of b2M in
macrophages without affecting the total cellular b2M content.
This may potentially lead to interference not only with protein and
lipid antigen presentation but also with iron metabolism. Iron is
essential
for the
growth of M. tuberculosis
and
therefore
manipulation of the host iron homeostasis can be an important
virulence strategy for M. tuberculosis. Interestingly, HFE knock-
out as well as b2M knock-out mice showed an increased

derived from OVA on MHC-I is quantitated by FACS using an Ab that recognizes SIINFEKL bound to H-2Kb MHC-I and median fluorescence intensities

susceptibility to experimental infection with M. avium and during
infection these animals were found to accumulate iron inside the
granuloma macrophages [21,43]. Thus, ESAT-6:CFP-10 perhaps
play multiple roles in M. tuberculosis virulence.
The dissociation constant of b2M and HLA-AB heavy chain is
161028 M [44] and that for b2M and ESAT-6 is 1.0361026 M,
as calculated from the SPR studies. Since, the affinity of b2M for
HLA-AB heavy chain is higher than its affinity for ESAT-6, it is
most likely that ESAT-6 when present in high concentrations,
binds to portion of available free b2M pool before it forms
complex with the HLA heavy chain. This probably explains the
partial inhibition observed in the surface expression of b2M and
HLA class I and class I-restricted antigen presentation. Overall,
our results suggest that ESAT-6 if present in the cell at a given
point in time, as can happen during the course of infection, can
potentially compromise the function of b2M, HLA class I
molecules and interfere with antigen presentation.
Interestingly, UL18, a human cytomegalovirus protein is known
to bind b2M and reduce the maturation of cellular MHC-I
molecules on cell surface [45]. Also, b2M-deficient mice are found
to be more susceptible to mycobacterial infection as compared to
the wild-type mice [21], suggesting that b2M and/or b2M-
dependent factors are probably important for resistance against
mycobacteria. Therefore, it appears logical that targeting b2M
and cellular processes regulated by it would be beneficial for the
survival of M. tuberculosis.
The structural core of the ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex consists of
two similar helixâ€“turnâ€“helix hairpin structures from each protein,
and is stabilized by an extensive hydrophobic contact surface. The
alpha helical cores lie anti-parallel to each other to form a four-
helix bundle. The extreme C-terminus of ESAT-6 (residues 84â€“95)
was found to be free and was not involved in interaction with CFP-
10 [13â€“15]. Interestingly, a recombinant M. tuberculosis strain
H37Rv EsxAD84â€“95 expressing a mutant form of ESAT-6 with a
C-terminal deletion of 12 amino acid residues was found to possess
a functional ESX-1 system (as it was shown to secrete ESAT-6 and
CFP-10 efficiently), but was attenuated in a mouse infection model
[13â€“15]. This implies that the C-terminus of ESAT-6 does not
play a significant structural role, but is required for M. tuberculosis
virulence. Interestingly, we found that deletion of the last 6 amino
acids (valine, threonine, glycine, methionine, phenylalanine and
alanine) from the C-terminal end of ESAT-6 inhibited formation
of the ESAT-6:b2M complex. The ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 complex
which failed to interact with b2M also failed to reduce the surface
b2M as well as HLA expression. The loss of b2M binding activity
thus may well correlate with the attenuation of strains harbouring
the mutant ESAT-6 with the last 12 amino acid deletion in the C-
terminus region as reported earlier [13â€“15]. It appears that CFP-
10 and ESAT-6 stabilizes each other through extensive hydro-
phobic interactions spanning their core helix-loop-helix structure,
while the free flexible C-terminal end of ESAT-6 is available for
interaction with b2M and possibly other host proteins. True to this
expectation, we found that anti-b2M Ab could co-immunopre-
cipitate both the ESAT-6 and ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex but not
the C-terminally truncated ESAT-6DC alone or in complex with
CFP-10. Based on the observations made by us and others [13], it
is tempting to speculate that the interaction of ESAT-6 through its
free C-terminal end with b2M and possibly other host proteins is
required for its virulence properties.
Interestingly, exogenously added ESAT-6 and ESAT-6:CFP-10
complex coupled with FITC was able to find its way to the ER of
dendritic cells and macrophages. It is interesting to note that fluid
phase proteins like human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein US6
and the Pseudomonas aureginosa derived Exotoxin A that escape
proteolytic degradation can enter into the ER lumen directly
[28,46]. However, the exact mechanism by which ESAT-6/
ESAT-6:CFP-10 is retrotransported to the ER is not understood.
One of the possibilities could be leaching into the cells due to the
pore forming ability of ESAT-6 [25,47]. In fact, M. tuberculosis
and M. leprae but not M. bovis BCG are known to rely on ESAT-
6:CFP-10 to escape from the phagolysosome to the cytosol in
myeloid cells [26]. Again, ESAT-6 but not CFP-10 was able to
hemolyse RBCs by forming pores in their membranes which could
be plugged by using the appropriate polethylene glycol [47]. These
evidence suggest that ESAT-6 or ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex may
gain access to the ER compartment either through pore formation
or via the cytosolic detour pathway [26,48]. Exogenously added
soluble ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex was found to reduce the amount

mature MHC-I-b2M complexes may in turn could affect the
subsequent priming of CD8+ T cells to undermine the anti-
mycobacterial immunity.
A CD8+ T cell response is perhaps crucial for immunity in
already established tuberculosis [49]. M. tuberculosis-specific
CD8+ T cells have been found to be present in granulomas and
pleural exudates of TB patients sometimes more in numbers than
that of CD4+ T cells [50,51]. Moreover, adoptive transfer of CD8+
T cells provides protection in BCG and M. tuberculosis challenged
mice [52,53]. Also, mice deficient in b2M and TAP are more
susceptible to tuberculosis [21,54]. CD8 deficient mice are still
susceptible to M. tuberculosis infection though not to the extent of
b2m2/2 mice [55,56]. Given the importance of CD8+ T cells and
the class I antigen presentation pathway in immunity against M.
tuberculosis, the ability to downregulate CD8+ T cell activation
can be highly advantageous to M. tuberculosis in its constant tug of
war with the host immune system. Since, ESAT-6 is highly
expressed especially during the initial stages of infection [35] and is
a secretory protein, M. tuberculosis may deploy ESAT-6 or ESAT-
6:CFP-10 complex to sequester b2M in the cell to suppress
presentation of mycobacterial antigens and thereby subvert
generation of crucial anti-mycobacterial adaptive immune re-
sponses. It is also possible that ESAT-6:CFP-10 from resident M.
tuberculosis, especially macrophages can interfere with the class I
antigen presentation pathway and prevent the clearance of
infected cells by the cytolytic CD8+ T cells. We have carried out
experiments that mimic the presence of ESAT-6 both extracellu-
larly and intracellularly. In both the conditions, we found that the
surface b2M levels were reduced suggesting a role of ESAT-6 in
interfering with class I antigen presentation.
Interestingly, in addition to b2M alone, the ESAT-6:b2M
complex could be detected in the pleural fluid of the patients
suffering from pleural tuberculosis indicating the pathophysiolog-
ical importance of ESAT6:b2M interactions in vivo. However, the
mechanisms leading to the formation of ESAT-6:b2M complex in
the pleural fluid are not clear at present.
In summary, our data demonstrate that ESAT-6 and ESAT-
6:CFP-10 complex interacts and sequesters one of the host
proteins b2M to inhibit surface expression of b2M-associated
molecules and consequently can suppress antigen presentation by
MHC-I-b2M complex. The free C-terminal end of ESAT-6 is
required for such interaction and possibly virulence. However, the
exact molecular mechanisms by which the ESAT-6 or ESAT-
6:CFP10 complex gains access to the ER resident b2M is yet to be
understood. Results presented in our manuscript not only identify
a novel interaction but also highlight a novel mechanism of
suppression of MHC-I antigen presentation that might play a
crucial role in subverting adaptive immune responses during M.
tuberculosis infection. Therefore, the identification of ESAT-6 and
b2M interaction, not only sheds new light on the host pathogen
relationship, but also opens up avenues for development of small
molecule inhibitors or vaccine for tuberculosis therapy.
Materials and Methods
Yeast two-hybrid interaction screening
Library screening was performed according to the user manual
(Yeast Protocols Handbook from Clontech). Yeast cell strain
AH109 transformed with the bait plasmid pGBKT7-ESAT-6 was
mated with yeast strain Y187 transformed with a human leukocyte
cDNA prey library obtained from Clontech (Clontech Laborato-
ries, USA). Tranformants were plated and grown on SD/â€“Ade/â€“
His/â€“Leu/â€“Trp medium (QDO plates) for 5 days at 30uC to
screen for ADE2 and HIS3 expression. The colonies those
appeared on the QDO plates were sub-streaked five times to dilute
non-specific library plasmids. The positive colonies were used for
bait plasmid isolation as described by Robzyk and Kassir [57].
Prey cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers encompassing
the cDNA insert in pACT2 and sequenced using an automated
DNA sequencer. The cDNA sequences were identified using
online PSI-BLASTX searches (National Center for Biotechnology
Information).
Cell culture
The human monocyte/macrophage cell line THP-1 was
obtained from National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune,
India. The suspension cell line was maintained in RPMI-1640
medium (Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat
inactivated FBS (Hyclone, USA), antibiotic-antimycotic (16,
containing Penicillin G, Streptomycin, Amphotericin B), 2 mM
L-Glutamine and 10 mM HEPES (All from GIBCO, USA) and
maintained at 37uC and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. The
KG-1 cells obtained from National Centre for Cell Science
(NCCS), Pune, India were grown in Iscoveâ€™s Modified Dulbeccoâ€™s
Medium or IMDM (HyClone, USA) supplemented with 20%
FBS, 16 antibiotic-antimycotic, 2 mM L-Glutamine and 10 mM
HEPES and maintained at 37uC and 5% CO2 in a humidified
incubator. Similarly, HEK-293 cells were maintained in DMEM
(Hyclone, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat inactivated
FBS (Hyclone, USA), antibiotic-antimycotic (16, containing
penicillin G, streptomycin, amphotericin B), 2 mM L-Glutamine
and 10 mM HEPES (all from GIBCO, USA) and maintained at
37uC and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. THP-1 monocytic
cells were differentiated into macrophages by incubating cells
them with 5 ng/ml of PMA (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 12 hours
followed by a resting period of 24 hours in medium containing
10% FBS. For some experiments, peritoneal macrophages were
harvested from C57BL/6 mice obtained from National Institute of
Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad. Mice of either sex, 6â€“8 weeks old,
were injected intra-peritoneally with 1 ml of 4% thioglycolate
broth and after 3 days, peritoneal macrophages were isolated as
described earlier [58,59]. The mice were maintained and the
experiments were conducted at the animal house facility of
National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad following the
guidelines of the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee. Harvest-
ed cells were washed and used for further experiments. All cells
(THP-1 macrophages and thioglycolate elicited mouse peritoneal
cells) were incubated with recombinant proteins in incomplete
culture medium without FBS for 2 hours. For some experiments,
before the addition of recombinant proteins, cells were treated
with 10 mM MG-132 (Calbiochem, USA).
Purification of recombinant proteins
ESAT-6 ORF cloned in pET23a was used for purification of
His-tagged ESAT-6 as described elsewhere [20]. In brief, protein
expression was induced in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) transformed
with pET23a-ESAT-6 by addition of isopropyl-b-D-galactopyr-
anoside (IPTG) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) to a final concentration of
1 mM. ESAT-6 protein was purified from cell pellet under
denaturing conditions using 8 M urea (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and
the denatured protein was refolded back by sequential removal of
urea. For purification of mutant ESAT-6 (ESAT-6DC, the last 6
amino acids were deleted from the C-terminal end of ESAT-6)
and CFP-10, the corresponding ORFs were cloned in pET23a
with an N-terminal His-tag. For purification of the protein
complexes like ESAT-6:CFP-10 and ESAT-6DC:CFP-10, ESAT-
6 or ESAT-6DC ORF was cloned in frame with His-tag of first
multiple cloning site (MCS) in pETDuet (Novagen EMD,

Germany) while CFP-10 was cloned in the second MCS of
pETDuet vector. For ESAT-6:b2M purification, ESAT-6 was
cloned in frame with His-tag of the first MCS in pETDuet while
b2M was cloned in the second MCS of pETDuet vector. These
clones were transformed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and protein
expression was induced by addition of IPTG. Polyhistidine-tagged
recombinant protein was purified from these cells using TALON
resin (Clontech Laboratories, USA) according to the manufactur-
erâ€™s recommendation for purification of protein under native
condition. Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE analysis of purified proteins
revealed an essentially pure homogenous preparation of expected
size. The purified proteins were dialyzed against several changes of
16 PBS and protein concentration was estimated using Bicinch-
oninic acid method (Pierce Chemical Company, USA).
Co-immunoprecipitation assay
The recombinant His-tagged protein (100 mg) was incubated
with whole cell lysate (500 mg) prepared from PMA-differenti-
ated THP-1 macrophages (made in 16 PBS pH 7.4, 10% v/v
glycerol, 1% NP-40 and protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche,
Germany) overnight at 4uC on a rotating platform. Mouse anti-
human b2M mAb (clone CBL306, IgG1 isotype) (Milipore,
USA) was then added to this mixture and incubated for another
2 hours at 4uC. Protein A/G Agarose beads (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, USA) were then added to this mixture and
further incubated at 4uC for 1 hour. The protein A/G bound
immune complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed
extensively with 16 PBS, dissociated by boiling in Laemmli
buffer and analysed by Western blotting. In some experiments,
HLA
class
I
molecules
were
pulled
down
from
THP-1
macrophages treated for 2 hours with either ESAT-6:CFP-10
or ESAT-6DC:CFP-10 complexes. Post-treatment with protein
complexes, the cells were washed and lysed in a HEPES-
containing immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4,
137 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and protease inhibitor cocktail,
Roche, Germany). Equal amount of lysates (100 mg) were
incubated with W6/32 mAb (IgG2a isotype) that recognizes
HLA class I complexed with b2M (Abcam Inc, USA) or isotype-
matched control Ab (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) overnight, followed
by capturing with protein A/G agarose beads (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, USA) for 1 hour. After completion of incubation,
the beads were washed, and eluted by boiling in 16 Laemmli
buffer and were analysed by Western blotting. For pull down
assays in transfected cells, 200 mg whole cell lysate (prepared by
using HEPES-containing immunoprecipitation buffer) or RER
fraction was incubated with anti-GFP Ab (Sigma-Aldrich, USA)
overnight. Immune-complexes were pulled down by addition
of
protein
A/G
beads
for
1 hour.
Beads
were
washed,
resuspended and boiled in 16 Laemmli buffer and the pulled-
down products were analysed by Western blotting. About 10% of
the lysates were used as input controls in all immunoprecipita-
tion experiments.
Western blotting
Immunoprecipitated complexes and cell lysates were resolved
on either 16% Tris-Tricine SDS or 15% glycine SDS-PAGE and
then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were
probed with the appropriate combination of primary Ab and HRP
conjugated secondary Ab (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Recombinant
His-tagged proteins were detected with rabbit anti-His Ab (Abcam
Inc, USA), b2M with rabbit anti-b2M Ab (Abcam Inc, USA) and
b-actin with mouse anti-b-actin Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
USA). Bound HRP enzyme was detected by chemiluminescence
following the manufacturerâ€™s protocol (GE Healthcare, UK).
Surface plasmon resonance
b2M
purified
from
human
urine
(Sigma-Aldrich,
USA)
(dialysed against 10 mM acetate buffer, pH 3.5) was coupled to
the flow cells of the sensor chip (Carboxy-Methylated Dextran
chip (CM5, Biacore AB) using 100 mM N-hydroxysuccinimide
and 400 mM N-Ethyl-N9-(dimethylaminopropyl) Carbodiimide,
until an appropriate level of coupling (400 resonance units) was
achieved. Deactivation after immobilization was carried out using
1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.5). All binding studies were performed in
75 mM phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.5 using a 5 ml/minute
flow rate at 25uC. A control flow cell was also prepared under
identical conditions in the absence of the protein. Recombinant
His-tagged ESAT-6 protein was dialysed against running buffer
and injected in different concentrations into the flow cell with
immobilized b2M. Changes in the refraction index at the surface
due to interactions between the two molecules were detected and
recorded as RU (Resonance Units). Curves generated from the
RU
trace
were
evaluated
using
a
curve-fitting
algorithm,
BIAevaluation (Biacore, GE Healthcare).
Glutaraldehyde cross-linking to confirm protein-protein
interaction
For glutaraldehyde cross-linking, purified ESAT-6:b2M protein
complexes were dialysed in sodium acetate buffers of varying pH
(4.0, 5.0 and 6.0). The dialysed protein samples were then
centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 10 minutes and 100 ml of each
sample was treated with 5 ml of 3% freshly prepared solution of
glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 15, 20 and 30 minutes at
37uC. Cross-linking reaction was terminated by addition of 10 ml
of 1M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Cross-linked products were denatured
by heating at 95uC with equal volume of 16 Laemmli buffer,
centrifuged and resolved on a 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gel
and visualized by silver staining.
GST pull down assay
ESAT-6 or ESAT-6DC ORF cloned in pGEX-4T-1 or the
empty vector pGEX-4T-1 was used to purify GST-ESAT-6 or
GST-ESAT-6DC or GST alone using glutathione-agarose beads
(Clontech
Laboratories,
USA)
following
the
manufacturerâ€™s
protocol. GST-ESAT-6 or GST-ESAT-6DC or GST bound to
Glutathione bead was incubated with GST pre-cleared THP-1
macrophage lysate (made in lysis buffer composed of 16PBS, 1%
Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, 16 protease inhibitor cocktail
mixture) at 4uC for 2 hours. The beads were washed with lysis
buffer and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. These samples were
then separated by 16% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE and analyzed by
Western blotting using rabbit anti-human b2M Ab and HRP
conjugated anti-rabbit secondary Ab and the blots were visualized
by chemiluminescence.
Detection of ESAT-6:b2M complex in pleural fluid
samples from tuberculosis positive individuals
Pleural fluid samples were collected from individuals suffering
from clinically diagnosed pleural TB. Patients with non-tubercu-
lous etiology having malignant pleural effusion/parapneumonic
effusion were included as controls. The study was approved by the
Institutional Ethical Committee (LEPRA Society-Blue Peter
Research Centre, Hyderabad) and informed consent was obtained
from each subject prior to sample collection. The amount of
ESAT-6:b2M complex present in the pleural fluid was measured
by sandwich ELISA. Briefly, 96-well ELISA plates were coated
overnight with 1 mg/well of mouse anti-human b2M Ab, clone
CBL306
(Millipore,
USA).
After

(AMRESCO, USA), pleural fluid samples (50 ml) were added and
incubated overnight at 4uC. Captured ESAT-6:b2M complexes
were detected with polyclonal rabbit anti-ESAT-6 Ab (Abcam Inc,
USA), diluted 1:100 and HRP conjugated anti-rabbit Ab (Sigma-
Aldrich, USA), diluted 1:1000. A similar sandwich ELISA was
used for detection of b2M in the pleural fluid samples where the
ELISA plate was coated with 1 mg/well mouse anti-human b2M
Ab, clone CBL306 (Millipore, USA) and post blocking pleural
fluid samples (50 ml) were added and the captured b2M was
detected with the help of rabbit-anti-human b2M Ab (Abcam Inc,
USA), diluted 1:1000 and HRP conjugated anti-rabbit Ab (Sigma-
Aldrich, USA), diluted 1:1000. All Ab dilutions were made in
blocking buffer (16 PBS+2% BSA). To detect the bound HRP,
ortho-phenylenediamine or OPD (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and
H2O2 (Qualigens Fine Chemicals, India) was used. The reaction
was stopped by addition of 1N H2SO4 (Qualigens Fine Chemicals,
India). The absorbance was measured at 492 nm. At each step
ELISA plates were thoroughly washed 3 times with 16 PBS+
0.05% Tween 20 (AMRESCO, USA) and 2 times with 16 PBS.
Flow cytometry
For flow cytometry, cells were incubated with appropriate
antibodies (either as a fluorochrome conjugated primary Ab or in
successive steps of unlabelled primary Ab and fluorochrome
conjugated secondary reagents) in a 100 ml reaction volume FACS
staining buffer (16 PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium
azide) for 60 minutes on ice. After washing, the cells were fixed in
1% paraformaldehyde. Surface b2M was stained with PE
conjugated anti-human b2M Ab of IgM isotype, clone TUÂ¨ 99
(BD Pharmingen, USA) and PE conjugated mouse IgM, k (BD
Pharmingen, USA) was used as isotype control. Surface-expressed
HLA class I molecules were stained with monoclonal antibody
HC-10 (kind gift from Prof. H. L. Ploegh) which detects free HLA
class I heavy chain molecules or W6/32 (Abcam Inc, USA) which
detects b2M complexed HLA class I and FITC conjugated anti-
mouse Ab (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Appropriate isotype-matched
IgG2a (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used as control. Cell-bound
fluorescence was measured on a FACSAria flow cytometer
(Beckton Dickinson, USA) and the data were analyzed using
FlowJo (TreeStar, Oregon, USA) data analysis software.
Nucleofection of THP-1 cells
Open reading frame of either full length ESAT-6 or ESAT-6
truncated by 6 C-terminal amino acids residues (ESAT-6DC) was
cloned in frame with the EGFP protein of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech
Laboratories, USA). These constructs, pEGFPC1-esat-6 and
pEGFPC1-esat-6DC, were nucleofected into 1â€“26106 THP-1
cells for cytoplasmic expression of EGFP-ESAT-6 and EGFP-
ESAT-6DC respectively, using a nucleofection kit from Lonza
(Lonza, Germany) following the protocols provided by the
manufacturer. Cells nucleofected with empty pEGFP-C1 vector
was used as control group. After 20â€“24 hours, b2M expression on
the cell surface was examined by flow cytometry in EGFP-positive
cells using PE conjugated anti-human b2M Ab (BD Pharmingen,
USA).
Transfection of HEK-293 cells
ESAT-6 and ESAT-6DC ORFs cloned with an N-terminal
GFP-tag in pEGFP-C1 vector, pEGFPC1-esat-6 and pEGFPC1-
esat-6DC respectively, were transfected in HEK-293 cells. For
some experiments, ESAT-6 cloned in a pcDNA 3.1 (+) vector with
an incorporated N-terminal FLAG tag (cloned between NheI and
HindIII restriction sites) was used for transfecting HEK-293 cells.
The cells were seeded in antibiotic free DMEM with 10% FCS
overnight. Respective plasmids and Lipofectamine 2000 transfec-
tion reagent (Invitrogen, USA) were diluted in Opti-MEM
minimal serum medium and then mixed together. For 1 mg
plasmid 3 ml of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent was used. The
plasmid-Lipofectamine mixture was incubated at room tempera-
ture for 30 minutes and was added to the seeded HEK-293 cells
drop by drop. Cells were kept in Opti-MEM medium for 4â€“
6 hours after which it was replaced with complete DMEM
medium. All the experiments were carried out at approximately
20â€“24 hours post-transfection.
Confocal microscopy
FITC-labelled ESAT-6:CFP-10 was prepared using a FITC
labelling kit from Pierce (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) following
the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. For ER localization studies, one
million cells were incubated with FITC-labeled ESAT-6:CFP-10
protein for about 100 minutes and the ER-Tracker dye Blue
White DPX (Invitrogen, USA) was added to these cells to a final
concentration of 1 mM and incubated for 20 minutes. Cells were
washed three times in 16 PBS and then fixed with 3%
paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and mounted on coverslip and
visualized under a confocal microscope. Localization of recombi-
nant FITC-labelled ESAT-6:CFP-10 was also studied with
calnexin, an ER specific marker. Calnexin was stained with anti-
calnexin Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA) and detected by
Alexa-Fluor 594 conjugated anti-rabbit secondary Ab (Invitrogen,
USA). Levels of intracellular free HLA class I molecules not
complexed with b2M were measured with a monoclonal Ab HC-
10 that specifically detects free HLA class I heavy chain molecules
(kind gift from Prof. H.L Ploegh). Alexa Fluor 594 conjugated anti-
mouse
Ab (Invitrogen,
USA)
was used
as secondary
Ab.
Intracellularly over-expressed FLAG-tagged ESAT-6 was stained
with anti-FLAG Ab (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) followed by Alexa
Fluor 488 conjugated anti-mouse Ab. For all experiments
involving intracellular staining, cells were first fixed with 3%
paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and then permeabilized with
0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by incubation with
appropriate primary and secondary antibodies. All cells were
visualized under a LSM 510META confocal microscope and
images were captured.
Isolation of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) fraction
About 10â€“156106 HEK-293 cells were transfected with either
pEGFP-C1 or pEGFPC1-esat-6 or pEGFPC1-esat-6DC plasmids
and after 20â€“24 hours of transfection, cells were detached, pelleted
and washed with 16PBS. The pellet was used for isolation of the
RER fraction using a commercially available kit (IMGENEX,
India). Briefly, the cell pellet was resuspended in an iso-osmotic
homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche, Germany) and lysed using a Dounce homogenizer. In
case of incomplete lysis, cells were also briefly sonicated. Unlysed
cells were separated by centrifugation at 1,000 g for 10 minutes.

mitochondria and cell debris. The supernatant was used for
precipitation of RER fraction with 8 mM calcium chloride which
was added drop by drop with constant agitation. The RER
fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 8,000 g for 10 minutes at
4uC. The pellet was dissolved in a HEPES containing suspension
buffer with protease inhibitor and 1% NP-40 (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA). Enrichment of the ER fraction was confirmed by the
presence of ER-specific marker b2M (23, 24) and absence of EEA1
(endosome marker), LAMP2 (lysosome marker) as well as GAPDH

(cytoplasmic marker) (Figure S10). The enriched ER fraction was
stored at 280uC until used for pull-down assays.
Assay for effect of ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex on MHC-I
antigen presentation
Hypertonic cytoplasmic loading of ovalbumin (OVA) followed
by osmotic lysis of pinosomes containing OVA was used to present
soluble antigens to the MHC-I pathway of antigen presentation
[60,61]. In brief, peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 (H-2Kb)
mice were pre-treated with recombinant ESAT-6:CFP-10 or
ESAT-6:CFP-10DC protein complex (7.5 mM) for 2 hours. After
washing, the cells were further incubated for 10 minutes at 37uC
in hypertonic serum-free DMEM containing 0.5 M sucrose
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA), 10% polyethylene glycol 1000 (Sigma-
Aldrich, USA), 10 mM HEPES and 10 mg/ml OVA which is
equivalent to 225 mM concentration (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Then
hypotonic DMEM (60% DMEM and 40% water) was added for
2 minutes at 37uC. The cells were washed and further incubated
for 2 hours to allow OVA antigen processing and presentation.
These cells were then directly probed for the presence of OVA-
derived SIINFEKL peptide (OVA257â€“264) on MHC-I using a
phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated monoclonal Ab (25-D1.16) that
recognizes SIINFEKL peptide bound to MHC-I molecules (H-2Kb)
(eBiosciences, USA). The PE fluorescence was detected in the FL-2
channel of flow cytometer (BD FACSAria) and the data were
analyzed using Flowjo software. To determine the effect of soluble
ESAT-6:CFP-10 or ESAT-6:CFP-10DC protein on cross-presenta-
tion of exogenous OVA, peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 (H-
2Kb) mice were pre-treated for 2 hours with recombinant ESAT-
6:CFP-10 or ESAT-6:CFP-10DC (7.5 mM), washed and incubated
with 1 mg/ml (equivalent to 22.5 mM concentration) soluble OVA
added exogenously for another 2 hours. Cells were washed, fixed and
surface expression of SIINFEKL peptide (OVA257â€“264) on MHC-I
was analysed as described earlier. PE conjugated isotype-matched Ab
(BD Pharmingen, USA) was used as control.
B3Z stimulation assay
Class I antigen presentation assay was carried out in vitro using
B3Z (a kind gift from Dr. Satyajit Rath and Dr. Vineeta Bal,
National Institute of Immunology, India), a CD8+ T cell
hybridoma specific for OVA257â€“264 (SIINFEKL), presented on
the murine H-2Kb MHC class I molecule [62] and using
thioglycolate elicited peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice
(H-2b) as antigen presenting cells (APCs). Macrophages either left
untreated or pre-treated with 7.5 mM of ESAT-6:CFP-10 or
ESAT-6DC:CFP-10
protein
were
loaded
cytosolically
with
10 mg/ml ovalbumin (with paraformaldehyde pre-fixed cells as
well as BSA as control) in a hypertonic solution as described
elsewhere [63]. Cells were washed and further incubated for
2 hours at 37uC. The OVA-loaded APCs (56105) were co-
cultured with B3Z T cells (56105) in a 24-well tissue culture plate
for 20â€“24 hours [64]. The IL-2 levels secreted in the culture
supernatants were measured by ELISA.
Ethics statement
All the animals studies were conducted following the guidelines
laid by Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of
Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), Ministry of environment and
Forest, Govt. of India and performed in accordance with approved
protocol (# P16/IAEC/NIN/2012/7/SG/) by the Institutional
Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) of National Institute of
Nutrition,
Hyderabad,
India
(Registration
No. 154/1999/
CPCSEA).
All the experiments involving human samples were approved by
the Institutional Ethical Committee (IEC) of LEPRA Society-Blue

experiments performed in a similar way. Groups were compared
using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA by ranks, followed by
individual comparisons between the groups using the Mann-
Whitney U Test. p value of #0.05 was considered to be significant.
A statistics software package, IBM SPSS version 19.0 was used for
all the statistical analyses.
Supporting Information
Figure S1
The DNA sequence of the clone 9.24 obtained
from the yeast two hybrid screening and aligns with
human b2M ORF. The positive clone (9.24) sequence obtained
from yeast two hybrid screening was queried against the Human
genomic plus transcript database (Human G+T) using the NCBI
MegaBlast algorithm. The Beta-2-microglobulin (b2M) was retrieved
with the maximum score in the list of sequences producing significant
alignment with 93% identity. The above alignment is the outcome
from a pairwise local alignment of the clone 9.24 sequence and human
b2M coding sequence (CDS) using the EMBOSS Water program
with a gap open and gap extend penalty of 10 and 0.5 respectively.

The ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex interacts with
mouse b2M. Recombinant His-tagged ESAT-6:CFP-10 protein
was bound to Ni-NTA agarose beads and incubated for 2 hours
with 1 mg cell lysate prepared from BMC2 mouse macrophages.
After extensive wash the bound complexes were eluted by boiling in
16 Laemmli buffer. The samples were resolved on a 16% Tris-
Tricine SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose mem-
brane and probed with rabbit anti-b2M Ab (Abcam, USA) followed
by HRP conjugated anti-rabbit secondary Ab (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA). Bands were visualized by addition of ECL reagent (GE
Healthcare). Lane 1 is input control.

addition of anti-HLA-I Ab (Lanes 3 and 4). The protein A/G
bound protein complexes were dissociated by boiling in 16 SDS-
PAGE loading dye and immunoblotted for detecting ESAT-6

(Lanes 1 and 2). The blots were visualized by chemiluminescence
after incubation with anti-rabbit IgG HRP conjugate. Results are
representative of three different experiments.

The ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex is not cytotoxic
to THP-1 macrophages. PMA-differentiated THP-1 macrophag-
es (26105/100 ml/well into a 96-well microplate) were treated with
indicated concentrations of ESAT-6:CFP-10 for 2 hours. MTT (3-
(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; Sigma-
Aldrich) was added at a final concentration of 1 mg/ml for 4 hours
after which cells were lysed with a lysis buffer (20% SDS in 50%
dimethyl formamide) and the absorbance was recorded at 590 nm as
described earlier (Khan et al., 2008, Cell. Microbiol. 10:1711â€“1722).

12.5 mM ESAT-6:CFP-10 complex for 2 hours after which surface
expression of Mac-1 (A), TLR-4 (B), MHC-II (C) and CD14 (D)
was measured by flow cytometry using specific primary and FITC
conjugated secondary antibodies. Anti-Mac-1 Ab, anti-TLR4 Ab
and anti-CD14 Ab were from BD Pharmingen and for staining
MHC-II, supernatant from Y3P hybridoma cells was used. Results
are representative of at least three different experiments.

left untreated or treated with two different concentrations of
ESAT-6:CFP-10 for 2 hours and cell lysates were prepared. After
protein estimation, 30 mg of lysates were separated on a 15% SDS-
PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane which was
probed with anti-b2M Ab. b-actin levels were also measured in
this blot to confirm equal protein loading. (B) HEK-293 cells were
seeded at a density of 16106 in a 6 well plate and were transfected
with either pEGFP-C1, pEGFP-C1-esat-6 or pEGFP-C1-esat-
6DC plasmid construct. After 20â€“24 hours, RNA was isolated
from the transfected cells to synthesize cDNA. Specific primers
were used for amplification of b2M and b-actin by PCR from the
synthesized cDNA. Amplified products were resolved on a 1.5%
agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Results
are representative of three different experiments.
