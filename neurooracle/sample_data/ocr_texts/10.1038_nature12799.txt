Abstract
The evolutionary survival of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of human tuberculosis (TB), 
depends on its ability to invade the host, replicate, and transmit infection. At its initial peripheral 
infection site in the distal lung airways, M. tuberculosis infects macrophages which transport it to 
deeper tissues1. How mycobacteria survive in these broadly microbicidal cells is an important 
question. Here we show that M. tuberculosis, and its close pathogenic relative Mycobacterium 
marinum, preferentially recruit and infect permissive macrophages while evading microbicidal 
ones. This immune evasion is accomplished by using cell surface associated phthiocerol 
dimycoceroserate (PDIM) lipids2 to mask underlying pathogen-associated molecular patterns 
(PAMPs). In the absence of PDIM, these PAMPs signal a toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent 
recruitment of macrophages that produce microbicidal reactive nitrogen species. Concordantly, the 
related phenolic glycolipids (PGL)2, promote recruitment of permissive macrophages via a host 
chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2)-mediated pathway. Thus, we have identified coordinated roles for 
PDIM, known to be essential for mycobacterial virulence3 and PGL, which (along with CCR2) is 
known to be associated with human TB4,5. Our findings also suggest an explanation for the 
longstanding observation that M. tuberculosis initiates infection in the relatively sterile 
environment of the lower respiratory tract, rather than in the upper respiratory tract, where resident

microflora and inhaled environmental microbes may continually recruit microbicidal macrophages 
through TLR-dependent signaling.
Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as the TLRs enable host recognition of diverse 
microbes through their PAMPs6. Macrophages recruited through TLR signaling pathways 
can eradicate organisms invading the oropharyngeal mucosa, e.g. Streptococcus 
pneumoniae7. In contrast, pathogenic mycobacteria appear to use macrophages and myeloid 
dendritic cells for transport across epithelial barriers to their infection niche1,8. 
Mycobacteria are replete with TLR PAMPs, such as lipoproteins and bacterial cell wall 
peptidoglycan, that have been shown to activate cytokine responses in cultured 
macrophages1. Yet in vivo studies find TLR signaling to be dispensable in the early stages 
of infection9, suggesting that mycobacteria have evolved mechanisms to circumvent the 
bactericidal consequences of TLR signaling.
To explore these mechanisms, we used zebrafish larvae infected with M. marinum, a close 
genetic relative of M. tuberculosis, and the causative agent of TB in ectotherms. This model 
has yielded important insights into the pathogenesis and genetics of human TB10. In 
humans, the earliest interactions between mycobacteria and phagocytes occur at the lung 
epithelial surface. Such interactions can be modeled in the larva by injection of bacteria or 
other chemical stimuli into the hindbrain ventricle (HBV), a neuroepithelium-lined cavity to 
which phagocytes are recruited8 (Fig.1a). We used morpholino knockdown to create 
zebrafish deficient in MyD88, a common downstream adaptor molecule for TLR signaling 
pathways6. As expected, MyD88 morphants had decreased macrophage recruitment to 
Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, mucosal bacteria that can be 
commensal or pathogenic11-13 (Fig. 1b). Similarly, macrophage recruitment to the 
nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis was MyD88-dependent. In contrast, macrophage 
recruitment to M. marinum was MyD88-independent (Fig. 1c). This finding suggested that 
pathogenic mycobacteria have the ability to mask PAMPs that would otherwise induce TLR 
signaling during the initial infection phase. We hypothesized that such a factor would be a 
cell surface associated virulence determinant. In this light, PDIM seemed a likely candidate, 
particularly because it is present only in the pathogenic mycobacteria, including M. 
tuberculosis and M. marinum, but absent in M. smegmatis2. We created a M. marinum 
mutant that lacks PDIM on its surface by knocking out the PDIM transporter, encoded by 
the mmpL7 gene, and confirmed that it was attenuated in zebrafish larvae (Fig. 1d and 
Extended Data Fig. 2). If PDIM is masking PAMPs, then macrophage recruitment to 
ΔmmpL7 bacteria should be MyD88-dependent, and this was the case (Fig. 1e). In contrast, 
macrophage migration remained MyD88-independent in response to M. marinum deficient 
in another cell surface-associated virulence determinant, Erp (Δerp) (Fig. 1d, e and Extended 
Data Fig. 2)14. This result was consistent with M. smegmatis possessing a functional erp14, 
and suggested further that the evasion of MyD88-dependent immune detection was mediated 
specifically by PDIM.
Our model posits that pathogenic mycobacteria use PDIM to evade recruitment of MyD88-
dependent macrophage populations detrimental to their survival. Therefore, we predicted 
that wild-type mycobacteria should be unaffected in MyD88 morphants, whereas the

attenuation of ΔmmpL7 should be reversed. We found both to be the case (Fig. 1f). For these 
assays, ~ 80 M. marinum were injected into the HBV. However, MyD88 morphants were 
previously reported to be susceptible to higher M. marinum inocula delivered 
intravenously15. We confirmed these findings, showing that MyD88 deficiency increased 
susceptibility at later time points after intravenous administration of >300 CFU (Extended 
Data Fig. 3). It is likely that MyD88 exerts its protective responses at these later stages 
through mechanisms distinct from the ones we have uncovered, such as through IL-1-
mediated responses9. Indeed, IL-1 expression was undetectable 3 hours following infection 
when we observed MyD88-dependent macrophage recruitment (data not shown) suggesting 
an IL-1 independent role for MyD88 in mediating recruitment towards PDIM-deficient 
mycobacteria.
Further characterization of wild-type versus PDIM-deficient bacteria revealed that both 
strains recruited cells expressing the macrophage-specific marker mpeg18 (Extended Data 
Fig. 4a and Extended Data Videos 1, 2). We next asked whether these macrophages 
possessed differential microbicidal potential. We examined the expression of inducible nitric 
oxide synthase (iNOS) in these recruited cells because: 1) it is induced in macrophages upon 
TLR signaling6, and can be expressed by zebrafish16, mouse17 and human18 macrophages 
following mycobacterial infection and 2) mycobacteria are known to be susceptible to 
reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in both murine17 and human18 macrophages. We found very 
few iNOS-positive macrophages arriving to wild-type M. marinum, whereas the majority of 
those arriving in response to ΔmmpL7 bacteria were iNOS-positive (Fig. 2a-c, and Extended 
Data Fig. 4b). Δerp bacteria elicited very few iNOS-expressing macrophages (Fig. 2c and 
Extended Data Fig. 4b), further showing that this early manipulation of macrophage 
recruitment and/or activation is a specific characteristic of PDIM. We confirmed that RNS 
were the major mediators of MyD88-dependent macrophage microbicidal activity by 
showing that the iNOS inhibitors CPTIO and L-NAME reversed growth attenuation of the 
ΔmmpL7 mutant (Fig. 2d and Extended Data Fig. 4c).
Together our findings suggested that PDIM mediates an immune evasion strategy, whereby 
mycobacteria evade detection by TLRs so as to avoid recruitment of iNOS-expressing, 
microbicidal macrophages. To test this idea, we co-infected red fluorescent wild-type 
bacteria with green fluorescent wild-type or ΔmmpL7 bacteria. We found that wild-type 
bacteria were attenuated in the presence of ΔmmpL7 bacteria, and that this attenuation 
transfer was specifically caused by co-infection with ΔmmpL7 and not with wild-type or 
Δerp bacteria (Fig. 2e and Extended Data Fig. 5a, b). Furthermore, this transfer of 
attenuation from ΔmmpL7 to wild-type bacteria was dependent on macrophages; no 
attenuation was observed when macrophages were depleted prior to infection using a 
morpholino against the myeloid transcription factor, PU.1 (Fig. 2f)16. Attenuation transfer 
was similarly dependent on MyD88 signaling, as well as on RNS production (Fig. 2g, h and 
Extended Data Figure 5c).
Since PDIM is not the only substrate for the MmpL7 transporter, we confirmed that the 
effects were due to the lack of PDIM per se by using a PDIM synthesis mutant, Δmas, 
showing it to both recruit macrophages in a MyD88-dependent fashion and to transfer 
attenuation to wild-type bacteria (Extended Data Fig. 6). Finally, to rule out the possibility

that the PDIM-deficient mutants simply had increased expression of the culpable PAMP(s), 
we co-injected heat-killed, crushed wild-type bacteria together with live wild-type bacteria. 
If the culpable PAMP(s) are expressed by wild-type bacteria, then they should become 
exposed by crushing the bacteria and cause attenuation of the live bacteria. We found this to 
be the case (Fig. 2i). Altogether, these results suggest that PDIM physically masks 
underlying mycobacterial PAMPs, thereby preventing mycobacterial delivery into 
microbicidal macrophages.
To corroborate our findings in a second model, we infected mice via aerosol with wild-type 
M. tuberculosis (H37Rv) or with an isogenic strain (ΔdrrA) defective for proper PDIM 
surface localization and virulence in mice3. At 21 DPI, we found substantially greater 
proportions of iNOS-producing cells among the CD11b+Ly6Chi inflammatory monocyte 
population in the lungs of mice infected with the ΔdrrA mutant compared to mice infected 
with the wild type strain (Fig. 3 and Extended Data Fig. 7). Thus PDIM-mediated evasion of 
TLR-dependent immune recognition is shared by M. tuberculosis in the context of the 
mammalian lung, consistent with its central role in avoidance of TLR-dependent anti-
microbial mechanisms such as iNOS and antimicrobial peptides6.
We next sought to understand the mechanism by which mycobacteria recruit the permissive 
macrophages that are essential for their transport into host tissues. Given our prior finding 
that M. marinum recruits only macrophages (and not neutrophils) to the HBV8, we 
considered macrophage-specific chemokines as candidates for mediating this recruitment. 
We investigated CCR2, which has been implicated in macrophage migration to bacterial 
pathogens in mice19, including macrophages that are permissive to M. tuberculosis 
replication after aerosol infection20. We identified the functional zebrafish CCR2 orthologue 
(see online methods section) and confirmed that its knockdown resulted in reduced 
macrophage migration in response to recombinant human chemokine ligand 2 (hCCL2) and 
not to the closely related human macrophage chemokines CCL4 and CCL5 (Extended Data 
Fig. 8a). The specificity of CCL2-mediated macrophage migration was revealed by the 
following findings: 1) human and mouse CCL2 induced macrophage but not neutrophil 
migration (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c) 2) recombinant human IL-8, a neutrophil chemokine, 
induced neutrophil but not macrophage migration (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c) 3) human 
LTB4 induced recruitment of both neutrophils and macrophages (Extended Data Fig. 8b, c), 
as expected16 and 4) Myd88 knockdown did not diminish CCL2-mediated macrophage 
migration, ruling out TLR-mediated migration in response to any endotoxin that might be 
contaminating the chemokine preparations (Extended Data Fig. 8b).
CCR2 morphants had reduced macrophage migration in response to wild-type M. marinum, 
confirming the role of this pathway in recruitment (Fig. 4a). Recruitment to PDIM-deficient 
M. marinum was unaffected showing that TLR PAMPs trigger recruitment through a CCR2-
independent pathway (Fig. 4a). Accordingly, we found that M. marinum infection induced 
CCL2, and that CCL2 morphants also had reduced macrophage recruitment in response to 
infection (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Figure 9).
Turning to the question of which bacterial determinant induced the CCR2 pathway, we 
considered PGL, a molecule closely related to PDIM in both M. marinum and M.

tuberculosis2. While many clinical M. tuberculosis isolates have lost PGL, its presence has 
been linked to increased virulence5. Moreover, among M. tuberculosis clinical isolates, PGL 
expression was linked to ccl2 expression in a mouse lung infection model21. Similarly, we 
found that PGL was required for ccl2 induction in the larva; deletion of the M. marinum 
pks15 locus specifically abrogates PGL, but not PDIM, production (data not shown) and 
resulted in loss of ccl2 induction. ΔmmpL7 bacteria, which lack surface expression of both 
PGL and PDIM, similarly failed to induce ccl2, highlighting that this chemokine is not 
induced through TLR interactions, but rather is specifically induced through PGL-mediated 
interactions (Fig. 4b). Furthermore, Δpks15 bacteria recruited fewer macrophages upon 
infection of wild-type larvae, and this reduction was similar to that seen in CCR2 morphants 
infected with wild-type bacteria (Fig. 4c). There was no additional reduction in recruitment 
when CCR2 morphants were infected with PGL-deficient bacteria, suggesting that PGL 
recruits macrophages solely through the CCR2 pathway (Fig. 4c).
Our findings implicate PGL in bacterial virulence and correspondingly, the CCR2 pathway 
in host susceptibility. Globally, a large proportion of M. tuberculosis isolates are PGL 
deficient due to a frameshift in pks152. However, the importance of PGL in mediating 
virulence and/or transmission is underscored by its presence in many of the W-Beijing 
strains, which are becoming rapidly enriched among M. tuberculosis isolates globally5, and 
have predominated in outbreaks in North America where TB is not prevalent5. Infectivity is 
a key requirement for transmission, and our data suggested that PGL may enhance 
infectivity through CCR2-mediated recruitment of permissive macrophages at the earliest 
stages of infection. This enhancement may be particularly relevant in the context of human 
infections, in which the infectious dose is thought to be as low as 1-3 bacteria22,23. To test 
the hypothesis that PGL enhances infectivity at low doses, we compared the ability of wild-
type and PGL-deficient strains to establish infection. Confocal microscopy was used five 
hours after HBV injection to select those animals that had received 1-3 bacteria (Extended 
Data Fig. 10), and then again at 5 DPI to identify which animals were still infected. We 
found that 89% of the wild-type but only 18% of the Δpks15 infections were successful (Fig. 
4d). Concurrent administration of recombinant CCL2 restored the infectivity of Δpks15 
bacteria, provided the CCR2 pathway was intact (Fig. 4d). Correspondingly, we found that 
wild-type bacteria had a lower infectivity rate in CCR2 morphants (Fig. 4d). Consistent with 
our finding that PGL recruits macrophages solely through CCR2, there was no further 
decrease in infectivity in CCR2 morphants infected with the PGL mutant (Fig. 4d). Finally, 
the infectivity of wild-type bacteria in MyD88 morphants was undiminished (90% for wild-
type vs. 83% for morphants), consistent with our finding that TLR signaling is not involved 
in macrophage recruitment to wild-type bacteria.
These findings highlight the interdependency between bacterial PGL and host CCR2 
signaling in driving bacterial infectivity under the low inoculum conditions relevant to 
human infection. Prior investigations into the role of PGL and CCR2 may have failed to 
reveal these mechanisms because those studies used higher inocula24 and, in the study of 
CCR2 signaling, a PGL-deficient strain25. Indeed, our finding that CCR2 signaling is a host 
susceptibility factor is reinforced by human studies showing an association between the high 
expression of CCL2 and TB susceptibility4. Furthermore, the association appears to be

stronger in East Asian populations26, where clinical isolates are enriched for the 
predominantly PGL-expressing, W-Beijing strains27. In light of our findings, we propose 
that the enrichment of PGL expression among these strains is influencing this association, as 
the CCR2 pathway would be most relevant in the context of bacterial PGL stimulation.
Finally our data suggested an explanation for why M. tuberculosis must reach the alveolar 
surfaces of the distal lung in order to initiate infection23 (Extended Data Fig. 1). It is well 
established that TB results from inhalation of small aerosol droplets containing ~1-3 
bacteria, which are capable of reaching the alveolar surfaces of the distal lung; in contrast, 
large droplets harboring ~104 bacteria are trapped in the upper bronchial passages and are 
far less successful at establishing infection22,23. These observations have led to the idea that 
the alveolar surfaces of the distal lung offer a more favorable environment for mycobacterial 
proliferation. We hypothesized that commensal microbes from the oropharyngeal surfaces as 
well as inhaled environmental organisms, might lead to continual TLR signaling in the 
upper respiratory tract that would then override the mycobacterial PDIM-dependent immune 
evasion strategies we identified. In contrast, the lower respiratory tract, which is relatively 
sterile28, would favor recruitment of Mycobacterium-permissive macrophages. To test this 
hypothesis we co-infected animals with M. marinum together with bacterial colonizers of the 
pharynx that induce TLR signaling - either S. aureus, a common Gram-positive colonizer of 
the nasopharynx in both adults and children12 or the Gram-negative bacterium P. 
aeruginosa, also reported to colonize the pharynx of asymptomatic adults and children11. 
Co-infection with P. aeruginosa resulted in the attenuation of wild-type mycobacteria even 
by 1 DPI, and continuing into 3 DPI (Fig. 5a). Mycobacterial growth was attenuated despite 
rapid clearing of P. aeruginosa: 56% of the animals had cleared the co-infected P. 
aeruginosa by 1 DPI, and 76% by 3 DPI, with only a few residual bacteria in the remaining 
animals. Thus, it was not the physical presence of, but rather the detrimental immunological 
milieu induced by P. aeruginosa that was responsible for the attenuation of M. marinum. 
Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the detrimental effect of P. aeruginosa on 
mycobacterial survival was MyD88-dependent (Fig.5b). S. aureus co-infection also had a 
MyD88-dependent detrimental effect on M. marinum survival (Fig. 5c)
Our prior work identified strategies by which intracellular mycobacteria manipulate host 
pathways after having traversed epithelial barriers; these involve a bacterial protein secretion 
system that expands the bacterial niche through macrophage recruitment to the nascent 
granuloma10. We now describe what may be the first contact between mycobacteria and 
their hosts, and the manner in which mycobacteria manipulate recruitment, and potentially 
influence the differentiation or activation state, of the first responding macrophages so as to 
gain access to their preferred niche (Extended Data Fig. 1). The choreographed entry 
involves two related mycobacterial lipids acting in concert to avoid one host pathway while 
inducing another. Our findings link PDIM, recognized as an absolutely essential 
mycobacterial virulence factor, to the evasion of TLR detection and thus explain the 
dispensability of TLR-mediated immunity in protection against M. tuberculosis infection in 
both human and animal studies9,29. In contrast, PGL is dispensable for virulence, being 
variably present among clinical isolates. Yet, its presence in the ancestral M. cannetti strains 
as well as in M. marinum, the closest genetic relative of the M. tuberculosis complex2,

suggests its integral role in the evolution of mycobacterial pathogenicity. TB is an ancient 
disease and the enhanced infectivity conferred by PGL may have been essential for most of 
its history before human crowding, with its greatly increased opportunities for transmission, 
made it dispensable30.
Our findings suggest that commensal flora may play a central role in choreographing 
mycobacterial entry. Not only must pathogenic mycobacteria possess a physical barrier to 
prevent host TLR-mediated detection, but they must also evade TLR signaling initiated by 
other organisms, by entering through the distal lung (Extended Data Fig. 1). Our work may 
also explain the paradox that smaller M. tuberculosis droplets are more infectious than larger 
ones. However the requirement placed on mycobacteria to gain entry through the distal lung 
makes TB less contagious than most other respiratory infections, thus assigning a protective 
role to the commensal flora. Conversely, the persistence of human TB for over 70,000 
years30 attests to the effectiveness of the mycobacterial evolutionary survival kit (masking 
lipid, recruiting lipid and small infection droplets) to simultaneously evade and manipulate 
the host and its commensal flora.
Online Methods
Bacterial Strains and Methods
M. marinum strain M (ATCC BAA-535) and the Δerp mutant have been described32. The 
ΔmmpL7 and Δpks15 mutants were generated as described in the following section. 
Fluorescently labeled bacterial strains were generated by transformation with the pTEC15 or 
pTEC27 plasmids (deposited with Addgene, plasmids 30174 and 30182 respectively), 
resulting in msp12-driven expression of the wasabi or tdTomato fluorescent proteins, 
respectively. Mycobacteria were grown at 33°C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth or on 7H10 agar 
(both by Difco) supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.005% oleic acid, 0.2% 
glucose, 0.2% glycerol, 0.085% sodium chloride and 0.05% Tween-80 (broth culture only). 
50 μg/mL hygromycin was added as appropriate. For sucrose counter-selection, 7H10 agar 
was supplemented with 10% sucrose. Single-cell suspensions of bacteria were prepared as 
described33. To prepare heat-killed crushed M. marinum, bacteria were incubated at 80°C 
for 20 minutes and then homogenized in a Biospec Bead Beater together with 0.1 mm silica 
spheres for 1 minute. The P. aeruginosa PAO1 fluorescent strain used in this study has been 
described34. The S. aureus Newman strain expressing pOS1-SdrC-mCherry #391 was a gift 
from Dr. Juliane Bubeck Wardenburg.
Targeted Deletion of mmpL7 and pks15
A 2638 bp PstI fragment containing part of the mmpL7 (MMAR_1764) ORF was cloned 
into a pBluescript-derived vector, pBSXKpn.2 (CLC, unpublished). A 1124 bp KpnI 
fragment internal to mmpL7 was then excised and replaced with the aph cassette, conferring 
kanamycin resistance. The sucrose counter-selectable marker, sacB, and an additional 
marker hygA, conferring hygromycin resistance, were then added to create pJENK7.1::Hyg. 
This construct was transformed into the wild-type reference strain, M, and kanamycin-
resistant colonies were selected. Subsequent screening for sucrose-sensitivity identified 
merodiploids that were verified by southern blotting. One such merodiploid was then grown

in liquid culture for ten days and plated on sucrose-containing medium. Sucrose- and 
kanamycin-resistant, hygromycin-sensitive colonies were then verified by southern blotting 
to identify the ΔmmpL7 mutant, KT15. This strain was verified to be deficient in surface 
localization of PDIM (data not shown), and exhibited colony morphology defects previously 
reported for M. marinum PDIM mutants35. The pks15 (MMAR_1762) locus was deleted as 
follows. Flanking regions upstream and downstream of pks15 were amplified by PCR using 
primers 5′pks15F (5′CCGCTCGAGGGTGCGATGCGTGGTATC3′), 5′pks15R.2 and 
(5′CGACTAGTTCAGTTGCTCCTGTTCATG3′), 3′pks15F, and 
(5′GGAGCAACTGAACTAGTACCATCCGACACCGACTG3′) and 3′pks15R.2 
(5′CCGTCTAGAGTGGTGCTGTTCGGCGTC3′), respectively. These fragments were 
sequentially inserted, directly adjacent to each other into pBluescriptSK+::SacBHyg.1 
(CLC, unpublished), a pBluescript derivative which contains sacB and hygA external to the 
MCS. The resulting construct, pPKS15KO, bears an unmarked deletion of the pks15 ORF, 
and was used to transform strain M, and hygromycin resistant colonies were selected. 
Putative merodiploids were verified by Southern blotting and then counter-selected on 
sucrose as above, to produce the sucrose-resistant, hygromycin-sensitive isolate (KT21) 
which was then verified by Southern blotting. Additional verification by thin layer 
chromatography determined that PGL was absent, while PDIM production was retained 
(data not shown), consistent with deletion of pks15 in M.tuberculosis5.
Zebrafish Husbandry and Infections
Wild-type AB zebrafish were maintained as described36. Larvae (of undetermined sex given 
the early developmental stages used) were infected at 36–48 hours post-fertilization (hpf) 
via caudal vein or hindbrain ventricle injection using thawed single-cell suspensions of 
known titer33,36. Number of animals to be used for each experiment was guided by past 
results with other bacterial mutants and/or zebrafish morphants. Larvae were randomly 
allotted to the different experimental conditions. Zebrafish husbandry and all experiments 
performed on them were in compliance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee 
approved protocols.
Microscopy and Image-Based Quantification of Infection Level
Wide-field microscopy was performed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti-E equipped with a C-
HGFIE 130W mercury light source, Chroma FITC (41001) filter, and 2x/0.10 Plan 
Apochromat objective. Fluorescence images were captured with a CoolSNAP HQ2 
Monochrome Camera (Photometrics) using NIS-Elements (version 3.22). Quantification of 
fluorescent M. marinum infection using images of individual embryos using Fluorescent 
Pixel Count (FPC) was performed as previously described33. For confocal imaging, larvae 
were imbedded in 1.5% agarose (low melting point)37. A series of z-stack images with a 2 
μm step size was generated through the infected HBV, using the galvo scanner (laser 
scanner) of the Nikon A1 confocal microscope with a 20x Plan Apo 0.75 NA objective. 
Bacterial burdens were determined by using the 3D surface-rendering feature of Imaris 
(Bitplane Scientific Software)8.

Hindbrain Assays
Macrophage recruitment assays were performed as previously described36. For 
determination of hindbrain ventricle infection burdens, 1 and 3 DPI larvae were mounted in 
1.5% agarose and confocal z-stacks of 2 μm were obtained.
iNOS Staining
Antibody staining of larvae was performed as described31. Larvae were then imaged using 
confocal microscopy and the number of infected macrophages that were positive for iNOS 
staining was determined for each larva.
iNOS Scavengers
Fish were treated as previously described38. CPTIO or L-NAME (Sigma) were used at a 
final concentration of 500 μM and 1 mM, respectively in 0.1% DMSO in fish water. Fish 
were incubated immediately following infection and fresh inhibitor was added every 24 
hours until bacterial burden was determined.
Morpholinos
Morpholinos described in Table S1 were injected at the 1-4 cell stage as previously 
described16.
RT-PCR to verify efficacy of Myd88 MO
RNA was extracted from pools of 15-40 embryos using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies), 
treated with Turbo DNA-Free Kit (Life Technologies) and cDNA synthesized with 
PrimeScript (Takara). Primers used for PCR were as follows: actin FWD 5′-
ACCTGACAGACTACCTGATG, REV 5′-TGAAGGTGGTCTCATGGATAC, myd88 
FWD 5′-ATGGCATCAAAGTTAAGTATAGACC, REV 5′-

Identification of candidate CCR2 orthologue in zebrafish
BLAST searches of the zebrafish genome (www.ensembl.org) identified two closely-related 
CCR-like genes on Chromosome 16, ENSDARG00000079829 and 
ENSDARG00000062999. In BLAST comparisons to the human genome 
ENSDARG00000079829 was found to have the highest homology to human CCR2 (E value 
8.8e-112), while ENSDARG00000062999 was most highly homologous to human CCR4 (E 
value 2e-90). In addition, annotation of the zebrafish genome from NCBI annotates 
ENSDARG00000079829 as a CCR-2-like gene. We confirmed expression of the mRNA 
and identified the short 5′ upstream exon ATGTCGGCGACACAAAACAGTA via 5′-
RACE39.
Identification of zebrafish CCL2 orthologue
Protein sequences of human and mouse CCL2 were used to interrogate the zebrafish genome 
by BLAST. Expression levels of the four most closely-related zebrafish proteins was then 
examined at 3 HPI to identify the likely functional orthologue (Extended Data Fig. 9a). Of

the four candidates, only ENSDARG00000041835 was significantly induced at 3 HPI. 
Knockdown of ENSDARG00000041835 resulted in a decrease in macrophage recruitment 
into the HBV at 3 HPI (Extended Data Fig. 9b).
Quantitative Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)
cDNA was synthesized from pools of 20-40 larvae as previously described31. Quantification 
of ccl2 RNA levels were determined using SYBR green and the following primer pair; 
5′GTCTGGTGCTCTTCGCTTTC3′ and 5′TGCAGAGAAGATGCGTCGTA3′.
Infectivity Assay
2 DPF larvae were infected via the HBV36 with an average of 0.8 bacteria per injection. Fish 
harboring 1-3 bacteria were then identified at 5 HPI by confocal microscopy. These infected 
fish were then evaluated at 5 DPI and were scored as infected or uninfected, based on the 
presence or absence of fluorescent bacteria.
Mice, aerosol infections, and flow cytometry
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. All mice were housed under 
specific pathogen free conditions at Seattle Biomedical Research Institute, and all 
experiments were performed in compliance with the respective Institutional Animal Care 
and Use Committee approved protocols. Ten-week old female mice were randomized to the 
different experimental groups. The number of mice to be used to adequately power the 
experiment was guided by the results of the corresponding zebrafish experiments. A stock of 
M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv or the isogenic PDIM-deficient ΔdrrA strain was sonicated 
before use and mice were infected in an aerosol infection chamber (Glas-Col) with 
approximately 200 colony forming units (CFUs) of H37Rv or 1000 CFUs of ΔdrrA to 
achieve similar bacterial burdens at 21 days post infection. The infectious dose in each 
experiment was determined by plating lung tissue of two mice from each group. Colonies on 
7H10 agar plates were counted after 21 days of incubation at 37°C. Lung tissue was 
perfused with 5 ml of PBS administered through the right ventricle of the heart, finely 
chopped using a gentleMACS Octo Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec) and incubated at 37°C for 
30 minutes in HEPES buffer containing Liberase Blendzyme 3 (Roche Applied Science). 
Following digestion, single cell suspensions were prepared by passing tissue through a cell 
strainer. Single cells suspensions were then stained for flow cytometric analysis. Lung single 
cell suspensions were surface stained at 4°C for 20 minutes in the presence of Fc block 
(24G2) with the following antibodies from eBioscience: PE-Cy7 labeled anti-CD4 (GK1.5, 
eBioscience), anti-CD8α (53-6.7, eBioscience), anti-CD11c (N418), and FITC-labeled anti-
Ly6G (1A8) to exclude T cells, DCs, and neutrophils. Alveolar macrophages were excluded 
based on their high CD11c expression and autofluorescence. PerCPCy5.5 labeled anti-Ly6C 
(HK1.4) and APC-efluor 780 labeled anti-CD11b (M1/70) were used to identify CD11b
+Ly6CHI monocytes. Intracellular staining was done following fixation and 
permeabilization following manufacturer recommendations (eBioscience). Cells were fixed 
and permeabilized using eBioscience's Fix/Perm buffer for 1 hour at 4°C, followed by 
staining for iNOS with anti-NOS2 Alexa Fluor 405 (C-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or

mouse IgG1 isotype control for 30 minutes at 4°C. Samples were analyzed on an LSR-II 
(BD Biosciences) and FlowJo Software (Treestar).
Statistics
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 5.01 (GraphPad). For data sets requiring 
log10 transformation prior to ANOVA, embryos with no detectable fluorescence above 
background were assigned a value of 0.9, with 1 being the limit of detection, prior to log10 
transformation. Post-test P values are as follows: *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001.

monocytes were identified within the double negative population by their co-expression of 
Ly6C and CD11b. These cells were then evaluated for intracellular iNOS expression, N=4 
per group (Figure 3a,b) or b, with isotype control antibodies, N=4 per group.

Extended Data Fig. 8. 
Specificity of CCL2-mediated macrophage recruitment in wild-type and CCR2 morphant 
larvae a, Mean macrophage recruitment at 3 HPI into the HBV of control (ctrl), or CCR2 
MO (ccr2) larvae following injection of vehicle control (“mock”; 0.1% BSA in PBS), 
human CCL2 (hCCL2), human CCL4 (hCCL4), or human CCL5 (hCCL5) b-c, Mean 
macrophage (b) and neutrophil (c) recruitment at 3HPI into the HBV of control (ctrl), CCR2 
MO (ccr2), or MyD88 MO (myd88) larvae following injection of vehicle control (mock), 
murine CCL2 (mCCL2), human CCL2 (hCCL2), human interleukin-8 (hIL-8), or human 
leukotriene B4 (hLTB4). Representative of three separate experiments. Significance assessed 
by one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni's post-test for the comparisons shown, *P < 0.05; 
***P < 0.001.

Extended Data Fig. 9. 
Identification of zebrafish CCL2 orthologue. a, mRNA levels of potential CCL2 
orthologues (mean +/- SEM of four biological replicates) induced at 3 hours post caudal 
vein infection of 2dpf larvae with 250-300 wild-type M. marinum. These assays were 
performed on the same cDNA pools as the data presented in Figure 4b. b, Mean macrophage 
recruitment at 3 HPI into the HBV of wild-type or CCL2 MO fish following infection with 
80 M. marinum. Representative of two separate experiments.
