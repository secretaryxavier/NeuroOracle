Simple Summary: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors represent the most common mesenchymal tumor
of the canine gastrointestinal tract. Activating mutations in c-KIT and PDGFRA genes are considered
the key molecular drivers of human gastrointestinal stromal tumors pathogenesis and are used to
predict the response to Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, in veterinary medicine, the
signiﬁcance of these mutations in canine gastrointestinal stromal tumors has not been sufﬁciently
explored yet. The aim of this study is to investigate the mutational status of c-KIT and PDGFRA, by
PCR and sequencing, in 17 canine gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Mutations of c-KIT were detected
in 47% of cases; in one case, PDGFRA mutation was also identiﬁed. Although follow-up data were not
available for all specimens, based on the information collected, we observed at the time of diagnosis
the presence of metastases in cases with c-KIT mutation. In conclusion, this study provides evidence
for the presence of c-KIT and PDGFRA mutations in canine gastrointestinal stromal tumors and
suggests a potential association of c-KIT mutation with the more aggressive biological behavior of
the tumor.
Abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of
the canine gastrointestinal tract and are diagnosed by the immunohistochemical expression of the
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) KIT. Activating mutations of the proto-oncogenes c-KIT and PDGFRA
drive GIST oncogenesis and are used to predict the response to RTK-inhibitors in human oncology.
Currently, the frequency and signiﬁcance of these mutations in canine GIST have not been adequately
explored. Therefore, we investigated the mutational status of c-KIT (exons 9, 11 and 13) and PDGFRA
(exons 12 and 18) genes by PCR followed by fragment analysis for c-KIT deletions and PCR followed
by screening with DHPLC and direct sequencing conﬁrmation for single nucleotide variations in 17
formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded canine GISTs conﬁrmed by KIT immunopositivity. c-KIT mutations
were detected in 47% of cases, with a mutation detection rate signiﬁcantly higher (p = 0.0004, Fisher’s
exact test) and always involving exon 11. A PDGFRA gene mutation (exon 18) was identiﬁed in one
case. Even if follow-up data were not available for all cases, four cases with documented abdominal
metastases displayed c-KIT mutations. These data conﬁrm that c-KIT exon 11 mutations occur
frequently in canine GISTs, and identify the presence of a PDGFRA mutation similar to human
GISTs. This study also suggests a potential association of c-KIT mutation with more aggressive
biological behavior.

1. Introduction
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal neo-
plasms affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract wall in humans [1,2] as well as dogs [3] and

arise from the neoplastic transformation of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) [1,2,4], which are
‘pacemaker’ cells interposed between the plexuses myenteric and muscular tunic of the GI
tract, with the function of coordinating peristalsis. Most GISTs are diagnosed on the basis of
the immunohistochemical demonstration of the expression of KIT (CD117, stem cell factor
receptor), a type-III tyrosine kinase receptor encoded by the protoncogene c-KIT, which,
therefore, has evidential value in the diagnosis of GIST, which is otherwise difﬁcult to
distinguish from other GI mesenchymal neoplasms. In fact, retrospective studies regarding
dogs and humans have shown that most of the gastrointestinal mesenchymal neoplasms,
previously classiﬁed as leiomyomas or leiomyosarcomas, express CD117 and are then to be
diagnosed as GISTs [5–16].
Mutations in the proto-oncogene c-KIT in exon 11, 9, 13 and 17 of the c-KIT gene
have been observed in human GISTs. The mutation with the highest frequency (of more
than 65%) is located in exon 11, in the juxtamembrane domain [17–19]. The frequent
ﬁnding of these mutations has demonstrated their important pathogenetic role, which is
responsible for the constitutive dimerization and activation of the KIT receptor regardless
of the interaction with the ligand. In canine GISTs, activating mutations have been found
and all of them in exon 11, as recorded in humans [7,8,12,15].
PDGFRA encodes a transmembrane type-II tyrosine kinase receptor that is normally
activated by platelet-derived growth factors (PDGFs), mitogens for cells of mesenchymal
origin [20]. PDGFRA mutations were identiﬁed in 35% of human GISTs with wild-type
c-KIT [20] and mostly (about 90%) localized in exon 18.
In canine GISTs, only
Gregory-Bryson et al. (2010) [12] found the presence of synonymous single nucleotide poly-
morphism (SNPs) in exon 12 and 14 of PDGFRA.
Two Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), toceranib and masitinib, have recently entered
into veterinary clinical practice [21,22] and are currently changing the therapeutic approach
for malignancies in dogs and cats. For the treatment of human GISTs, imatinib mesylate, an
anticancer agent targeting several protein tyrosine kinases including c-KIT and PDGFR [23],
is the ﬁrst-line therapy for GISTs carrying the c-KIT [24] and PDGFR mutations [20,25]. A
favorable response to imatinib mesylate has also been reported in dogs with unresected or
metastatic GISTs carrying c-KIT mutations, suggesting the possibility of the effectiveness
of the treatment [7,15]. Strikingly, a metastatic GIST reported by Irie et al. (2015) [7]
showed complete remission after imatinib mesylate treatment. A recent study has shown
the biological activity of toceranib in canine GISTs with shorter progression-free intervals
in GISTs with metastasis and high tumor mitotic index [26]. Therefore, it is important
to identify c-KIT and PDGFR mutations in canine GISTs so that appropriate therapeutic
options can be identiﬁed.
In this study, the type and frequency of c-KIT exon 8, 9 and 11 and PDGFRA exon 12
and 18 mutations, and the potential relationship between mutational status and histotype
and biological behavior, were investigated.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Samples Collection
The study was conducted at Department of Veterinary Medical Sciences (DIMEVET)
University of Bologna (Ozzano Emilia, Bologna, Italy) and was carried out on formalin-
ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded histological samples of canine GISTs received at the Pathological
Service for histological diagnosis over a period of 16 years (2000–2016). All specimens
previously diagnosed as GISTs by histomorphology and CD117 immunopositivity were
included in this study. From records, anamnestic information about the caseload, including
breed, gender and age of the patient, tumors localization, and the presence of metastasis,
when detectable, were extracted.
2.2. Histology
The classiﬁcation was based on histopathological observations according to the criteria
established by the WHO speciﬁc for the tumors of gastrointestinal tract [3], and on the

Vet. Sci. 2022, 9, 376
3 of 12
basis of the veterinary literature [5–10,12–16]. During the histological evaluations, the
morphological type of each case was identiﬁed, and they were classiﬁed according to their
histological pattern (storiform, epithelioid, myxoid and fascicular). Malignant tumors were
classiﬁed using criteria based on cell differentiation, presence and extension of necrosis
within the neoplastic mass, and mitotic index [27,28]. For the evaluation of the histological
grade, the samples were scored from 1 to 3 for each of the three previous parameters:
overall cell differentiation (1, neoplasms that show close resemblance to the physiological
tissue of the adult animal and do not show cellular atypia; 2, neoplasms showing a deﬁned
histological subtype or moderate atypia; 3, neoplasms with poor differentiation and marked
atypia); mitotic activity (1, range from 0 to 9 of mitotic ﬁgures for ten ﬁelds at high magniﬁ-
cation; 2, range from 10 to 19 of mitotic ﬁgures for ten ﬁelds at high magniﬁcation; 3, 20 or
more mitotic ﬁgures for ten ﬁelds at high magniﬁcation) and necrosis (1, absence of necrosis;
2, necrosis ≤50% of the tumor surface of the histological section; 3, necrosis > 50% of the
tumor surface of the histological section). Grade I was assigned to a ﬁnal score of 3 or 4;
Grade II was assigned a score of 5 or 6 and Grade III was assigned with a score of 7, 8 or 9.
2.3. Immunohistochemistry
All the GISTs were subjected to immunohistochemical (IHC) evaluations with CD117,
PDGFRα, SMA and Desmin.
The immunohistochemical staining was performed following the streptavidin-biotin-
peroxidase technique (BIO SPA, Milan, Italy). The antibodies and their dilutions are
as follows: CD117-protein c-KIT (1:500, polyclonal; Dako, Glostrup, Denmark), desmin
(1:100, monoclonal; Dako), actin smooth muscle (1:100, monoclonal; Dako), and PDGFRα
(1:300, polyclonal; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA). After incubation
with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 20 min (to block the activity of endogenous
peroxidases), and treatment in a microwave oven (750 W) for the unmasking of the antigen
in citrate buffer at pH 6.0 (one cycle of 5 min and 5 cycles of 2 and a half minutes each,
topping up the evaporated buffer after each session), the sections were then incubated
overnight at 4 ◦C in a humid chamber with the primary antibody diluted, according to
the appropriate dilutions, in PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4). The sections, subsequently washed in
PBS, were ﬁrst incubated with the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with
biotin) for 30 min at room temperature, then incubated with the streptavidin–peroxidase
complex for 25 min at room temperature. After a 12-minute passage in the DAB chromogen
solution (diaminobenzidine 0.02%, and H2O2 0.001% in PBS), the sections were immediately
rinsed in PBS, then in running water, stained with a counterstain (hematoxylin; Histo-Line
Laboratories, Pantigliate, MI, Italy), dehydrated and mounted with DPX (Fluka, Riedel-de
Häen, Germany).
The results were graded as follows: −, negative reaction; +, foci of positivity (<50%
of neoplastic cells show a positive reaction); ++, widespread cellular positivity (>50%
and <75% of cells immunoreactive); +++, most (>75%) of neoplastic cells are positive.
Appropriate positive controls were used in order to evaluate the speciﬁcity of the reactions
and ascertain the appropriate cross-reactivity in the dog tissue. Normal skeletal muscle
and normal dog intestine were used as positive controls for mesenchymal markers (SMA,
Desmin and PDGFRα). Purkinje cells from cerebellar tissue and mast cell tumors were used
as a positive control for CD117 [29,30]. As a negative control for the immunohistochemical
procedure, 10% normal goat serum was used on the replicated sections instead of the
primary antibody.
2.4. Analysis of c-KIT and PDGFRA Mutations
Tissue sample from each case was analyzed to determine the c-KIT and PDGFRA
mutations status in genomic DNA.
Extraction of the DNA from a 6–8 µm section of formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded
tissue was performed using the NucleoSpin® FFPE DNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren,

Vet. Sci. 2022, 9, 376
4 of 12
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Different primers for c-KIT and
PDGFRA (Table 1) were used for PCR ampliﬁcation.

2.5. Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the Fisher’s exact test to examine the associa-
tions between the presence of c-KIT mutations and histotype, histological grade and the
presence of metastases.
3. Results
3.1. Sample Collection
Seventeen cases of canine gastrointestinal stromal tumors were included in this study.
Nine of these patients were males and 6 were females, and two were of an unknown gender;
half of them were sterilized (Table 2). Two of the affected dogs were German Shepherd
(2/17; 12%) and two Setter (2/17; 12%), while all the other breeds are represented with only
one case; ﬁnally, 5 out of 17 dogs were Mixed breed (29%). The age of onset of the primary
neoplastic mass ranged from 5 to 14 years, with a mean age of 11 years (Table 2). The
localization of the tumor was at the gastric level in two cases (2/17; 12%), one of which was
near the pylorus. In nine subjects (9/17; 53%), the GISTs were found in the small intestine.
Of these, three involve the duodenum (30%), two the jejunum, two the ileum and two had
unspeciﬁed location. The remaining six cases (35%) mainly involved the large intestine
with two cases at the level of the ileocecal valve, three at the level of the cecum and one
at the colon (Table 1) (Figure 1). Metastatic involvement is reported in 4 out of 17 subjects
(24%) affecting the tributary lymph nodes and the mesentery in case #13; liver, diaphragm
and mesentery in case #7; spleen in case #9 and mesentery in case #10 (Table 2).

3.2. Histology
Four out of seventeen GISTs (24%) showed high cellularity, with a storiform pattern.
Upon histological observation, they appear highly cellular, consisting of densely packed
sheets of cells, with a markedly spindle morphology, arranged in palisades or intertwined
and/or intercalated bundles or structured in a ‘storiform’ arrangement, with shaped nuclei
oval and eosinophilic cytoplasm. The cell limits appear indistinct (Figure 2a). In three cases
(#2, 6, 16) it was possible to observe an abundant presence of necrosis (>50%), hemorrhagic
foci, marked neoangiogenesis and extremely dilated and blood-ﬁlled blood vessels.
 
Figure 2. Representative images of histomorphological pattern of GISTs, Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE).
(a) Case #8, storiform pattern. Spindle cells forming whirls and palisades. (b) Case #16, fascicular
pattern. Spindle cells are organized into interlacing and crisscrossing bundles. (c) Case #9, epithelioid
pattern. Nests and sheets of round to polygonal cells. (d) Case #12, myxoid pattern. Scattered,
non-cohesive, spindle cells with myxoid matrix. (a) Scale bar 300 µm and (b–d) scale bar 100 µm.
In 7 cases out of 17 (41%), the neoplasm shows a fasciculate pattern with less marked
cellularity than the previous ones, and on histological observation it appears to consist of
cells with fusiform morphology, which are less densely packed and arranged in loosely
intertwined palisades and of smaller extension (Figure 2b).
In 5 out of 17 samples (29%), the neoplastic cells showed an epithelioid-like appearance,
and appear arranged in trabecular-like structures or, more frequently, in a solid-compact
carpet. The cells, with a polygonal to rounded shape, have an often-vacuolated cytoplasm
and high pleomorphism (Figure 2c).

Vet. Sci. 2022, 9, 376

In one case (#12), it is possible to observe a myxoid pattern, characterized by poorly
structured cells, spindle-shaped and separated by an abundant myxoid matrix. The nuclei
are very elongated with clearly evident nucleoli. Interspersed with these areas it is possible
to observe more or less extensive areas with a fascicular or storiform pattern (Figure 2d).
At the evaluation of the histological grade, 10/17 cases (59%) showed a Grade I; 6/17
cases (35%) have Grade II, and only one case (n◦11) is Grade III (Table 2). Evaluation of
the presence and extent of intratumoral hemorrhage gave the following results: 7/17 (41%)
grade 0, 3/17 (18%) grade 1 and 7/17 (41%) grade 2 (Table 2).
3.3. Immunohistochemistry
In all 17 GISTs, the cells show a strong and widespread cytoplasmic immunopositivity
of the granular type for the KIT protein (CD117) with a percentage of immunopositive cells
greater than about 90%. In only one case (#4) immunoreactivity occurs mainly in the cell
membrane (Figure 3a) and in another (#8) immunoreactivity aggregated at the perinuclear
area with focal distribution (Figure 3b).

tive slides showing strong and uniform cytoplasmic CD117 positivity of the tumor mass. (b) Case #8,

neoplastic cells. (d) Case #4, cytoplasmic positivity to PDGFRα. (a) Scale bar 500 µm, (b–d) scale bar
100 µm.

Vet. Sci. 2022, 9, 376

Ten samples were tested with SMA antibody; only one of these (#6) was found to be
diffusely immunopositive (Figure 3c), while the remaining nine cases showed focal and
weak immunopositivity, with a predominantly cytoplasmic pattern.
Eight samples were tested for Desmin antibody. Of these, seven were negative, while
only one sample (#1) was focally positive at the cytoplasmic level, in about 30% of the cells.
Of all samples tested for PDGFRα antibody, three cases were completely negative, eight
samples were weakly positive and six samples moderately positive. The immunopositivity
pattern for this marker is localized at the cytoplasmic level with variable intensity, from
weak to moderate, with a percentage of positive cells greater than 70% (Figure 3d).
3.4. Analysis of c-KIT and PDGFRA Mutations
c-KIT mutations were detected in 8/17 cases (47%) and always involved exon 11 (dele-
tion of 3–46 bp), while exons 8 and 9 were wild-type in all cases. PDGFRA gene mutation
was identiﬁed only in one case in the exon 18 (ENSCAFT00000003270.5 c.2597 G > A, SNP
activating mutation) (Table 3). The mutation in the dog results in the substitution of Argi-
nine with Lysine in position 866 and it was identiﬁed by DHPLC screening and conﬁrmed
by sequencing, which allowed deﬁnition of the mutation. The mutation is predicted to be
cancer causative with a score of −2.10 (standard threshold at −0.75) using FATHMM [31].

Although follow-up information was not available for all cases, abdominal metastases
were documented in four cases, and all showed a mutation in c-KIT exon-11.
3.5. Statistical Analysis
No signiﬁcant correlations were found between the presence of metastases and his-
tological pattern (p = 0.2605), histological grade and histotype (p = 1.0000), histological
grade and presence of mutations (p = 0.5840). The presence of mutations, on the other hand,
appears to be signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) correlated with the presence of metastases (p = 0.0004).
4. Discussion
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) represent a distinctive diagnostic neoplastic
entity that, although quite uncommon and not yet fully characterized in dogs, has acquired
over the years a well-deﬁned clinical and histopathological identity and generates consid-
erable interest for several reasons. Indeed, canine GISTs bear a very close resemblance to
their human counterparts, representing an excellent spontaneous comparative model. This

similarity paves the way for signiﬁcant therapeutic perspectives in dogs, since features and
the mutational aspect are almost completely superimposable [6–8,12,19,32–35].
In our caseload, collected over a long period (16 years), GISTs are scarcely represented.
However, these data follow epidemiological data from the literature [5,6,10–14,16], which
considers GISTs a neoplasm whose incidence is rather difﬁcult to determine but still
relatively rare, although it represents an important share of gastrointestinal mesenchymal
neoplasms (from 39% to 50%).
CD117 positivity in over 70% of neoplastic cells is the prerequisite for diagnosing
these neoplasms as GISTs [3]. In all our tumors, CD117 revealed an intense and widespread
positivity to over 90% of the neoplastic cells. For most of the cases, this positivity was of a
ﬁnely granular type, and in one case a paranuclear positivity was expressed in the form of
small rounded and intensely colored clusters near the nucleus. This result reﬂects literature
data [16] in which paranuclear positivity has been reported in a small number of cases.
Some attempts have been made to correlate the CD117 immunohistochemical pattern
to the presence of mutations in canine GISTs, similar to what has already been extensively
analyzed for mast cell tumors in dogs [36], but without signiﬁcant results [8]. Furthermore,
in our cases, no association was found between the IHC pattern and the mutational status
of c-KIT.
Eight distinct mutations of the same type (deletions) were identiﬁed in this study,
all involving exon 11 of the c-KIT gene in the juxtamembrane domain. On the other
hand, no mutation was recognized in the other exons investigated (exons 8, 9, 13 and 17).
These results conﬁrm what has already been reported in canine cases [6,7,12] in which the
mutations are localized in exon 11 in almost all of them. Only Irie et al. (2015) [7] reports a
mutation in exon 9 of c-KIT, which is found in humans, but not in our series.
Almost half of the cases analyzed have this KIT mutation (47%; 8/17), in a percent-
age that falls within the range of the few studies that have evaluated the frequency of
this mutation in canine GISTs (from 35% by Gregory-Bryson et al., 2010 [12] to 50% by
Kumagai et al., 2003 [9] up to 74% by Takanosu et al., 2016 [8]). The different results might
be the consequence of the employment of different methodological approaches (conven-
tional PCR vs RT-PCR). The presence of KIT mutations does not appear to be related either
to the GISTs localization, nor to the histotype and to the histological grade of the GI tumors.
Nonetheless, most cases with mutations showed metastases at the time of diagnosis and,
thus, exhibited a more biologically aggressive behavior (p = 0.0004).
One case showed the presence of an activating point mutation at the level of exon 18
of the PDGFRA oncogene (case #4) in correspondence to a human equivalent mutational
hotspot. Until now, no signiﬁcant activating mutation affecting PDGFRA had ever been
reported in the dog, unlike what had been found for some time in humans, in which
activating mutations of this gene represent a share ranging from 10 to 35% [16,19,34].
Interestingly, case #4 also presented an activating mutation in KIT Exon 11. This ﬁnding,
both mutations in the same tumor, has never been observed in human GISTs.
In humans, PDGFRA-mutated GISTs are frequently found in the stomach, presented an
epithelioid histotype and are often associated with a PDGFRα strong immunopositivity [37].
Of note is that case # 4, although localized in the intestine and with a moderate PDGFRα
immunopositivity, shows the same epithelioid histotype.
There are several ‘inhibitory’ molecules that target tyrosine kinase receptors (TKIs),
including imatinib mesylate, which has long been successfully used in the treatment of
human GISTs with KIT mutations. To date, due to its effective therapeutic response, this
TKI has recently been considered the treatment of choice for patients with advanced stage
GISTs. In a study conducted on two dogs with documented exon-11 c-KIT mutations,
imatinib mesylate (Gleevec) has been used for its ability to inhibit protein kinases and
results in a marked tumor response and an increase in survival time [7,15]. The use of
toceranib phosphate in seven dogs with GIST had recently shown a shorter disease-free
interval in dogs with metastasis at diagnosis and a high tumor mitotic index [26]. Therefore,

the role of c-KIT and PDGRFA mutations in canine GISTs must be extensively studied to
understand their potential therapeutic efﬁcacy.
5. Conclusions
c-KIT mutations were detected in half of the cases included in this study, and their
presence appears to be associated with malignancy. An activating mutation of PDGFRA,
which in humans is represented in a signiﬁcant fraction of GISTs, had not yet been reported
in canine GISTs. Unfortunately, follow-up data were not available and, therefore, no
meaningful prognostic information can be provided from this study.
In conclusion, the study conﬁrms that activating mutations of c-KIT play an important
role in canine GISTs, are related to a malignant biological behavior and, therefore, have
strong therapeutic implications. Further studies are needed involving a larger number of
cases with follow-up data in order to demonstrate the prognostic and predictive role of KIT
or PDGFRA mutations in canine GISTs.
Our results indicate, conﬁrming what has already been stated in the literature, to what
extent KIT mutations can have a prognostic and therapeutic signiﬁcance in canine GISTs.
