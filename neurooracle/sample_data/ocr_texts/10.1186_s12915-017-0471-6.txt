Abstract
Background: Phthiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIM), glycolipids found on the outer surface of virulent members of
the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) complex, are a major contributing factor to the pathogenesis of Mtb. Myelocytic
cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, are the primary hosts for Mtb after infection and previous studies have
shown multiple roles for PDIM in supporting Mtb in these cells. However, Mtb can infect other cell types. We previously
showed that Mtb efficiently replicates in human lymphatic endothelial cells (hLECs) and that the hLEC cytosol acts as a
reservoir for Mtb in humans. Here, we examined the role of PDIM in Mtb translocation to the cytosol in hLECs.
Results: Analysis of a Mtb mutant unable to produce PDIM showed less co-localisation of bacteria with the membrane
damage marker Galectin-8 (Gal8), indicating that PDIM strongly contribute to phagosomal membrane damage. Lack of
this Mtb lipid also leads to a reduction in the proportion of Mtb co-localising with markers of macroautophagic
removal of intracellular bacteria (xenophagy) such as ubiquitin, p62 and NDP52. hLEC imaging with transmission
electron microscopy shows that Mtb mutants lacking PDIM are much less frequently localised in the cytosol,
leading to a lower intracellular burden.
Conclusions: PDIM is needed for the disruption of the phagosome membrane in hLEC, helping Mtb avoid the
hydrolytic phagolysosomal milieu. It facilitates the translocation of Mtb into the cytosol, and the decreased intracellular
burden of Mtb lacking PDIM indicates that the cytosol is the preferred replicative niche for Mtb in these cells. We
hypothesise that pharmacological targeting of PDIM synthesis in Mtb would reduce the formation of a lymphatic
reservoir of Mtb in humans.

Background
Worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of
death from an infectious disease with over 1.3 million
TB-related deaths in 2016 [1]. The etiological agent of
TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), has a complex
and unique cell wall with several components on the
outer surface that Mtb uses to interact with the host
cells it infects [2, 3]. One such set of components,
phthiocerol
dimycocerosates
(PDIMs),
are
methyl-
branched fatty acid-containing lipids, which have been
found on all pathogenic members of the Mtb complex
[4] and on all clinical isolates of Mtb [5]. In contrast,
PDIMs are known to be frequently lost during in vitro
culture [5, 6]. This implicates PDIM as a major factor
that contributes to the pathogenesis of TB. Indeed, Mtb
mutants lacking PDIM are severely attenuated in a
guinea pig TB model [5] (with reduced replication and
fewer lung tubercles than seen with a PDIM-positive
strain), as well as in a mouse TB model [7–9]. PDIMs

have been implicated in several functions during Mtb in-
fection, including but not limited to: phagocytic uptake
of Mtb in human macrophages [10], reduced recruit-
ment
of
vacuolar-type
H+-ATPase
(v-ATPase)
and
decreased phagosome-lysotracker association [10], pro-
tection from nitric oxide-dependent killing by macro-
phages [11], masking of pathogen-associated molecular
patterns leading to reduced recruitment of microbicidal
macrophages [12] and induction of host cell death [13].
Recently, PDIMs have been shown to act in concert with
the ESAT-6 secretion system (ESX-1) to promote phago-
somal rupture/damage in primary human macrophages
[14],
THP-1
macrophages
[15]
and
murine
bone
marrow-derived macrophages [16]. Although these stud-
ies concluded that phagosomal membrane rupture is
reduced in the absence of PDIM, without ultrastructural
data there has been no unequivocal confirmation that
this condition reduces the extent to which Mtb localises
in the cytosol.
Myelocytic cells (such as macrophages and dendritic
cells) are the primary hosts for Mtb after infection [17]
and virtually all in vitro studies of PDIM biology have
used murine or human macrophages as a model. How-
ever, Mtb can infect many other cell types [18]. We have
previously shown that primary human lymphatic endo-
thelial cells (hLECs) are a reservoir for Mtb in humans
[19]. Lymphatic endothelial cells form part of the walls
of lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels [20, 21] but are
also increasingly recognised as having a key role in the
innate and adaptive immune response to infection
[22–26]. We showed in vitro that Mtb can be taken up
by hLECs, inside which they disrupt the phagosomal
membrane and translocate to the cytosol, a process in-
volving the secretion of ESAT-6 by the type VII secretion
system ESX-1, encoded within the RD-1 locus [27, 28].
We hypothesised that after escaping from the phago-
some, Mtb replicates preferentially in the cytoplasm of
hLECs, and we observed minimal host cell death
throughout this process [19]. Given the potential im-
portance of cytosolic localisation for efficient Mtb repli-
cation in hLECs, and the emerging role for PDIM in
phagosome damage, we sought to determine if PDIM
were important during Mtb infection of hLECs.
We used an in vitro model using primary hLECs in-
fected with either wild-type (WT) Mtb or a mutant lack-
ing the ability to produce PDIM. Although over 50 kb of
the Mtb genome (>1%) is dedicated to producing PDIM
[29, 30], mutation of any of several biosynthetic or trans-
porter genes is sufficient to prevent completely PDIM
production or its transfer to the outer surface [7, 8, 31,
32]. One such biosynthetic gene (ppsE, encoding phthio-
cerol synthesis polyketide synthase type I) was shown to
be essential for PDIM production [33, 34]. In this study,
we used Mtb H37Rv strain PMM100, which has an
unmarked deletion of ppsE [10]. We also used the WT
parent strain (Mtb WT) and the PMM100 mutant com-
plemented with ppsE [10]. Each strain also expressed a
chromosomally
integrated
green
fluorescent
protein
(GFP) tag [10].
We show that PDIM strongly contributes to the
process of phagosome damage in hLECs, and that lack-
ing PDIM leads to a significantly increased proportion of
Mtb present in phagolysosomes relative to WT Mtb. We
also determined that PDIM contributes towards the
induction
of
selective
autophagy
of
the
bacteria
(xenophagy). Using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), we confirmed that lacking PDIM significantly re-
duces the number of bacteria present in the cytosol.
Finally, we show that the burden of Mtb lacking PDIM
is severely reduced in hLECs, in contrast to the un-
affected bacterial burden seen in macrophages under
similar infection conditions [10, 14]. We suggest that
this defect is due to a fundamental difference in the pri-
mary replicative niche of Mtb in hLECs compared to
macrophages – namely the cytosol – which is much less
accessible when PDIMs are absent. Moreover, transloca-
tion to the cytosol may be a strategy that Mtb employs
to avoid being killed in a phagolysosome.
This work identifies PDIM as an important factor for
Mtb to access and translocate into the cytosol of lymph-
atic endothelial cells and thus, to a potentially replication-
favourable environment. An important consequence of
this scenario is its implication that pharmacologically
targeting PDIM synthesis could severely inhibit the forma-
tion of a lymphatic reservoir of Mtb in humans.
Results
PDIM increases the ability of Mtb to damage the
phagosome and avoid a phagolysosomal fate in hLECs
We infected hLECs with Mtb-GFP WT (Mtb WT),
Mtb-GFP
PMM100
(Mtb
ΔPDIM)
or
Mtb-GFP
PMM100::pMVE (Mtb ΔPDIM::PDIM) at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of ten per cell for a period of 5 h
prior to washing away any extracellular bacteria. We
then allowed the infection to proceed for 2, 24, 48 or
72 h (5 + 2 h, 5 + 24 h etc.) before the samples were fixed
and labelled with specific antibodies to identify different
intracellular markers.
First, we investigated whether PDIMs were involved in
phagosome damage in hLECs using the marker Galectin
8 (Gal8) [35, 36] (Fig. 1a,b). Using an unbiased image-
based analysis (see ‘Methods’) to quantify the association
of Gal8 to either bacterial strain, we determined that
after 5 + 2 hpi, there was a 50% reduction in the extent
to which Mtb in phagosomes was positive for this cyto-
plasmic marker when PDIM was absent (Fig. 1b).
Complementation of the Mtb ΔPDIM strain with PDIM

levels. The effect was more profound at later time points
(24–72 h), when only 1–2% of Mtb phagosomes were
Gal8-positive in the absence of PDIM, compared to
6–9% with PDIM present (Fig. 1b). We also measured
the
association
of
ubiquitin
and
other
xenophagy
markers using the same method (see below).
Phagosome damage is a prerequisite for localisation of
Mtb in the cytosol, in a process that requires the type VII
secretion system encoded by the RD-1 locus [27, 28]. We
previously determined that Mtb lacking the RD-1 locus
was over three times more likely than Mtb WT to be
present in phagolysosomes in hLECs [as measured by
Cathepsin D (CtsD) association] [19] and several studies
have shown that PDIM-less mutants are transported to
acidic compartments in macrophages [10, 37, 38]. We,
therefore, reasoned that because the Mtb ΔPDIM strain
was less capable of damaging the phagosomal membrane,
it would be more frequently localised in phagolysosomes
(Fig. 1c,d). Indeed, we found that after 5 + 24 hpi, there
was a significant 1.5-fold increase in the proportion of
Mtb co-localising with CtsD compared to Mtb WT. This
increased to 1.8-fold at 5 + 48 h and 2.75-fold at 5 + 72 h
(Fig. 1d). Thus, whereas PDIM increased the number of
damaged Mtb WT phagosomes, the lack of this lipid
retained Mtb in phagolysosomes.
NF-kB and IRF-1 are not differentially activated in hLECs by
Mtb lacking PDIM
Mtb PDIMs are reported to mask Toll-like receptors
(TLR) ligands [12] and TLR activation can impact phago-
some maturation in macrophages [39]. Thus, we investi-
gated whether the increased kinetic of Mtb targeting to
phagolysosomes was due to the differential activation of
hLECs by Mtb WT and mutants. We monitored the acti-
vation of NF-kB (p65) and IRF-1 after infection of hLECs
with Mtb WT, Mtb ΔPDIM and Mtb ΔPDIM∷PDIM by
confocal microscopy as previously shown [40, 41]. We
found that after 24 h of infection, Mtb induced NF-kB
activation, as measured by translocation of p65 into the
nucleus but this activation was not significantly different
between Mtb WT and the mutants (Fig. 2a,b). Addition-
ally, Mtb induced IRF-1 activation, as measured by IRF-1
translocation into the nucleus (Fig. 2a). However, this
activation was not significantly different between Mtb WT
and the mutant lacking PDIM (Fig. 2c). Our results argue
that, unlike macrophages, PDIM does not impact TLR
activation in hLEC.
Recruitment of xenophagy-related proteins is impaired when
Mtb lacks PDIM in hLECs
Xenophagy is the attempted destruction of intracellular
pathogens by (selective) autophagy [42]. It has been
shown to be a defence mechanism by which Mtb prolif-
eration is controlled by macrophages [43] and hLECs
[19]. For Mtb, the process is thought to involve the rec-
ognition of the bacterium itself [44], the damaged mem-
brane
surrounding
the
bacterium
[45]
and/or
Mtb-derived products such as extracellular DNA [46].
Ubiquitin (Ub) serves as an autophagy receptor, forming
polyubiquitin chains on these targets and adaptor pro-
teins such as sequestosome 1 (p62) and antigen nuclear
dot 52 kDa protein (NDP52) form a bridge between the
ubiquitin chain and a forming double membrane struc-
ture called a phagophore; the latter is positive for
microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B
(LC3) [46]. Eventually the phagophore fuses to form a
structure that completely encapsulates the bacterium;
this is called an autophagosome.
We previously showed that Mtb lacking the RD-1 re-
gion was not efficiently targeted by autophagosomes in
hLECs [19]. This was hypothesised to be due to the re-
quirement for a damaged phagosome to allow recogni-
tion by the selective autophagy machinery of either Mtb
or the damaged membrane itself. Therefore, given that
Mtb lacking PDIM was significantly less associated with
Gal8, we predicted that the mutant bacteria would be
less frequently associated with components of the xeno-
phagy pathway. Using immunofluorescence labelling, we
measured the association of ubiquitin (Fig. 3a), p62
(Fig. 3b) and NDP52 (Fig. 3c) with WT and mutant Mtb
at 2–72 hpi. There was initially a very low level of asso-
ciation of ubiquitin with Mtb WT at 5 + 2 hpi, but this
increased to 8–10% at 5 + 24 hpi and remained at this
level throughout (Fig. 3a). In contrast, from 24 to 72 hpi,
Mtb ΔPDIM showed very low levels of ubiquitin when
compared to the WT strain (63% at 24 h to 86% reduc-
tion at 72 h; Fig. 3a). In agreement with the role of
PDIM in the recognition by ubiquitin, the PDIM com-
plemented strain had levels comparable with the WT
strain. When p62 (Fig. 3b) and NDP52 (Fig. 3c) localisa-
tion was analysed, similar results were obtained. Overall,
5–15% of the WT bacteria were associated with au-
tophagic markers throughout the infection, which is
consistent with other studies of macrophages [46].
Deletion of PDIM reduced these levels to 1–5%, indi-
cating that PDIMs contribute towards recruitment of
xenophagy proteins.
Mtb lacking PDIM is much less frequently localised in the
cytosol in hLEC
Because the Mtb WT showed a higher frequency of
phagosomal damage than Mtb ΔPDIM, the next predic-
tion was that the WT strain would be more likely to be
physically translocated to the cytoplasm. For this, we
performed conventional resin embedding and TEM on
hLECs infected with each strain for 24 h (Fig. 4a–i). We
had previously established conditions in these cells in
Lerner et al. BMC Biology  (2018) 16:1 
Page 4 of 13

which Mtb in intact phagosomes could be clearly distin-
guished from those that had physically translocated to
the cytoplasm [19]. Here, we also discriminated between
Mtb in phagosomes/phagolysosomes and those sur-
rounded by autophagic structures. The ultrastructural
criteria used to distinguish the three different sub-
populations are described in more detail in the legend of
Fig. 4. After acquiring electron microscopy images, we
used an unbiased stereology approach to quantify the
proportion of bacteria that were localised to the three
different compartments. The data showed that compared
to Mtb WT, there was a 60.4% reduction in the propor-
tion of Mtb ΔPDIM localised in the cytosol, with a
corresponding increase in membrane-bound (but not
autophagic)
bacteria.
Complementation
of
Mtb
ΔPDIM with PDIM reverted the localisations back to
WT levels. Therefore, we concluded that the presence
of PDIM in Mtb WT facilitates the ability of the bac-
teria to escape from the special conditions within the
phagosome and to be exposed to a different environ-
ment in the cytoplasm.
Intracellular burden of Mtb lacking PDIM is severely
reduced in hLECs
Although PDIMs have been shown to be essential for
replication in vivo [5, 7–9], PDIM deficiency was shown
not to affect Mtb burden in human macrophages under
very similar conditions to those used in this study [10,
14]. However, there are some fundamental differences
between hLECs and macrophages that suggest lacking
PDIM would affect Mtb burden in hLECs. For instance,
hLECs have a considerably higher proportion of Mtb
localised in the cytosol than macrophages [19, 47].
Moreover, in contrast to the substantial amount of cell
death observed in Mtb-infected macrophages, infection
of hLECs with Mtb leads to minimal host cell death [19,
48, 49]. Since both strains of Mtb are labelled with GFP,
we could use the total GFP signal per cell as an indicator

of net bacterial growth. We, therefore, quantified the
total GFP signal per hLEC cell (GFP/cell) from 2 to 72
hpi with each Mtb strain (Fig. 5a). Measurements of the
colony-forming units were not used because of the in-
accuracy
deriving
from
the
clumping
of
Mtb,
as
described previously [19]. Because PDIMs have been
shown to be required for efficient phagocytosis in pri-
mary human macrophages [10], we first checked the
uptake of each Mtb strain at 2 hpi (Fig. 5b). Consistent
with previous results, there was on average a 38.2%
reduction in uptake of Mtb ΔPDIM compared to the
WT strain. To compensate for this reduction, we in-
fected hLECs with Mtb ΔPDIM at a tenfold higher MOI,
resulting in an average increase in uptake of 67.1% com-
pared to the WT strain (Fig. 5b). We then measured the
increase in GFP/cell signal over the course of 72 h of in-
fection, and showed that replication of Mtb is severely
inhibited when lacking PDIM in hLECs, with on average
an 11.1-fold increase in WT compared to a 2.12-fold in-
crease in the mutant (Fig. 5c). Even when overcompen-
sating for the reduced uptake using a tenfold higher
MOI, the average GFP/cell was much less than that for
the WT strain with the normal MOI, and showed a
similar 2.03-fold increase as seen for this strain with the
normal MOI (Fig. 5c).
Discussion
Some intracellular pathogens such as Mtb can damage
phagosomal
membranes
[35].
When
this
happens,
glycans present on the inner leaflet of intracellular mem-
branes can be exposed to the cytosol and are recognised
by cytosolic sensors such as galectins [35]. In turn,
galectins recruit the selective autophagy machinery and
thus, the pathogen is targeted by the autophagy pathway
and eventually killed after autophagosome–lysosome fu-
sion. This process is called xenophagy, which is the se-
lective autophagy of a foreign object (in this case, Mtb).
In this study, we used Gal8 as a marker of damaged pha-
gosomes and in combination with autophagy markers
(p62, Ubiquitin and NDP52), we examined the role of
PDIM in the xenophagic recognition of Mtb in hLECs.
Phagosome damage and xenophagy markers were sig-
nificantly less associated with Mtb lacking PDIM than
WT. The simplest explanation for this result is that
phagosome damage is likely to be a prerequisite for
exposure of Mtb itself, Mtb-derived components such as

DNA and the host glycans on the inner leaflet of the
phagosome membrane to the xenophagy machinery.
Indeed, the higher fraction of Mtb WT-associated struc-
tures that label for the xenophagy markers is consistent
with the higher percentage of phagosomes that are ac-
cessible to Gal8. Although the association of markers
with Mtb is generally low (for example, 6–10% of Mtb
WT and only 1–4% of Mtb ΔPDIM co-localise with Gal8
at each snapshot in time from 2–72 hpi; Fig. 1a,b), it is
likely that events in phagosomal damage, pathogen rec-
ognition and targeting of autophagic compartments are
dynamic and transient [36], but this remains to be deter-
mined precisely. Importantly, the differences in the
intracellular trafficking of Mtb are likely independent of

infected with Mtb WT, Mtb ΔPDIM or Mtb ΔPDIM::PDIM for 5 + 24 h and fixed. The samples were processed for resin embedding and then
transmission electron microscopy was used to look at the subcellular localisation of Mtb. Three potential localisations were considered and
classified. a–c Cytosolic (defined as no obvious host membrane surrounding bacteria outside the bacterial capsule-like material visible on the
surface). d–f Phagosomal (defined as bacteria enclosed in a single membrane-bound organelle). Most of these are larger (membrane-bound)
vacuoles, often with more than one Mtb cell as well as additional irregular membranes and contents in various stages of degradation, typical
for phagolysosomes. Arrowheads indicate the phagosomal/phagolysosomal limiting membrane. g–i Autophagic. In this case, the bacteria and
surrounding cytoplasm are enclosed by either single or multiple membranes that are mostly poorly preserved. In contrast to phagolysosomes,
the inner contents of the autophagosomes do not appear to be degraded. The arrowheads here indicate the poorly visible membrane or
remains of membranes on the periphery of the structure. In all images, black stars indicate bacteria. Scale bars are 500 nm. j Stereological
analysis was performed to determine the proportion of Mtb in each compartment. Data are representative of two independent experiments

TLR activation since NF-kB and IRF-1 activation in
hLECs was similar for Mtb WT and Mtb lacking PDIM.
Our
data
show
that
Mtb
lacking
PDIM
more
frequently co-localises with the lysosomal marker CtsD
than Mtb WT (54% versus 35% at 24 hpi) (Fig. 1c,d).
This differs from what has been reported for human
macrophages, where Mtb with
and without
PDIM
equally associates with the lysosomal marker CD63
(around 25% at 24 hpi) [10]. Whereas it is possible that
the trafficking of Mtb in macrophages and hLECs is dif-
ferent, we hypothesise that this reduction is due to the
ability of Mtb to localise in the cytosol of hLECs and
thus, to avoid a phagolysosomal fate. Supporting this, we
measured the effect of PDIM on the localisation of Mtb
in the phagosome vs. the cytosol (Fig. 4) for the first
time. We determined that approximately 50% of the bac-
teria successfully translocate to the cytosol after 24 h,
but only 21% in the absence of PDIM (Fig. 4). The

recent reports on the involvement of PDIM on phago-
some damage [14–16] did not determine if the trans-
location of Mtb to the cytosol was affected because
those
techniques
and
experiments
were
unable
to
discern between cytosolic localisation and access. By
using these methods, the formation of a single damaged
phagosome will give a positive result without determin-
ing the extent of cytosolic localisation, a critical event
that needs to be considered. Here, we used TEM, which,
when the samples are carefully prepared, does show the
presence or absence of host membranes around Mtb.
Although chemical fixation and subsequent dehydration
steps could affect the preservation of the phagosomal
membrane and increase the total numbers of phago-
somes with damaged membranes, the comparison be-
tween the different mutants unambiguously shows that
PDIM contributes to the cytosolic translocation of Mtb
in hLECs. This has yet to be seen in macrophages.
We hypothesised that in hLECs, Mtb replicates prefer-
entially in the cytosol. Consistent with this, the PDIM
mutant, which escapes less far into the cytosol, is signifi-
cantly inhibited for growth in hLECs. Although PDIM
mutants are attenuated in vivo [5, 7–9], to our know-
ledge in cellulo models of Mtb infection using PDIM
mutants show that at high MOI, there is no replication
defect of PDIM-less strains [10, 14]. Moreover, at low
MOIs, PDIM-deficient strains show only a moderate
replication defect [13, 14] or no significant difference
[11]. One study using transposon mutants in PDIM loci
shows that three of five strains have a reduced burden,
whereas two of five are the same as WT; however, these
differences may be due to off-target effects, which are
possible when using transposons [8]. In this study, we
used a high MOI to be consistent with the literature and
in agreement with our previous studies [19]. We show
that, unlike what is reported for macrophages, Mtb
ΔPDIM has a significantly reduced burden compared to
WT. Even infecting with a tenfold higher MOI (over-
compensating for reduced uptake of ΔPDIM) does not
lead to a higher burden than the WT at the original
MOI. Therefore, there is a clear attenuation when PDIM
is absent in hLECs.
The in vivo attenuation of PDIM mutants is thought
to result from increased susceptibility to reactive nitro-
gen intermediates produced by macrophages as well as
the enhanced activation of the immune response early
during infection [11]. PDIM-less mutants have been
shown to be less efficient at preventing v-ATPase re-
cruitment to the phagosome membrane and are more
frequently found in acidified compartments. This did
not, however, lead to differences in the extent of Mtb in
the phagolysosome [10], perhaps explaining why there
was no difference in intracellular burden. In contrast, we
observed a marked increase in the extent to which the
PDIM mutant co-localised with the phagolysosome
marker CtsD. This result was comparable to what we
observed with a RD-1 mutant in the same model and
with the same infection conditions. We previously
showed that a large proportion of Mtb cells translocate
into the cytosol in hLECs without causing cell death
[19]. We reasoned that this translocation is a mechanism
to avoid being killed in the phagolysosome. This cyto-
solic replication of Mtb in hLECs represents a funda-
mental
difference
when
compared to macrophages,
where cytosolic translocation is associated with cell
death [49] and extensive Mtb replication in dead cells
[48]. Thus, the reduced ability of the PDIM strain to
localise in the cytosol would largely explain why PDIMs
are crucial for replication in hLECs, whereas it is much
less crucial (or not at all) in macrophages. However,
there was still 21% of PDIM-negative Mtb present in the
cytosol, yet this seems not to contribute towards increas-
ing the intracellular burden. Therefore, there are likely
further mechanisms by which PDIM indirectly or dir-
ectly affects replication in hLECs. One possible mechan-
ism could be related to the reported higher permeability
of the Mtb cell wall in PDIM-negative strains of Mtb
[29]. It is feasible that PDIM-less Mtb is more sensitive
to an antibacterial cytosolic component than Mtb WT
such as nitric oxide from endothelial nitric oxide
synthase, which we previously found to target cytosolic
Mtb [19].
Extrapulmonary TB accounts for 25% of all cases and
infection of the lymph nodes represents a key stage in
TB dissemination. Therefore, lack of growth in hLECs
by PDIM-deficient Mtb could contribute to the many
reasons why there is discordance between the reports of
only a minor effect of PDIM deficiency in macrophages
in cellulo and PDIM being essential for virulence in vivo.
In addition, this suggests that targeting PDIM synthesis
pharmacologically could significantly reduce the lymph-
atic reservoir of Mtb in vivo, subsequently reducing both
dissemination and reactivation of Mtb. Supporting this,
one of the two known mechanisms of action of pyrazina-
mide (a first-line anti-tubercular drug) targets PDIM
synthesis [50], but the effects of this drug on the lymph-
atic pool of Mtb specifically due to targeting PDIM syn-
thesis is unknown.
With the increasing recognition of PDIM as a key
factor for Mtb–host interactions, it is essential to
consider the PDIM status of strains used for infec-
tion.
Furthermore,
Mtb
is
likely
to
exist
as
a
heterogenous population in respect to PDIM/ESX-1
expression and secretion levels, even when prepared
as a clonal population. These factors may explain
some of the many discrepancies regarding intracellu-

extracellular signalling that are present in the litera-
ture and should be considered.
Conclusions
We determined that there was at least a 50% decrease in
the extent of phagosome damage when PDIMs were
absent from Mtb in hLECs after 5 + 2 h of infection. The
reduced phagosome damage correlated with an in-
creased presence of Mtb in phagolysosomes. We also
found that a lack of PDIM led to reduced recruitment of
xenophagy markers, most likely due to the lack of
phagosome membrane damage and therefore, reduced
access for xenophagy receptors to Mtb and/or the cyto-
solic surveillance pathway to Mtb-derived nucleic acids.
Ultrastructural analysis confirmed that Mtb lacking
PDIM was much less frequently localised in the cytosol
in hLECs after 5 + 24 h of infection. Finally, we deter-
mined that the intracellular burden of Mtb lacking
PDIM is severely reduced in hLECs. This work high-
lights PDIM as a crucial virulence factor for Mtb in
hLECs and suggests that pharmacological targeting of
PDIM synthesis may lead to a reduced reservoir of Mtb
in the lymphatic system in humans. For the wider
tuberculosis field, this work further emphasises the
importance of ensuring that cultured Mtb stocks are
PDIM-positive, because PDIM is frequently lost during
in vitro culturing [6] and this can have multiple deleteri-
ous consequences in cellulo.
Methods
Eukaryotic cell culture
Primary hLECs (ScienCell Research Laboratories) were
cultured according to the supplier’s instructions up to pas-
sage 5. hLECs were seeded at a density of 5000 cells per
cm2 into T-75 flasks that had been coated with fibronectin
(Sigma-Aldrich) overnight at 37 °C. hLECs were incubated
at 37 °C with 5% CO2 overnight in endothelial cell
medium (ECM) (ScienCell Research Laboratories) supple-
mented with 5% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (ScienCell
Research Laboratories) and 1% (v/v) endothelial cell
growth supplement (ScienCell Research Laboratories).
The cells were then washed with phosphate buffered sa-
line (PBS) and the culture medium replaced. The cells
were grown until 90% confluent, detached from the flask
using 2.5 mL 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (Gibco) and used for
experimentation (or passaged into new flasks). For con-
focal microscopy, 10,000 hLECs in 300 μL with complete
ECM were seeded onto fibronectin-treated 1.5-thickness
10-mm-diameter glass coverslips (Glaswarenfabrik Karl
Hecht) placed into each well of 24-well plates treated with
tissue culture. For electron microscopy, 300,000 hLECs
were seeded in 5 mL with complete ECM in fibronectin-
treated T-25 flasks.
Bacterial strains and culture
Mtb strains used in this study were kindly provided by
C. Asterie-Dequeker as used in [10]. A detailed descrip-
tion of these strains including the method used to knock
out and complement the ppsE gene, as well as fluores-
cently label the bacteria using an integrating GFP tag, is
provided in [10]. In this study, we refer to the Mtb-GFP
WT strain as Mtb WT, the Mtb-GFP PMM100 strain as
Mtb ΔPDIM and the Mtb-GFP PMM100::pMVE strain
as Mtb ΔPDIM::PDIM. Culture of the mycobacteria was
in Middlebrook’s 7H9 broth medium (Sigma-Aldrich)
supplemented
with
0.05%
(v/v)
glycerol
(Fisher
Chemical), 10% (v/v) Middlebrook albumin-dextrose-
catalase (BD Biosciences) and 0.05% (v/v) Tween80
(Sigma-Aldrich). Cultures of 10 mL were incubated at
37 °C with rotation in 50-mL Falcon tubes.
Infection of hLECs with Mtb
Mtb was grown to mid-exponential phase and pelleted
at 2000 g in a benchtop centrifuge for 5 min at room
temperature (RT). A pellet was washed once with 10 mL
PBS and once with 10 mL ECM, re-pelleting after each
wash. Five sterile 2.5–3.5 mm glass balls (VWR) were
added to the pellet and vigorously shaken for 1 min to
break up clumps of bacteria. Then, 10 mL of ECM was
used to rinse the sides of the Falcon tube and resuspend
the bacteria. Next, a slow spin at 300 g for 5 minutes
was performed and the top 8 mL of the suspension was
carefully transferred to a new Falcon tube. OD600 was
measured and the mixture diluted in ECM to achieve a
MOI of ten bacteria to one hLEC (assuming a cell sus-
pension of OD 0.1 contains 107 mycobacteria per mL;
data not shown) in a total volume of 300 μL of ECM per
well in a 24-well plate or 2 mL of ECM per T-25 flask.
After 5 h of infection (at 37 °C with 5% CO2), the cells
were washed twice with PBS to remove extracellular
bacteria and then 1 mL (for 24-well plates) or 5 mL (for
T-25 flasks) of complete ECM was added and incubated
for 2, 24, 48 and 72 hours.

Indirect immunofluorescence
At the required time point, hLECs infected with Mtb on
glass coverslips were fixed by removing the culture
medium, washing once with 1 mL of PBS and then
adding PBS containing 3% (v/v) methanol-free parafor-
maldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) overnight at
4 °C. The samples were then quenched with 1 mL of
50 mM NH4Cl (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 15 mins at
RT and then permeabilised with 500 μL 0.05% (w/v)
saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1% (w/v) bovine serum
albumin (BSA; Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 mins at RT.
After one PBS wash for 5 mins at RT, the coverslips
were transferred onto a sheet of parafilm attached to the
bench. Before the coverslips could dry out, 50 μl of di-
luted
primary
antibody
(in
PBS
containing
0.05%
saponin and 1% BSA) was added onto the coverslip and
then incubated in the dark with a moist tissue for 1 h at
RT. Next, the coverslips were transferred back into the
wells of a 24-well plate and washed three times with
1 mL of PBS for 5 min each. The secondary antibody
was added in the same way as the primary. After two
more PBS washes, DNA was stained using 1 mL of 300
nM DAPI (Life Technologies) in PBS for 10 mins at RT.
The coverslips were washed once more and finally were
mounted onto glass slides using 8 μL DAKO mounting
medium (DAKO Cytomation).
Fluorescence imaging and analysis
We used a Leica SP5 laser scanning confocal microscope
with an acousto-optical beam splitter (Leica Microsys-
tems) equipped with HC PL APO CS2 63×, 1.4 NA oil
objective, UV laser (excitation at 405 nm), argon laser
(488 nm), diode-pumped solid-state laser (561 nm),
HeNe laser (633 nm), one photomultiplier tube detector
and two HyD detectors for all imaging of fixed samples,
with Leica Type F (Leica Microsystems) immersion oil.
Image acquisition used the proprietary Leica LAS AF
software (Leica Microsystems) with the following set-
tings: argon laser set to 20%, scanning mode xyz,
sequential acquisition, pixel resolution of 1024 × 1024,
scanner frequency 200 Hz, line averaging 4, zoom 1,
8-bit acquisition. All acquisition settings were kept
constant between repeats. At least six random fields of
view were analysed for each sample, with at least three
independent
repetitions
performed
(unless
stated
otherwise).
Leica SP5 files (lif) were opened using FIJI, a distribu-
tion of ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). To
measure the intracellular replication of Mtb (i.e. the GFP
signal per hLEC), a cell was outlined using the ‘line’ tool
to create a region of interest and the GFP channel was
duplicated. Anything outside the region of interest was
cleared, and the GFP channel was subjected to a consist-
ent pixel threshold of 50, thus creating a binary image
where each GFP pixel had a value of 255. The sum value
of the GFP pixels is called RAWIntDen. Because each
GFP pixel is 0.24 × 0.24 μm and has a value of 255,
RAWIntDen can be converted to total GFP area per
hLEC (μm2) using the following equation: (RAWInt-
Den × (0.24 × 0.24))/255.
To measure the association of a marker (e.g. Gal8)
with the bacteria, we measured the mean intensity of all
the pixels in the marker channel that overlap with the
GFP from the bacteria channel. This was done by split-
ting the multi-channel image into individual channels
and subjecting the GFP channel to a consistent pixel
threshold of 50 to create a mask. The mask was sub-
jected to the ‘fill holes’, ‘dilate’ (1 pixel) and ‘erode’
(1 pixel) tools in that order to create a good representa-
tion of the true outlines of the bacteria. Then the ‘ana-
lyse
particles’
function
of
FIJI
was
used
and
measurements were re-directed to the marker channel.
Ultrastructural analysis
After 5 + 24 h of infection, hLECs infected with Mtb in
T-25 flasks were fixed by addition of warm 2% glutaral-
dehyde in 200 mM HEPES pH 7.4 directly to the culture
medium at a 1:1 volume ratio. After 5 min, this was re-
placed with 5 mL of 1% glutaraldehyde in 200 mM
HEPES and kept at pH 7.4 overnight at 4 °C. Subse-
quently, cells were gently scraped and embedded in 1%
low-melting-point agarose (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Blocks were post-fixed with 2% osmium tetroxide solu-
tion (Electron Microscopy Sciences) containing 1.5%
potassium ferricyanide for 2 h on ice, then stained with
1% tannin for 30 min and with 2% aqueous uranyl acet-
ate (Electron Microscopy Sciences) for 2 h at RT. Next,
cells were dehydrated at RT starting with a graded etha-
nol series (70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 100%), ending with
propylene oxide, followed by gradual infiltration with
Spurr's
resin
(Polysciences)
over
2
days.
Ultrathin
sections (~70 nm) were cut using an ultramicrotome
Ultracut EM UCT (Leica Microsystems) and a diamond
knife (Diatome), and contrasted with 0.2% lead citrate
for 15 s. Sections were analysed with a JEM-1400 TEM
(JEOL). Images were taken with a TemCam-F216 cam-
era and EM-MENU software (TVIPS).
At least 32 different infected cells per sample were
imaged by systematic random sampling. For subcellular
localisation analysis, cytosolic, phagosomal/phagolysoso-
mal or autophagic bacteria were classified as described
in the legend to Fig. 3. Their relative proportions were

determined by counting cross-points of the stereological
test grid over bacteria. Proportions were calculated from
total counts per sample.
Data and statistical analysis
Results are expressed as means from three independent
experiments (unless otherwise stated) ± standard error of
the mean. Data were plotted and statistical analyses were
performed using Graphpad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software
Inc). Means between three or more groups were tested
for significant differences using one-way ANOVA with
Tukey’s post-test.
