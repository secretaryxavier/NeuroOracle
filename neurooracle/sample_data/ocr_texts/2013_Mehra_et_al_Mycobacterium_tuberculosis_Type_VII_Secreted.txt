Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) disrupts anti-microbial pathways of macrophages, cells that normally kill bacteria. Over 40
years ago, D’Arcy Hart showed that Mtb avoids delivery to lysosomes, but the molecular mechanisms that allow Mtb to
elude lysosomal degradation are poorly understood. Specialized secretion systems are often used by bacterial pathogens to
translocate effectors that target the host, and Mtb encodes type VII secretion systems (TSSSs) that enable mycobacteria to
secrete proteins across their complex cell envelope; however, their cellular targets are unknown. Here, we describe a
systematic strategy to identify bacterial virulence factors by looking for interactions between the Mtb secretome and host
proteins using a high throughput, high stringency, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) platform. Using this approach we identified an
interaction between EsxH, which is secreted by the Esx-3 TSSS, and human hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine
kinase substrate (Hgs/Hrs), a component of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). ESCRT has a
well-described role in directing proteins destined for lysosomal degradation into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) of multivesicular
bodies (MVBs), ensuring degradation of the sorted cargo upon MVB-lysosome fusion. Here, we show that ESCRT is required
to deliver Mtb to the lysosome and to restrict intracellular bacterial growth. Further, EsxH, in complex with EsxG, disrupts
ESCRT function and impairs phagosome maturation. Thus, we demonstrate a role for a TSSS and the host ESCRT machinery
in one of the central features of tuberculosis pathogenesis.

Introduction
An important virulence property of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
(Mtb)- the causative agent of the disease tuberculosis- is its ability
to avoid delivery to the lysosome. It has long been appreciated that
Mtb alters phagosome maturation, such that internalized bacteria
are not transported to the lysosome but instead reside in an early
endosome-like compartment [1,2]. The Mtb-induced block in
phagosome-lysosome fusion has been attributed to a wide array of
lipid and protein effectors [3,4] but the mechanism remains poorly
understood. More recently, the ability of Mtb to permeabilize the
phagosomal membrane, which allows bacterial products and in
some cases intact bacteria to access the cytosol, has been described
[5–9]. The TSSS Esx-1 and its secreted effectors, EsxA/ESAT-6
and EsxB/CFP-10, are critical for this process. Esx-1 has been
investigated intensively because its absence in the vaccine strain
Mycobacterium bovis-BCG (BCG) largely accounts for attenuation
of that strain [8–10]. Mtb encodes five loci resembling Esx-1
(Esx-1-Esx-5), as well as 11 tandem pairs of proteins similar to EsxA
and EsxB (EsxA-EsxW), but their cellular targets, if any, are
unknown [11]. Esx-3 plays a role in iron acquisition in Mtb, as well
as in a non-pathogenic strain, Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmeg)
[12,13]. Esx-3 is a focus of vaccine efforts because it secretes EsxG/
TB9.8 and EsxH/TB10.4, which are highly antigenic [14,15], and
because introduction of the Mtb ESX-3 locus into an Msmeg strain
lacking the endogenous ESX-3 region generates highly protective
immunity [16]. The ESX-5 locus is required for transport of proteins
with conserved proline-glutamic acid (PE) and proline-proline-
glutamic acid (PPE) motifs [17,18] and modulates macrophage
responses [19]. Thus, TSSSs and their putative effectors appear to
be important in virulence and modulating host cells, however, their
mechanism of action and molecular targets are unclear.

Here, we show that EsxG and EsxH from Mtb, but not the
Msmeg homologs, target the host factor, Hrs. Hrs is a component
of the ESCRT machinery, a group of four protein complexes
(ESCRT-0 to ESCRT-III) composed of cytosolic components that
are sequentially recruited to the endosomal membrane. The
ESCRT machinery has a well-described role in directing cargo
destined for degradation into intraluminal vesicles of multivesic-
ular bodies (MVBs) that fuse with lysosomes [20,21]. We show that
ESCRT is also required to deliver Mtb to the lysosome and to
restrict intracellular bacterial growth. EsxH, in complex with
EsxG, is able to disrupt ESCRT function and impair phagosome
maturation.
Results
High throughput identification of Mtb secretome-human
host interactions
We used a systematic strategy to identify secreted bacterial
virulence factors by looking for interactions with host proteins
using a high throughput, high stringency, yeast two-hybrid (Y2H)
platform [22]. First, we curated the literature to define the Mtb
secretome.
Thirty-eight
publications
predicted
718
secreted
proteins based on presence in culture filtrate (CF), ability to cause
secretion of an assayable protein, bioinformatic criteria, or detailed
study (see Text S1 for additional details). In order to prioritize
open reading frames (ORFs) for screening, we imposed a number
of criteria, such as excluding proteins with multiple transmem-
brane spanning domains (see Text S1 for additional details). In
addition, since the starting list of putative secreted proteins might
contain proteins that are not actually secreted, we attempted to
eliminate ORFs that were likely to be inaccurately classified as
secreted. One way in which this can happen is if cytoplasmic
proteins appear in CF due to bacterial lysis. In order to minimize
the contribution of such proteins, we did not include ORFs that
were annotated in Tuberculist (http://tuberculist.epfl.ch/) as
being involved in lipid metabolism, information pathways (which
contains proteins involved in replication, transcription and
translation), or intermediary metabolism and respiration, since
most of these are likely involved in basic, intrinsic bacterial
processes, and hence, many may be misclassified. To avoid
removing true secreted proteins, ORFs were not de-prioritized if
they had a possible signal sequence or there were data supporting
their role during infection. In doing so, we removed many proteins
that were found in CF in a single study, and hence may be
misclassified (see Text S1 for details). From the final list, 339
sequence validated secretome ORFs were provided by Pathogen
Functional Genomic Resource Center (PFGRC; Dataset S1).
Because many secreted proteins play an intrinsic role in the
bacterial lifecycle, we anticipated that only a small fraction would
interact with human proteins. Thus, to estimate a false positive hit
rate of our system, we included sixty ORFs that are not likely to be
secreted to serve as controls (see Text S1 for details; Dataset S2).
In order to evaluate their performance in Y2H protein-protein
interaction (PPI) mapping, we tested the 399 Mtb ORFs expressed
as Gal4-DNA binding domain (DB) fusions for pair wise
interactions with the same 399 Mtb ORFs expressed as Gal4-
activation domain (AD) fusions. From the ,160,000 combinations
queried, we found 14 unique PPIs (Table S1). The rate of
interactions is as high as in human ORFeome mapping [22],
exceeding the stochastic false positive rate of the Y2H platform by
fifteen-fold [23]. Half of the interactions were between proteins
belonging to the WXG100 family (EsxA-EsxW). These proteins
are approximately 100 amino acids in length and have a
characteristic hairpin bend formed by a Trp-Xaa-Gly (W-X-G)
motif. Mtb encodes 11 tandem pairs of such proteins, which are
thought to function as secreted heterodimers. Heterodimer
formation is proposed to be limited to interactions between
genome pairs or very closely related family members [24,25], and
the interactions we detected by Y2H exhibit this specificity. Six of
the remaining seven PPIs involved homotypic interactions; for
example, bacterioferritin (BfrB) was found to interact with itself,
consistent with the proposal that it assembles into 24-subunit
oligomers [26].
After ensuring the high performance of Mtb ORFs in Y2H PPI
mapping, we looked for interactions between the Mtb secretome
and ,12,000 human ORFs, testing approximately 4 million
interactions. From the secretome collection, we identified 99 PPIs
between 53 Mtb proteins and 63 human proteins (Dataset S3).
The number of Mtb proteins exhibiting an interaction with a
human protein was approximately two-fold higher for the
secretome collection compared to the non-secreted control set
(53 out of 339 versus 5 out of 60). We analyzed the collection to
determine whether PPIs were enriched for subsets of Mtb proteins
(Table S2). We observed that the sixteen Esx proteins included in
the collection were significantly more likely to interact with human
ORFs than were controls (p = 0.0087). The finding that Esx
proteins were enriched for interactions may reflect that this group
of proteins plays an important role in virulence, or could mean
that these proteins, which usually form a heterodimer, are prone to
aberrant interactions when they are expressed without their
binding partner.
It is difficult to gauge the success of the screen based upon
known interaction between Mtb proteins and cytosolic human
protein because so few are known. Included in our screening set
were, PtpA, which has been shown to interact with Vps33B and
the H subunit of the human v-ATPase [27,28], LpdC, which
interacts with coronin 1 [29], and NdkA, which interacts with
Rab5 and Rab7 [30]. We did not identify these known
interactions, however, the screen was not performed to saturation
and the Y2H platform can detect ,20% of well-validated
interacting pairs [31]. We did identify an interaction between
PtpA and Ligand of Numb protein X (LNX1), a RING finger-type

causes

tuberculosis, one of the world’s most deadly infections.
The host immune system can’t eradicate Mtb because it
grows within macrophages, cells that normally kill bacteria.
One of the intracellular survival strategies of Mtb is to
avoid delivery to lysosomes, a phenomenon described
over 40 years ago, but for which the mechanism and
molecular details remain incomplete. Mtb possess special-
ized secretion systems (Type VII secretion systems; TSSS)
that transfer particular proteins out of the bacteria, but
how these proteins promote infection is not well under-
stood. In this study, we used a high stringency yeast two-
hybrid system to identify interactions between secreted
effectors from Mtb and human host factors. We identified
ninety-nine such interactions and focused our attention on
the interaction between EsxH, secreted by Esx-3, a TSSS of
Mtb, and Hrs, a component of the host ESCRT machinery.
We provide evidence that Mtb EsxH directly targets host
Hrs to disrupt delivery of bacteria to lysosomes. Thus, this
study demonstrates the role of a TSSS effector and the
ESCRT machinery in what is one of the central features of
tuberculosis pathogenesis, thereby providing molecular
insight into why humans can’t clear Mtb infection.

E3 ligase that contains 4 PDZ domains and plays a scaffolding role
in diverse cellular pathways. Several other secretome ORFs also
interacted with LNX1, suggesting that LNX1 might be modulated
by Mtb, or LNX1 might regulate the function or stability of
certain Mtb effectors.
When we examined hit rates based upon the functional category
of the Mtb ORFs, the category with the greatest enrichment was
cell wall and cell processes, which contains the Esx family
members. The intermediary metabolism and respiration category
exhibited a hit rate similar to the control collection, consistent with
the idea that most of these ORFs do not function in host
interactions as their annotation suggests. Interestingly, one of the
two proteins that did exhibit an interaction in this category is
Zmp1, a zinc metalloprotease which has been shown to inhibit the
inflammasome and impair phagosome maturation but whose
cellular target is unknown [32]. Zmp1 interacted with KCTD6, a
BTB/POZ domain containing protein that can function as a
Cullin3 (Cul3) adaptor [33]. Cul3 has recently been shown to be
a regulator of endo-lysosomal trafficking, suggesting that Zmp1
may impair phagosome maturation by acting on KCTD6-Cul3
[34].
To evaluate the human targets of the Mtb proteins, we searched
the STRING database (http://string.embl.de/) for each of the
proteins’ functional associations. The STRING database predicts
protein-protein interactions based upon physical and functional
associations, such as available high-throughput data, co-expres-
sion, genomic context, and text mining of available literature.
Using a medium confidence value to define protein-protein
interactions, there were significantly more interactions (n = 16)
observed for the human targets than would be predicted by chance
(p = 8.3610212). We identified proteins involved in host immunity
to bacterial infection, such as Ndp52 [35,36], Tax1pb1 [37], and
STAT3 [38], however, human targets of the Mtb proteins were
not significantly enriched for annotated pathways in the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) when corrected for
multiple testing, which may reflect the limited number of human
targets found.
ESCRT is required for restricting intracellular growth and
trafficking of slow growing mycobacteria
We focused on the interaction between EsxH and Hrs because
TSSSs, which secrete Esx proteins, are clearly important in
virulence but the function of their secreted effectors is largely
unknown. In addition, our existing data supported the idea that
the ESCRT machinery is important in controlling bacterial
replication. Hrs, which plays a central role in the assembly of the
initial ESCRT components on endosomes, is recruited to
mycobacterial phagosomes [39], and we had previously shown
in an RNAi screen in Drosophila that ESCRT restricts the
intracellular growth of rapidly growing mycobacteria [40,41].
Control of bacterial replication appears to be particularly sensitive
to ESCRT perturbation, because, in addition, when we screened
,6500 siRNA pools in RAW 264.7 (RAW) macrophages for their
ability to confer enhanced intracellular growth of Msmeg, we
found that the two strongest hits were Rab7, known to be involved
in late endosome-lysosome fusion, and Tsg101, an ESCRT-I
component that is recruited to endosomes by Hrs (data not
shown). Hrs was also identified in this screen, although previously
we had found no effect with Hrs silencing, which we now attribute
to insufficient protein depletion [41]. In the RAW cell RNAi
screen that identified Hrs, we used Ambion Silencer siRNA pools,
whereas previously we used a Dharmacon siGENOME pool to
deplete Hrs [41]. To clarify the discrepancy, we tested a third pool
(Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus), which, like the Ambion pool,
conferred enhanced growth to Msmeg. We tested the individual
Dharmacon ON-TARGETplus siRNAs and found that 2 of 4
targeting Hrs resulted in depletion of Hrs protein, enhanced the
growth of Msmeg, and altered trafficking, whereas the other two
had no effect (Figure S1 and data not shown). Thus, one possibility
is that Mtb secretes EsxH, which binds Hrs and impairs ESCRT
function, thereby promoting intracellular bacterial growth. To
determine whether ESCRT restricts growth of Mtb, we depleted
Hrs and Tsg101 and examined the intracellular growth of Mtb in
RAW macrophages. We found no significant effect of silencing on
bacterial uptake (data not shown), however when we assessed
bacterial colony forming units (CFU) two day post-infection, we
observed enhanced intracellular survival of Mtb in cells depleted of
Hrs or Tsg101, similar to what was seen with Rab7 silencing
(Figure 1A). Intracellular growth of BCG in bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDMs) was even more strongly effected (Figure
S2). Thus, Hrs restricts growth of slow growing and virulent
mycobacteria.
ESCRT targets certain cell surface receptors and biosynthetic
cargo to lysosomes [42]. Thus, ESCRT might restrict intracellular
bacterial
growth
by
governing
bacterial
trafficking
and/or
lysosomal content. We examined the localization of Mtb relative
to Transferrin Receptor (TfR), a marker of early and recycling
endosomes, and LAMP1, a marker of late endosomes and
lysosomes using automated image analysis (Figures S3A, S3B).
In cells depleted of Tsg101, Hrs, or Rab7, we observed diminished
co-localization between Mtb and LAMP1 and a concomitant
increase in co-localization of Mtb with TfR compared to control
cells 24 hours post-infection (hpi) (Figure 1B), suggesting decreased
Mtb delivery to degradative compartments. Similarly, in cells
infected with BCG there was diminished co-localization with
LysoTracker, which accumulates in the acidic environment of the
lysosome, and enhanced co-localization with TfR (Figure 1B).
Thus, Hrs and Tsg101, like Rab7, are required for bacterial
trafficking. To verify that bacterial viability correlates with low
LAMP1 and LysoTracker co-localization and with high TfR co-
localization, we compared the cellular localization of viable
bacteria to total bacteria. We identified metabolically active
BCG 24 hpi based upon their ability to induce expression of GFP
from
a
tetracycline-inducible
promoter
(BCG-tet-GFP)
and
compared their intracellular localization to the BCG strain that
constitutively express GFP (BCG-GFP). Whereas there was a wide
range in intensities of associated LAMP1 and LysoTracker with
BCG-GFP, metabolically active bacteria were found almost
exclusively in phagosomes with minimal acidification, little co-
localization with LAMP1, and enhanced TfR co-localization at
48 hpi (Figure S3C). Thus, impaired bacterial trafficking to a late
endosomal or lysosomal compartment underlies the failure to
control
mycobacterial
replication
in
ESCRT-depleted
cells,
although altered lysosomal content may also contribute.
The Mtb EsxG EsxH heterodimer binds Hrs
Pathogenic mycobacteria arrest phagosome maturation in
evolutionarily diverse cells. Supporting the idea that EsxH might
play a role in inhibition of bacterial degradation, we observed that
EsxH interacts with human, mouse, and zebrafish orthologs of
Hrs, suggesting that it recognizes a conserved structural feature of
Hrs (Figure 2A). Orthologs of EsxH are found widely in
mycobacteria, including in the non-pathogen Msmeg. If EsxH
prevents phagosome-lysosome fusion by impairing Hrs function,
we anticipate that would be a feature specific to EsxH from
pathogenic mycobacteria. To test this, we cloned the EsxH
ortholog from Msmeg (MSMEG_0621; EsxHMs), which encodes a
protein 75% identical to EsxH from Mtb (hereafter referred to as

EsxHMt). Although EsxHMs interacted with EsxGMt, demonstrat-
ing that the protein was functional in the Y2H assay, it interacted
poorly with Hrs (Figure 2A), consistent with the notion that the
interaction of EsxHMt with Hrs contributes to virulence.
EsxHMt forms a heterodimer with EsxGMt, composed of a four-
helix bundle with flexible N- and C-terminal arms from both
proteins that coordinate zinc and contribute to a cleft that has
been predicted to mediate a PPI [43]. To determine whether Hrs
interacts with the heterodimer, we used a fusion protein in which
EsxGMt and EsxHMt were expressed as a single polypeptide that
preserves the folded structure of the native heterodimer [44]. This
fusion protein interacted with Hrs (Figure 2B). Deletion of the first
five amino acids of EsxHMt (EsxGMt-EsxHMt-DN5) weakened its
interaction with Hrs (Figure 2B). These data show that Hrs can
interact with EsxHMt when it is complexed to EsxGMt and suggest
that the conformation of the amino terminal arm of EsxHMt is
important. To further test whether the structure of the N- and C-
termini are important, we mutated His-14, His-70, and His-76
Glu-77. These residues contribute to zinc binding, and His-76 is
also part of the predicted cleft. We mutated them to Ala, with the
exception of His-70, which we changed to Arg because this is
found in EsxHMs. While H14A and H70R did not have a
detectable effect, when His-76 and Glu-77 were both changed to
Ala, the interaction between EsxHMt and Hrs was impaired,
although EsxHMt H76A-E77A still interacted with EsxGMt
(Figure 2A). To verify that EsxHMt binds Hrs, we purified the
EsxGMt EsxHMt heterodimer from E. coli [44] and Hrs from
baculovirus [45]. Hrs bound EsxGMt EsxHMt in a saturable
manner, exhibiting stoichiometric binding with a Kd of ,5 mM
(Figure 2C and 2D). We conclude that Hrs interacts with the
EsxGMt EsxHMt heterodimer, and the interaction likely involves
the N- and C-terminal arms of EsxHMt.
EsxGMt and EsxHMt disrupt ESCRT function in mammalian
cells
To determine whether EsxHMt interacts with Hrs and alters
ESCRT function in mammalian cells, we expressed EsxHMt–
FLAG in HEK293 cells. EsxHMt was not detectable unless we co-
expressed EsxGMt. (Figure 3A, compare lanes 1 and 3; see Figure
S4 for quantification); its abundance was also increased slightly by
overexpression of Hrs (compare lane 19 with 29 and lane 5 with 6).
When expressed alone, EsxHMt could be stabilized by MG132,
likely because it is not properly folded without EsxGMt and hence
is subject to proteasome-mediated degradation (Figure 3A com-
pare lanes 1 and 5). To determine if there was an interaction
between EsxGMt-EsxHMt and Hrs, we performed co-immunopre-
cipitation
experiments
in cells
co-transfected
with EsxGMt,
EsxHMt, and Hrs-myc. Hrs was immunoprecipitated with an
antibody directed against the myc-tag, and we found that EsxHMt
was co-immunoprecipitated (Figure 3B). No EsxHMt was co-
immunoprecipitated when an isotype control antibody was used,
and as expected, EsxHMs and EsxHMt-H76A E77A were impaired
in the interaction with Hrs (Figure 3B and 3C). Interestingly, the
co-immunoprecipitation of EsxHMt and Hrs could only be
detected when cells were pre-treated with MG132. Thus, one
possibility is that the EsxGMt-EsxHMt heterodimer is polyubiqui-
tinated and degraded by the proteasome. In the presence of
MG132, the polyubiquitinated species might accumulate, allowing
us to detect an interaction between Hrs and an ubiquitinated
species of EsxHMt, since Hrs contains an ubiquitin interacting
motif (UIM) domain. Arguing against this possibility, when
EsxGMt was co-expressed with EsxHMt, there was little, if any,
effect of MG132 on EsxHMt protein levels (Figure 3A, compare
lanes 3 and 7, Figure S4, and Figure S5). In addition, when we
examined mono- and polyubiquitinated proteins using the FK2
antibody, inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 caused the
accumulation of high molecular weight proteins as anticipated.
However, there was no difference seen in the quantity or mobility
of EsxHMt (Figure S5). Further, when we mapped the region of
Hrs required for the interaction with EsxGMt-EsxHMt in the Y2H
assay, the UIM domain was not required. Amino acids 398–630,
which contain a coiled-coil region, were sufficient to mediate the
interaction (Figure 2E). We verified that the C-terminal half of Hrs
was sufficient to mediate an interaction by co-immunoprecipita-
tion (Fig. 3D). In summary, these data show that EsxGMt stabilizes
EsxHMt in the mammalian cytosol and that the heterodimer can
bind the C-terminus of Hrs.
To test the hypothesis that the EsxHMt interaction with Hrs
disrupts ESCRT, we examined the effect of EsxGMt EsxHMt on
epidermal growth factor (EGF) and epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) degradation (all performed without MG132
treatment). Upon binding ligand, EGFR is internalized and
transferred into ILVs by ESCRT so that it can be degraded upon
MVB-lysosome fusion. To determine whether EsxHMt interferes
with this process, we transfected EsxGMt and EsxHMt or vector
control into HEK293 cells and examined EGFR levels 90 min
after EGF treatment. We found that EGFR levels decreased in
control cells. In cells co-expressing EsxGMt and EsxHMt there was
a 63+/28% (n = 3) increase in the fraction of EGFR that
remained undegraded (Figure 3E), similar to what has been seen
with Hrs depletion [46]. In contrast, co-expression of EsxGMs and
EsxHMs
had
no
detectable
effect
on
EGFR
degradation
(Figure 3E). We observed similar results when we used fluorescent
EGF to examine trafficking in A549 cells using fluorescence
microscopy. As expected, cells depleted of Hrs showed enhanced
EGF fluorescence due to impaired degradation. We observed a
similar decreased degradation in cells expressing EsxGMt and
EsxHMt (Figure 3F and G). In contrast, expression of EsxGMs
EsxHMs or EsxGMt EsxHMt-H76A-E77A had little effect on EGF
degradation (Figure 3G and 3H). Thus, EsxHMt, in complex with
EsxGMt, is sufficient to inhibit EGF and EGFR degradation, an
activity that correlates with its binding to Hrs. EsxHMs, from the
non-pathogenic species, does not have this property.
EsxGMt and EsxHMt arrest phagosome maturation
Because Esx-3 is essential for Mtb growth, we examined the
effect of overexpressing EsxHMt on bacterial trafficking. First, we
wanted to determine whether EsxGMt EsxHMt could confer a
block in maturation to phagosomes containing Msmeg. However,
when we expressed EsxGMt EsxHMt--FLAG under control of the

hsp60 promoter in Msmeg, it was not secreted (Figure S6). It was
secreted by Mtb (Figure 4A), and when we examined whether
overexpression of EsxGMt and EsxHMt-FLAG could enhance
phagosome maturation
arrest
of Mtb, we
found
less co-
localization between Mtb and LAMP1 and enhanced co-
localization with TfR with the strain overexpressing EsxHMt-
FLAG, compared to a strain transformed with vector control
(Figure 4B–E). The defect in lysosomal trafficking was similar to
siRNA-mediated silencing of Hrs, Tsg101, and Rab7, and the
combination of EsxGMt EsxHMt overexpression and ESCRT-
silencing resulted in lower LAMP1 co-localization than either
manipulation alone (Figure 4B). An Mtb strain that expressed
EsxGMt EsxHMt- H76A-E77A did not exhibit altered trafficking,
but the mutant protein also failed to be secreted (Figure 4A, 4F).
Mtb did secrete EsxGMs EsxHMs-FLAG, which, unlike EsxGMt
EsxHMt-FLAG, did not block LAMP1 co-localization (Figure 4A
and 4F). We conclude that EsxGMt EsxHMt, but not EsxGMs
EsxHMs, can prevent lysosomal trafficking during infection, most
likely reflecting the ability of EsxHMt to bind Hrs and impair
ESCRT activity.
Discussion
We used high throughput Y2H interactome mapping to identify
interactions between secreted Mtb proteins and human proteins,
identifying 99 new potential interactions. We made use of a large
body of literature that has attempted to catalogue the secretome of
Mtb. Our study is subject to the uncertainty around the definition
of the Mtb secretome. For example, proteins can be in the culture
filtrate due to bacterial lysis, rather than secretion, and bioinfor-
matics predictions may be inaccurate. In addition, many secreted
proteins play an intrinsic role in the bacterial lifecycle and are
unlikely to make a biologically meaningful interaction with host
proteins. Thus, to estimate a false positive hit rate of our system,
we
included
a
non-secreted
control
collection.
We
found
approximately two-fold enrichment in the rate of interactions
comparing the secretome collection to the control collection,
suggesting that true interactions were identified, but that there also
may be a relatively high rate of ‘‘pseudo-interactions,’’ which may
be valid biophysically but never occur in vivo because the involved
proteins are separated spatially or temporally. In addition, the
interactome list is by no means complete. We did not screen the
entire putative secretome, but rather imposed criteria to try to
arrive at a set that was enriched for true secreted proteins likely to
play a role in virulence. In addition, the screen was not performed
to saturation, and only a fraction of verifiable interactions can be
detected by a single method to detect PPIs [31]. Therefore, the list
is not comprehensive and likely contains false-positives, but given
the paucity of data on host-pathogen interactions in Mtb, it has
likely significantly expanded the known Mtb-human protein-
protein interactome. It represents a resource for investigators
working on Mtb; the confirmation and significance of such
interactions will require further validation.
Interactome mapping provides an unbiased strategy to identify
host-pathogen
interactions
for
pathogens
in
which
genetic
strategies are limited, and it can be complemented by depletion
studies in host cells. Such physical interaction mapping can
identify redundant or essential factors that may be missed using
genetic approaches. For example, in the case of EsxHMt, its
importance may have been unrecognized in previous genetic
approaches to identify Mtb virulence factors because of redun-
dancy within this large gene family, the existence of additional
mechanisms
to
modulate
phagosome
maturation,
and
the
essentiality of the Esx-3 system.
This Y2H screen and our previous genome-wide RNAi screen
in Drosophila pointed to the importance of the ESCRT machinery
in mycobacterial pathogenesis. Here, we show that the ESCRT
machinery is important in restricting the intracellular growth of
pathogenic mycobacteria, which likely reflects a role of ESCRT in
trafficking bacteria to the lysosome, although the effects of ESCRT
on endo-lysosomal content and signaling pathways may also play a
role. In addition, by modulating the ESCRT machinery, Mtb
might alter antigen presentation or exosome formation [42,47].
Further work is required to understand exactly how EsxHMt
impairs ESCRT function. We envision that EsxHMt inhibits
ESCRT on or near the mycobacterial phagosome, where its local
concentration would be highest, as opposed to globally disrupting
ESCRT. The C-terminal half of Hrs, which we showed binds
EsxHMt, has previously been shown to be involved in the
interactions with Tsg101 [48,49], STAM [50], and SNAP-25
[45]. Thus, one possibility is that EsxHMt interferes with these
associations. The relatively low affinity measured in vitro between
EsxHMt and Hrs (,5 mM) may be sufficient to disrupt Hrs
interactions with other host proteins, as the interactions of Hrs
with many of its binding partners are of low affinity [45,48,51,52].
For example, HIV Gag recruits Tsg101 to sites of viral budding by
binding the Tsg101 UEV domain with an even lower affinity
(KD,21–50 mM) [48,53]. There may also be a particular form of
Hrs or EsxHMt that exist in vivo in macrophages that exhibits
higher affinity. For example, Hrs interacts with the endosomal
membrane, engages in numerous protein-protein interactions, and
is modified by phosphorylation and ubiquitination, none of which
occur when the affinity is measured with recombinant protein.
Interestingly MG132, which is known to alter ESCRT activity
[54,55], enhanced our ability to detect an interaction between
EsxGMt-EsxHMt and Hrs in co-immunoprecipitation experiments
in HEK293 cells. One explanation for the requirement of MG132
to detect the Hrs-EsxHMt interaction by co-immunoprecipitation
may be related to the observation that MG132 impairs ESCRT-
dependent trafficking [54,55]. Thus, it is possible that MG132
stabilizes the interaction between EsxHMt and Hrs by altering
ESCRT, although other potential mechanisms could be envi-
sioned. Even in the absence of MG132, EsxGMt-EsxHMt inhibits
ESCRT function. Therefore, we speculate that EsxHMt preferen-
tially binds to a form of Hrs that exists transiently in cells, a form
that is stabilized by MG132. Once bound to Hrs, EsxHMt could
interact with other host proteins that modify Hrs or ESCRT
components.
Hrs is one of several host factors that Mtb likely target to create
a protected niche [3,4]. Lipoamide dehydrogenase (LpdC) is
thought to prevent phagosome-lysosome maturation by retaining
the host factor, coronin 1 [29,56]. PtpA, a secreted tyrosine
phosphatase, may directly exclude the vacuolar-H+ATPase during
infection, impairing acidification and phagosome maturation
[27,28,57], while nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (NdkA) targets
Rab7 activation [30,58]. In addition, there is less phosphatidyli-
nositol 3-phosphate on the mycobacterial phagosome than latex
bead phagosomes, which may reflect the activity of the secreted
lipid
phosphatase,
SapM
[59,60].
This
leads
to
impaired
recruitment of Hrs [39]. Thus, Hrs activity could be inhibited
by Coomassie blue. (D) Average binding (n = 3) was fitted with the Hill function, revealing a Hill coefficient of ,1.7 and a KD of 5.4 mM. (E) EsxGMt-
EsxHMt-DB was tested in the Y2H for interactions with human Hrs-AD deletion constructs. The domain structure of Hrs is indicated.

on mycobacterial phagosomes by two synergistic mechanisms:
impaired recruitment and direct targeting by EsxHMt. How the
activities of these various bacterial effectors are coordinated,
whether they are required in concert or function in different cell
types or at different time points post-infection, has not been
explored. In order to evaluate the relative contribution of the
EsxHMt-Hrs interaction to trafficking and intracellular survival
during infection, we will have to identify mutations in EsxHMt that
disrupt its binding to Hrs, but that do not interfere with its
secretion from Mtb or disrupt bacterial iron acquisition.
It was surprising to us that it was possible to alter Mtb
trafficking by overexpressing EsxGMt EsxHMt, as if Mtb normally
expresses a ‘‘sub-optimal’’ amount to maximally alter phagosome
maturation. Similarly, ESCRT and Rab7 appear to be sub-
maximally inhibited, as further impairing their function by
RNAi-mediated silencing also enhances the block in phagosome-
lysosome fusion. Given that over-expression of EsxHMt by Mtb
caused a greater effect on trafficking than Hrs silencing (Fig. 4B),
EsxHMt may have additional cellular targets involved in cellular
trafficking as well. One explanation for the observation that
additional EsxHMt can further impair trafficking is that this
reflects in vitro growth conditions, whereas, during infection in vivo,
EsxHMt levels may be higher. An additional possibility is that
EsxGMt EsxHMt production is finely tuned to balance an
opposing effect that is detrimental to the bacteria. For example,
EsxGMt and EsxHMt generate prominent T cell responses,
[14,15]. In addition, we found that although the Mtb strain that
overexpresses EsxGMt EsxHMt exhibited diminished co-localiza-
tion with LAMP1 and enhanced co-localization with TfR, there
was no difference in intracellular growth for this strain relative to
control (Figure S7). Thus, overexpression of EsxGMt EsxHMt,
while promoting trafficking, might come with an opposing
intracellular fitness cost for bacteria.
In summary, our studies demonstrate that Mtb adapted Esx-3,
an ancient microbial system for iron acquisition, to alter host cell
physiology. Analogously, Esx-1, which is important for conjuga-
tion in Msmeg [61], mediates important host interactions that are
critical for virulence, including permeabilizing the mycobacterial
phagosome and altering phagosome maturation [5–9,62]. Thus,
the duplication and adaptation of TSSSs to new functions appears
to be a particularly important evolutionary path to virulence in
Mtb. The relatively low affinity between Hrs and its endogenous
binding partners may have made it particularly susceptible to
manipulation by diverse pathogens, from enveloped viruses to
Mtb. The observation that macrophage control of infection is
especially sensitive to ESCRT inhibition suggests ESCRT is a
likely target of additional pathogens as well.
Materials and Methods
Detailed methods, including description of Y2H interaction
mapping, plasmids, siRNAs, and Hill plot analysis, are provided in
Text S1.
Tissue culture conditions
RAW264.7 and HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Gibco), 20 mM HEPES,
2 mM L-glutamine, and 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine
serum (hiFBS; Invitrogen). BMDMs were isolated from C57BL/
6 mice as described [63] Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco), added
for passaging, was omitted during infections. A549 cells were
grown in RPMI 1640 Medium (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine, 16
Non-essential Amino Acids (Cellgro), and 10% hiFBS. Cells were
grown at 37uC with 5% CO2 atmosphere. siRNAs were
transfected with Hiperfect (Qiagen). Plasmids were transfected
into HEK293 cells with Effectene (Qiagen) and A549 cells with
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. bovis-BCG, and M. smegmatis mc2155
were grown at 37uC to log phase in Middlebrook 7H9 media with
0.05% Tween 80, BBL Middlebrook OADC Enrichment, and
0.2% glycerol. Plasmids were selected with 50 mg/ml kanamycin
or hygromycin depending upon the resistance marker. To
generate EsxGMt EsxHMt-FLAG and EsxGMs EsxHMs-FLAG for
overexpression in mycobacteria, EsxG-EsxH was amplified from
BCG (the EsxG-EsxH region is 100% identical between BCG and
Mtb) and Msmeg genomic DNA, respectively, using primers
described in Text S1. The PCR products were cloned into pSYMP
under control of the hsp60 promoter [64].
Intracellular bacterial growth assay
RAW cells were seeded one day before infection or they were
transfected with siRNAs two days prior to infection with a single
cell suspension of Mtb (MOI,2–5), obtained as previously
described [40]. The cells were extensively washed and lysed with
0.2% Triton X-100 3 hpi or 2d later and serial dilutions were
plated on 7H10 or 7H11. CFU were calculated 15 to 21 d later.
Lysosomal trafficking assay
RAW cells were transfected with siRNAs for two days and
then infected with a single cell suspension of BCG or Mtb
(MOI,20) for 3 h, then washed extensively. Cells were fixed
24 hpi with 4% formaldehyde/PBS for BCG and with 1%
paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight for Mtb and immunostained
for LAMP1 (Abcam) or TfR (Invitrogen). For Lysotracker
(Invitrogen) staining, unfixed RAW cells were incubated with
200 nM Lysotracker, washed twice in PBS, and visualized.
Images were captured using the Nikon Eclipse TiE/B automated
fluorescent microscope with Photometrics HQ@ Monochrome
digital camera. 606z-stack images were acquired, deconvoluted,
and analyzed using NIS-Elements DUO software (see Fig. S3 for
details). Contrast was not altered prior to automated image
analysis; for reproduced images, alterations were applied equally
to all samples.
Recombinant protein binding assay
His-tagged EsxGMt-EsxHMt was purified as described in Text
S1. Prior to inclusion of recombinant proteins in binding reactions
they were centrifuged at 100,0006 g for 30 min to remove
aggregated protein. To determine whether EsxGMt EsxHMt binds
to Hrs in a direct and saturable manner, 1.0 mg EsxGMt EsxHMt-
-6XHis was bound to Ni-NTA beads and incubated with
increasing amounts of purified, soluble Hrs (0,4 mg) in 20 mM
HEPES [pH, 7.4], 150 mM KCl, and 0.05% Tween-20, with
protease inhibitors (10 mM leupeptin, 1 mg/mL pepstatin, 0.3 mM
aprotinin, and 1.74 mg/mL PMSF) for 1 h at 4uC. Beads were
washed in PBST (0.1 M PBS 0.05% Tween-20) with 10 mM
imidazole.

Coomassie staining. Bands were subject to quantification with
ImageJ software (v. 1.42).
Co-immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
Cellular lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer with Halt
Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific) and 10 mM N-
ethylmaleimide (Sigma) and analyzed by western blotting. The
antibodies used for western analysis are: actin (clone C4/
MAB1501, Millipore), Hrs (M79/sc-30221, Santa Cruz Biotech-
nology), Rab7 (117, Abcam), FLAG (F7425, Sigma), EGFR
(#4267S, Cell Signaling), and FK2 (Millipore). For co-immuno-
precipitation, HEK293 cells transfected with Hrs-myc and Esx
expression plasmids were treated with 20 mM MG132 (Calbio-
chem) for 3 h prior to mechanical lysis and incubated with
Dynabeads Protein G (Novex, Life technologies) pre-bound to
isotype control antibody (sc-2025, Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
anti-myc antibody (sc-40/9E10, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or
anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen), and bound proteins were analyzed
by western blotting.
EGFR and EGF degradation assays
Two days after transfection, HEK293 cells were incubated in
serum-free DMEM and treated with 100 ng/ml of recombinant
human EGF (rh-EGF, R&D Systems) essentially as described
[65]. Cells were harvested immediately prior to addition of
EGF
and
90 min
later
and
EGFR
analyzed
by
western

[66]. Two days after transfection of A549 cells with siRNA or
DNA, cells were incubated with serum-free RPMI before
addition of 25 mg/ml Alexa Fluor 488-EGF (Invitrogen) in
EGF uptake media (RPMI, 2% BSA, 20 mM HEPES) at 4uC
for
1 h.
Cells
were
washed
to
remove
unbound
ligand,
incubated at 37uC for 90 min, and examined by immunoflu-
orescence microscopy.
Mycobacterial secretion of EsxH
To analyze secretion of EsxHMs-FLAG or EsxHMt-FLAG from
Mtb and Msmeg, strains were grown to mid-log phase, washed
with PBS, and inoculated into Sauton’s media. In Sauton’s media,
they were grown to reach log phase (overnight in the case of
Msmeg and for two days in case of Mtb). Thereafter, mycobacteria
were pelleted by centrifugation. The supernatants were filtered
through 0.22 mM filters followed by precipitation with 12%
trichloroacetic acid. The precipitate was washed with ice-cold
acetone, air dried, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. The
bacterial pellets were lysed by bead beating in lysis buffer (50 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.6% SDS, 10 mM NaH2PO4,
and
protease
inhibitor)
with
0.1 mm
zirconia/silica
beads
(BiosSpec Products, Inc.). SDS-sample buffer was added, followed
by boiling at 95uC for 5 min. Antibody to the pyruvate
dehydrogenase E2 component sucB (Rv2215/dlaT) [67], a
cytosolic protein, was used as a loading control and to indicate
the degree of bacterial lysis.

confirmed that automated quantification closely paralleled manual
quantification and visual scoring by a blinded observer. (B) To
further validate the automated analysis, we verified enhanced

which promotes phagosome maturation [61]. RAW cells treated
