Our understanding of the host response to infections has historically focused on
“resistance” mechanisms that directly control pathogen replication. However, both
pathogen effectors and antimicrobial immune pathways have the capacity to damage
host tissue, and the ability to tolerate these insults can also be critical for host
survival. These “tolerance” mechanisms may be equally as important as resistance to
prevent disease in the context of a persistent infection, such as tuberculosis, when
resistance mechanisms are ineffective and the pathogen persists in the tissue for long
periods. Host tolerance encompasses a wide range of strategies, many of which involve
regulation of the inﬂammatory response. Here we will examine general strategies used
by macrophages and T cells to promote tolerance in the context of tuberculosis, and
focus on pathways, such as regulation of inﬂammasome activation, that are emerging as
common mediators of tolerance.

INTRODUCTION
The ultimate goal of the host response to bacterial pathogens is to survive the infection. Much of the
research to understand protective immunity has historically had a singular focus on antimicrobial
resistance mechanisms that directly control bacterial replication. In general, these “resistance”
mechanisms act by poisoning the pathogen, disrupting the pathogen’s niche, or sequestering
nutrients in an attempt to restrict growth and spread (1, 2). Classic resistance pathways include
the antimicrobial peptide production from epithelial surfaces and the microbicidal functions
of phagocytes which are augmented by antigen-speciﬁc lymphocyte responses. More recently it
has become clear that in addition to these resistance strategies, the host also relies on distinct
mechanisms that allow it to withstand infections independently of controlling bacterial growth
(3, 4). These “tolerance” mechanisms represent host pathways that modulate diverse aspects of
physiology. Both the local control of inﬂammatory tissue damage and repair, as well as systemic
responses such as anorexia, and fever have been shown to promote host survival in a number
of infection contexts (5, 6). For many self-resolving infections, resistance mechanisms may be
suﬃcient to restrict bacterial replication and minimize pathology (2). However, some pathogens,
like Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), are able to resist many of the resistance mechanisms of
the host and persist for long periods (7). In these situations, tolerance pathways are critical for
preventing the progressive pathology elicited by the persistent presence of the pathogen. Tolerance
responses ensure that the locally infected tissues continue to function and that the overall health of
the host is maintained (3, 8).

Tolerance to Mtb
While potential therapies that promote host resistance have
received a great deal of interest, promoting tolerance pathways
that decrease morbidity and/or mortality in the face of an
ongoing chronic infection could represent an equally appealing
avenue for intervention (9, 10). In this review, we will discuss
the host response to Mtb infections from the viewpoint of
host tolerance. While tolerance encompasses a potentially large
array of host functions, we will consider known and emerging
mechanisms that limit lung damage and discuss how distinct cell
populations like macrophages and T cells contribute to tolerance
by controlling cytokine production and metabolic functions.
Ultimately, understanding host tolerance mechanisms will deﬁne
new pathways of protective immunity to tuberculosis (TB), and
could identify new therapeutic strategies.
Tuberculosis Pathogenesis
Mtb infections are transmitted by aerosol (7, 11). Following
inhalation of contaminated droplets, Mtb is engulfed by alveolar
macrophages, where the pathogen replicates and evades the
innate antimicrobial mechanisms of this cell (7, 11, 12). After
the activation of host adaptive immune responses, bacterial
growth is slowed or halted. While evidence from non-human
primates (NHP) and human autopsy studies indicate that some
infectious foci can be sterilized, the pathogen is able to persist
in the face of this adaptive response for long periods. In some
individuals, this infection produces the chronic inﬂammatory
disease called, tuberculosis (TB). While any organ in the body
can be aﬀected, pulmonary disease promotes transmission of the
pathogen, beginning a new infectious cycle.
For most individuals, chronic infection with Mtb does not
produce symptomatic disease (7, 13). However, a subset of
individuals (5–10%) will progress to develop TB after a period of
asymptomatic infection that generally lasts for less than 2 years,
but can extend for decades in rare cases (14, 15). What drives the
heterogeneity of disease progression is not entirely known and
is likely a combination of host and bacterial genetic diversity, as
well as environmental factors (3, 8, 16). Several distinct aspects
of TB pathogenesis could be aﬀected by host tolerance pathways.
Most obviously, the risk of developing disease is likely to depend
on host tolerance. Most infected individuals never develop
symptoms, and the ability to harbor this immunogenic pathogen
for long-periods without suﬀering from progressive pathology
likely depends on the ability to control inﬂammation(10, 17,
18). In fact, the phenomenon of “latent TB infection” (LTBI)
could be considered one of the clearer examples of pathogen
tolerance in humans. Patients that are cured of TB by antibiotic
therapy suﬀer from reduced respiratory function, indicating that
even after bacteria are eradicated, local tissue damage persists
(19–21). In fact, multiple rounds of infection and antibiotic
therapy are associated with increased erosion of lung function
(21). This eﬀect is not simply additive, as rabbits exposed to
5 sequential low dose infections developed signiﬁcantly more
severe cavitary disease than animals exposed to a single large
dose of Mtb (22). Thus, tolerance mechanisms that control
local tissue damage could determine long-term outcome and are
inﬂuenced by environmental factors such as the frequency of
infection. Manifestations of Mtb other than pulmonary disease
may be even more dependent on host tolerance mechanisms
that control inﬂammation (23). For example, meningeal Mtb
infection is associated with very high mortality, which is related
to the expression of inﬂammatory cytokines (24, 25). Similarly,
TB immune reconstitution inﬂammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS)
is a condition that occurs in HIV/Mtb co-infected individuals
soon after starting antiretroviral therapy (26). This syndrome
still results in almost 40% mortality, and is associated with failed
regulation of inﬂammatory cascades (27–30).
The mechanisms that control TB tolerance are complex
because interactions between multiple cell types inﬂuence disease
progression. Following infection and activation of the host
immunity, infected cells are walled oﬀin large structures termed
a granuloma (7, 16). Granulomas are thought to be required for
the host to tolerate Mtb infections, yet their development and
progression throughout infection may also drive Mtb survival
and transmission. Bacterial barcoding and PET-CT studies in
non-human primates have shown individual granuloma that
are formed from single founder bacteria can have very distinct
fates, some contain the pathogen and while others progressively
develop into the large cavities that typify pulmonary TB disease
(16, 31, 32). As a result, individual lesions are variable in
their disease trajectories and transmission potential suggesting
complicated dynamics determine the outcome of each lesion
(31, 32). Beyond granuloma development, inﬂux of leukocytes
such as neutrophils and the expression of proteases such as
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can reduce host tolerance by
irreversibly damaging tissue (33, 34). As the role of MMPs and
neutrophils in modulating immunopathology to Mtb have been
reviewed elsewhere, we will focus on how macrophages and T
cells modulate host tolerance to determine the outcome of Mtb
infections (35, 36).
Macrophages and Tolerance
Macrophages are an important intracellular niche for Mtb
to replicate yet they can also restrict Mtb growth in an
activation dependent manner (12). The balance between Mtb
replication and control is determined by a diverse array of
resistance pathways, including those activated by interferon-γ
(IFNγ), granulocyte-macropahge colony stimulating factor (GM-
CSF) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) (37–39). Due to their direct
interactions with Mtb, macrophages are also central regulators
of host tolerance. Several lines of evidence suggest that tolerance
mechanisms modulated by macrophages may play a signiﬁcant
role in determining disease progression and controlling the
outcome to Mtb disease.
Nitric Oxide
One compelling case for the role of tolerance in macrophages
during chronic Mtb infections is that of inducible nitric oxide
synthase (Nos2). For years, it was generally presumed that the
protective function of Nos2 could be attributed to the direct
antimicrobial activity of nitric oxide (NO) (40). In support of
this hypothesis was data that showed that Nos2 deﬁcient mice are
extremely susceptible to Mtb infection (40, 41). These animals die
within 2 months of infection with 10–100 fold more bacteria in
lungs than wild type animals as well as a massive inﬁltration of

Tolerance to Mtb
tissue-damaging neutrophils. Recent evidence however suggests
that the situation is more complex. Mtb expresses a number
of defense mechanisms that protect the pathogen from the
antimicrobial eﬀects of NO, and recent evidence suggests that
the role of Nos2 in regulating inﬂammatory pathways and host
tolerance play a dominant role in protection (Figure 1) (42–45).
Disentangling tolerance pathways in vivo is a signiﬁcant
challenge due to the interlinked nature of bacterial load and
tissue damage; higher bacterial burdens can lead to more
inﬂammation and tissue damage, while higher tissue damage
and inﬂammation may create an environment that drives more
bacterial replication (8). The role of each host eﬀector in
controlling resistance or tolerance pathways may also be timing
and context dependent (46). It is also likely that many pathways
control both resistance and tolerance during persistent infection
(47). Because of this, distinct in vivo models that control either
inﬂammation or bacterial replication are required to break
down the mechanisms of a particular “protective” gene like
Nos2. When these models were applied to Nos2, it became
clear in Nos2 deﬁcient animals succumb to Mtb infection
through hyperinﬂammatory disease, even when bacterial load
is controlled using a conditionally-replicating strain of the
pathogen (43, 44). Subsequent mechanistic studies determined
that NO nitrosylates the inﬂammasome component NLRP3,
which inhibits the production of bioactive IL-1β and prevents
persistent neutrophil recruitment (44). Similarly, Nos2 has also
been shown to dampen the inﬂammatory response by limiting
the activation of NF-κβ (48).
FIGURE 1 | Nos2 and Phox control tolerance during Mtb infection by
negatively regulating inﬂammasome activation. During Mtb infection in
macrophages, Nos2 and Phox produce NO and ROS respectively. While these
molecules are antimicrobial against many pathogens, Mtb is mostly resistant.
Persistent Mtb then activates the NLRP3 inﬂammasome to produce active
IL1β. Prolonged inﬂammasome activation leads to increased IL1β secretion
and neutrophil recruitment that damages the lungs. In order to tolerate
persistent infections with Mtb, the NO and ROS produced by macrophages
also suppresses inﬂammasome activation to limit the damage caused by
recurring neutrophil recruitment. NO directly nitrosylates NLRP3 while the
mechanisms of ROS inhibition remain unknown.
Nos2 serves as an important example of the need to
understand the mechanisms by which individual immune
eﬀectors protect against TB disease progression. While a modest
role for Nos2 in modulating Mtb replication in macrophages
remains possible, the recent evidence strongly suggests the
predominant role of NO production in mice during Mtb is to
control tolerance by dampening inﬂammatory pathways.
NADPH Phagocyte Oxidase
Many immune mediators have similarly pleiotropic eﬀects
as Nos2, raising the possibility that other well-characterized
pathways may also play unanticipated roles in regulating
tolerance. The NADPH Phagocyte Oxidase Complex (Phox)
provides another example. This system is required to produce
a burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that intoxicate the
intracellular bacteria. The importance of Phox in protecting
the host during Mtb infections is generally considered minimal
because Phox deﬁcient animals show no long-term defects
in controlling Mtb growth and Mtb is equipped with many
strategies to resist ROS-mediated killing (41, 49–51). However,
human studies suggest that mutations in Phox, which leads
to the condition known as chronic granulomatous disease, are
associated with higher susceptibility to mycobacterial infections
including TB (52, 53). In other disease contexts Phox deﬁciencies
have been found cause inﬂammatory disease, particularly those
related to IL-1β activation (54). Recent work shows that Phox
is also critical for tolerance to Mtb infection (Figure 1) (55).
Phox-deﬁcient mice have no deﬁciency in bacterial control, yet
Phox-deﬁcient animals accumulate high numbers of neutrophils
in an IL-1β dependent fashion, leading to exacerbated disease
(55). Similar to the role of Nos2, the ROS produced by Phox
control tolerance by inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3
inﬂammasome which reduces IL-1β production and limits
neutrophil inﬂux to the infected lung. The fact that the important
tolerance-regulating functions for both Nos2 and Phox were
overlooked for some time, suggests that tolerance-regulating
roles may still be found for additional host response pathways.
The similar ability of Nos2 and Phox to control inﬂammasome
activation suggests that preventing persistent IL-1β production
is a common strategy used by the host to tolerate persistent
infections. In support of this, human studies have found that
altered IL-1β expression modulates TB disease severity (56).
IL-1β alleles that enhance IL-1β expression are associated
with increased risk of developing TB disease, more severe
pulmonary disease, and poor treatment outcome (56). In
addition, inﬂammasome activation is associated with the
development of TB-IRIS and TB meningitis (57, 58). Two recent
studies suggest that expression and activation of inﬂammasome
components including NLRP3 and the high expression of IL-
1β in plasma and the nervous system are signatures of failed
tolerance during antiretroviral treatment and a major risk factor
to developing fatal disease (57, 58). The repeated association
with inﬂammasome activity, IL-1β production and more severe
TB-related pathology suggests that this pathway could serve as
a therapeutic target, particularly for the severe inﬂammatory
syndromes with poor outcomes.

Tolerance to Mtb
Lysosomal Function and Autophagy
Proper maintenance of cellular organelles is important to
tolerate Mtb infections (59–62). Loss of critical homeostatic
pathways can lead to cellular dysfunction and misregulation
of inﬂammatory cytokines during Mtb disease. Mycobacterium
infections of zebraﬁsh with mutations in cathepsins leads to loss
of granuloma integrity and reduced survival due to improper
breakdown in lysosomal contents (59). In humans, this mutation
is phenocopied in individuals who smoke tobacco. Mtb infected
macrophages from smokers accumulate particulates in their
lysosomes, inhibiting their function and likely altering tolerance.
It is well known that previous smoking history can increase the
risk of developing TB disease by over two-fold and it is possible
that alterations to lysosomal function are a key aspect to these
patients TB susceptibility (63).
Autophagy is another key pathway that maintains the integrity
of organelles and regulates a variety of important immune-related
processes (64). Recently, the role of autophagy in antimicrobial
resistance during Mtb has been questioned but the importance
of Atg5 in tolerance is undeniable (61, 65, 66). Mice with
mutations in most autophagy genes control Mtb disease normally
(61). However, Atg5-/- mice show a unique susceptibility to TB
disease. Infection of Atg5 mice leads to a hyperinﬂammatory
disease state with massive neutrophil migration to the pulmonary
tissue and rapid mortality (61). Depletion of neutrophils alone
in infected Atg5 deﬁcient mice can reverse the susceptibility
and allow long term survival arguing against an inherent
defect in antimicrobial control. Exactly how Atg5 controls
the inﬂammatory response, or why loss of Atg5 and not
other autophagy components drives neutrophil-mediated disease
remains to be understood. But it is clear that altering macrophage
homeostasis directly modulates tolerance to Mtb.
Macrophage Metabolism
Recent evidence suggests that macrophage metabolic pathways
and byproducts can modulate the inﬂammatory pathways both
locally and systemically (1, 2). Similarly, Mtb infections are
inﬂuenced by systemic metabolic dysfunction such as diabetes,
which can alter the activation state of macrophages at the site
of infection (67). Evidence for how essential local and systemic
metabolic networks inﬂuence host tolerance to Mtb is beginning
to emerge.
Central regulators of host cell metabolism are intimately
linked with control of inﬂammatory circuits (68). These
pathways, including mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR),
silent mating type information regulation 2 homologs (Sirtuins),
and
adenosine
monophosphate-activated
protein
kinase
(AMPK), are known to regulate cellular functions such
as
autophagy,
NF-kb
signaling,
and
central
metabolism.
Importantly, many of these networks are disrupted during Mtb
infection suggesting that they could play a role in regulating
the inﬂammatory milieu that is activated during Mtb infection
and likely inﬂuence host tolerance (69). Because FDA approved
modulators of these metabolic networks are available, they
represent appealing targets for host directed therapies that may
enhance tolerance during Mtb infections and improve clinical
outcomes (70).
Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), a known regulator of host stress responses,
is downregulated during Mtb infection (71). In order to
understand how the loss of SIRT1 function impacts Mtb
disease, Singhal and colleagues treated infected macrophages
and animals with a known small molecule SIRT1 activator
(Figure 2) (71). While activation of SIRT1 resulted in a
modest reduction in bacterial growth in vitro and in vivo,
it led to dramatic changes in the inﬂammatory proﬁle of
infected macrophages and immunopathology in mice, indicating
that activation of SIRT1 promotes host tolerance during Mtb
infection. Interestingly, SIRT1 activation during Mtb results
in similar outcomes to treatment with the AMPK activator
metformin, a common treatment for diabetes (72). During Mtb
infection, metformin treatment leads to subtle decreases in
bacterial burden but larger decreases in inﬂammatory cytokines
and tissue damage (Figure 2). A retrospective study of diabetic
TB patients indicates that metformin may improve outcomes.
SIRT1 can also inﬂuence AMPK signaling, suggesting that
the SIRT1/AMPK signaling axis may be a critical regulator
of tolerance during Mtb infection. It is also intriguing that
diabetes treatments such as metformin, are so eﬀective against
treating Mtb disease. Diabetes increases Mtb risk in humans
(73, 74). In a mouse model of hyperglycemia, there was
a profound eﬀect on neutrophil accumulation during Mtb
infection which worsened disease outcome (75). Thus, while it
likely the complex eﬀect of diabetes on immunity could include
resistance defects, in the mouse model tolerance defects appear
to dominate.
FIGURE 2 | Host metabolic networks modulate tolerance to Mtb infections.
Distinct metabolic networks control the inﬂammatory response during Mtb
infection. Small molecule activation of Sirt1 with SRT1720 inhibits NF-κβ
signaling and activates AMPK and promote tolerance to Mtb. This is similar to
treatment with the diabetes drug Metformin that activates AMPK to inhibit
inﬂammation and allow the host to better tolerate persistent Mtb infections. An
alternative metabolic network activated by Irg1, produces the metabolite
Itaconate. Itaconate can directly restrict Mtb replication, but in vivo robustly
controls tolerance by modulating the inﬂammatory response to persistent
infection. Together these metabolic networks directly and indirectly control
tolerance to Mtb infection.

Tolerance to Mtb
Another
important
metabolic
pathway
that
modulates
tolerance to Mtb is mediated by the mitochondrial enzyme
immune responsive gene 1 (Irg1) (76). Irg1 produces the
metabolite itaconate that recently was shown to dampen cytokine
production and reduce damaging ROS during Mtb infection
(Figure 2) (77). Loss of Irg1 in vivo leads to rapid mortality
that is driven by hyper-inﬂammation and neutrophil-mediated
disease. Itaconate alone is suﬃcient to reverse the increase in
pro-inﬂammatory gene expression in infected Irg1 deﬁcient
macrophages suggesting this metabolite is a robust regulator of
tolerance to Mtb. While itaconate can directly inhibit bacterial
growth, in vivo studies indicate that its immunomodulatory
function may play a dominant role (76, 77). Future studies will
need to carefully dissect the role of Irg1 in both controlling
resistance and tolerance to fully understand its pleiotropic
functions during Mtb infection.
T Cells and Tolerance
T cells are critical for resistance to Mtb (7, 78). In addition,
it is clear that Th1 cells that produce IFNγ promote tolerance
by activating the production of NO and by directly inhibiting
the recruitment of neutrophils (44, 79). This profound eﬀect on
Mtb protection suggested that more robust activation of Th1
cells would lead to improved disease outcomes. In reality, the
situation is much more complicated and recent evidence suggests
that activating enhanced Th1 responses to Mtb leads to increased
susceptibility through failed tolerance.
IFNγ . The cytokine IFNγ is produced by activated T cells
during Mtb infection and is essential for protection of the
host. During chronic infections, the levels of IFNγ produced
by individual T cells can wain due to persistent antigen and
T cell exhaustion (80). Targeting inhibitory receptors on T cells
might drive enhanced cytokine responses and lead to more
robust Mtb control. As a proof of principle of this concept
mice lacking the T cell inhibitory receptor PD1 were infected
with Mtb (81). Surprisingly, rather controlling Mtb infection
better, PD1 deﬁcient animals had decreased tolerance that was
characterized by increased susceptibility and immunopathology.
This counterintuitive result suggested that more robust T cell
responses might be detrimental to long term Mtb protection.
What is driving the decrease in tolerance in these animals?
One recent study began to examine the mechanisms modulating
the tolerance defect in PD1 deﬁcient mice and showed that
increased IFNγ production is responsible (82). When PD1
deﬁcient T cells no longer make IFNγ, the defect in tolerance
is reversed. In addition, CD4+ T cells that produce more
IFNγ on a per cell basis do not control Mtb growth more
eﬀectively in the lungs, but rather cause tissue damage and
more rapid mortality. Similarly, T cells with mutations in the
Calcium channel ORAI1 activating protein Stim1 are unable to
undergo apoptosis following infection leading to a signiﬁcant
increase in IFNγ in the lungs (83). This increase in T cell
survival and IFNγ makes infected mice susceptible to infection
by decreasing tolerance. Therefore, during Mtb infection pushing
the expression of IFNγ beyond a protective threshold leads to
failed tolerance.
T cell Metabolism. While it is possible that results with PD1 are
an outlier additional evidence suggests that other alterations to
T cell activation may have deleterious eﬀects on tolerating Mtb.
One recent study found an important role for Cyclophilin D in
modulating tolerance to Mtb in a T cell dependent manner (84).
CyclophilinD (CypD) is a mitochondrial protein that modulates
cell death mechanisms such as necrosis (85). Inhibition of CypD
in macrophages prevents necrosis and limits Mtb replication
(86, 87). On this basis, Divangahi and colleagues infected CypD
mice, and found that they were highly susceptible to infection
(84). However, these mice succumbed to disease with identical
burdens of bacteria compared to wild type animals suggesting
loss of CypD decreases tolerance to persistent Mtb infections.
Importantly, the defect in tolerance was not related to diﬀerences
in cell death and control of Mtb replication. Instead CypD
was found to regulate a metabolic switch between oxidative
phosphorylation and glycolysis in T cells. In the absence of CypD,
T cells produced more ROS that drove glycolytic ﬂux, leading
to enhanced activation and cytokine production. This critical
change in the central metabolism of T cells dramatically reduced
the tolerance CypD animals to persistent Mtb infection.
Taken together the ﬁndings that increasing T cell numbers and
enhancing their function in the lungs of Mtb infected animals
reduces tolerance is compelling. We can no longer pursue the
development of therapeutics or vaccines that simply drive more
activated T cells and more IFNγ production without considering
the very real possibility of deleterious eﬀects. Mammalian hosts
have clearly evolved an important balance between antimicrobial
resistance strategies and tolerance mechanisms to survive
persistent infections that must be more adequately evaluated
in our research as we pursue more eﬀective Mtb treatment
strategies.
Outlook
The studies discussed above suggest a critical role for the
regulation of inﬂammatory cascades in tolerance to persistent
Mtb infection, and highlights a number of well-studied pathways
in this process. It seems clear that macrophages integrate
metabolic and innate immune signals with those derived
from T cells to control the extent of inﬂammatory tissue
damage. While these pathways are important determinants
of disease progression, they likely represent a small fraction
of
the
mechanisms
that
contribute
to
tolerance.
Our
current understanding of TB tolerance is focused largely
on immunological factors with an already appreciated protective
role in the mouse model of TB. However, in simpler model
systems, it is clear that a wide variety of functions involved
in tissue repair, systemic metabolism, and energy utilization
also play an important role. Furthermore, it is clear that
bacterial factors interact with the immune system to regulate
tolerance, and a number of Mtb genes have been found to
alter
immunopathology
without
aﬀecting
bacterial
ﬁtness
(88, 89). Developing models for TB where these diverse tolerance
pathways can be observed and dissected represents a major
challenge for the future.
While our understanding of tolerance generally lags far
behind our knowledge of resistance mechanisms, the examples

Tolerance to Mtb
described above highlight the importance of continued research.
While antibiotics are generally eﬀective for uncomplicated Mtb
infections, several particularly serious and/or long-term sequelae
of Mtb infection can be attributed to defects in tolerance.
These complications include acute failures of tolerance, such as
meningitis and TB-IRIS, as well as the long-term tissue damage
and decreased lung function that generally follows infection.
Understanding the processes involved in damage and repair will
likely produce more eﬀective therapies.
