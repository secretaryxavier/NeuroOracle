Abstract This study used receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) methodology and discriminative analyses to exam-
ine the correspondence of the Child Behavior Checklist
(CBCL) rationally-derived DSM-oriented scales and
empirically-derived syndrome scales with clinical diagno-
ses in a clinic-referred sample of children and adolescents
(N=476). Although results demonstrated that the CBCL
Anxiety, Affective, Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity, Oppo-
sitional and Conduct Problems DSM-oriented scales corre-
sponded significantly with related clinical diagnoses

derived from parent-based structured interviews, these
DSM-oriented scales did not evidence significantly greater
correspondence with clinical diagnoses than the syndrome
scales in all cases but one. The DSM-oriented Anxiety
Problems scale was the only scale that evidenced signifi-
cantly greater correspondence with diagnoses above its
syndrome scale counterpart —the Anxious/Depressed scale.
The recently developed and rationally-derived DSM-oriented
scales thus generally do not add incremental clinical utility
above that already afforded by the syndrome scales with
respect to corresponding with diagnoses. Implications of
these findings are discussed.

The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach and
Rescorla 2001) is among the most widely used parent-report
measures of youth emotional and behavioral problems in both
clinical and research settings. Since the development of the
original empirically-based CBCL scales (Achenbach and
Edelbrock 1983), Achenbach and colleagues have added
narrow-band syndrome scales, competence and adaptive
scales, as well as broad-band internalizing, externalizing,
and total problems scales to better organize the information
obtained from parents on their children’s competences and
behavioral problems. With well-established normative data
and standardized clinical cutoffs for its various syndrome
and broad-band scales, the CBCL syndrome, internalizing,
externalizing, and total problems scales have demonstrated
strong psychometric properties within clinical settings for
discriminating between referred and nonreferred populations
(Achenbach 1991; Chen et al. 1994; Drotar et al., 1995). For
instance, the CBCL internalizing scale has demonstrated the

ability to discriminate between youths with and without
anxiety, as well as youths with anxiety disorders and youths
with externalizing disorders (Seligman et al. 2004). Signif-
icant associations with both general (e.g., anxiety and
affective disorders groups) and more specific (e.g.,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder)
diagnostic groups have also been established (Eiraldi et al.
2000; Kasius et al. 1997), supporting the utility of the CBCL
syndrome and broad-band scales across multiple settings.
CBCL DSM-Oriented Scales
Although the CBCL’s empirically-derived syndrome and
broad-band scales have evidenced particular strengths, it
has been argued that a weakness is their lack of
concordance with nosology from the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM; American
Psychiatric Association 2000). For example, Jensen et al.
(1993) and Kasius et al. (1997) found that the CBCL
syndrome scales appear to be sensitive to measuring
general mental illness/psychopathology, but not very
sensitive to measuring specific DSM diagnoses, particularly
for internalizing disorders. This may not be surprising given
the factor analytically-derived syndrome scales measure
dimensions not entirely consistent with DSM nosology. For
instance, items that appear specific to DSM categories of
anxiety or depression are scored on the same Anxious/
Depressed syndrome scale (e.g., “too fearful or anxious”,
“nervous, highstrung, or tense “, “talks about killing self’,
“feels worthless or inferior’).
Scales that map closely to DSM nosology may be useful
for several reasons. First, DSM-oriented scales have the
potential to better screen for and inform subsequently
administered diagnostic interviews than other scales that
were designed to measure multi-disorder syndromes or
other constructs not aligned with DSM categories. Related-
ly, reimbursement for mental health services in clinical
settings in America relies heavily on the documentation of
DSM-based disorders (Achenbach and Dumenci 2001;
Doucette 2002). The psychopathology and treatment
research literature are also largely based upon the DSM
classification system. Therefore, to provide an additional
perspective with closer linkage to the prevailing DSM
nosology, Achenbach et al. (2003) developed the CBCL
DSM-oriented scales to supplement the traditional CBCL
syndrome scales. Unlike the syndrome scales, the DSM-
oriented scales were not derived via factor analytic
methods, but were constructed through agreement in
ratings among 22 highly experienced child psychiatrists
and psychologists from 16 cultures. These experts rated
each pre-existing CBCL item for the degree to which each
was consistent with criteria for a particular DSM-IV
val Springer
diagnostic category. Items were then matched with a given
diagnostic category if rated as “very consistent with the
DSM category” by at least 14 of the 22 experts (Achenbach
et al. 2003), and a DSM-oriented scale was developed for
categories matching 6 or more items. The six DSM-oriented
scales (and the diagnoses they are meant to represent) are:
(a) Affective Problems [Dysthymic (DYS) and Major
Depressive Disorders (MDD)], (b) Anxiety Problems
[Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Separation Anxiety
Disorder (SAD), and Specific Phobia (SPEC)], (c) Attention
Deficit/Hyperactivity Problems [Primarily Hyperactive
(ADHD-PH), Primarily Inattenttve (ADHD-PI) and Com-
bined (ADHD-C) subtypes], (d) Conduct Problems [Conduct
Disorder (CD)], (e) Oppositional Defiant Problems [Opposi-
tional Defiant Disorder (ODD)], and (f) Somatic Problems
(Somatization and Somatoform Disorders).
Although research supporting the psychometric proper-
ties of these CBCL DSM-oriented scales is growing, less is
known about the clinical utility of these scales with respect
to their correspondence with youth clinical diagnoses. Their
comparative performance with related syndrome scales
regarding correspondence with DSM diagnoses is also
unknown. Knowing the degree to which the rationally-
derived DSM-oriented scales correspond with DSM diag-
noses relative to the empirically-derived syndrome scales
could provide insight into the incremental utility offered by
the newly derived DSM-oriented scales as well as whether
the DSM-oriented scales achieved their intended aims (.e.,
greater correspondence with DSM categories). Among
research conducted to date on the CBCL DSM-oriented
scales, Achenbach et al. (2003) reported that the CBCL
DSM-oriented scales, compared to the syndrome scales,
evidenced a similar degree of internal consistency, test-
retest reliability, and cross-informant agreement. They also
reported that both scales revealed similar associations
between classifications of youths’ scores as “deviant”
(defined as 7-score>65). The factor structure of the CBCL
DSM-oriented scales was also found to be supported in a
community sample (Achenbach et al. 2003). Nakamura et
al. (2009) also found support for scale reliability, as well as
convergent and discriminative validity, for all six CBCL
DSM-oriented scales using a large and ethnically diverse
clinic-referred sample of 673 children and adolescents
diagnosed with structured interviews.
Ferdinand (2008) also explored the clinical utility of the
CBCL DSM-oriented Anxiety Problems and Affective
Problems scales for predicting pertinent DSM-IV internal-
izing diagnoses (based on either parent/child impairment
ratings or clinician rated clinical severity ratings) via
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methodology,
in a clinic-referred sample of 277 youths, ages 6-18.
Ferdinand found that the CBCL DSM-oriented Anxiety
Problems scale could predict SAD, GAD and SPEC when

375
diagnoses were based on parent/child impairment ratings,
but could not predict SAD and GAD when diagnoses were
based on clinician severity ratings. Similarly, Ferdinand
found that the CBCL DSM-oriented Affective Problems
scale could predict MDD and DYS when diagnoses were
based on parent/child impairment ratings, but could not
predict DYS when diagnoses were based on clinician
severity ratings.
Although studies have begun to examine the psycho-
metric properties of some of the CBCL DSM-oriented
scales, numerous questions remain regarding the clinical
utility of these scales on this widely used measure.
Particularly unexplored are the DSM-oriented externalizing
scales (1.e., Oppositional Problems and Conduct Problems
scales) as well as the Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity
(ADH) Problems scale. Regarding the DSM-oriented ADH
Problems scale, although the developers indicated that this
scale was designed to measure both ADHD-PI and ADHD-
PH, it may be useful to test empirically whether this scale
performs well at identifying ADHD-PI, ADHD-PH, and
ADHD-C youths as well as discriminating between ADHD
and disruptive behavior related disorders. Similarly, regard-
ing the DSM-oriented Oppositional and Conduct Problems
scales, further analysis of performance in clinical settings
may provide insight into questions of how best use these
scales to assist in diagnostic formulations of ODD, CD and
their differential diagnosis. The CBCL’s broad use in
diagnostic settings makes informing answers to these
questions of particular importance.
For this reason, the present study used ROC curve
methodology and discriminative ANOVAs to examine the
concurrent validity and correspondence of the internalizing-
and externalizing-related CBCL DSM-oriented scales with
related DSM diagnoses using a clinic-referred sample of
children and adolescents. In general, it was predicted that
the DSM-oriented scales would evidence significantly
greater correspondence with DSM diagnoses than the
syndrome scales given their purported closer linkage with
DSM categories. Specific hypotheses for each scale are
indicated below, in the Data Analytic Approach section.
Method
Participants
Youths in the present sample were 476 of 557 consecutively
referred children and adolescents to two mental health
clinics (the Center for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, in
Honolulu, Hawaii; and Judge Baker’s Children Hospital, in
Boston, Massachusetts) for diagnostic intake evaluations.
Eligibility for youths in the present study included being 6—
18 years old and having a CBCL' and diagnostic data
available. Of the 557 consecutively referred youths, three
children (0.5%) were younger than 6 years old, two youths
(0.4%) had missing diagnostic data and 75 youths (13.5%)
did not have an available CBCL (due to their caretakers
choosing to not fill out the assessment measures). These 80
youths were thus not included in the study. To help ensure
that all CBCLs contained valid responses, inclusion into the
study also required each CBCL form to have 90% or more
completed items (i.e., fewer than 13 items missing). One
participant was excluded due to having 17 items missing,
leaving a final sample size of 476 youths. The final sample
consisted of 320 (67.2%) boys and 156 (32.8%) girls.
Information about the total number of diagnoses present in
the sample (primary and anywhere in the diagnostic profile)
appears in Table |. Youths’ ages ranged from 6.55 to
18.9 years (M=11.4, SD=2.5), and primary caregivers’
ages ranged from 21 to 78 (M= 41.4; SD=9.6). Additional
youth and primary caregiver demographic information
appears in Table 2. All children and parents were fluent in
English.
Measures
Child Behavior Checklist for Ages 6-18 (CBCL/6—18;
Achenbach and Rescorla 2001) The 120 items on the
CBCL are rated as Not True (0), Somewhat or Sometimes
True (1), or Very True or Often True (2). Items are summed
to yield (a) competence and adaptive scale scores, (b) eight
syndrome scale scores (comprised of 103 of the total 120
items), (c) six DSM-oriented scale scores (comprised of 55
of the total 120 items), and (d) broad-band scale scores
(including internalizing and externalizing total scores).
Validity and reliability of the syndrome and DSM-oriented
scales have been documented (Achenbach and Rescorla
2001; Achenbach et al. 2003), and extensive normative
data are available for children ranging from 6 to 18. All
analyses were conducted using raw CBCL scale scores, as
Achenbach and Rescorla’s (2001) ASEBA manual recom-
mends using raw scores in order to account for the full
range of variation.
Children's Interview for Psychiatric Syndromes, Parent
Version (P-ChIPS; Weller et al. 1999) The P-ChIPS is a
semi-structured interview designed to be administered to
the parents of youths (aged 6-18 years) by trained
interviewers. The interviews screen for 20 different mood,
anxiety, behavioral, substance, eating, and elimination Axis
' Although rare, there were occasions whereby two informants (i.e.,
mother and father) completed two separate CBCLs for the same youth.
In such cases, we included only the mother’s CBCL in the present
study.

I disorders as well as psychosocial stressors, and are based
on the DSM-IV classification criteria. Content and concur-
rent validity, as well as inter-rater reliability of the P-ChIPS
have been demonstrated. Fristad et al. (1998) showed that
the P-ChIPS demonstrated moderate levels of agreement
with the ChIPS child interview (mean kappa=0.41) as well
as with clinician diagnoses (mean kappa=0.49). Across
diagnostic categories, sensitivity averaged 87% and speci-
ficity averaged 76%, suggesting that the P-ChIPS is similar
to other structured interviews administered to parents
regarding the accuracy of both positive and negative
findings.
Procedure
Prior to any data collection, all participants and their legal
guardians underwent standardized Institutional Review
Board-approved notice of privacy and consent procedures.
The youths’ primary caregivers completed the CBCL in
val Springer
English and also participated in structured diagnostic
interviews (i.e., the P-ChIPS). Assessors consisted of Ph.D.
level clinical child psychologists and doctoral students in
clinical psychology”. A small portion of diagnoses were for
problem areas not assessed by the P-ChIPS diagnostic
interviews (e.g., trichotillomania). In order to make such
diagnostic determinations, assessors acquired information
from the parents regarding these problems areas according to
* Although inter-rater reliability data of these structured interviews
were not gathered, assessors in the present study were trained to
reliability using the P-ChIPS. Becoming trained to reliability involved
(a) observation of three P-ChIPS interviews conducted by trained
assessors, (b) conducting a series of five P-ChIPS interviews while
being observed by a criterion-trained assessor, (c) matching the
experienced assessor on all clinical diagnoses in three of the five
interviews, and (d) matching the experienced interviewer on the
Clinical Severity Ratings (CSRs) within at least one point on all
diagnoses given. CSRs are ratings provided by the assessor which
range from 0-10 and indicate clinical severity of each disorder. CSRs>
5 indicate clinically significant severity for each disorder.

Data preparation Although missing data levels were low in
the present sample [1.e., 369 (77.5%) participants of the full
sample had no missing CBCL items, 69 (14.5%) had only 1
missing item, 19 (4.0%) had 2 missing items, 18 (3.8%)
had 3-7 missing items and 1 (0.2%) had 12 missing items],
we imputed missing data using the Missing Value Analysis
(MVA) module of SPSS 15.0 (SPSS, 2006). The SPSS
MVA module examines missing data patterns and imputes
missing values through a maximum likelihood method
based on expectation-maximization algorithms (Little and
Rubin 1987). To help ensure that only valid CBCL
subscales were included in analyses, we calculated each
subscale only if it had less than 20% missing items. Twenty
percent instead of 10% was used as the cut-off for subscale
inclusion to allow the subscales with low item counts (e.g.,
the DSM-oriented Anxiety and ADH Problems scales) to
have one item missing and still be calculated. Among the
DSM-oriented scales, three Anxiety, three Somatic, one
Affective, one ADH, one Oppositional and one Conduct
Problems scales scores were not calculated due to having
more than 20% missing data. Among the syndrome scales,
two Anxious/Depressed, two Somatic Complaints, two
Thought Problems, one Withdrawn/Depressed, one Social
Problems, one Attention Problems, one Rule Breaking
Behavior and one Aggressive Behavior scale scores were
not calculated due to having more than 20% missing data.
Data Analytic Approach
The correspondence of the DSM-oriented scales and
syndrome scales with related diagnoses was examined via
ANOVA and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
analyses, using Analyze-It for Microsoft Excel version
2.12 (Analyze-It Software Ltd., 2008). ROC analyses result
in Area Under the Curve (AUC) values, which indicate the
degree to which a scale predicts a binary classification (e.g.,
presence or absence of a clinical diagnosis). AUC values
significantly greater than .50 indicate that the scale can
perform the binary classification better than chance level.
AUC values may also be interpreted according to the
following: 50—.70, poor; .70—.80, fair; .80-.90, good; .90—
1.00, excellent (c.f. Ferdinand 2008). The comparative
performance of the DSM-oriented and syndrome scales with
respect to corresponding with relevant diagnoses was
evaluated via z-test comparisons of AUC values (DeLong
et al. 1988). Larger AUC values are indicative of better
prediction of diagnostic status. Given the number of
ANOVAs and AUC z-tests conducted, consideration of
the Bonferroni correction (i.e., .05/37) warranted setting the
significance level to .001 to help correct for Type-I error
rates in the present study. The DSM-oriented Somatic
Problems scale was not examined because no youths in
the present sample had a Somatization Disorder.
Using discriminative ANOVA and ROC methodology,
we applied a general analytic approach to each DSM-
oriented scale. (a) First, if the scale was designed to target a
cluster of related diagnoses, we used ANOVA and AUC
analyses to evaluate whether the DSM-oriented scale could
discriminate youths with each individual diagnosis targeted
vai Springer

378
J Psychopathol Behav Assess (2010) 32:373-384
by the scale from all youths without diagnoses of the
related disorders (e.g., evaluating whether the DSM-
oriented Anxiety Problems scale — designed to measure
SAD, GAD and SPEC — can discriminate youths with
SAD from youths without any anxiety disorder). We
performed this test to demonstrate that the DSM-oriented
scales corresponded significantly with each disorder tar-
geted by the scale. This test was applicable to the DSM-
oriented Anxiety, Affective and ADH Problems scales, as
these scales were designed to target clusters of related
disorders. We predicted that these DSM-oriented scales
would correspond significantly (1.e., evidence significant
ANOVA and AUC values significantly greater than chance)
with all individual diagnostic groups. (b) Second, we used
ANOVA and AUC analyses to evaluate whether each DSM-
oriented scale could discriminate between any youths with
the scale’s targeted disorder group from all youths without
any of those disorders (e.g., evaluating whether the DSM-
oriented Anxiety Problems scale — designed to measure
SAD, GAD and SPEC — can discriminate youths with
SAD, GAD and/or SPEC from youths without any of these
disorders), and whether each DSM-oriented scale could
perform this discrimination significantly better than its
related syndrome scale (1.e., significantly greater AUC).
These tests were applicable to all DSM-oriented scales. We
predicted that all DSM-oriented scales would be able to
discriminate the targeted diagnostic groups significantly
better than the syndrome scales given that the DSM-oriented
scales were developed to more closely correspond with
current DSM categories. (c) Third, we used ANOVA and
AUC analyses to evaluate whether each DSM-oriented scale
could discriminate youths with the scale’s targeted disorder
group from youths with a related disorder (but without any
disorder related to the targeted disorders), so as to aid in
differential diagnostic formulations between related disor-
ders*. For example, one test of this type evaluated whether
the DSM-oriented Anxiety Problems scale — designed to
measure SAD, GAD and SPEC — can discriminate youths
with SAD, GAD and/or SPEC from youths with any
affective disorder (and without any anxiety disorder). This
type of analysis was applicable to all DSM-oriented scales.
Again, we predicted that all DSM-oriented scales would be
able to significantly discriminate pertinent diagnostic groups
and would perform significantly better than the related
syndrome scales (i.e., significantly greater AUC values).
The one exception was the DSM-oriented Oppositional
> Although differential diagnoses also refer to differentiating between
specific disorders of a common disorder category (e.g., differentiating
between GAD and SAD within the area of anxiety disorders), we
currently assessed for differential diagnostic performance at the more
broader level (e.g., differentiating between anxiety and depression)
given that the CBCL DSM-oriented scales were not designed to
specifically map onto any single disorder subtype.

Problems scale. We predicted that this scale would not be
able to discriminate between ODD and CD youths, given
that all the features of ODD are usually present in CD.
Notably, we predicted the null hypothesis in this particular
case. However, instead of omitting this analysis due to the
prediction of the null hypothesis, we thought it was
meaningful to include this analysis in the present study.
That is, if significant differences were found between ODD
and CD youths on the DSM-oriented Oppositional Problems
scale, this would suggest that this scale does not specifically
measure ODD symptomatology given that both ODD and
CD youths should have elevated scores on this scale.
Results
CBCL DSM-Oriented Anxiety Problems Scale
Individual diagnoses of the targeted diagnostic group The
ANOVA and ROC results evaluating the various tests of the
DSM-oriented Anxiety Problems scale — including the test
of correspondence with individual diagnoses of the targeted
diagnostic group — appear in Table 3. As predicted, the
DSM-oriented Anxiety Problems scale corresponded sig-
nificantly with the individual diagnoses targeted by the
scale (1.e., SAD, GAD, SPEC; Table 3, row 1, 2 and 3).
Targeted diagnostic group As predicted, the DSM-oriented
Anxiety Problems scale was able to discriminate the
anxiety group targeted by the scale (i.e., SAD/GAD/SPEC
youths) from youths without these diagnoses. The Anxious/
Depressed syndrome scale also significantly discriminated
these groups, and consistent with prediction, the AUC of
the DSM-oriented Anxiety Problems scale was significantly
greater than the AUC of the Anxious/Depressed syndrome
scale (Table 3, row 4 and 5). Both AUC values, however,
fell in the “good” range.
Differential diagnoses As predicted, the DSM-oriented Anx-
iety Problems scale significantly discriminated youths with
SAD, GAD and/or SPEC from affective youths without
anxiety disorders (1.e., youths with major depressive disorder,
dysthymic disorder, or depressive disorder not otherwise
specified, but without any anxiety disorders*). The Anxious/
Depressed syndrome scale also significantly discriminated
these groups (as evidenced by a significant ANOVA), and
consistent with prediction, the AUC of the DSM-oriented
Anxiety Problems scale (falling in the “good” range) was
* Any anxiety disorder included separation anxiety disorder, general-
ized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
post traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, social phobia, and
anxiety disorder not otherwise specified.

Individual diagnoses of the targeted diagnostic group The
ANOVA and ROC results evaluating the various tests of the
DSM-oriented Affective Problems scale — including the test
of correspondence with individual diagnoses of the targeted
diagnostic group — appear in Table 4. As predicted, the
DSM-oriented Affective Problems scale corresponded sig-
nificantly with the individual diagnoses targeted by the scale
(i.e, MDD, DYS; Table 4, row 1 and 2).
Targeted diagnostic group As predicted, the DSM-oriented
Affective Problems scale was able to discriminate youths
with MDD or DYS (ie., the youths targeted by the scale)
from youths without these diagnoses. The Withdrawn/
Depressed syndrome scale also significantly discriminated
these groups. Contrary to prediction, however, the AUC of
the DSM-oriented Affective Problems scale was not
significantly different than the AUC of the Withdrawn/
Depressed syndrome scale (Table 4, row 3 and 4). Both
AUC values also fell in the “fair” range.
Differential diagnoses As predicted, the DSM-oriented
Affective Problems scale significantly discriminated youths
with MDD or DYS from anxious youths without any
affective disorder (1.e., youths with any anxiety disorder,
but without any affective disorder’). The Withdrawn/
Depressed syndrome scale was also able to significantly
discriminate these groups. Contrary to prediction, however,
the AUC of the DSM-oriented Affective Problems scale
was not significantly different than the AUC of the
Withdrawn/Depressed syndrome scale (Table 4, row 5 and
6). Both AUC values also fell in the “poor” range.

predicted, the DSM-oriented Oppositional Problems scale
was able to discriminate youths with ODD (the targeted
diagnostic group of this scale) from youths without ODD.
The Aggressive Behavior syndrome scale was also able to
significantly discriminate these groups. Contrary to predic-
tion, however, the AUC of the DSM-oriented Oppositional
Problems scale was not significantly different than the AUC
of the Aggressive Behavior syndrome scale (Table 6, row 1
and 2), and both AUC values fell in the “fair” range. With
respect to the DSM-oriented Conduct Problems scale, this
scale was able to discriminate youths with CD (.e., the
targeted diagnostic group of this scale) from youths without
CD. The Rule-Breaking Behavior syndrome scale was also
able to significantly discriminate these groups. Contrary to
prediction, however, the AUC of the DSM-oriented Conduct
Problems scale was not significantly different than the AUC
of the Rule-Breaking Behavior syndrome scale (Table 6, row
3 and 4), and both AUC values fell in the “good” range.
Differential diagnoses As predicted, the DSM-oriented
Oppositional Problems scale was not able to discriminate
youths with ODD from youths with CD. The Aggressive
Behavior syndrome scale also could not perform this
discrimination. As noted above, this was expected given
that both ODD and CD youths exhibit ODD-related
symptomatology. With respect to the DSM-oriented Con-

ODD. The Rule-Breaking Behavior syndrome scale was
also able to significantly discriminate CD from ODD
youths. Contrary to prediction, however, the AUC of the

Mothers-only analyses Given that mothers and fathers have
reported differently on the CBCL (e.g., Kendall et al.
2007), such as mothers reporting more youth problems than
fathers (e.g., Christensen et al. 1991), we repeated all
analyses using mothers-only data (n=290). Results were
almost completely identical as the results based on the full
sample. Across all analyses, the only differences between
the results based on the mothers-only subsample and full
sample were the following: (a) the AUC of the DSM-
oriented Anxiety Problems scale was significantly greater
than the AUC of the Anxious/Depressed syndrome scale
with respect to discriminating youths with SAD, GAD, or
SPEC from youths with any affective disorder (but no
anxiety disorder) at the p < .05 level with the mothers-only
sample, but at the p < .001 with the full sample; this
difference was likely due to reduced power in the mothers-
only analyses as the sample size of the affective disorder
group reduced from 37 to 26 affective youths when using
the mothers-only data; and (b) the Withdrawn/Depressed
syndrome scale was able to discriminate youths with MDD
or DYS from youths with any anxiety disorder (and without
any affective disorders) at the p < .01 level with the
mothers-only sample, but at the p < .001 with the full
sample. The patterns of results of all other analyses were
identical between the full and mothers-only samples’. The
results of the present study are thus likely generalizable to
and interpretable in relationship with the literature on
mothers’ reports of youth problems.
Gender specific analyses Given that differences have been
found between parental ratings of boys’ and girls’ behavior/
emotional problems (e.g., Thurber and Osborn 1993), we
repeated all analyses using boys-only data (n=320) and
girls-only data (n=156). The boys-only and_ girls-only
results were nearly identical as the results based on the full
sample. Across all analyses, the only difference of the
gender-specific results compared to the full-sample results
was the following: for the girls-only analyses, unlike the
full-sample results, the Withdrawn/Depressed syndrome
scale was not able to discriminate girls with depression

(n=44) from girls with anxiety (n=46; p=.117); however,
consistent with the full-sample results, the DSM-oriented
Affective Problems scale was able to somewhat discrimi-
nate girls with depression from girls with anxiety (p=.002).
Unlike the full-sample results, the associated AUC value of
the DSM-oriented Affective Problems scale (AUC=.70)
was somewhat larger than the AUC value of the With-
drawn/Depressed syndrome scale (AUC=.61; p=.038),
with respect to discriminating between depressed and
anxious girls. The patterns of results of all other gender-
specific analyses’ were identical to the full-sample results.
Discussion
The present study evaluated and compared the degree to
which the rationally-derived CBCL DSM-oriented scales
and empirically-derived syndrome scales corresponded with
parent-based youth DSM diagnoses. Given that expert child
psychiatrists and psychologists assisted in deriving the
DSM-oriented scales to be more consistent with DSM
nosology, it was predicted that these scales would evidence
significantly better correspondence with clinical DSM
diagnoses than the syndrome scales. The present findings,
however, revealed that the DSM-oriented scales generally did
not evidence performance superior to that of the syndrome
scales with respect to correspondence with clinical diagno-
ses. One explanation for this lack of increased correspon-
dence with DSM diagnoses by the DSM-oriented scales is
that these scales were derived from the limited pool of 120
items already comprising the CBCL. This likely placed a
limit on the ability of the developers to create scales that
align more with DSM constructs. In fact, among the six
CBCL DSM-oriented scales, the Oppositional and Conduct
Problems scales are the only two scales that target specific
DSM disorders (i.e., ODD and CD, respectively). The
remaining four DSM-oriented scales were developed to
target clusters of related disorders (e.g., the DSM-oriented
Anxiety Problems scale targets the cluster of GAD, SAD and
SPEC anxiety disorders, as opposed to any single anxiety
disorder), likely due to a limited item pool.
Interestingly, the DSM-oriented Anxiety Problems scale
was the only DSM-oriented scale that evidenced a slight
advantage over the syndrome scales. Despite being com-
prised of only 6-1tems, a concern raised by previous
investigators (e.g., Ferdinand 2008; Kendall et al. 2007),
the DSM-oriented Anxiety Problems scale evidenced
significantly greater AUC values than the Anxious/De-
pressed syndrome scale with respect to discriminating (a)

383
the anxiety disorders targeted by the scale (1.e., SAD, GAD,
and SPEC) from all other disorders, as well as (b) the
anxiety disorders targeted by the scale from affective
disorders. These findings are consistent with the notion
that the Anxious/Depressed syndrome scale is somewhat
less specific to anxiety than the DSM-oriented Anxiety
Problems scale, given that the Anxious/Depressed syn-
drome scale contains items also related to affective
problems (e.g., “feels too guilty,” “talks about killing self,”
“feels worthless and inferior’). Notably, however, the
Anxious/Depressed syndrome scale also evidenced signif-
icant ANOVAs and its AUC values fell in the “fair” and
“good” range, supporting this scale’s ability to also
correspond significantly with anxiety problems.
Regarding assessment of disruptive behaviors, the
present study demonstrated that the DSM-oriented Opposi-
tional Problems and Aggressive Behavior syndrome scales
performed similarly with respect to correspondence to ODD
diagnostic status. The present study also demonstrated that
the DSM-oriented Conduct Problems and the Rule-
Breaking Behavior syndrome scales performed similarly
with respect to corresponding with CD diagnostic status.
Notably, the DSM-oriented Oppositional Problems could
not discriminate between ODD and CD youths, whereas the
DSM-oriented Conduct Problems scale could discriminate
between these youths. This finding is consistent with the
mutually exclusive diagnostic rule of ODD and CD (.e.,
that a youth cannot receive both ODD and CD), as well as
the notion that all the features of ODD are usually present
in CD. This finding has implications pertaining to the
application and interpretation of the DSM-oriented Opposi-
tional Problems and Conduct Problems scales. Before
interpreting elevations on the DSM-oriented Oppositional
Problems scale as suggestive of an ODD diagnosis (or the
need for further testing to determine ODD status), it is
necessary to also inspect the DSM-oriented Conduct
Problems scale to verify that elevations are not also present
on this scale. If the DSM-oriented Conduct Problems scale
is not elevated, a diagnosis of ODD may be considered;
however, if the DSM-oriented Conduct Problems scale is
elevated, a diagnosis of CD should instead be considered.
The gender-specific analyses revealed that the present
study’s findings are generally robust to youth gender. The
one potential gender-related difference is that the DSM-
oriented Affective Problems scale and the Withdrawn/
Depressed syndrome scale performed equally well with
respect to discriminating boys with depression from boys
with anxiety, whilst the DSM-oriented Affective Problems
scale performed somewhat better than the Withdrawn/
Depressed syndrome scale with respect to discriminating
girls with depression from girls with anxiety.
Despite the DSM-oriented scales not evidencing signif-
icant advantages over the syndrome scales with respect to
correspondence with clinical DSM diagnoses (except for the
few instances noted above), it is notable that the 6 DSM-
oriented scales are comprised of significantly fewer items
than the 8 syndrome scales (i.e., 55 1tems versus 103 items,
respectively). As public mental health systems and provider
agencies move towards mandating the use of standardized
measurement of youth outcomes, a shortened version of the
CBCL — comprised of only the 55-itemed DSM-oriented
scales — could be useful in clinical (and research) contexts,
particularly when assessment battery length is a concern.
More research however is needed to ensure that the DSM-
oriented scales perform at least as well as the syndrome
scales with respect to measurement accuracy across
additional parameters and sample characteristics, such as
factor structure, reliability, and age.
There were also limitations of the present study that offer
directions for future research. First, there were no youths in the
present sample with a somatization disorder. As a result, the
DSM-oriented Somatic Problems scale could not be evalu-
ated. Future research evaluating the concurrent validity of the
DSM-oriented Somatic Problems scale is thus needed. There
were also very few youths in the sample with a diagnosis of
ADHD-PH, limiting the ability to evaluate the concurrent
validity of the DSM-oriented ADH Problems scale with
respect to this diagnosis. Further, only the CBCL, as opposed
to also the Teacher Report Form (TRF) and/or Youth Self-
Report (YSR), was examined in the present study. Findings
related to both the TRF and YSR DS’M-oriented scales would
provide further understanding of the performance of these
DSM-oriented scales in clinical settings, such as their corre-
spondence with DSM diagnoses. Other questions pertaining
to the applicability of the DSM-oriented scales could also be
examined. For instance, knowing the degree to which the
DSM-oriented Anxiety Problems scale corresponds with
other anxiety disorders beyond the anxiety disorders targeted
by the scale (i.e., SAD, GAD, and SPEC) would help inform
its usage. Further, knowing the degree to which other parent-
report measures (e.g., the Revised Child Anxiety and
Depression Scale — Parent Version; Ebesutani et al. 2009)
designed to map onto specific DSM constructs correspond
with clinical diagnoses compared to the CBCL DSM-
oriented scales may also inform whether the CBCL DSM-
oriented scales achieved their aims.
Overall, although the present findings support the concur-
rent validity of the recently derived CBCL DSM-oriented
scales, the present study did not identify significant
advantages of the DSM-oriented scales over the syndrome
scales with respect to correspondence with DSM diagnoses.
Given that in creating the DSM-oriented scales, the devel-
opers likely sought to increase correspondence with DSM
diagnoses relative to that of the syndrome scales, additional
attention may be needed to explore why increased corre-
spondence was not achieved and whether increased corre-

spondence may be obtained via modifications to the DSM-
oriented scales. Kendall et al. (2007), for example, recently
attempted to improve the 6-item DSM-oriented Anxiety
Problems scale by adding an additional 10 anxiety-related
CBCL items to the scale. Although this did not lead to clear
improvement of the scale (1.e., their new 16-item anxiety
scale predicted anxiety disorders better than the original 6-
item CBCL DSM-oriented Anxiety Problems scale when
based on mother reports, but predicted anxiety disorders
worse when based on father reports), these findings are
promising with respect to the potential for enhancing the
clinical utility and concurrent validity of the CBCL DSM-
oriented scales via scale/item modifications. Additional
similar efforts would be valuable. In the meantime, findings
of the present study demonstrated that the CBCL DSM-
oriented scales evidenced significant correspondence with
related DSM diagnoses and are thus clinically useful along-
side the syndrome and broad-band scales to incorporate into
the assessment of youth emotional and behavior problems. It
is encouraged that future efforts be made to increase corre-
spondence of the DSM-oriented scales with DSM diagnoses
for enhanced utility in clinical and research settings.
