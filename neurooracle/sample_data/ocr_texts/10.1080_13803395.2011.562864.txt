Abstract
Poor inhibitory control and abnormalities in responding to rewards are characteristic of the
developmental or primary form of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (P-ADHD). A secondary
form of ADHD (S-ADHD) may occur as a consequence of childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI),
but the similarities and differences between these two forms of ADHD have not been well
characterized. To address these issues, we studied two inhibitory control tasks under different
reward conditions in four groups of children and adolescents: TBI who did not exhibit S-ADHD,
TBI who did exhibit S-ADHD, P-ADHD, and healthy controls. Participants with TBI exhibited
poor cancellation inhibition relative to controls. Although reward facilitated both cancellation and
restraint inhibition similarly across groups, poor performance persisted in the P-ADHD group, and
participants with S-ADHD exhibited a selective deficit in cancellation inhibition.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common in children and adolescents, and often results in
significant cognitive and behavioral deficits, including inattention (Catroppa, Anderson, &
Stargatt, 1999; Cicerone, 1996; Dennis, Wilkinson, Koski, & Humphreys, 1995) and poor
inhibitory control (Levin, Hanten, Zhang, Swank, Hunter, 2004; Levin et al., 1993; Konrad,
Gauggel, Manz, & Scholl, 2000a, 2000b). Childhood TBI may also lead to the emergence of

new-onset psychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (i.e.,
secondary ADHD (S-ADHD); Gerring et al., 1998). S-ADHD occurs in approximately 15–
20% of TBI survivors without a previous history of ADHD (Gerring et al., 1998; Gerring et
al., 2000; Herskovits et al., 1999; Max et al., 2005a, 2005b; Slomine et al., 2005; Yeates et
al., 2005), manifesting as early as 6 months post-TBI (Max et al., 2005a) and persisting into
the chronic stage of recovery (e.g., Max et al., 1998; Max et al., 2005b).
A key question is whether S-ADHD is simply an acquired form of developmental or primary
ADHD (P-ADHD), sharing commonalities in cognitive, behavioral and functional
outcomes, or whether fundamental differences exist between these disorders despite
similarities in some overt behavioral features. Both P-ADHD and S-ADHD exhibit deficits
with inhibitory control (e.g., Schachar, Levin, Max, Purvis, & Chen, 2004; Schachar et al.,
2007) but it is not clear that the inhibitory control deficits are identical in the two groups.
An important distinction in inhibitory control tasks is that between canceling or stopping an
ongoing prepotent response and restraining or withholding an action. Cancellation is often
measured with the stop signal task (Logan & Cowan, 1984; Logan, 1994), in which
participants are instructed to respond as quickly as possible to one of 2 visual “go” signals
and stop responding when they hear the auditory stop signal (which is presented after
varying delays following the go signal). Poor or inefficient inhibition is manifested as longer
latencies to respond to the stop signal, or slower stop signal reaction time (SSRT). Restraint
is commonly measured with the go/no-go (GNG) task which requires participants to respond
as quickly as possible to a visual go stimulus, but to withhold their responses when they
encounter a visual “no-go” stimulus. Poor restraint is indexed by the number of responses
made to no-go stimuli (commission errors). Children with P-ADHD often exhibit deficits in
both cancellation and restraint (e.g., Schachar, Levin, et al., 2004; Schachar et al., 2007).
The close association between the cognitive and behavioral aspects of inhibitory control
suggests that poor inhibition may represent a vulnerability to ADHD (Young et al., 2009).
In addition to their deficits in inhibitory control, children with P-ADHD also exhibit
abnormal responses to rewards, with some theorists speculating that these children have a
preference for immediate reward (Sonuga-Barke, 2002) and/or an insensitivity to reward
whereby that more reinforcement is required to motivate behavior (e.g. Haenlein and Caul,
1987). To date, the effects of reward on inhibitory control in children with P-ADHD are
equivocal, with reports of reward facilitation (Desman, Petermann & Hampel, 2008; Huang-
Pollock, Mikami, Pfiffner, & McBurnett, 2007; Konrad et al., 2000b; Scheres, Oosterlaan, &
Sergeant, 2001; Stevens, Quittner, Zuckerman, & Moore, 2002; Tamm & Carlson, 2007),
reward impairment (Gomez, 2003; Shanahan, Pennington, & Willcutt, 2008; Wodka et al.
2007), or null effects (Crone, Jennings, & van der Molen, 2003; Iaboni, Douglas, & Baker,
1995; Oosterlaan & Sergeant, 1998). Methodological problems that complicate
interpretation within and across these studies include: lack of a control group (Tamm &
Carlson, 2007); no non-reward condition to compare reinforcement effects to (Huang-
Pollock et al., 2007; Iaboni et al., 1995; Oosterlaan & Sergeant, 1998); confounding of
rewards and punishments (Crone et al., 2003; Gomez, 2003; Shanahan et al., 2008; Wodka
et al., 2007); rewarding both response execution and inhibition (Huang-Pollock et al., 2007;
Shanahan et al., 2008; Stevens et al., 2002); the finding that feedback alone produces similar
improvements to rewards (Desman et al., 2008); and the existence of normal inhibition in P-
ADHD groups (Crone et al., 2003; Scheres et al., 2001), which makes it difficult to ascertain
if rewards facilitated or impaired performance.
The nature and magnitude of inhibitory control difficulties in children with S-ADHD have
not been well-studied, and it is currently unknown whether P-ADHD and S-ADHD exhibit
similar deficits across all inhibitory control tasks. Relative to typically developing children,

children with S-ADHD exhibit poor cancellation inhibition on the stop signal task (Konrad
et al., 2000a, 2000b). An inhibition deficit has been documented relative to children with
TBI in those with both a severe TBI and S-ADHD diagnosis (Schachar, Chen, et al., 2004),
suggesting that those with greater injury severity and a de novo diagnosis of ADHD are
more susceptible to disinhibition than those with less severe injuries. Because most studies
include children in both chronic and acute phases of recovery, the interpretation of data on
inhibition in TBI and S-ADHD populations is not clear. For instance, children with TBI
exhibit an initial deficit in SSRT that resolves by two years post-injury (Leblanc et al.,
2005). Further, commission errors on the GNG task decrease with time since injury, with
greater injury severity resulting in poorer improvement over time (Wassenberg, Max,
Lindgren, & Schatz, 2004). To date, only two studies have assessed cancellation
performance in both P-ADHD and S-ADHD groups (Konrad et al., 2000a, 2000b), but
because the performance was not directly compared between groups, it is currently unknown
whether or not these patients cancel their responses in a similar manner. No study has
compared the performance of children with P-ADHD and S-ADHD on other forms of
inhibitory control, such as restraint.
Little is known about how reward variables influences inhibition in children with S-ADHD.
Konrad and colleagues (2000b) rewarded successful inhibition on the stop signal task, which
improved cancellation performance in children with TBI and S-ADHD, although not to the
point of comparability to controls. At the same time, reward facilitated inhibition in children
with P-ADHD such that their performance was similar to controls. However, the ADHD
groups were not directly compared in this study (Konrad et al., 2000b), so it is unknown
whether or not they responded similarly to reward.
While comparisons to non-injured controls are helpful in determining whether and how
children with S-ADHD differ from typically functioning children in terms of inhibitory
control and responses to reward, and comparisons to children with TBI without S-ADHD
indicate the specific deficits S-ADHD confers beyond the consequences of TBI, a direct
comparison to children with P-ADHD may reveal the degree and intensity of deficits in S-
ADHD. This later comparison would also clarify whether each form of ADHD reflects a
similar disinhibition syndrome, despite differences in etiology.
Although childhood TBI can affect a number of cognitive processes, poor inhibitory control
on the stop signal task (longer SSRT) has been proposed as a candidate endophenotype for
P-ADHD (Crosbie, Perusse, Barr, & Schachar, 2008). If children with TBI exhibit similar
inhibition deficits to those with ADHD, then one would need to qualify the relationship
between endophenotype and genetic risk. If children with S-ADHD exhibit similar deficits
in cancellation and restraint to children with P-ADHD, then S-ADHD may be considered as
an acquired disorder that mimics the P-ADHD endophenotype, which would inform not only
the brain bases of inhibition deficits in P-ADHD, but also the neural bases of inhibitory
control in general. If the two groups differ across measures or exhibit a dissimilar pattern of
results, then there is evidence that S-ADHD is a separate disorder from P-ADHD, in terms
of both underlying mechanisms and associated behavioral deficits. If both groups of children
respond similarly to reward despite differences in inhibitory control performance, then it
may be concluded that rewards operate similarly on inhibition abilities across groups
suggesting a powerful effect of motivational variables in spite of differences in brain
abnormalities. In short, each pattern of results would have specific and direct implications
for the assessment and treatment of S-ADHD.
The objective of the present study was to understand how reward modulates cancellation and
restraint inhibition in developmental (P-ADHD) and acquired (S-ADHD) forms of ADHD.
We compared restraint and cancellation inhibitory control in four groups of participants

(typically developing children, children with P-ADHD, children with TBI in the chronic
stage of recovery, and children with TBI in the chronic stage of recovery with a research
diagnosis of S-ADHD). To measure cancellation and restraint we used two versions of the
stop signal task that differed only in the timing of the presentation of the stop signal
(Schachar et al., 2007). By making the no-go signal in the restraint version of the stop signal
task an auditory tone, task demands in restraint and cancellation tasks are equated, thereby
minimizing reliance on selective attention that are associated with the traditional GNG task
(Aron & Poldrack, 2005; Rubia, Smith, Brammer, & Taylor, 2003). Following the
administration of the standard inhibitory control tasks, we then investigated the relation
between reward and inhibitory control by rewarding successful cancellation and restraint.
Predictions concerned both group and reward effects, and were aligned with the literature
reviewed earlier. We predicted that approximately 15–20 % of children with TBI would
exhibit symptoms consistent with a S-ADHD diagnosis, and these participants were
expected to exhibit poorer inhibitory control on measures of cancellation and restraint
relative to those with TBI only or to healthy controls. Given that time since injury
ameliorates cancellation deficits in children with TBI (Leblanc et al., 2005), and that
participants in the TBI group in the present study were also in the chronic phase of recovery,
we predicted that children with TBI without S-ADHD would exhibit inhibitory control
similar to that of normal controls under all reward conditions. Participants in the P-ADHD
group were expected to have poorer inhibitory control relative to controls, with rewards
possibly improving inhibitory control performance. Improvement of inhibitory control
deficits by rewards in the P-ADHD group to levels exhibited by typically developing
children would suggest that children with P-ADHD also suffer from an inability to self-
motivate their own behavior.
Method
Recruitment
Children and adolescents aged seven to 17 years old were recruited to form four participant
groups: Control, TBI, S-ADHD, and P-ADHD groups. Participants in the TBI groups (n=63)
were recruited through trauma registries at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.
Typically developing youths (Control group, n=66) and children and adolescents with
diagnosed P-ADHD (n=20) were recruited through community advertisements. A brief
recruitment phone interview with each participant’s parent collected demographic
information and ensured participation eligibility: Control participants were excluded if their
parents reported that they had a history of P-ADHD, TBI, or learning disabilities; youths in
the TBI and S-ADHD groups were excluded if there was evidence of pre-injury P-ADHD
and a history of more than one TBI; exclusion for the P-ADHD group included a history of
TBI. For all groups, participants were excluded if there was a history of neurological
disorders, severe psychiatric disorders (e.g., psychosis), mental retardation, and/or sensory
or motor impairments. Family socioeconomic (SES) scores were calculated from the
Hollingshead Four-Factor Index (Hollingshead, 1975) by averaging the SES scores of both
parents, or from one parent, when this was the only information available.
The Conners 3rd Edition Rating Scales
The full-length form of the Conners 3rd Edition Rating Scales (Conners 3; Conners, 2008)
was administered to each participant’s parent (110 items) and teacher (115 items). The
Conners 3 assesses symptoms of ADHD and associated behavioral difficulties, such as
learning problems, executive dysfunction, and aggression, as well as symptoms related to
common comorbidities of ADHD such as oppositional defiant disorder and conduct
disorder. The Conners 3 also includes symptom counts, which are explicit Diagnostic and

Statistical Manual, 4th edition text revision (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric
Association, 2000) criteria that are necessary to diagnose ADHD, oppositional defiant
disorder, and conduct disorder. Thus, this rating scale was used to confirm inclusion of
participants into each group and to identify children with TBI who also reached criteria for
S-ADHD.
Participants were excluded from the Control group if they reached criteria for any disorder
on the DSM-IV-TR Symptom Counts and/or if they were rated as exhibiting a T-score in the
atypical range (i.e., over 65) on any subscale of the Conners 3 parent or teacher scales.
Participants in the P-ADHD group were excluded if they failed to reach DSM-IV-TR criteria
for ADHD (any subtype) on both the Conners 3 parent and teacher scales. Because age at
onset of S-ADHD can be no earlier than the age at TBI, we waived the age requirement for
diagnosis as well as the requirement that ADHD symptoms must be present in at least two
environments (i.e., since it is not clear that symptoms need to be present in multiple
environments to diagnose S-ADHD; American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Therefore,
participants in the TBI group were included into the S-ADHD group if they reached DSM-
IV-TR criteria for ADHD (any subtype) on either the Conners 3 parent or teacher scale.
Participants
Control Group—Of the 66 youths initially recruited into the Control group, nine
participants cancelled or missed their appointments and 13 participants were excluded based
on clinically significant elevations on the Conners 3 rating scales. The final Control group
consisted of 44 participants (21 female, 23 male; mean age, 12.44 years).
TBI and S-ADHD groups—Inclusion criteria included the presence of a non-inflicted,
non-penetrating TBI at least one year but no more than six years prior to testing,
hospitalization for at least one night for the TBI, the absence of multiple head injuries, and
no pre-injury neurological disorders. Ten participants cancelled or missed their
appointments, and four participants were excluded due to the presence of a pre-injury P-
ADHD diagnosis. Nine participants without evidence of pre-injury P-ADHD met criteria for
ADHD (any subtype) on parent and/or teacher Conners 3 ratings of DSM-IV-TR ADHD
symptoms, and were included into the S-ADHD group (5 female, 4 male; mean age, 11.91
years). While the participant number of the S-ADHD group is relatively small, it does
represent the incidence of S-ADHD following childhood TBI (see Gerring et al., 1998; Max
et al., 2005a, 2005b). Forty participants without evidence of ADHD on the Conners 3
remained in the TBI group (16 female, 24 male; mean age, 11.8 years).
Severity of TBI was classified based on initial post-resuscitation Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS) scores (Teasdale & Jennet, 1974). For patients who did not require resuscitation, the
lowest GCS score on record was used. GCS scores separated participants into 3 severity
classifications: mild (TBI, n=28; S-ADHD, n=6), moderate (TBI, n=6; S-ADHD, n=2), and
severe (TBI, n=16; S-ADHD, n=1) injuries.
P-ADHD—Inclusion criteria included the diagnosis of ADHD from a health care
professional and a negative history for TBI. Two participants were excluded from further
analyses due to a lack of significant elevations on Conners 3, and 1 participant initially
recruited for the control group was included in the P-ADHD group based on significant
elevations on the same scale. The final P-ADHD group (n=19; 2 female, 17 male; mean age,
10.70 years) included 12 participants who were either drug naïve or were not currently
taking any psychotropic medication for their ADHD. The remaining participants were
currently undergoing pharmacological treatment (with two participants taking multiple

medications); these participants were asked to discontinue treatment for 24 hours prior to
testing.
Intelligence Testing
The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) was administered to all
participants. WASI scores were used to exclude any participant with a Full Scale IQ score
under 75.
Stop Signal Tasks
The stop signal task is based on a formal model that conceptualizes the ability to stop a
speeded motor response as the outcome of a race between response execution (“go”
processes) and response inhibition (“stop” processes; Logan & Cowan, 1984; Logan, 1994;
Verbruggen & Logan, 2008a); whichever process wins the race determines whether the
response with be executed or inhibited. The race model allows for the measurement of the
latency of inhibitory control (i.e., the SSRT), which is an unobservable, internally generated
act of control (Logan, 1994). Two versions of the stop signal task were used to measure
canceling (“cancellation”) and restraining (“restraint”) a prepotent response (see Figure 1;
Logan, 1994; Schachar et al., 2007). Both versions consisted of a primary visual choice
reaction time task involving a go signal and a secondary task involving a stop signal (Logan
& Cowan, 1984; Logan, 1994). In the primary task, one of two possible go signals (an X or
an O) was presented on a computer screen for 1000 milliseconds following a 500
millisecond fixation point. Participants were instructed to respond to these stimuli as quickly
as possible by making the appropriate button press on a handheld controller. They were also
instructed to inhibit their responses to the go signal when they heard the auditory stop signal
(a 1000 Hz tone emitted from computer speakers). The stop signal occurred randomly on
25% of trials.
In the cancellation version, the stop signal occurred at various delays following the go signal
to interrupt an already executed response. The delay between the presentation of the go and
the stop signal was varied dynamically in this version of the task to ensure that participants
would cancel their responses on 50% of the inhibition trials, regardless of whether or not
they slowed their go reaction time as a strategy to increase successful cancellation (Logan &
Cowan, 1984; Logan, 1994). The initial stop signal delay was set at 250 milliseconds. If a
participant successfully inhibited his/her response, then the delay was increased by 50
milliseconds on the subsequent stop trail, and if the participant was unable to inhibit his/her
response, then the delay was decreased by 50 milliseconds on the subsequent stop trial. This
method ensured approximate control over stop and go processes by increasing or decreasing
the ease of successful inhibition. In the restraint version of the task, the stop signal was
presented concurrently with the go signal to prevent a response from being executed
(Schachar et al., 2007). Thus, the delay between the presentation of the go and stop signals
in the restraint task was always zero.
The latency of inhibitory control on both versions of the stop signal task was estimated by
determining the SSRT via the integration procedure (Logan, 1994): the go reaction time in
non-stop signal trials were rank ordered, the go reaction time that corresponded to the
probability of inhibition was determined, and the SSRT was estimated by subtracting the
mean delay from the new “integrated go reaction time”. By utilizing this procedure, all
faster go reaction times that would have been executed and all slower responses that would
have been stopped can be excluded from the final SSRT metric (Schachar et al., 2007).
Each task version was performed under three different reward conditions presented in the
same ascending order of magnitude (NO, LOW, HIGH). In the neutral (NO) condition, the
Sinopoli et al.

words “Good work! Press a button to keep going” appeared in the middle of the screen. No
other specific feedback about task performance was revealed. Following the NO condition,
participants were informed that they would be performing the task for a second and third
time where they could win points for successful inhibition, and if they could win 400 points
by the end of the testing session, they would receive a prize (a $10 gift certificate for the
movies). They were also told that each time that they successfully inhibited their responses
they would win 2 points in the low reward condition (LOW), which would be followed by a
high reward condition (HIGH) where they would win 10 points. Points earned were
immediately represented on the screen in a visual analog scale (the scale was left empty in
the NO condition). Participants were informed of how many points they had won in each
block via a message in the middle of the screen (e.g. “You won 12 points.”). Participants
were also told that they would receive bonus points for pushing the buttons as quickly as
possible during the primary task. Although no actual bonus points were rewarded, this
additional instruction was given in order to reduce the tendency for participants to slow their
go reaction time to ensure successful inhibition, which would have invalidated the race
model (Logan, 1994). The points were recorded by the examiner, and total scores were
revealed at the end of the testing session. When 2 children did not win enough points for the
prize, their scores were bumped up to 400 via “bonus points” to ensure that all children won
the prize.
Each reward condition of the cancellation and restraint versions of the SST involved a total
of 120 trials divided into 5 blocks of 24 trials each, with the stop signal randomly occurring
on 30 trials. The first block in each task was a practice block, which was not utilized in
subsequent analyses. The reward conditions were always presented in the same ascending
order of magnitude (NO, LOW, HIGH) due to a concern that the LOW or NO conditions
could have been perceived as punishments if they followed presentation of the HIGH
condition, which may have confounded the effects of rewards on inhibitory control with the
effects of punishments, thus altering the main experimental manipulation.
The order of administration of each task version was counterbalanced, with the WASI and
another computerized task intervening.
Procedure
Informed consent was obtained prior to testing from each participant’s parent, and assent
was obtained from the participants themselves. All participants completed the WASI and
both stop signal tasks, with order of task administration being randomized across
participants. This experiment was conducted with approval of the Research Ethics Boards at
the Hospital for Sick Children and the University of Toronto.
Statistical Analyses
Participant data from the stop signal task was excluded from statistical analyses if any of the
following occurred: less than 66% accuracy on go trials, mean go reaction time (MRT) less
than 100 milliseconds, and for the cancellation version only, percent inhibition less than
12.5% or greater than 87.5 % (See Band, 1997; Band, van der Molen, & Logan, 2003;
Schachar, Levin, et al., 2004b; Verbruggen & Logan, 2008b). Based on these criteria, one
participant from the Control group, two from the TBI group, and one participant from the P-
ADHD group were excluded from analyses of the cancellation data, while one participant
from the Control group and one participant from the P-ADHD group were excluded from
analyses of the restraint data.
We examined both inhibitory control and response execution. Inhibitory control was
indexed by SSRT and by the percentage of responses inhibited (percent inhibition). Percent
Sinopoli et al.

inhibition can be considered a more appropriate measure of restraint inhibition compared to
the SSRT metric, as it provides information on the number of commission errors made on
the task (i.e., a greater percentage of responses inhibited means less commission errors).
Response execution was indexed by MRT, standard deviation of go reaction time (SDRT),
and percent correct on go trials (accuracy). SDRT allowed for a measurement of variability,
or the degree to which go responses were consistent across the tasks and reward conditions.
Age at injury, time since injury (for the TBI and S-ADHD groups only), age of assessment,
WASI scores, and SES were compared between groups using an analysis of variance
(ANOVA). These variables were also analyzed between severity groups (MILD,
MODERATE, SEVERE) using a similar procedure.
Group differences in performance on each task were compared separately for each
dependent variable (SSRT, percent inhibition, MRT, SDRT, and percent correct) utilizing
repeated measures ANOVAs, with reward condition (NO, LOW, HIGH) and task
(cancellation, restraint) as the within-subjects factors, and group (Control, TBI, S-ADHD, P-
ADHD) and order of task administration (cancellation administered first, cancellation
administered second) as between-subjects variables. Because inhibitory control improves
with age (e.g., Williams, Ponesse, Schachar, Logan, & Tannock, 1999), age at test was
added as a covariate in these analyses. We found significant differences between groups in
terms of SES (see Results), thus SES was also included as a covariate. The effect of TBI
severity on task performance was examined to ensure that injury-related variables were not
mediating any group or task effects. Thus, similar repeated measures ANOVAs were
conducted for each dependent variable with severity group (MILD, MODERATE,
SEVERE) as the between-subjects variable.
Linear regression analyses determined the impact of demographic and injury variables on
performance in the TBI and S-ADHD groups. GCS score, age at injury, time since injury,
and SES score were entered as potential predictors of inhibitory control performance.
Results
Participant Characteristics
Participant characteristics are presented in Table 1. Age at assessment was similar between
groups, and age of injury and time since injury did not differ between the TBI and S-ADHD
groups. Age at injury, time since injury, IQ scores, and SES did not differ between severity
groups. Although WASI scores differed between participant groups (F(3, 107)=4.244,
p=0.007, partial η2=0.106), mean IQ scores were within the normal range for all groups and
no participants were excluded based on low IQ scores. The Control group exhibited higher
SES scores relative to the other groups (F(3, 102)=6.797, p<0.001, partial η2=0.167), thus
SES was used as a covariate in subsequent analyses.
Stop Signal Tasks: Group and Reward Effects
SSRT—Participants in the Control group exhibited faster SSRT (F(3, 92)=3.374, p=0.022,
partial η2=0.099) relative to the TBI (p=0.032) and P-ADHD (p=0.003) groups (see Table
2). We found a reward by task interaction (linear effect, F(2, 184)=3.182, p=0.044, partial
η2=0.033): in the cancellation task, increasing reward magnitude decreased SSRT in a linear
fashion (NO vs. LOW vs. HIGH); in the restraint task, improvements in SSRT were
observed in the reward conditions (LOW and HIGH) compared to the neutral condition
(NO), but no differences were found between the reward conditions themselves. SSRT was
faster in the cancellation compared to the restraint task (linear effect, F(1, 92)=17.860,

p<0.001, partial η2=0.163). There was no significant effect of order, nor were there any
other significant interactions.
Percent Inhibition—In the cancellation task, percent inhibition was approximately 50%
across reward conditions and groups, indicating that the tracking algorithm was successful at
limiting the probability of inhibition to approximately 0.5 (see Table 2). There was no main
effect of group, but planned comparisons revealed a marginal difference between the P-
ADHD group compared to the Control group (p=0.058), with the P-ADHD group inhibiting
a smaller percentage of responses. There was no main effect of reward, although there was a
reward by task by order interaction (linear effect, F(2, 184)=6.475, p=0.002, partial
η2=0.066) revealing that if the cancellation task was administered first, participants inhibited
a greater percentage of responses in the NO and LOW conditions of the cancellation task.
As expected, a greater percentage of responses were inhibited in restraint compared to
cancellation (linear effect, F(1, 92)=16.837, p<0.001, partial η2=0.155). There were no other
significant interactions.
MRT—There were no main effects of group, reward, task, or order of task presentation on
MRT. There was a significant task by order interaction (linear effect, F(1, 92)=4.605,
p=0.035, partial η2=0.048; see Table 3), revealing that longer MRT was observed in the
cancellation task when it administered first. There were no other significant interactions.
SDRT—Participants in the Control group exhibited less variability of go responses (F(3,
92)=3.575, p=0.017, partial η2=0.104) compared to all other groups (TBI, p=0.027; S-
ADHD, p=0.038; P-ADHD, p=0.005; see Table 3). SDRT was not affected by reward.
When the cancellation task was administered first, there was greater variability in the
restraint task (task by order interaction; linear effect, F(1, 92)=10.016, p=0.002, partial
η2=0.098). There were no other significant interactions.
Percent Correct—There was a main effect of group (F(3, 92)=4.895, p=0.003, partial
η2=0.138), with greater accuracy on the go task observed in the Control (p<0.001) and TBI
(p=0.002) groups relative to the P-ADHD group (see Table 3). Reward did not affect the
accuracy of responses. There was, however, a task by order interaction (linear effect, F(1,
92)=22.280, p<0.001, partial η2=0.195) and a reward by task by order interaction (linear
effect, F(2, 184)=4.770, p=.010, partial η2=0.049). When the cancellation task was
administered first, a greater percentage of correct go responses on the cancellation task were
observed across all three reward conditions. In contrast, there was poorer accuracy on the
restraint task when the cancellation task was administered first, especially in the NO and
LOW conditions. There were no other significant interactions.
Injury Characteristics
Inhibitory Control Performance—There was no main effect of severity group on SSRT,
although there was a significant reward by severity group interaction (quadratic effect, F(4,
78)=2.877, p=0.028, partial η2=0.129) and a reward by task by severity group interaction
(quadratic effect, F(4, 78)=3.513, p=0.011, partial η2=0.153): faster SSRT in the MILD
group was observed during the HIGH condition relative to the NO condition, especially
during the cancellation task; and faster SSRT in the SEVERE group was observed during
the reward (LOW and HIGH) conditions relative to the neutral (NO) condition, especially
during the cancellation task. There was no effect of severity on percent inhibition.
“Go” Task Performance—There was no main effect of severity group on MRT,
although there was a significant reward by task by group by order interaction (linear effect,
F(4, 78)=4.696, p=0.002, partial η2=0.194). When the cancellation task was administered

first, participants in the MILD group exhibited faster MRT during the cancellation task in
the NO condition, while participants in the SEVERE group exhibited faster MRT in the NO
condition of the cancellation task and faster MRT in the HIGH condition of the restraint
task. The MODERATE severity group exhibited more variable go task performance (F(2,
39)=5.624, p=0.007, partial η2=0.224), especially during the cancellation task (task by group
interaction; linear effect, F(2, 30)=3.895, p=0.029, partial η2=0.166) and when the
cancellation task was administered second (task by group by order interaction; linear effect,
F(2, 78)=5.160, p=0.008, partial η2=0.117). Participants in the SEVERE group exhibited
better accuracy during the NO condition relative to the HIGH condition (reward by severity
interaction; linear effect, F(4, 78)=2.486, p=0.05, partial η2=0.113), but poorer accuracy
across all conditions when the cancellation task was administered first (reward by severity
by order interaction; linear effect, F(4, 78)=2.443, p=0.054, partial η2=0.111).
Regression Results: Cancellation—Age of injury significantly predicted MRT and
SDRT across reward conditions (see Table 4); younger age at injury resulted in slower and
more variable response execution in the neutral and reward conditions. A longer time since
injury was also associated with faster MRT in the NO and LOW conditions. Age of injury
and GCS score significantly predicted SSRT, but only in the HIGH condition (younger age
of injury and lower GCS scores, or more severe injuries, resulted in longer SSRT). Injury
variables were not significant predictors of accuracy on go trials or percent inhibition.
Regression Results: Restraint—Time since injury predicted MRT across reward
conditions (greater time since injury, faster response execution). Age of injury was a
significant predictor of MRT and SDRT performance across reward conditions (see Table
4), indicating that a younger age of injury results in slower and more variable response
execution. For the LOW condition only, GCS score was also a significant predictor of MRT
and SDRT, with participants with lower GCS scores (more severe injuries) exhibiting longer
and more variable response execution time on the go task. Age at injury predicted SSRT in
the LOW and HIGH conditions only, with longer SSRT observed in participants who had
incurred their TBIs at younger ages. Accuracy in the HIGH condition was also significantly
predicted by age at injury and time since injury, and individuals with an older age at injury
and a longer time since injury were more accurate on the go task. Injury variables did not
predict percent inhibition.
Discussion
The broadest objective of the present study was to investigate how reward affects
cancellation and restraint inhibition under comparable task demands in developmental (P-
ADHD) and acquired (S-ADHD) forms of attention disorders. In examining rewarded or
unrewarded cancellation and restraint in children and adolescents with TBI, S-ADHD, P-
ADHD, and typically developing controls, we aimed to delineate the inhibitory control
profile of the four groups. Consistent with previous research (e.g. Schachar et al., 2007;
Willcutt, Doyle, Nigg, Faraone, & Pennington, 2005), participants in the P-ADHD group
exhibited longer latencies to cancel and restrain their responses, inhibited fewer responses
on the restraint version, produced more variable responses to go stimuli, and were less
accurate in the cancellation go task relative to typically developing controls. In line our
hypotheses and with previous research (e.g., Max et al., 2005b), 18 % of participants in the
TBI group reached criteria for S-ADHD. This group of participants exhibited abnormal
cancellation inhibition, and greater variability in go responses. Injury-related variables, such
as age at injury, time since injury, and severity of injury did not mediate these group effects;
rather, these variables were either unrelated or inconsistently related to inhibitory control.
Reward selectively facilitated the speed of inhibitory control, but without significantly
altering response execution measures, and did so similarly across groups. The data bear on a

number of issues, but particularly how the P-ADHD and S-ADHD groups differ and
whether there are significant differences between children with TBI with and without
identifiable S-ADHD.
Group Effects
A direct comparison of the ADHD groups allowed us to determine whether or not P-ADHD
and S-ADHD share a similar cognitive-behavioral expression. Participants in the P-ADHD
group exhibited poorer inhibitory control relative to typically developing children, but the S-
ADHD group did not differ significantly from the Control group in terms of cancellation or
restraint inhibition. However, their performance on the cancellation task was intermediate
between the control, TBI, and P-ADHD groups. That is, they exhibited statistically similar
inhibitory control performance relative to the Control group, but they also did not differ
from the most impaired group, suggesting abnormal cancellation inhibitory control that is
not as severe as the impairment exhibited by children with P-ADHD. Schachar, Levin and
colleagues (2004) reported an inhibitory control deficit in children with S-ADHD and a
severe TBI relative to controls. Because only one participant in our S-ADHD group had
incurred a severe TBI, it remains unclear whether a group of children with more severe
injuries would exhibit poorer inhibitory control compared to those with less severe injuries
and/or those with P-ADHD.
Previous studies have shown that children with S-ADHD experience deficits in cancellation
inhibition relative to typically developing children, but similar SSRT relative to children
with only TBI (who were also impaired relative to controls; Konrad et al., 2000a, 2000b).
The Konrad et al. (2000a, 2000b) studies included children who had incurred their injuries 6
months to 6 years prior to testing, thereby including participants in the acute phase of injury
who might have experienced greater inhibition problems than those in the chronic phase of
injury (Leblanc et al., 2005). Rapid functional improvement occurs soon after a TBI,
especially in severe injuries, with more gradual recovery over the first few years post-TBI
(Yeates, 2000). Performance in our TBI and S-ADHD groups may represent some recovery
of inhibitory control abilities over time, which, to the extent that it occurred, would have
attenuated group differences.
Contrary to expectations, the TBI group, who were all in the chronic phase of recovery,
exhibited poor cancellation performance relative to Controls. Future studies are needed to
examine whether injury location, area, and/or volume may account for these differences.
Disrupted inhibition in P-ADHD may be related to abnormalities of frontostriatal circuitry
(e.g. Aron & Poldrack, 2005; Kieling, Goncalves, Tannock, & Castellanos, 2008) including
volume reductions and functional abnormalities in the basal ganglia (caudate nucleus and
globus pallidus) and parts of the prefrontal cortex (e.g., Castellanos et al., 1996; Durston et
al., 2004; Filipek et al., 1997; Rubia et al., 2010; Rubia et al., 1999; Seidman et al., 2006;
Sowell et al., 2003; Vaidya et al., 2005). Children with TBI, with and without S-ADHD,
who have lesions to the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia (especially the
striatum) would be expected to exhibit longer SSRT on the cancellation task without
significant deficits on the go trials (e.g., Aron, Fletcher, Bullmore, Sahakian, & Robbins,
2003; Chambers et al., 2007; Chevrier, Noseworthy, & Schachar, 2007; Rieger, Gauggel, &
Burmeister, 2003). Conversely, participants with damage to the dorsal aspects of the
prefrontal cortex, especially to the left side, may exhibit greater impairments with restraint
(Levin et al., 1993).
Both ADHD groups were more variable than controls in their responses to go stimuli,
implying that stability of response execution is disrupted to a similar degree in
developmental and acquired disorders of attention. The inconsistent pattern of responding in
the participants with P-ADHD is in line with a number of studies (e.g. Berwid et al., 2005;
Sinopoli et al.

Lijffijt, Kenemans, Verbaten, & Engeland, 2005; Schachar, Tannock, Marriott, & Logan,
1995), and may reflect problems in sustained attention and concentration, motor timing
(Rubia, et al., 1999; Rubia, et al., 2001; Rubia et al., 2003) and response regulation (Rubia,
Smith, & Taylor, 2007). Our study adds the new information that children with S-ADHD
have unstable response execution. The exact mechanism of this problem in the TBI groups is
unknown. Speed of response execution did not differ between the TBI and S-ADHD groups,
so slower cognitive processing (Kalff et al., 2005) and slower motor speed (Van Meel,
Oosterlaan, Heslenfeld, & Sergeant, 2005) can be excluded as possible mediators of group
differences in response variability (SDRT).
Reward effects
Increases in reward improved the latency to cancel and restrain a response in all groups.
This is consistent with our previous study that showed that increasing the reward magnitude
for successful inhibition improved cancellation and restraint in typically developing children
and adolescents (Sinopoli, Schachar, & Dennis, 2011). We extended that study by showing
that reward facilitated inhibitory control in children with TBI (with and without S-ADHD)
and those with P-ADHD, and showed that all groups benefited similarly from reward. That
reward did not affect the speed of response execution confirms that the reward effects on
SSRT are not merely a result of a general increase in the speed of information processing.
How reward facilitates inhibitory control is not known. Reward may interact directly with
the inhibitory control system, or act indirectly via a separate system that in turn influences
the relationship between reward and inhibition substrates (Padmala & Pesoa, 2010). As
elaborated elsewhere (Sinopoli et al., 2011), rewards may serve to increase arousal,
attention, the hedonic value associated with a response, learning about stimuli-response
associations, and/or the incentive salience of a stimulus associated with a response (see also
Berridge, 2007).
Given that reward facilitated inhibition in children and adolescents with TBI, the
mesolimbic dopamine system may be intact in the TBI and S-ADHD groups, or at least able
to interact adaptively with the inhibition system. Our findings are in line with previous
research that also showed the beneficial effects of rewards on inhibitory control performance
in TBI and S-ADHD groups (Konrad et al., 2000b), and with a study that showed that
increasing the magnitude of monetary incentives improved prospective memory in children
with mild or severe TBI (McCauley, McDaniel, Pedroza, Chapman, & Levin, 2009). In
neither the present study nor the Konrad et al. (2000b) or McCauley et al. (2009) studies is it
clear whether rewards stimulated greater allocation of specific cognitive resources to
increase proficiency, or whether reinforcement simply served to increase general arousal.
The former is likely to be more correct. Relative to the Control group, the TBI and S-ADHD
groups continued to exhibit greater variability in go responses in both stop signal tasks,
regardless of reward conditions. Furthermore, MRT was unaffected by reward in both
versions of the stop signal tasks, which indicates that reward did not generally increase
arousal.
By selectively rewarding successful inhibition and including a neutral, non-reward
condition, we avoided the methodological shortcomings of previous studies, and revealed
that rewards facilitated inhibitory control in the P-ADHD group across tasks (see also
Konrad et al., 2000b). These linear improvements in inhibitory control are consistent with
previous findings showing that increasing the value of reinforcement improves SSRT
(Slusarek, Velling, Bunk, & Eggers, 2001; Huang-Pollock et al., 2007), and also that
children with P-ADHD make advantageous decisions with high magnitude (Luman,
Oosterlaan, Knol, & Sergeant, 2008) or high frequency (Toplak, Jain, & Tannock, 2005)
reinforcement. Children with P-ADHD may use immediate rewards to motivate, decrease
distractibility, and focus attention (Sonuga-Barke, 2002). Here, high reward did not

normalize the stopping deficit exhibited by the P-ADHD group, so either the inhibitory
control deficit in P-ADHD is too profound for rewards to significantly improve it, or
children with ADHD, despite their preference for immediate incentive, have a higher than
normal reward threshold (Douglas, 1999; Haenlein & Caul, 1987; Quay, 1997). Each
hypothesis may account for the results, given both the lack of group interaction with reward
and the improvements in SSRT with reward.
Limitations
The order of task administration affected the accuracy of go responses and the percentage of
responses that were successfully inhibited, possibly reflecting participant fatigue or practice
effects as the testing session progressed. Our main findings, namely the group and reward
effects on SSRT, were not qualified by order effects, suggesting robustness in the results.
The S-ADHD group was identified on the basis of informant endorsement of clinically
significant ADHD symptoms that met DSM-IV-TR criteria for the disorder. It is not clear,
however, that individual psychiatric interviews would have improved the relation between
diagnosis and inhibitory control outcome (see Willcutt et al., 2005).
Following the procedure used in previous studies (e.g., Konrad et al., 2000a, 2000b;
Schachar, Levin, et al., 2004), we explored the presence of P-ADHD in the S-ADHD and
TBI groups during the initial recruitment interview by probing for the presence of pre-injury
DSM-IV-TR ADHD symptoms required for a diagnosis of P-ADHD. The number of
participants in the S-ADHD group was much smaller than the sample sizes of the other
participant groups. While a larger S-ADHD sample would have been welcome, our
prevalence rate for S-ADHD is exactly that reported in the literature for chronic-phase TBI
(18%; e.g., Gerring et al., 1998; Max et al., 2005b). In addressing the S-ADHD sample size,
we considered a number of adjustments, including subtracting cases from cells with greater
n until all cells were equal (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007) to equate group sizes. We decided
against this approach because artificially equalizing group sizes might have distorted group
differences and limited generalizability (given that the unequal n in the current study
represents actual population incidence of S-ADHD; Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Although
greater inhibitory control deficits may have been predicted in children with S-ADHD and
more severe injuries (see Schachar, Levin, et al., 2004), we could not explore this relation
further.
Conclusions
Developmental and acquired forms of ADHD have distinct inhibitory control deficits.
Children and adolescents with P-ADHD experienced greater difficulties with both
cancellation and restraint than those with S-ADHD, which is congruent with the idea that
poor inhibitory control is characteristic of children with a developmental form of P-ADHD
(Crosbie & Schachar, 2001), so that a longer SSRT may be a candidate endophenotype only
for this specific group of children (Crosbie et al., 2008). We did find, however, that the
SSRTs of the S-ADHD group were not different from those of the P-ADHD group, which
suggests that inhibition is not intact in children with S-ADHD and may represent a
phenocopy of the behaviour exhibited by children with the developmental form of the
disorder.
The data have some treatment implications. Stimulant medication ameliorates P-ADHD
symptoms and improves the latency of cancellation (reviewed in Dennis, Sinopoli, Fletcher,
& Schachar, 2008). Although stimulant effects on attention after childhood TBI are
attenuated and time-limited, children with TBI do exhibit greater improvements in cognition
relative to placebo (Jin & Schachar, 2004; Mahalick et al., 1998), so stimulants may have

some value in ameliorating the self-regulation difficulties in children with S-ADHD, and in
stabilizing their inconsistent pattern of responses. Current behavioral therapies for P-ADHD
utilize rewards and response costs to modify behaviour (Oosterlaan & Sergeant, 1998), and
the focus of behavioral therapy should be on training children with ADHD to achieve (and
maintain) an adequate motivational state to help reduce impulsivity, thus strengthening
inhibitory control and other regulatory processes (see Luman, Oosterlaan, & Sergeant,
2005). Our data suggests that children and adolescents with TBI and S-ADHD would also
benefit from similar behavioral interventions. Given the lack of group by reward interaction,
however, it seems unlikely that incentives would fully normalize this deficit. Children in the
Control group also benefited from rewards, with low levels of reward optimizing their
inhibitory processes.
More generally, our study exemplifies the recent call (Levy & Ebstein, 2008) for principled
and systematic comparisons of core cognitive phenotypes across disorders to inform
cognitive processes, putative brain mechanisms, and treatment planning. S-ADHD as a
result of childhood TBI results in inconsistent responding to go stimuli and inhibition
performance that is atypical and intermediate between that of typically developing
participants and a P-ADHD group. Unlike children with P-ADHD, children with S-ADHD
do not show significant difficulties with restraint inhibition, similar to children with TBI
without attention difficulties. Despite similarities in clinical manifestation, S-ADHD and P-
ADHD appear to have different cognitive-behavioral phenotypes.

Figure 1.
Cancellation and Restraint models of the stop signal task (with and without rewards). Trials
1 and 2 represent the primary task in both versions, where a go signal (X in Trial 1, O in
Trial 2) is presented following a fixation point. Participants were instructed to respond to
these stimuli as quickly as possible by making the appropriate button press on a handheld
controller. An inhibitory control trial is depicted in Trial 3. In the cancellation version (left
panel), the initial auditory stop signal was presented 250 milliseconds (ms) following onset
of the go signal. If a participant was able to successfully inhibit his/her response, then the
delay was increased by 50 ms on the subsequent stop trail to increase the level of difficulty,
but if the participant was unable to inhibit his/her response, then the delay was decreased by
50 ms on the subsequent stop trial to make cancellation easier. In the restraint version (right
panel), the stop signal was always presented at the same time as the go signal (the delay
between the onset of the go and stop signal was zero). In both versions of the task, the
feedback following the inhibition trials were identical: failed inhibition (i.e., going instead of
stopping or withholding) resulted in no feedback in the NO condition, and in a failure to win
points in the LOW and HIGH conditions; successful inhibition in the NO condition also
resulted in no feedback, but each successful inhibition in the LOW and HIGH conditions
resulted in the receipt of 2 or 10 points, respectively.
