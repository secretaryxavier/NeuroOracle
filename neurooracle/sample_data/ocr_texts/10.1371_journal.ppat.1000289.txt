Abstract
Phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM) are major virulence factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), in particular during the
early step of infection when bacilli encounter their host macrophages. However, their cellular and molecular mechanisms of
action remain unknown. Using Mtb mutants deleted for genes involved in DIM biosynthesis, we demonstrated that DIM
participate both in the receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb and the prevention of phagosomal acidification. The
effects of DIM required a state of the membrane fluidity as demonstrated by experiments conducted with cholesterol-
depleting drugs that abolished the differences in phagocytosis efficiency and phagosome acidification observed between
wild-type and mutant strains. The insertion of a new cholesterol-pyrene probe in living cells demonstrated that the polarity
of the membrane hydrophobic core changed upon contact with Mtb whereas the lateral diffusion of cholesterol was
unaffected. This effect was dependent on DIM and was consistent with the effect observed following DIM insertion in model
membrane. Therefore, we propose that DIM control the invasion of macrophages by Mtb by targeting lipid organisation in
the host membrane, thereby modifying its biophysical properties. The DIM-induced changes in lipid ordering favour the
efficiency of receptor-mediated phagocytosis of Mtb and contribute to the control of phagosomal pH driving bacilli in a
protective niche.

Introduction
The cell envelope of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) plays a major
role in the pathogenesis of this bacterium [1]. An interesting
feature of this envelope is its high lipid content, constituting up to
40% of the dry weight of mycobacteria [2]. One group of lipids,
phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM), has been studied intensively
since being shown to promote Mtb virulence. DIM are produced
by all members of the Mtb complex and a few other mycobacterial
species, most pathogenic in humans or animals. They are
produced by the combined action of fatty acid synthases and
polyketide synthases and in Mtb are composed of a mixture of
long-chain b-diols esterified by multimethyl-branched fatty acids
named mycocerosic acids [3]. They are found near the surface of
the bacilli [4] and are thought to be part of the mycobacterial
pseudo-outer membrane [1,5]. They play a role in cell wall
permeability [6] and many studies have implicated these molecules
in the pathogenicity of Mtb. Indeed, A DIM-less Mtb strain was
initially shown to display lower levels of replication and to elicit
fewer lung surface tubercles than a DIM-producing strain [7]. An
avirulent strain of Mtb coated with a mixture of DIM and
cholesteryl oleate persisted longer than the uncoated strain in the
spleen and lung of infected mice [8]. Consistent with these initial
observations, two independent signature-tagged transposon muta-
genesis studies have led to the isolation of Mtb mutants with a
severe growth defect in mice [9,10]. In some of these mutants, a
transposon was found to have inserted into a region of the genome
dedicated to the synthesis and transport of DIM, leading to a
defect in DIM production or translocation. These studies clearly
demonstrated the importance of DIM production for Mtb
pathogenicity. However, it remains unclear whether DIM mediate
pathogenesis indirectly by changing the cell wall envelope or
whether they act as effectors modifying host immune responses
and notably interfering with antimicrobial activity.
Recent studies have suggested that DIM play a role in
modulating the early immune responses of murine macrophages.
Rousseau et al. showed that DIM production in Mtb contributes to
the initial growth of the bacillus in mice by protecting it from the
nitric oxide-dependent killing of macrophages and modulates the
production of key inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa [11]. A
screening for mycobacterial mutants with defects in phagosomal
acidification or maturation arrest in macrophages identified
multiples genes including some involved in DIM synthesis
[12,13]. These studies, although small in number, suggest that
DIM are involved in modulating the immune responses of murine
macrophages, although the cellular and molecular mechanisms by
which DIM participate in the cross-talk between Mtb and
macrophages remain unclear.

The delivery of Mtb, and of particles in general, to the
phagosome and the initiation of bactericidal responses requires an
encounter with macrophages and ingestion through a receptor-
mediated, actin-dependent process called phagocytosis. Mycobac-
teria make use of the phagocytic machinery to gain access to the
interior of the macrophage where they subvert phagosome
maturation. At the interface between mycobacteria and macro-
phages, the complex outermost layer of the mycobacterial cell wall
probably plays a role in facilitating host cell entry. Some envelope
molecules tested in competition assays with bacteria or coated on
latex beads have been shown to interact with macrophage
phagocytic receptors. For instance, the mycobacterial lipoarabi-
nomannan and phosphatidylinositol mannosides bind to the
mannose receptor (MR) [14,15], one of the major receptors for
mycobacterial entry, via the glycosylated part of the molecule
[16,17]. Another important phagocytic receptor of macrophages,
the
complement
receptor
3,
CR3
[18],
recognizes
outer
mycobacterial capsular polysaccharides through its lectin site
[19] and phosphatidylinositol mannosides [20].
DIM are located in the outer layer of Mtb cell envelope and
therefore constitute potential candidates for modulating the initial
step of entry into macrophages and for controlling the outcome of
bacterial infection. We investigate the mechanism of action of
DIM during host cell infection. We demonstrated the involvement
of DIM in the receptor-dependent phagocytosis of Mtb through a
mechanism involving plasma membrane reorganisation after
bacteria recognition. This modification might enable Mtb to
create a protective niche, by preventing phagosome acidification.
Results
DIM deficiency affects macrophage infection
We
investigated
the
role
of
DIM
in
the
infection
of
macrophages derived from monocytes (MDMs) by Mtb in a
bacterial context by comparing the capacity of cells to take up the
parental strain H37Rv (WT) and the DIM-deficient H37Rv
mutant in which the ppsE gene has been deleted (PMM56,
Table 1). Culture MDMs were used to mimic the initial encounter
of bacilli with their host cells. The WT and mutant strains were
transformed with pMV361H gfp which carries a hygromycin
resistance cassette as the selection marker and a gfp gene for
fluorescence microscopy analysis. As shown in Figure 1A and 1B,
the DIM-less mutant infected fewer MDMs than did the WT,
whatever the multiplicity of infection (MOI 5 to 50) and the
duration of infection (60 or 180 minutes). After 1 h of infection,
the PMM56 mutant had infected about half as many macrophages
as H37Rv (Figure 1B). Analysis of the intracellular distribution of
bacteria indicated that most infected macrophages contained 6 to
10 H37Rv per cell, but only 1 to 2 PMM56 mutants (Figure 1C).
These preliminary observations suggest that DIM deficiency
impaired the capacity of Mtb to infect MDMs. The effect of this
deletion decreased slightly with increasing MOI or time of
infection. We therefore carried out all the subsequent experiments
at an MOI of 10 or 20 using an incubation time of 1 hour.
We investigated the poorly infectious phenotype associated with
DIM deficiency, and sought to confirm this phenotype using
various recombinant strains. An unmarked DIM-less mutant
derived from PMM56 was constructed by excision of the res-Vkm-
res cassette (Table 1). Like the parental strain PMM56, PMM100
was unable to synthesize DIM (Figure S1). The ppsE mutation was
then complemented by the transfer of pMVE allowing expression
of the ppsE gene (Table 1). As expected, this plasmid restored DIM
production (Figure S1). The capacity of the unmarked mutant and
the complemented strain to infect MDMs was then compared with
that of the WT strain and of the PMM56 mutant. As expected, the
marked and unmarked DIM-less mutants were similarly affected
in their capacity to infect MDMs whereas the genetic comple-
mentation of the ppsE mutation almost completely rescued the WT
phenotype (Table 2), indicating that the response was essentially
due to the gene deletion. We also constructed a mutant strain
derived from M. bovis BCG with the same ppsE mutation as the
PMM56 mutant (Table 1). We then analyzed the capacity of this
new M. bovis BCG mutant, named PMM50, to infect MDMs. We
found that the deletion of ppsE in M. bovis BCG abolished the
synthesis of DIM (Figure S1) and decreased the efficiency with
which bacteria infected MDMs (Table 2). The ppsE deletion also
decreased the rate of infection of PMA-differenciated THP-1 by
M. bovis BCG (Table 2).
Thus the ppsE mutation and the resulting DIM deficiency,
decrease the ability of M. tuberculosis complex strains to infect
macrophages.
DIM directly contribute to the initial step of macrophage
infection
As DIM were thought to be involved in mycobacterial cell
envelope organization, it was therefore hypothesized that their loss
might alter the surface properties of Mtb, thereby affecting the
macrophage invasion process. We investigated this issue by
purifying DIM from H37Rv and using them to coat the
PMM56 mutant or the WT strain. We then compared the
invasion efficiency of the coated and uncoated strains. Coating
with DIM had no significant effect on H37Rv uptake but allowed
the PMM56 mutant to infect macrophages as efficiently as the
parental strain (Figure 2).
We investigated whether this effect on phagocytosis was specific
to DIM or applied to all apolar lipids, by carrying out the same
experiment with triglycerides (TG). The coating of the PMM56
mutant with TG had no significant effect on bacterial internal-
ization (Figure 2). When used in excess, to compete with DIM for
coating of the PMM56 mutant, TG did not significantly prevent
the reversion of the mutant phenotype induced by DIM alone
(Figure 2). Thus, DIM seem to have a direct effect on the host cell
Author Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of
human tuberculosis, is an extremely successful human
pathogen. The pathogenesis of bacterium is associated with
its ability to invade macrophages and to circumvent
bactericidal functions of the host cell in order to survive
within a protective niche. The cellular mechanisms are
largely investigated but the bacterial factors are poorly
known. The outermost layer of the mycobacterial cell
envelope is particularly of interest because of its localization
at the interface with macrophages. An interesting feature of
this envelope is its high lipid content. One group of lipids,
the phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM), has been studied
intensively since being shown to promote Mtb virulence.
We investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
DIM and demonstrated that DIM participate in the receptor-
dependent phagocytosis of Mtb in human macrophages
through a mechanism involving a reorganization of the
plasma membrane following recognition of bacilli. This
modification of the plasma membrane biophysical proper-
ties might help Mtb to create a protective niche by
preventing acidification of its phagosome. Our results
provide a first hint on the molecular mechanism of action
of DIM, a key Mtb lipidic virulence factor.

rather than simply changing/altering bacterial cell wall organiza-
tion. In line of this hypothesis, the M. tuberculosis mutant, displaying
changes in envelope organization due to a mutation within the
mycoloyltransferase gene fbpC [21], was internalized to a similar
extent to the parental WT strain (data not shown). The data
provided evidence for a role of DIM in the initial step of
macrophage infection by Mtb.
DIM participate in the receptor-dependent phagocytosis
of Mtb
It is generally accepted that mycobacteria are taken up into
macrophages through a conventional phagocytic process [22] that
can be divided into two steps: i) the recognition and the adhesion
through binding to surface receptors and ii) the integration of
signaling pathways triggering local remodeling of the actin
cystoskeleton and leading to particle engulfment. We investigated
the possible role of DIM in the adhesion and/or the uptake of Mtb,
by placing MDMs in contact with H37Rv or the PMM56 mutant
and incubating for 30 minutes at 4uC to allow particles to bind,
whilst preventing phagocytosis. At the end of the incubation
period, non-adherent extracellular bacteria were eliminated by
washing the cells with fresh cold medium and bound bacilli were
detected
by
incubation
with
an
antibody
directed
against
mycobacteria. We counted the cells that had bound bacilli and
found that the WT and PMM56 strains adhered to macrophages
to a similar extent (1966 and 2367% binding, n = 3 at MOI 10)
regardless of the MOI used (Figure 3A).
We found that the uptake of both WT and PMM56 strains
required an intact actin filament network. Indeed, the prior
treatment of macrophages with cytochalasin, an actin-depolymer-
izing drug, inhibited the internalization of the WT and the
PMM56 strains in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal
effect at 2 mg/ml (8067% and 77612% inhibition, n = 3,
respectively) (Figure 3B).
Actin is also required for macropinocytosis, a mechanism by
which
mycobacteria
have
recently
been
shown
to
invade
macrophages [23] or non phagocytic cells, such as type II
(A549) human pneumocytes [24]. Following the infection of A549
cells for 2 hours at an MOI of 20 with the WT strain or the
PMM56 mutant, we found that both strains infected a similar
percentage of cells (5166% and 4967%, (n = 3), respectively).

Thus, the lower capacity for the mutant uptake is probably
restricted to macrophages (MDMs and PMA-differentiated THP-
1) strongly suggesting that DIM affect the receptor-dependent
phagocytosis of Mtb rather than macropinocytosis in human
macrophages.
We then investigated whether the absence of DIM specifically
affected the entry of H37Rv into human macrophages through a
particular receptor. The major receptors used by Mtb for the
invasion of MDMs are the complement receptor CR3 (CR3) and
the mannose receptor (MR) [14,18]. We assessed the uptake of the
WT strain or of the PMM56 mutant using blocking antibodies
raised against human CR3 or MR. We used a combination of two
blocking anti-CR3 Abs ICRF 44 and D12 [25,26] or the CD206
anti-MR mAb [27] or irrelevant mouse anti-human immunoglob-
ulins IgG1 and IgG2 as isotype controls. We tested various
dilutions of mAbs and efficiency was highest for 100 and 50 mg/ml
for ICRF44 and D12, respectively, with a 5068% decrease in
H37Rv internalization (Figure 3C), and for 2 mg/ml for anti-MR
mAb
resulting in a 35614% decrease
in H37Rv uptake
(Figure 3C). By contrast to the phagocytosis of the WT strain,
no inhibition of the PMM56 mutant was observed with any of the
blocking antibodies (Figure 3C). These results were extended to
phagocytosis via the opsonic receptor. Serum opsonization of the
WT strain or the PMM56 mutant increased the capacity of these
strains to infect macrophages, but phagocytosis of the opsonized
mutant remained less efficient than that of the opsonized WT
(Figure 3D), indicating that DIM deficiency also impaired the
activity of opsonic receptors.
These results demonstrate the need for DIM for the receptor-
dependent phagocytosis of Mtb by MDMs, targeting the uptake
rather than bacterial adhesion, and show that the effect of DIM
was not restricted to a specific receptor.
The role of DIM in Mtb phagocytosis required plasma
membrane cholesterol
Pioneering studies by Gatfield and Pieters [28] and Peyron et al.
[29] have proposed that mycobacteria enter phagocytic cells by a
cholesterol-dependent mechanism. As DIM did not act on a
specific receptor, we reasoned that DIM might work in concert
with plasma membrane cholesterol.
We tested this hypothesis by treating MDMs with a cholesterol-
depleting molecule, methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD). Following
treatment with various concentrations of the drug for 30 minutes,
the phagocytosis of H37Rv was found to be inhibited in a dose-
dependent manner (Figure 4Aa). A similar inhibitory profile was
obtained using a constant concentration of 10 mM MbCD but
with an increasing incubation time (Figure 4Ab). By contrast,
cholesterol depletion had no effect on internalization of the
PMM56 mutant (Figure 4A and 4B). Similar results were obtained
with another cholesterol-depleting drug, nystatin (Figure 4B).
None of these drugs had any significant effect on serum-opsonized
zymosan (Figure 4B), indicating the absence of a general effect on
phagocytic
functions
in
the
experimental
conditions
used.
Cholesterol depletion did not affect the binding of H37Rv or of
the PMM56 mutant (32611% and 37621% or 32611 and
3168% binding, n = 2, in the absence and the presence of the
drug, respectively). The involvement of DIM in H37Rv uptake
was therefore dependent on cholesterol. Consistent with this,
coating the PMM56 mutant with DIM restored the capacity of
MbCD to inhibit bacterial entry (Figure 4B).
Pathogenic mycobacteria have recently been shown to promote
the mobilization of cholesterol-enriched domains known as rafts,
within macrophages, to the site of contact between the bacilli and
the host cell [28,30]. We investigated the role of raft lipids in
H37Rv entry, by treating cells with a ganglioside GM1-binding
molecule, cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) [31], which crosslinks
GM1. The prior treatment of MDMs for 30 minutes with this

Mtb. MDMs were incubated for 60 minutes with strains at an MOI of 10:

with DIM or triglycerides (TG) or DIM with excess TG. Data are expressed
as a percentage infection with respect to the WT (H37Rv; 100%). The

the significance of difference between the WT strain and the mutant or

drug decreased the phagocytosis of H37Rv in a dose-dependent
manner, with a 2863% decrease observed at a concentration of
40 mM (Figure 4C). By contrast, the level of internalization of the
PMM56 mutant remained unchanged, or even slightly increased
(Figure 4C). The entry of H37Rv into MDMs therefore required
cholesterol and GM1 gangliosides whereas the uptake of the
PMM56 mutant did not. This suggested that DIM might be
involved in the use of lipid rafts by H37Rv to enter MDMs.
We examined the distribution of GM1 gangliosides at the cell
surface during the interaction with H37Rv, by placing MDMs in
contact with bacilli and incubating at 4uC for 30 minutes, and
then staining with Alexa-647 CTB for 1 hour at 4uC for 1 h.
Confocal microscopy showed that GM1 gangliosides were present
at the cell surface (Figure 5) and colocalized with adherent bacilli
(Figure 5A), indicating that accumulation of this fluorescent
marker could be detected. However, this colocalization was
sporadic and most of the bacilli did not associate with GM1
ganglioside-enriched domains (Figure 5B and 5C), even when
experiments were conducted at 37uC in conditions permissive for
phagocytosis (data not shown). Similar data were obtained with
filipin, a cholesterol-binding agent that displays blue fluorescence
following its intercalation into the cell membrane (data not shown).
Thus, if cholesterol or GM1 gangliosides are redistributed at WT
entry foci, this phenomenon was either scarce in MDMs or was
difficult to detect in our experimental conditions.
DIM play a role in the lower acidity levels of Mtb-
containing phagosomes
Our findings clearly indicated a role for DIM in the portal entry
of Mtb. We then investigated the contribution of DIM to control
the maturation of Mtb-containing phagosomes. It is generally
thought that phagosomes containing live pathogenic mycobacteria
are arrested at an early stage of maturation characterized by
incomplete luminal acidification [32]. We characterized phago-
somes containing H37Rv or the PMM56 mutant by investigating
the colocalization of these strains with LysoTracker Red, an
acidotropic dye acting as an indicator of phagosome pH [33].
MDMs were infected by incubation with H37Rv or the PMM56

mutant for 1 hour. They were then thoroughly washed with fresh
medium and analyzed at different time points after infection. We
found that 35% of H37Rv-containing phagosomes colocalized
with LysoTracker at 2 hours (Figure 6A). This fraction decreased
slightly to 25% at 24 h and remained constant thereafter over a
period of 192 hours. By contrast, a much higher percentage of
phagosomes containing the PMM56 mutant (63%, p = 0.01, n = 3)
colocalized with LysoTracker soon after infection (2 h; Figure 6A).
This percentage gradually decreased during phagosome matura-

containing heat-killed H37Rv, used as control for normal
phagosome-lysosome fusion (Figure 6A). Mean viability was 85%
for both the WT and the mutant strains. This may account for the
proportion of H37Rv accumulating the acidotropic dye but it
cannot account for the difference between H37Rv and the
PMM56 mutant. Genetic complementation of the ppsE mutation
restored the WT phenotype (Figure 6B). Phagosomal acidification
has been attributed principally to the activity of the vacuolar type
H+-ATPase (V-ATPase), which has been shown to accumulate in
the phagosomal membrane as it matures within the cell [34,35].
Using an antibody directed against the H+-ATPase [36], we
demonstrated that 20 to 30% of phagosomes containing H37Rv
accumulated
the
H+-ATPase
over
a
period
of
96 hours
(Figure 6C). In contrast, 80–90% of phagosomes containing
PMM56 colocalized with the H+-ATPase soon after infection
(Figure 6C). This percentage slightly decreased with the time of
phagosome maturation but remained twice higher than the
percentage of phagosomes containing the WT strain over 96 hours
post-infection (Figure 6C). These data are consistent with the
accumulation of LysoTracker in phagosome containing PMM56.
We then examined whether LysoTracker and H+-ATPase
accumulation in phagosome containing DIM-less mutant was
associated with a maturation of phagosome toward a fusion with
lysosomes, by analyzing the translocation of the membrane-
associated glycoprotein, CD63, used as a marker of lysosomal
compartment in human macrophages [37]. The fraction of
phagosomes containing H37Rv colocalizing with CD63 ranged
from 1563 to 2964% over a period of 192 hours, and no
difference was observed between the WT and the PMM56 mutant
(Figure 6D). Thus, the ppsE mutation drove a significant
percentage of H37Rv cells toward a compartment that transiently
accumulated LysoTracker in the first few hours after infection
without fusion with CD63 positive-lysosomes.
The number of bacteria per MDM were also quantified using
direct counting of fluorescent bacteria as described previously [38].
As depicted in Figure S2, no significant difference was found in the
growth curves of PMM56 and H37Rv within macrophages. These
data showed that DIM participate in the control of acidification of
phagosome containing H37Rv but DIM deficiency did not either
drive bacilli toward a lysosomal compartement or affected the
ability of M.tuberculosis to replicate in human macrophages.
We

process,

Cholesterol
depletion increased the percentage of colocalization between
LysoTracker and phagosomes containing H37Rv (Figure 6E),
indicating that cholesterol is required for the control of luminal pH
as recently reported [39]. By contrast, cholesterol depletion
decreased the colocalization of LysoTracker with phagosomes
containing the PMM56 mutant, to level similar to those for the
WT strain (Figure 6E). These findings suggest, as for phagocytosis,
that both DIM and cholesterol were important for the control of
phagosomal pH.
DIM decrease the polarity of the plasma membrane in
human macrophages
The previous findings demonstrated that DIM at the surface of
the Mtb envelope interfered with phagocytosis and blocked
phagosomal acidification in a cholesterol-dependent manner.
Cholesterol depleting drugs not only disrupt lipid rafts, they also
affect membrane fluidity [40]. Furthermore, the extraction of
membrane cholesterol destroys liquid cholesterol-phospholipid
complexes leaving solid-like-high melting point phospholipid
domains and inhibiting the lateral diffusion of membrane
components [41]. This suggested that the dynamic organization
of the plasma membrane might be involved in the DIM-dependent
phagocytosis of H37Rv. We therefore examined the effect of DIM
on some of the physical properties of the plasma membrane and
the molecular organization of its lipids, using the fluorescence
properties of Py-met-chol [42]. This new cholesterol-pyrene probe
combines the spectroscopic properties of pyrene as a sensor of the
polarity of the membrane hydrophobic core and the capacity to
mimic the lateral distribution of cholesterol. In model or biological
membranes, the fluorescence spectrum of the monomer species of
pyrene consists of five emission bands where I1 is a function of the
polarity of the probe’s surroundings and I3 is largely proportional
to probe concentration. The I1/I3 fluorescence ratio therefore
reflects the polarity of the membrane hydrophobic core [43] which
is mostly correlated with the number of water molecules passively
crossing the membrane [44]. Thus, changes in I1/I3 ratio reveal
changes in lipid organisation, with a decrease ratio corresponding
to a decrease in the permeability of membrane to water [45]. Py-
met-chol also diplays a characteristic wide fluorescence band
corresponding to the excimer species (IE) and the fluorescence IE/
I3 fluorescence ratio is directly related to the dynamic lateral
distribution of the probe in the membrane lipid network [46].
We first introduced Py-met-chol into the plasma membrane of
intact living PMA-differentiated THP-1, using a probe-loaded
MbCD, as previously described [42]. Under these conditions, no
cholesterol depletion was observed [42]. Figure 7A and 7B showed
a wide-field photomicrograph of probe-labelled cells and the
corresponding fluorescence spectrum of a cell suspension, for
which the IE/I3 ratio showed that about 1% of the Py-met-chol
was inserted into the plasma membrane [42]. We then monitored
the fluorescence spectra of Py-met-chol -loaded THP-1 brought
into contact with M. bovis BCG or the isogenic PMM50 mutant for
30 minutes at room temperature, to limit bacterial phagocytosis.
The interaction between THP-1 cells and M. bovis BCG resulted in
a significantly lower I1/I3 ratio than obtained with THP-1 cells
alone (Figure 7C). Thus, interactions between M. bovis BCG and
THP-1 cells induce a decrease in global membrane polarity.
Serum-opsonized
zymosan used

also
decreased I1/I3 ratio, but to a lesser extent than M. bovis BCG,
despite similar numbers of bound particles per cell and a similar
percentage of bound macrophages (data not shown). When the

decrease in I1/I3 ratio was significantly smaller than that obtained
with the WT strain (Figure 7C). This observation was not

restricted to PMM50 mutant, because another isogenic strain with
a mutation in the ppsB gene displayed a similar decrease in I1/I3
ratio (Figure 7C). By contrast, a mutant harbouring a Dpks15/
1::res-Vkm-res mutation, which has been shown to affect PGL
synthesis without modifying DIM production [47], behaved like
the WT strain. These findings demonstrate that DIM contributed
to a decrease of the mean membrane polarity of THP-1 cells
during interactions with M.bovis BCG. IE/I3 ratios did not differ
between sets of conditions (data not shown), demonstrating an
absence of dynamic reorganisation of Py-met-chol in the lipid
phase of the plasma membrane during binding.
We got further insight into the mechanism by which DIM
influence the polarity of the core of the plasma membrane, by
incorporating DIM into model membranes (LUVs) containing
1 mol% of Py-met-chol. We chose DPPC as the main lipid as it
gave optimal solubility of both DIM and probe, thanks to its fully
saturated acyl-chains and length. We tested the incorporation of
DIM into each sample, by carrying out dynamic light scattering
measurements to detect small particles corresponding to aggre-
gates. We found that the maximum solubility of DIM in DPPC
was below 15 mol % (% mol/mol) (data not shown). We then
carried out measurements of I1/I3 and IE/I3 (Figure 8) ratios of Py-
met-chol as a function of DIM mole fraction (from 0 to 11.75 mol
%) in fluid state LUVs. Once DIM were incorporated into LUVs,
I1/I3 ratios decreased below those of LUVs without DIM and
eventually reached a plateau as suggested by the error bars in
Figure 8A. Thus, DIM insertion decreases the polarity of the
bilayer core reflecting changes in the dynamic structure of the
membrane. At the same time, IE/I3 ratio was considerably
increased by the addition of small amount of DIM (Figure 8B).
This addition resulted in confinement of the probe, inducing an
increase in its apparent concentration, possibly due to the DIM-
dependent recruitment of Py-met-chol into small domains. The
increase in the amount of DIM from 5 to 11.75 mol % had no
further effect on IE/I3 ratio (Figure 8B), indicating that DIM did
not recruit /gather more cholesterol probes. This last observation
seems to conflict with the data obtained in living cells. However,
the plasma membrane has a mean cholesterol content of 30%,
suggesting the dilution of Py-met-chol within the native cholester-
ol, making its lateral segregation more difficult to observe.
Taken together, these results showed that during the binding
process, the presence of DIM at the mycobacterial cell surface
induces the reorganisation of the host cell plasma membrane,
probably through insertion into the membrane. This event led to a
change in membrane properties and a more rigid (less polar and
tighter) bilayer.
Discussion
This work provides the first insight into a possible mechanism of
action of DIM in Mtb pathogenesis. We demonstrated ex-vivo that
DIM act in the initial cross-talk between human macrophages and
Mtb. Our results strongly support a model in which contact of Mtb
with phagocytes is followed by the insertion of DIM into the
plasma
membrane
of
the
host,
modifying
the
biophysical
properties of this membrane. This modification increases the
efficiency of receptor-mediated phagocytosis and affects phago-
some acidification thereby facilitating the access of the pathogen to
its ecological niche.

These conclusions were drawn from comparative studies of
macrophage infection in a bacterial context using WT and mutant
strains. These mutants harbour an insertion/deletion within the
ppsE gene which encodes a protein essential for DIM biosynthesis
[48]. The mutant phenotypes were attributed to the gene deletion
and loss of DIM, because reversion to the WT phenotype was
observed following genetic complementation of the mutation with
an intact ppsE gene or chemical complementation with purified
DIM. There are several lines of evidence to suggest that DIM play
a direct role in the observed phenotypes rather than having an
indirect effect through changes to the structural organization of
the Mtb envelope. First, DIM are found at the mycobacterial cell
surface, in an ideal location for direct interaction with the host cell
[4]. Second, coating the PMM56 mutant with purified DIM
restored the capacity of the bacteria to infect MDMs to WT levels.
This phenotypic reversion would not have been observed if DIM
acted indirectly by affecting mycobacterial membrane organiza-
tion or the anchoring of other effector molecules. Third, we
demonstrated that DIM inserted into model membranes in vitro
modify the biophysical properties of this membrane in a similar
manner to that observed with live bacteria and host cells.
Our results are consistent with a model in which the presence of
DIM in the mycobacterial cell envelope directly interferes with
host cell membrane functions. Other examples of the loss of cell
surface molecules resulting in changes in the interaction between
mycobacteria and host cells have been reported. For instance, the
mechanical or enzymatic removal of capsular polysaccharides
decreases Mtb binding to CHO cells expressing CR3 [19].
Disruption of the Mtb surface capsule by sonication significantly
increases association with macrophages [49]. Diacyltrehaloses
(DAT) and polyacyltrehaloses (PAT) deficiencies increase the
efficiency of Mtb binding to phagocytic and non phagocytic cells
[50]. This last observation was attributed to changes in the surface
properties of DAT/PAT-deficient mutants including composition-
al changes and changes in net charges/hydrophobicity [50].
However, we reported herein that DIM deficiency did not affect
binding to human macrophages. Instead, it interfered with a
downstream event, receptor-mediated internalization. Indeed,
prior treatment of the cells with blocking antibodies directed
against CR3 or MR reduced WT strain uptake without affecting
internalisation of the DIM-deficient mutant, indicating that the
PMM56 mutant used another entry route. Similarly, prior
incubation of PMM56 with serum did not induce a reversion of
the rate of internalization to that observed with serum opsonized
WT strain. We propose that this effect of DIM is mediated by
direct modification of the host cell plasma membrane. Indeed, we
demonstrated that changes in the composition of the MDMs
plasma membrane induced by cholesterol depletion with MbCD
or nystatin affected Mtb phagocytosis and phagosome acidification
in a similar way to DIM elimination from the Mtb envelope. We
also demonstrated the involvement of DIM in the decrease in
plasma membrane core polarity following the binding of live
mycobacteria. Consistent with these data for living cells, the
incorporation of purified DIM into model membranes (LUVs)
containing Py-met-chol decreased bilayer core polarity. The
transfer of DIM from the Mtb cell envelope to the host cell
membrane is also consistent with the finding of Beatty et al. [51]
who showed that the mycoside B, a lipid from M. bovis BCG
containing the same lipid core as DIM, was released from bacteria
during the infection process and transported into various host cell
organelles.
We characterized the DIM-dependent internalization of Mtb
into macrophages by demonstrating that the more efficient uptake
of WT strains than of DIM-less mutants seemed to be exclusively
mediated by a receptor-dependent phagocytosis. Our data for
experiments performed in the presence of cytochalasin indicated
that both strains were internalized via an actin-dependent process.
The actin-dependent mechanisms by which Mtb might be taken up
into macrophages include macropinocytosis [24]. H37Rv was
efficiently taken up by type II human pneumocytes, but the WT
and the DIM-less mutants infected them to the same extent,
suggesting that DIM enhance a receptor dependent phagocytic
process in human macrophages. It remains unclear whether the
entry process used influences the fate of the mycobacteria. We
have previously demonstrated that the route of entry by which the
mycobacteria invade macrophages favour their uptake in hospital
conditions [52]. Consistent with this notion, we have observed that
the absence of DIM in the envelope of H37Rv drove bacteria into
phagosomes that accumulated an acidotropic dye early in
infection. Our results are consistent with those of a previous
study, in which a mutant lacking a DIM biosynthesis gene was
unable

defective in the arrest of phagosome maturation in murine
macrophages [13]. The presence of DIM is required but not
sufficient because we found that heat-killed bacteria which
contained DIM accumulated in acidified compartment. These
results imply that modulation of phagosome maturation is likely a
multifactorial process that is mediated by other components in
addition to DIM. Consistently, Stewart et al and Pethe et al
identified multiple genes involved in mycobacterial control of early
acidification of phagosomes [12,13]. Further studies of the role of
DIM in the arrest of phagosomes containing Mtb are required,
because our data also indicate that both WT and mutant
accumulated in a phagosome with low levels of expression of the
lysosomal marker, CD63. Consistently DIM deficiency did not
affect the ability of M.tuberculosis to replicate in human macro-
phages, as previously observed in murine macrophages [11]. It is
therefore tempting to speculate that the presence of DIM at the
surface of Mtb allows the preferential engagement of the portal of
entry so as to participate in the early step of bacterial protection,
possibly in collaboration with other components of M.tuberculosis.
Our results confirm that plasma membrane cholesterol is
involved in bacterial entry and that plasma membrane cholesterol
concentration is critical for the role of DIM in the phagocytosis of
Mtb. Cholesterol is an integral constituent of lipid rafts which are
thought to provide a entry portal for Mtb in murine macrophages
[28]. For comparison, we studied the effect of the ganglioside
GM1-binding molecule, CTB. The treatment of macrophages
with this drug significantly decreased infection by H37Rv WT
whereas no effect was observed on infection by a DIM-deficient
mutant.
However,
investigation
of
the
plasma
membrane
distribution of ganglioside GM1 or cholesterol by a fluorescence
approach showed the occasional accumulation of a fluorescence
signal at the site of impact of WT strains. Consistently, no Py-met-
chol clustering was detected during the binding of bacteria to
living cells. Mtb therefore seems to use lipid domains as rafts in
human macrophages through a mechanism at least partly
dependent on the presence of DIM at the surface of the bacillus
but not involving the massive relocation and accumulation of
gangliosides GM1 or cholesterol at the site of bacterial uptake, as
previously reported in murine macrophages [28].
The mechanism by which DIM disturb plasma membrane and
affect Mtb uptake remains unclear. DIM-dependent membrane
alterations probably result from nonspecific lipid-lipid interaction
rather than from the recognition of a specific molecular structure.
As highlighted by Rhoades and Ullrich, the hydrophobic nature of
mycobacterial lipids allows them to insert into the host lipid
membrane [53]. Physical interaction studies have suggested that
trehalose dimycolate (TDM) and glycopeptidolipide (GPL) insert
into model membranes, such as liposomes, phospholipid mono-
layers and purified membranes of mitochondria [54–56]. This
insertion may disturb the lipid composition of host membranes
thereby altering their physical properties. In particular, these
mycobacterial glycolipids have been shown to decrease the fluidity
of membrane liposomes [54], as reported here for DIM. It remains
unclear how DIM present in the envelope of M.bovis BCG or Mtb
insert into the plasma membrane. Similarly, the relationship
between DIM-induced changes in membrane organization and
Mtb uptake are unknown. Changes in membrane lipid composi-
tion/organization are generally thought to affect a number of cell
functions [40]. Only a few reports have described a clear
association between the insertion of mycobacterial lipids and
changes in plasma membrane functions. In particular, the
insertion of TDM and GPL into membranes has been associated
with the disruption of respiration and oxidative phosphorylation
functions in isolated mitochondria [54,56]. We showed that
physical changes of the plasma membrane induced by cholesterol
depleting drug drove bacteria toward a more-acidic compartment,
as did DIM deficiency. Further studies are required to determine
whether the effect of DIM on the control of phagosomal pH is a
consequence of the initial reorganization of the plasma membrane
described above. The fatty acid composition [57] and the
incorporation of palmitic and oleic acid into macrophage
membranes [58] have been shown to modify phagocytosis
probably by inducing changes in conformation of certain proteins,
including receptor [40]. We found that changes in the lipid
organization of the plasma membrane induced by DIM altered the
uptake of H37Rv, but not its binding. This suggests that the
physical membrane effect of DIM preferentially affects the
signalling pathway of phagocytic receptors rather than the
recognition or binding of their ligands. These points remain
unclear and are currently under investigation in our laboratory.

Mouse monoclonal antibodies (Abs) raised against CD11b
extracellular domain ICRF 44 and D12 (1:10; IgG1 and IgG2a)
and mouse anti-human Ab against the mannose receptor CD206
(1:100; IgG1) were obtained from BD Biosciences (San Jose, USA).
Mouse monoclonal Ab against human CD63 was obtained from
Caltag Laboratories (Burlingame, USA). Rabbit polyclonal anti-
serum against H+-ATPase proton pump was from Synaptic
Systems (Go¨ttingen, Germany). Irrelevant IgG1 and IgG2 were
purchased from DakoCytomation (Glostrup, Denmark) and BD
Biosciences, respectively. Anti-mycobacterium rabbit Ab was
obtained as previously described [59]. Secondary Abs, Lyso-
Tracker Red DND-99 and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated cholera
toxin subunit B (Alexa-647 CTB) were purchased from Molecular
Probes (Eugene, USA). 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocho-
line (DPPC) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster,
USA). Py-met-chol was synthesized as previously described [42].
The purity of phospholipids and Py-met-chol was confirmed by
thin-layer chromatography on silica gel (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) using chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v) as
the solvent. For detections, we used Dittmer’s reagent for DPPC
[60] with heating to detect Py-met-chol. Lipids, dissolved in
chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v) were stored at 4uC before use.
The concentrations of phospholipid solutions were determined by
a gravimetric approach using a Sartorius (Goettingen, Germany)
super microbalance (1027 g). Water was purified with a Milli-Q
system (Millipore, Bedford, USA). All other chemicals were
obtained from Sigma Chemical Co (USA).
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
M. tuberculosis H37Rv (sequenced strain) and M. bovis BCG
1173P2 (Pasteur strain) were grown at 37uC on Middlebroock
7H9 broth (InVitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) supplemented
with ADC (Becton Dickinson, Co, Sparks, USA). The strains were
grown to mid-exponential growth phase and centrifuged at
1.0006g for 10 minutes at room temperature in a Jouan CR412
centrifuge with a T4 swing out rotor. Bacteria were then isolated
as previously described [59]. Briefly, the medium was discarded,
bacteria were dispersed by shaking for 1 minute with glass beads
(4 mm
diameter),
and
resuspended
in
PBS,
pH 7.4.
The
remaining clumps were removed by allowing the bacterial
suspensions to sediment for 10 minutes and centrifuging the
supernatant for 10 minutes at 2006g. Bacteria were then counted
under a microscope in a Thoma chamber and plated on 7H11
plates to establish more precise counts. When specified, bacilli

were
prepared by treating bacilli with solvent alone or with 0.05%
triglycerides in 100 ml of petroleum ether. The solvent was
evaporated off and the bacteria were resuspended in PBS.
Petroleum ether-treated H37Rv were as viable [62] and as
capable to infect macrophages as the untreated strain (data not
shown). Heat-killed H37Rv, used as a positive control for
localization with acidic compartments in some experiments, were
prepared by heating 56107 bacteria in PBS at 96uC for 1 h.
Mycobacteria and zymosan were opsonised with human AB serum
as previously described [59]. Suspensions of bacteria were then
supplemented with 5% glycerol and stored at 280uC. For
macrophage infection, bacteria were quickly thawed, vortexed
and their titer adjusted to the required level in cell medium
culture. Up to 85% of mycobacteria were free and identifiable,
and their viability averaged 85%, as determined by the BacLight
bacterial viability assay.
Construction of recombinant M. tuberculosis H37Rv and
M. bovis BCG strains
The M. tuberculosis H37Rv DppsE::res-Vkm-res mutant (also
named PMM56) was constructed in a previous study [48] by
insertion/deletion within the ppsE gene which encodes a polyke-
tide synthase required for the formation of the b-diol chain
(Table 1). The corresponding M. bovis BCG DppsE::res-Vkm-res
(named PMM50) was constructed by the same method using the
recombinant mycobacteriophage phWM01 [48].
For construction of the M. bovis BCG DppsB mutant, we used the
strategy described by Bardarov et al. [63]. Two DNA fragments
(0.91 kb and 0.90 kb in length) overlapping the ppsB gene at its 59
and 39 extremities were amplified by PCR from M. bovis BCG
genomic DNA by using primers ppsB1+ppsB2 and ppsB5+ppsB6,
respectively (Table 1). The PCR was performed in a final volume
of 50 ml containing 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA), 10% Me2SO, and 1 mM of each
primer. The amplification program consisted of heating for
10 minutes at 95uC followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 95uC,
1 minute at 55uC and 3 minutes 30 s at 72uC with a final
extension phase of 10 minutes at 72uC. These fragments were
inserted into plasmid pGEM-T and a res-Vkm-res resistance
cassette was inserted between these two PCR fragments to give
pWM65. The PmeI fragment from pWM65, which contains the
disrupted ppsB::res-Vkm-res gene was then inserted into the cosmid
vector pYUB854 [63]. The resulting cosmid was cut with PacI and
ligated
with
the
mycobacteriophage
phAE87.
The
ligation
products were encapsidated in vitro using the Gigapack III XL
kit (Stratagene) and the ligation mixture was used to infect E. coli
HB101. Transfectants were selected on LB plates containing Km.
A recombinant phagemid, named phWM07, harboring the
disrupted
gene
construct
was
selected
and
transferred
by
electroporation into M. smegmatis for preparation of phage particles
[63]. These particles were then used to infect M. bovis BCG and
allelic exchange mutants were selected on 7H11 agar plates
supplemented with OADC and Km. Several clones were analyzed
by PCR using various primers (res1, res2, ppsB7, ppsB8, ppsB9,
ppsB10) (Table 1) and one clone, named PMM92, giving an
amplification pattern corresponding to allelic exchange was
selected.
The km cassette was recovered by transferring the plasmid
pWM19 containing the resolvase gene of transposon cd into
PMM92 [64]. The PMM92:pWM19 transformation mixture was
resuspended in 5 ml of 7H9 containing ADC and incubated for
48 h at 32uC. Transformants were selected directly in the liquid
medium by adding hygromycin to the transformation mixture and
incubating the culture at 32uC for 12 days. Viable bacteria were
then recovered by plating serial dilutions on 7H11 plates without
antibiotics and incubating at 39uC, a non permissive temperature
for pWM19 replication. Several colonies picked randomly were
then tested for growth on Km-containing plates. Colonies that
were unable to grow on Km-containing plates but able to grow on
antibiotic-free plates were selected and analyzed by PCR, using
primers res1, res2, ppsB7, ppsB8, ppsB9 and ppsB10 (Table 1).
One clone, PMM97, with an amplification pattern consistent with
excision of the km cassette was retained for further analysis.
For complementation of the PMM100 mutant, we first
recovered the antibiotic resistance cassette as decribed above.
Four clones sensitive to kanamycin were analyzed by PCR using
primers res1+ppsE4, res2+ppsE3, ppsE3+ppsE4 and conditions
described in Simeone et al [48]. One clone displaying an
amplification pattern consistent with excision of the res-Vkm-res
cassette was retained for further analysis and named PMM100 or
H37Rv DppsE::res.
We constructed the plasmid pMVE as follows: the ppsE gene
was amplified by PCR from M. bovis BCG genomic DNA, using
oligonucleotides ppsE-ATG and ppsE-Stop (Table 1). The PCR
product was purified, digested with NdeI and HindIII and inserted
between the NdeI and HindIII sites of pMV361eHyg, a pMV361
derivative harboring the pBlaF* promoter from pMIP12 instead of
the original phsp60 promoter and carrying a hyg resistance marker
[65,66]. We used the plasmid pMVE for the electrotransformation
of PMM100. Transformants were selected on plates containing
kanamycin.
The lipids produced by the various recombinant strains were
analyzed. We found that PMM56 and PMM100 did not
synthesized DIM, whereas PMM100:pMVE synthesized similar
amounts of DIM to the wild type-strain, H37Rv (Figure S1).
Similarly, the PMM50 and PMM97 strains synthesized no DIM
and no PGL (data not shown).
The various M. tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG recombinant and
wild-type strains were rendered fluorescent by the transfer of
plasmid pMV361H gfp or pCG211. The plasmid pMV361H gfp
was derived from the plasmid pMV361 [65] by the insertion of an
hygromycin resistance cassette and the gfp gene. In this construct,
gfp expression is under the control of the mycobacterial promoter
phsp60. Plasmid pCG211 was constructed by insertion of the gfp
gene between the BamHI and SpeI sites of plasmid pMIP12 [66].
The gfp gene was amplified from plasmid pMV361H gfp using
primers gfp1 and gfp2.
Cell culture
Human blood samples, obtained from the Etablissement
Franc¸ais du Sang of Toulouse (France), were collected from non
tuberculous control donors. Peripheral blood monocytes were
isolated as previously described [52] and cultured for 7 days on
sterile glass coverslips in 24-well tissue culture plates (56105 cells/
well) containing RPMI 1640 (Gibco, Cergy Pontoise, France)
supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Gibco) and 7% heat
inactivated human AB serum. The culture medium was renewed
on the third day. Macrophages derived from monocytes (MDMs)
were washed twice with fresh RPMI medium before use.
The human promonocytic cell line THP-1 (ECACC 88081201;
Salisbury, UK) was maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
2 mM glutamine and 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum
(FBS) at 37uC under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. For
differentiation into macrophages, cells were plated into 24 or 6-
wells tissue culture plates (26105 and 106 cells/well, respectively)

containing a sterile glass coverslip and treated with 20 nM PMA
for 48 h. Before use, cells were washed twice with fresh medium.
Cell infection and phagocytosis assay
Infection of macrophages and phagocytosis were assessed, as
previously described [52]. Briefly, macrophages were infected with
GFP-expressing mycobacteria at the appropriate multiplicity of
infection (MOI) in RPMI 1640. Infection was allowed to proceed
at 4uC for binding or 37uC for uptake, and the extracellular
bacteria were removed by 3 successive washes with fresh medium.
Where specified, macrophages were initially treated with drugs for
30 minutes at 37uC, washed with fresh medium and infected with
mycobacteria.
The
effects
of
drugs
on
cell
viability
and
morphology were assessed by Trypan blue exclusion and light
microscopy. At the end of the infection period, the cells were fixed
for 1 h at room temperature with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS
supplemented with 15 mM sucrose, and aldehyde groups were
neutralized with 50 mM NH4Cl. The cells were then rinsed in
PBS, and extracellular mycobacteria were stained with rabbit anti-
mycobacterium Ab (1:50) which was detected by a Rhodamine
Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary Ab. As the cells were
not permeabilized, immunostained extracellular mycobacteria
displayed red and green fluorescence and intracellular bacteria
appeared
as
green
fluorescent
particles.
Preparations
were
vizualized under a Leica DM-RB epifluorescence microscope to
count and calculate (i) the number of bacteria per macrophages
and (ii) the percentage of cells binding bacteria (% binding) or
ingesting at least one particle (% internalization or phagocytosis).
Where specified, data are also expressed as relative values,
calculated as the percentage of internalisation or phagocytosis
divided by control values. For each set of conditions, duplicate
experiments were performed, and at least 100 cells per slide were
counted.
Colocalization experiments with Lysotracker, H+-ATPase,
or CD63
Macrophages were infected with mycobacteria at an MOI of 10
for 1 h in RPMI 1640 at 37uC. Cells were then thoroughly washed
and incubated with fresh RPMI 1640 supplemented with 7%
human serum at 37uC under an atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
We
assessed
LysoTracker
Red
colocalization,
by
washing
macrophages at different time points after infection and incubating
them with the acidotropic dye (1:2000) in RPMI 1640 for 1 h.
Cells were then rinsed, fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 1 h,
washed and mounted on slides with DAKO mounting medium.
For H+-ATPase or CD63 analysis, macrophages were fixed as
described above, permeabilized by incubation with 0.3% Triton
X-100 for 10 minutes at room temperature (RT), blocked by
incubation with 0.3% BSA and incubated with rabbit polyclonal
antiserum against H+-ATPase (1/100) or mouse anti-CD63 Ab
(1:100) for 1 h at RT, revealed with Rhodamine-Red conjugated
goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse Ab, washed and mounted on slides.
Coverslips were viewed with a Leica DM-RB fluorescence
microscope or a Leica TCS-SP2 confocal scanning microscope.
All images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software. The
fraction of phagosomes with GFP fluorescence colocalized with
markers was determined by counting 100 phagosomes from at
least 10 different fields in duplicate in at least three independent
experiments for each time point.
Staining of GM1 gangliosides
Macrophages were placed in contact with bacilli for 30 minutes
at 4uC, washed with fresh medium and incubated with 50 mg/ml
Alexa-647 conjugated CTB for 1 h at 4uC. Cells were then
thoroughly washed, fixed by incubation in 3.7% paraformalde-
hyde, and visualized under a confocal scanning microscope.
Labelling mixture preparation
MbCD was dissolved in water (683 mg in 7 ml) and heated to
70uC with shaking. A 1:60 molar ratio (Py-met-chol/MbCD) was
obtained by slowly adding 68 ml of a solution of Py-met-chol in
dimethylformamide
(138 mM).
This
solution
was
sterilized
through filter with 0.22-mm pores and stored for period of up to
several weeks at 4uC. The incubation medium consisted of 1 ml of
this solution diluted (1:30, v/v) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
without Ca2+/Mg2+. The final concentration of dimethylforma-
mide was less than 0.05%. The final concentration of MbCD was
2.5 mM.
Cell labelling
PMA-differentiated THP-1 plated in 6-well tissue culture plates
(106 cells/well) were washed twice with PBS without Ca2+/Mg2+
and incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes with 1 ml Py-
met-chol/MbCD solution diluted 1/30. Cells were thoroughly
rinsed with fresh PBS and then vigorously flushed with 1 ml PBS
containing CaCl2 and MgCl2, resuspended at a final concentration
of 56105 cells/ml and placed in contact with particles for
30 minutes at RT.
Fluorescence spectroscopy
Emission spectra were recorded on a QuantaMaster-4 spectro-
fluorimeter (Photon Technology International, Birmingham, NJ)
monitored with FeliX32 software. The excitation wavelength
(bandwidth 5 nm) was set at 330 nm to avoid measurement of the
Raman peak of water. The fluorescence emission (bandwidth
1 nm) was measured from 370 to 480 nm in 0.5-nm increments.
The signal integration time was set to 200 ms. Fluorescence
spectra were recorded in 1-cm quartz cuvettes in which the
temperature was maintained at 45uC with a thermostat (Fisher
Bioblock Scientific) for LUVs and at room temperature for THP-1
cell suspensions. I1, I3 and IE were measured at 375, 386 and
470 nm, respectively.
Preparation of lipid vesicles
Liposomes were prepared by mixing appropriate volumes of the
stock solutions of DPPC, Py-met-chol and DIM (molar fractions
were calculated according to the total quantity of lipids in a given
suspension). Solvent was evaporated under a nitrogen stream and
samples were desiccated for 2 h under vacuum. The dried lipid
samples were hydrated in MOPS buffer (10 mM 3-morpholino-
propanesulfonic acid, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.02% w/v NaN3,
pH 7.4) and heated at 60uC for 20 min (temperature above than
the gel-to-liquid transition temperature (Tm)). The sample was
vortexed for 4 minutes to allow the formation of multilamellar
vesicles (MLVs). MLVs (at final concentrations of 1024 M) were
sonicated for 10 minutes at a temperature above the Tm using a
VibraCell sonicator (Sonics & Materials, Newtown, CT) with a
titanium-plated tip delivering 12.5 W. The samples, constituted of
small unilamellar vesicle suspensions, were immediately centri-
fuged for 25 minutes at 20,0006g (5408R centrifuge, Eppendorf,
Hamburg, Germany) to remove any titanium particles. Small
unilamellar vesicle suspensions were stored for 36 h to allow
vesicle fusion. The sizes of relaxed large unilamellar vesicles
(LUVs) were determined by measuring dynamic light scattering,
using a Dynapro device (Wyatt Technology, Santa Barbara, CA).
The LUVs in this study had a mean radius of 120 nm. However,

and analyzed as described previously [48]. Three major bands
were visible corresponding to three structural variants of DIM
(dimycocerosates of phthiocerol, forms A and B, and dimycocer-
osates of phthiodiolone) [3]. These DIM were all missing in the
PMM56, PMM100, PMM50, and PMM97 mutants. (A) TLC

Lipids were labelled using [1-14C] propionate, and half of the
bacteria was heat-killed using the same conditions as the ones used
for evaluation of acidification of Mtb-containing phagosome.
Lipids were then extracted and analyzed as described previously
[48].

incubated in the presence of serum. At various times after
infection, MDMs were fixed and processed for differentiating
intracellular and extracellular bacteria. Intracellular bacilli per
macrophage were then quantified by counting 100 macrophages
from at least 10 different fields. Values represented the mean+-
