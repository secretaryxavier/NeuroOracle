SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) kills infected macrophages by inhibiting apoptosis and
promoting necrosis. The tuberculosis necrotizing toxin (TNT) is a secreted nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide (NAD*) glycohydrolase that induces necrosis in infected macrophages. Here, we
show that NAD* depletion by TNT activates RIPK3 and MLKL, key mediators of necroptosis.
Notably, Mtb bypasses the canonical necroptosis pathway since neither TNF-a nor RIPK1 are
required for macrophage death. Macrophage necroptosis is associated with depolarized
mitochondria and impaired ATP synthesis, known hallmarks of Mtb-induced cell death. These
results identify TNT as the main trigger of necroptosis in Mtb-infected macrophages. Surprisingly,
NAD? depletion itself was sufficient to trigger necroptosis in a RIPK3- and MLKL-dependent
manner by inhibiting the NAD* salvage pathway in THP-1 cells or by TNT expression in Jurkat T
cells. These findings suggest avenues for host-directed therapies to treat tuberculosis and other
infectious and age-related diseases in which NAD? deficiency is a pathological factor.
In Brief
Pajuelo et al. show that NAD* hydrolysis by tuberculosis necrotizing toxin (TNT) induces
necroptosis. NAD* depletion alone is sufficient to activate RIPK3 and MLKL, bypassing
canonical necroptosis initiation. These findings suggest ways to treat tuberculosis and other
diseases in which NAD* deficiency is a pathological factor.

INTRODUCTION
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis, a devastating
disease with more than 10 million new cases and over 1.4 million reported deaths in 2016
(WHO, 2017). However, in healthy individuals, Mtb causes persistent infection with no
disease symptoms, indicating that Mtb avoids host immune responses (Behar et al., 2010). A
key mechanism determining the outcome of infection is the ability of Mtb to induce and
alter cellular death pathways in alveolar macrophages (Behar et al., 2010). To control Mtb
replication, alveolar macrophages attempt to initiate apoptosis (Behar et al., 2011), a host
programmed cell death resulting in containment of the bacteria, increased bacterial killing,
reduced inflammation, and enhanced antigen presentation (Liu et al., 2015). However,
virulent Mtb strains are capable of triggering a necrosis-like cell death that is associated with
higher mycobacterial replication, strong inflammation, dissemination, and disease
progression (Behar et al., 2010; Lerner et al., 2017). Intracellular replication of Mtb plays a
critical role in determining the fate of the infected cell. If a critical ‘‘burst’’ size is reached
(>25 bacilli per cell) the host cell undergoes an atypical, necrotic-like cell death
characterized by lysosomal permeabilization, mitochondrial damage, and membrane
destruction. In contrast, macrophages with a low bacillary burden undergo apoptosis, leading
to a more advantageous outcome for the host (Chen et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2006; Repasy et
al., 2013).
Recently, we identified CpnT, an outer membrane protein of Mtb consisting of an N-terminal
channel domain that is used for nutrient uptake; the secreted C-terminal domain is the major
cytotoxicity factor of Mtb in macrophages and induces necrosis-like cell death in eukaryotic
cells (Danilchanka et al., 2014). The C-terminal domain of CpnT, now known as
tuberculosis necrotizing toxin (TNT), is secreted into the cytosol of Mtb-infected
macrophages, where it hydrolyzes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD*) (Danilchanka
et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2015). The catalytic activity of TNT is required to trigger necrosis of

infected macrophages (Sun et al., 2015), but the molecular mechanisms connecting NADt
depletion and necrosis remained unknown.
Here, we describe TNT as a specific Mtb factor triggering necroptosis, a programmed
necrotic cell death pathway executed by activation of receptor-interacting serine-threonine
kinases (RIPK) 1 and 3 and the effector molecule mixed-lineage kinase domain-like protein
(MLKL) (Vanden Berghe et al., 2014). The canonical pathway to initiate necroptosis is by
activation of Fas/ CD95 or tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) and occurs
simultaneously with inhibition of caspase-8 (Newton and Manning, 2016). In this study, we
show that NAD*t depletion by TNT activates RIPK3 and MLKL to initiate necroptosis
independent of RIPK1 and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a). The catalytic activity of TNT
also damages mitochondria and depletes cellular ATP. Inhibition of RIPK3 or MLKL
protects macrophages from the cytotoxicity of Mtb to the same level as inactivation or
absence of TNT. Thus, the cytotoxicity of Mtb is mainly mediated by initiating necroptosis
through the activity of TNT. In fact, NAD* depletion itself is sufficient to trigger
necroptosis. These results reveal additional mechanisms for host-targeted therapies in
tuberculosis.
RESULTS
The Catalytic Activity of TNT Induces Mitochondrial Damage and Dysfunction
To examine the molecular mechanism of TNT-induced cell death, we used the human
macrophage cell line THP-1 as an infection model (Mendoza-Coronel and Castafién-
Arreola, 2016; Riendeau and Kornfeld, 2003). Mtb strains (Table S1) secreting functional
TNT replicated and increased cell numbers by 10- to 30-fold after 3-5 days, whereas the
AcpnT deletion mutant did not replicate and was slowly killed (Figure 1A). Mtb producing
only the N-terminal domain (NTD) of CpnT (Mtb AcpnT+cpn7Ty7p) and full-length CpnT
with a mutated, non-catalytic TNTy790n/Q822K domain (Mtb AcpnT+cpnT*) (Table S1)
replicated, but growth stopped at 10-fold lower bacterial numbers compared with wild-type
(WT) Mtb (Figure 1A). These results indicated that the catalytic activity of TNT is
important for survival and replication of Mtb in macrophages. To examine whether NAD*
depletion by TNT impairs mitochondrial function or integrity, we analyzed mitochondrial
health in Mtb-infected THP-1 macrophages. We observed that the oxygen consumption of
macrophages 48 hr after infection with WT Mtb was lower than that of uninfected cells,
whereas the Mtb strain producing CpnT* did not reduce the oxygen consumption of infected
macrophages (Figure 1B). Stressed or damaged mitochondria produce less ATP, which leads
to increased glycolysis to compensate for the energy loss and results in extracellular
acidification. Infection of macrophages with WT Mtb increased extracellular acidification 2-
fold compared with uninfected macrophages (Figure 1C). No difference was found when the
macrophages were infected with Mtb producing CpnT* (Figure 1C). The mitochondrial
membrane potential (MMP) was also reduced by 5-fold in Mtb-infected macrophages
compared with the uninfected control. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was
decreased by 2-fold when TNT was inactivated (Figure 1D). These results establish that the
catalytic activity of TNT is an important factor in depolarizing mitochondria.

Cytochrome crelease from the mitochondria to the cytosol is a sign of outer membrane
damage and permeabilization (Ott et al., 2002). Infection with Mtb strains producing
functional TNT released a significant amount of cytochrome c, whereas only marginal
amounts of cytochrome c were detected in the cytosol of macrophages infected with the
AcpnT mutant or the Mtb strain secreting non-catalytic TNT (Figure 1E). A consequence of
mitochondrial damage and dysfunction is decreased production of cellular ATP. As
expected, the total ATP level in macrophages infected with WT Mtb or mutant Mtb
producing non-catalytic TNT was lower compared with the uninfected control (Figure 1F).
Interpretation of the loss of mitochondrial damage and ATP depletion induced by the non-
catalytic mutant is complicated by the fact that this strain does not replicate at the level of
WT Mtb, reducing the bacterial load. To address this, we used the strain Mtb mc76206, a
derivative of H37Rv that lacks the genes panCD and /euCD, which are not involved in
virulence or drug resistance (Sampson et al., 2004), and a non-catalytic TNT mutant with the
same two point mutations as in the virulent strain (H792N/Q822K, Mtb mc?6206 AcpnT
+cpnT*). None of these strains replicated in macrophages (Figure S1A). However, the
induced mitochondrial dysfunction and depolarization and the decrease in ATP levels were
similar to those induced by the H37Rv and derivative strains (Figures S1B-S1E), indicating
that the observed differences were not a consequence of reduced bacterial replication but
were, instead, dependent on the catalytic activity of TNT. Taken together, these results
demonstrate that NAD* degradation by TNT leads to permeabilization of both mitochondrial
outer and inner membranes and decreases the membrane potential, the respiration rate of
mitochondria, and ATP production in macrophages infected with Mtb.
TNT Does Not Damage Mitochondria Directly
The results described above show that TNT damages mitochondria and decreases ATP
production, but it is not clear whether this is a consequence of a direct interaction between
TNT and mitochondria or whether TNT induces a signaling pathway that leads to
mitochondrial damage because of NAD* depletion. To distinguish between these two
possibilities, we incubated isolated mitochondria from THP-1 macrophages with purified
TNT and the non-catalytic TNT mutant proteins (Figures $2). The mitochondrial membrane
potential was not altered by TNT nor by the non-catalytic mutant throughout the experiment
(Figure 1G) suggesting that NAD* degradation by TNT indirectly damages mitochondria.
TNT Activates RIPK3 and MLKL in Human THP-1 Macrophages Infected with Mtb
At least three molecular mechanisms may account for the observed mitochondrial damage
by TNT. NAD* is an essential co-factor in crucial cellular processes, and, hence, loss of
NAD? may cause necrotic cell death by metabolic collapse (Zong and Thompson, 2006).
Alternatively, TNT could hijack a cytoplasmic protein that is imported by mitochondria
(Harbauer et al., 2014) and enable TNT to degrade the mitochondrial NAD* pool directly.
NADt depletion by TNT could also activate cellular signaling pathways executing
programmed necrotic cell death (Wang et al., 2014; Yuan et al., 2016). Because we did not
find any evidence for TNT localization to mitochondria, and because it was recently shown
that NAD* depletion by itself does not affect cellular ATP levels (Fouquerel et al., 2014), we
tested the hypothesis that TNT triggers programmed necrosis, also termed necroptosis

(Wang et al., 2014). To this end, we examined the requirement of RIPK1, RIPK3, or MLKL,
key mediators of necroptosis (Vanden Berghe et al., 2014), during TNT-induced macrophage
necrosis. As previously shown, the RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 s(Nec-1s) rescued cells
treated with TNF-a, cyclo-heximide, and carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-
fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) (T/C/Z) (Cho et al., 2009), which induce necroptosis by
formation of the RIPK1-RIPK3 complex (Wang et al., 2014; Figure S3A). However, Nec-1s
did not protect against cell death in Mtb-infected THP-1 macrophages (Figure S3B), ruling
out a role for RIPK1 in Mtb-induced cell death (Vanden Berghe et al., 2014). In contrast,
both GSK’872 and necrosulfonamide, inhibitors of RIPK3 (Kaiser et al., 2013) and MLKL
(Sun et al., 2012), respectively, protected THP-1 macrophages from cell death by Mtb
(Figure 2A) at concentrations that were not toxic for Mtb (Figure $4). The protective effect
of inhibiting RIPK3 and MLKL was completely abolished or largely reduced in infections
with Mtb strains lacking cpnT or expressing inactive cpnT (cpnTTM*), suggesting that the
catalytic activity of TNT somehow activates RIPK3 and MLKL. Importantly, GSK’872 and
necrosulfonamide also markedly reduced mitochondrial depolarization in Mtb-infected
THP-1 macrophages (Figure 2B). This mitochondrial protection by GSK’872 and
necrosulfonamide was completely dependent on cpn7 (Figure 2B). Interestingly, we
observed a small but significant rescue of the mitochondrial membrane potential when the
pretreated macrophages were infected with the Mtb strain producing CpnT with the
catalytically inactive TNT mutant compared with the Acpn7T mutant (Figure 2B). A potential
explanation for this observation is that the functional N-terminal channel of CpnT* increases
nutrient uptake and intracellular replication of Mtb (Figures 1A, 2C, and $5), as observed
earlier (Danilchanka et al., 2014), enhancing production of other Mtb factors that contribute
to cell death. Treatment with GSK’872 or necrosulfonamide was also associated with
reduced intracellular replication of Mtb strains expressing functional TNT, and no
synergistic effect was observed when both compounds were used (Figures 2C and S5). This
may reflect the improved mitochondrial health in infected macrophages after inhibition of
MLKL or RIPK3 and suggests that they are part of the same pathway. Notably, less
phosphorylated MLKL protein (pMLKL, the active form of MLKL) was detected when
macrophages infected with the cpnT deletion mutant and Mtb producing the catalytically
inactive TNT mutant were analyzed by western blot (Figure 2D). Furthermore, the cleaved
forms of caspase-3 and caspase-1, respectively involved in apoptosis and pyroptosis, were
also detected in THP-1 macrophages, regardless which strain was used for infection (Figure
2D), suggesting that other pathways might also be active during macrophage death.
However, lower levels of cleaved caspase-1 were found in strains lacking functional TNT
(Figure 2D), suggesting that the enzymatic activity of TNT and/or the intracellular growth
defect of these strains may be important for activation of pyroptosis. In conclusion, these
experiments clearly showed that MLKL is activated by TNT in THP-1 macrophages infected
with Mtb and that other TNT-independent mechanisms are also involved.
Deletion of the Miki and Ripk3 Genes Partially Protects Mouse Macrophages from TNT-
Induced Cell Death
To assess the relative contribution of different cell death mediators to macrophage death, we
used bone marrow-derived macrophages from C57BL/6J mice and measured macrophage
viability following infection by Mtb. Macrophages deficient in caspase-1 and caspase-11 did

not show any protection against cell death compared with WT macrophages independent of
the Mtb strain used for infection, demonstrating that the macrophages do not die by
pyroptotic cell death (Yuan et al., 2016; Figure 2E). Caspase-3-deficient macrophages
survived slightly better when infected with any of the Mtb strains, suggesting that a small
percentage of WT macrophages underwent apoptosis (Danke et al., 2010) in a TNT-
independent manner (Figure 2E). In contrast, the cell viability of knockout macrophages in
the necroptosis-related genes Ripk3, MIkI, and Rikp3/MIkI (Wang et al., 2014) was
markedly increased compared with WT macrophages when infected with Mtb (Figure 2E).
Importantly, the cell viability of Ripk3~~ and M/k’ macrophages infected with an Mtb
strain producing functional TNT increased by 80%, whereas the increase was less than 10%
in macrophages infected with the Acpn7 mutant or the non-catalytic TNT mutant (Figure
2E). This demonstrated that RIPK3 and MLKL play major roles in mediating cell death
induced by NAD* depletion by TNT. The results also showed that TNT accounts for
approximately half of the cytotoxicity of Mtb in infected macrophages, as observed earlier
(Danilchanka et al., 2014), and indicated that TNT induces mostly programmed necrotic cell
death. Interestingly, no differences were found between macrophages with single Ripk3”—
and M/kI-“ deletions and the double gene deletion Rikp3/MIKI”, suggesting that, in these
macrophages, RIPK3 and MLKL act in the same cell death pathway.
In previous studies, caspase-1 activation and interleukin-18 (IL-1) production were
detected in Mtb-infected macrophages without undergoing pyroptosis (Dorhoi et al., 2012;
Welin et al., 2011). We measured IL-18 production in Mtb-infected macrophages and found
that similar amounts of IL-1B are produced by all macrophages after infection regardless of
whether functional TNT was secreted by Mtb (Figure 2F). Furthermore, the survival of
macrophages deficient in caspase-1 and caspase-11 is not improved compared with WT
macrophages (Figure 2E), suggesting that, although caspase-1 is activated by TNT (Figure
2D), cell death is not dependent on this caspase. Taken together, these results revealed that
NAD* depletion by TNT activates the essential “necrosome” components MLKL and
RIPK3, which induce programmed necrotic cell death in Mtb.
TNF-a Is Not Involved in TNT-Induced Cell Death of Macrophages Infected with Mtb
Several studies indicate the importance of TNF-a in Mtb-mediated cell death (Butler et al.,
2017; Cavalcanti et al., 2012). To examine whether TNF-a also plays a role in cell death
triggered by TNT in human macrophages, we utilized inhibitors of TNF-a and TNFR1:
SPD304 and R7050, respectively (Gonzalez-Juarbe et al., 2017). Although Mtb reduced the
viability of infected THP-1 macrophages as expected, neither the TNFR1 inhibitor R7050
nor the TNF-a inhibitor SPD304 increased their cell viability (Figure S3C), suggesting that
TNF-a is not required for TNT-induced necroptosis.
The TNT Protein Is Sufficient to Induce RIPK1-Independent Necroptosis
In a previous study, we showed that expression of the tt gene in Jurkat T cells (Jurkat 655-
TNT) induced a necrotic-like cell death that was not prevented by necrostatin-1, indicating
RIPK1-independent necrosis (Danilchanka et al., 2014). In this experimental model, tnt
expression was tightly controlled by tetracycline or tetracycline derivatives. Our aim was to
control the level of NAD* depletion in Jurkat T cells and establish a threshold NAD* level

that triggers necroptotic cell death. To this end, we first determined doxycycline
concentrations ranging from 1 to 100 ng/mL, which established different TNT levels (Figure
3A). These doxycycline concentrations indeed reduced cellular NAD* by distinct levels,
ranging from 9.2 pmol/million cells in non-treated cells to 1.5 pmol/million cells at 50
ng/mL doxycycline. These experiments also showed that even TNT levels undetectable by
western blot led to a significant degradation of NAD*t (Figure 3B). Importantly, the cell
viability of Jurkat T cells was only affected when NAD* levels were reduced by at least 65%
to 3.2 pmol/million cells or less. Almost complete cytotoxicity was observed when the
cellular NAD* concentration was approximately 2 pmol/million of cells, corresponding to a
depletion of approximately 80% NAD* (Figure 3C). To examine whether TNT-induced cell
death of Jurkat T cells is also mediated by the necroptotic pathway as in Mtb-infected
macrophages, we treated Jurkat T cells with the RIPK3 and MLKL inhibitors GSK’ 872 and
necrosulfonamide in the presence of 1 mg/mL doxycycline to maximize tnt expression and
cytotoxicity. As expected, cell death was observed in the Jurkat 655-TNT but not in the
control Jurkat 644 cell line upon treatment with doxycycline (Figure 3D). Importantly,
inhibition of RIPK3 and MLKL afforded protection from TNT-induced cell death, whereas
inhibition of RIPK1 with Nec1s did not have any beneficial effect on cell viability (Figure
3D), demonstrating that TNT alone is sufficient to induce RIPK3/MLKL-dependent
necroptotic cell death without the presence of bacteria. This conclusion is supported by the
detection of phosphorylated MLKL in ‘ntexpressing Jurkat T cells, which was prevented
with the RIPK3 inhibitor GSK’ 872 (Figure 3E) but not by necrosulfonamide, as observed
previously (Sun et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014). Of note, NAD* depletion and subsequent
death in mammalian cells is also observed by (over)activation of poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerases (PARPs), NAD*-consuming enzymes involved in DNA repair (Morales et al.,
2014). However, inhibition of PARP] and PARP2, the two main isoforms involved in DNA
repair and NAD* depletion, with the inhibitor olaparib (Menear et al., 2008) did not result in
any protection, ruling out the involvement of PARPs in TNT-mediated death (Figure 3F).
NAD? Depletion in Macrophages Infected with Mtb Is Mainly Caused by TNT and Is Partially
Compensated by Nicotinamide Supplementation
Because the oxidized form of NAD* is 100-fold more prevalent than its reduced form in
cells under physiological conditions (Ying, 2008), we measured NAD* levels in THP-1
macrophages infected with Mtb. Infection with WT Mtb drastically decreased NAD* levels.
The NAD* concentration increased 5-fold when the macrophages were infected with an Mtb
strain producing inactive TNT (Figure 4A). Importantly, the devastating effect of TNT on
cellular NAD* levels was decreased 4-fold after providing nicotinamide, a precursor of NAD
* biosynthesis, to the macrophages at a concentration that was not toxic for Mtb (Figure $4).
NAD? was completely restored by nicotinamide supplementation in macrophages infected
with the Mtb strain producing inactive TNT (Figure 4A). These results show that TNT is the
main cause for depletion of NAD* in macrophages infected with Mtb and indicate that
stimulating NAD* synthesis in infected macrophages might be a feasible therapeutic
approach.

NAD* Depletion Triggers Necroptosis in Macrophages
To examine whether NAD* depletion independent of TNT is capable of triggering the
necroptotic cell death pathway in THP-1 macrophages, we inhibited nicotinamide
phosphoribo-syltransferase (NAMPT), a key enzyme in the NAD* salvage pathway, with
FK866 (Hasmann and Schemainda, 2003). FK866 treatment depleted the NAD* pool within
6 hr in a concentration-dependent manner, from 9.6 to 1.2 pmol/million cells in the presence
of 10 uM FK866 (Figure 4B). Interestingly, reducing the NAD* level to 3.2 pmol/million
cells or below resulted in activation of necroptosis, determined by phosphorylation of
MLKL, as shown by immunofluorescence (Figure 4C). However, similar to Jurkat T cells,
NAD* depletion by 80% by treatment with 10 uM FK866 was required to decrease cell
viability (Figure 4D). As expected, FK866-induced cell death was not prevented by
inhibiting RIPK1 using Nec-1s or the TNFR1 receptor using R7050 (Figure 4E). In contrast,
inhibition of RIPK3 and MLKL with GSK’872 and necrosulfonamide, respectively, partially
restored the cell viability of the macrophages (Figure 4E). In addition, inhibition of RIPK3
by treatment with GSK’872 prevented phosphorylation of MLKL (Figure 4F). These results
demonstrate that NAD* depletion itself, regardless of the mechanism, triggers necroptosis in
THP-1 macrophages downstream of RIPK1. These results also indicate that mammalian
cells require a minimal NAD* level to prevent necroptosis.
NAD* Replenishment and Protection of Mitochondrial Health Alleviates TNT Cytotoxicity
Interestingly, NAD* replenishment also increased the mitochondrial membrane potential and
cell viability of Mtb-infected macrophages by 3-fold (Figures 5A and5B), but the cell
viability did not reach the level of uninfected macrophages, probably because NADt
replenishment by nicotinamide is limited (Figure 4A). As expected, this effect was
dependent on the catalytic activity of TNT because nicotinamide treatment did not change
the mitochondrial membrane potential and cell viability of macrophages infected with the
Mtb strain producing inactive TNT (Figures 5A and5B).
Next we tested the hypothesis that protecting mitochondria or increasing their function
would protect infected macrophages from TNT-induced toxicity. To this end, we treated
Mtb-infected macrophages with resveratrol (RSV) and coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to increase
the number and respiration rate of mitochondria, respectively, and with cyclosporin A (CsA),
a cyclophilin D inhibitor that prevents formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition
(MPT) pore (Gan et al., 2005; Gonzalez-Juarbe et al., 2015). We observed that RSV, CoQ10,
or CsA, at concentrations that were not toxic for Mtb (Figure S4), increased the
mitochondrial membrane potential by 3- to 4-fold, respectively, in macrophages infected
with Mtb (Figure 5A). In all experiments, the observed rescue was higher in macrophages
infected with WT Mtb compared with Mtb producing non-catalytic TNT, indicating that the
beneficial effects of CsA, RSV, and CoQ10 are, to a large extent, dependent on NADt
hydrolysis of TNT (Figure 5A). These compounds also increased the cell viability of
macrophages infected with WT Mtb by 3-fold, demonstrating that mitochondrial function is
directly correlated with macrophage survival (Figure 5B). The beneficial effect of these
treatments is mainly dependent on TNT, underlining the importance of TNT for the
cytotoxicity of TNT in Mtb-infected macrophages. Importantly, supplementation of infected
macrophages with nicotinamide, RSV, CoQ10, or CsA restricted the intracellular growth of

WT Mtb and the complemented strain, whereas growth of the strain producing non-
functional TNT remained unchanged (Figures 5C and $5). Taken together, our results
highlight the importance of mitochondrial health during Mtb infection and show that
preserving mitochondrial function alleviates the cytotoxicity induced by the NAD*
glycohydrolase activity of TNT.
DISCUSSION
Mtb kills infected macrophages by inhibiting apoptosis (Liu et al., 2015) and promoting
necrosis, a type of cell death that is associated with higher mycobacterial replication,
inflammatory response, and progression of tuberculosis (Behar et al., 2010). However, it is
unclear which mechanisms Mtb uses to alter host cell death modes in its favor (Moraco and
Kornfeld, 2014). In this study, we demonstrated that the Mtb toxin TNT damages
mitochondria, a key event in the necrotic cell death of Mtb-infected macrophages (Chen et
al., 2006; Duan et al., 2002; Jamwal et al., 2013). The observed mitochondrial damage is a
consequence of the NADt glycohydrolase activity of TNT and does not require a direct
interaction of TNT with mitochondria, in contrast to other Mtb proteins associated with
mitochondria (Cadieux et al., 2011; Sohn et al., 2011). The key observation linking NAD*
depletion by TNT to necrotic cell death was that inhibition or lack of RIPK3 and/or MLKL
protected Mtb-infected macrophages from TNT-induced cell death. These results were
corroborated by the fact that the necrotic cell death induced by TNT in Jurkat T cells
involves the same mediators as in Mtb-infected macrophages without the confounding
influence of other factors during bacterial infection. These experiments conclusively
demonstrated that TNT triggers necroptosis, a form of programmed cell death with
molecular features similar to necrosis, preventing viruses from replication in infected cells
(Dondelinger et al., 2016; Weinlich et al., 2017). These findings are consistent with recent
results published by Zhao et al. (2017), who showed that cell death of macrophages infected
with virulent Mtb is dependent on RIPK3 and MLKL and that Ripk3~~ mice were more
resistant to Mtb infection than WT mice. Our study established that TNT is the main
necroptosis-inducing factor in macrophages infected with Mtb. Other mechanisms may
contribute to necrosis of Mtb-infected macrophages, such as uncharacterized cellular
pathways targeting mitochondria (Cadieux et al., 2011; Moreno-Altamirano et al., 2012;
Sohn et al., 2011).
Surprisingly, we observed that TNT-induced necroptosis does not require TNF-a signaling
or RIPK1, one of the core components of the necrosome and the initial kinase that is
activated upon TNF-a stimulation (de Almagro and Vucic, 2015; Vanden Berghe et al.,
2014). TNF-a-dependent cell death of macrophages is associated with apoptosis (Riendeau
and Kornfeld, 2003) and was observed with avirulent Mtb strains and/or low bacillary loads
(Lee et al., 2006). Our observation that virulent Mtb bypasses the TNF-a receptor and
RIPK1 activation and directly activates RIPK3 is consistent with previous studies (Riendeau
and Kornfeld, 2003; Zhao et al., 2017). Roca and Ramakrishnan (2013) showed in zebrafish
that Mycobacterium marmum induces RIPK1/RIPK3-dependent necroptosis in the presence
of excess TNF-a. This difference between necroptosis induced by M. marinum and Mtb
may be caused by the lack of a TNT homolog in M. marinum (Danilchanka et al., 2014).
The CpnT homolog in M. marinum (MMAR_5464) has a similar N terminus, which is

connected to a C-terminal ADP ribosyltransferase, suggesting that the role of this CpnT
homolog is different compared with TNT. Although we found that TNF-a is dispensable for
TNT-induced necroptosis, we cannot exclude that RIPK1 could be activated by higher levels
of TNF-a, contributing to RIPK3 activation in addition to TNT in Mtb-infected cells. Other
studies showed that Mtb-infected fibroblasts die from necroptosis via RIPK1-RIPK3-MLKL
in a TNF-a-dependent manner (Butler et al., 2017) and that MLKL does not appear to be
activated in Mtb-infected bone marrow-derived or J774.1 mouse macrophages (Butler et al.,
2017; Stutz et al., 2018). These apparent discrepancies may result from cell-type-specific
differences (Andreu et al., 2017).
The results of our study lead to the following model for TNT-induced cell death of infected
macrophages (Figure 6). After inhalation of Mtb into the lung, the bacteria are taken up by
alveolar macrophages through phagocytosis. Mtb evades killing in the phagosome by
blocking its fusion with lysosomes (Sun et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2011) and eventually
permeabilizes the phagosomal membrane using the proteins ESAT-6 and CFP10, secreted by
the ESX-1 system (Manzanillo et al., 2012; Simeone et al., 2012). This process enables Mtb
proteins to enter the cytosol of the infected macrophages. One of those proteins is the NADt
glycohydrolase TNT, which accounts for more than half of the NAD* loss in Mtb-infected
macrophages (Sun et al., 2015). Low cytosolic NAD* levels induce at least three major
molecular pathways in macrophages infected with Mtb. RIPK3 senses lower NAD* levels
and/or increased levels of its degradation products, nicotinamide and ADP-ribose, by an
unknown mechanism. Activated RIPK3 phosphorylates MLKL, which then forms
oligomeric pores in host cell membranes and induces necrotic death (pathway 1) (Wang et
al., 2014). In addition, RIPK3 also migrates, together with Bcl-x;,, to mitochondria (pathway
2). The RIPK3-Bcl-xy, complex associates with pro-caspase-8 and prevents caspase-8-
mediated apoptosis (Zhao et al., 2017). Furthermore, activated RIPK3 triggers formation of
the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, depolarizing mitochondria (Zhao et al.,
2017). The third pathway is based on connection of the cytosolic and mitochondrial NADt
pools. Hence, NAD* depletion in the cytoplasm directly decreases the NAD* concentration
in mitochondria (Cambronne et al., 2016), compromising electron transport chain function
and reducing the proton gradient across the inner membrane (Stein and Imai, 2012). The
concomitant loss of mitochondrial membrane potential impairs ATP production. Although
pathways 1| and 2 are part of the necroptotic death program triggered by activation of RIPK3
(Vanden Berghe et al., 2014), indirect depletion of mitochondrial NAD* by TNT probably
contributes to the rapid demise of mitochondria and the inability of macrophages to mount
an effective response to infection by Mtb. All of these observations explain the previously
observed importance of phagosomal per-meabilization for the cytotoxicity of Mtb in infected
macrophages (Simeone et al., 2012, 2016).
Importantly, our study shows that NAD* depletion, whether it is by the glycohydrolase
activity of TNT or by blocking NAD* synthesis, is sufficient to activate RIPK3/MLKL-
dependent necroptosis in THP-1 macrophages and Jurkat T cells. Interestingly, macrophages
tolerated a much larger reduction of NAD* concentration of up to 70% without any effect on
cell viability compared with T cells, although the overall amount of NAD* in both cell types
was similar (930-960 attomole [amol] per cell). This might be a cell-specific difference or
due to the different methods of NAD* depletion. Interestingly, our results indicate that

necroptosis is induced when the NAD* concentration drops belowa critical threshold of
~200 amol NADt per cell. It would be important to examine whether low NAD* levels
induce necroptosis in different primary human cells and what the critical NAD* threshold in
these cells is compared with the immortalized cell lines used in our study. However, several
studies show a connection between low NAD* levels and necrosis-like cell death, indicating
that lack of NAD* might be an evolutionarily conserved trigger of necroptosis. For example,
the NAD* glycohydrolase SPN of Streptococcus pyogenes depletes cellular NAD* and
induces necrosis (Chandrasekaran and Caparon, 2015). Similarly, PARP-1 hyper-activation
rapidly depletes cellular NAD*, leading to ATP depletion and necrotic cell death, which has
previously been interpreted as “‘energy collapse’’ (Herceg and Wang, 2001). Our findings
suggest that the necrosis observed in the presence of SPN and activation of PARP-1 may be
mediated by RIPK3 and MLKL as a result of NAD* depletion and subsequent initiation of
necroptosis.
One of the main questions raised by our study is how RIPK3 is activated by NAD* depletion
(Figure 6). It has been shown that proteins from the Bcl-2 family, such as Bcl-xy, are
regulated by sirtuins, NAD*-consuming enzymes whose activity depends on NAD* (Chang
and Guarente, 2014), suggesting a mechanism by which NAD* depletion could mediate Bcl-
x, -dependent recruitment of RIPK3 to mitochondria. NAD* depletion by TNT may also
directly influence sirtuin-dependent processes. For instance, SIRT1 has been shown to
induce phagosome-lysosome fusion and decrease Mtb intracellular growth in macrophages
(Cheng et al., 2017). Another mechanism of how NAD* could activate RIPK3 is by
increased intracellular calcium concentrations through activation of the TRPM2 calcium
channel by elevated ADP-ribose levels after NAD* hydrolysis (Perraud et al., 2001). This
hypothesis is supported by the observation that calcium influx by bacterial pore-forming
toxins triggers necroptosis (Gonzalez-Juarbe et al., 2015, 2017). Further experiments are
needed to identify the molecular mechanism(s) that activate(s) RIPK3 when the cellular
NAD* level drops below a critical threshold.
Conclusions
The finding that NAD* depletion triggers programmed cell death to kill macrophages
infected with Mtb reveals strategies for host-targeted approaches to treat tuberculosis (TB).
For example, Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs such as ponatinib and
pazopanib have been shown to inhibit necroptosis (Fauster et al., 2015) and could, perhaps,
be used to prevent necrosis and reduce dissemination of Mtb. Alternatively, NAD*
replenishment strategies could counter the toxicity of TNT and protect macrophages from
cell death. Indeed, nicotinamide treatment increases NADt levels and survival of
macrophages infected with Mtb, consistent with previous observations (Sun et al., 2015).
NAD* replenishment could be combined with reagents that promote mitochondrial function,
such as RSV and CsA, which were previously shown to protect macrophages from Mtb-
induced cell death (Cheng et al., 2017; Gan et al., 2005). These host-targeted strategies
could be combined with antibacterial drugs to improve TB chemotherapy (Kaufmann et al.,
2018; Nathan and Barry, 2015). These implications may also apply to other bacterial and
fungal pathogens that utilize NAD* glycohydrolases, such as .S. pyogenes (Chandrasekaran
and Caparon, 2015) and the over 300 microorganisms encoding TNT homologs

(Danilchanka et al., 2014). Perhaps even more importantly, the role of RIPK3 as a cellular
energy sensor may play a role in other diseases in which NAD* deficiency is a common
pathological factor, such as type 2 diabetes and a variety of neurological and heart diseases
(Elhassan et al., 2017; Verdin, 2015; Zhang and Ying, 2018).
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethics Statement
All experiments involving mice were performed following protocol 20270, approved by the
University of Alabama Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (ACUC) and in
agreement with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice(male and
female, 6-8weekold, age-matched) were kindly provided by Dr. Carlos Orihuela (University
of Alabama at Birmingham).
Infection of Macrophages
Mtb strains were harvested in mid-log phase (optical density 600 [OD600] of 0.6).
Macrophages were infected with the Mtb strains at an MOI of 10:1 for 4 hr. Macrophage
monolayers were incubated with medium containing 20 ug/mL gentamycin for 1 hr to kill
extracellular bacteria and then kept in medium without antibiotics. When macrophages
required pretreatment, the chemicals were added to the medium 1 hr before the infection and
were kept in medium for the rest of the experiment. In all the experiments, both floating and
attached macrophages were considered for analysis.
In Vitro NAD* Glycohydrolase Assays and NAD*t Content in Mtb-Infected Macrophages
The NAD* glycohydrolase activity of TNTwt and TNTy792y Q822x was measured by
incubating 100 ng of protein with 1 uM B-NAD* for 30 min at 37°C in reaction buffer (20
mM Tris and 200 mM NaCl [pH 7.4]). The remaining NAD* was quantified with the
EnzyFluo NAD/NADH Assay Kit (Bioassay Systems). To measure the NAD* content in
Mtb-infected THP-1 cells, macrophages were infected with Mtb strains at an MOI of 10:1
for 48 hr and lysed with 0.025% SDS to release all NAD* from the macrophages without
lysing mycobacteria. The EnzyFluo NAD/NADH Kit was then used to quantify the amount
of NAD* in each sample.
Statistical Analysis
SigmaPlot (Systat Software) was used for graph development and statistical analysis. Data
are presented as mean + SEM of at least 3 independent experiments; p values were
calculated using one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s correction, and p < 0.05 was considered
to be significant.

CYTOSOL
Phagosomal
permeabilization
Figure 6. Mechanism of TNT-Mediated Cell Death of Macrophages Infected with Mtb
After phagocytosis by macrophages, Mtb permeabilizes the phagosomal membrane,
enabling TNT to translocate to the cytosol. The enzymatic activity of TNT hydrolyzes
cellular NAD+ to nicotinamide (NAM) and ADP-ribose (ADPr). Depletion of the cytosolic
NAD+ pool induces three major molecular events. RIPK63 senses lower NAD+ levels
and/or increased levels of its degradation products and phosphorylates MLKL (pathway 1),
which then forms oligomeric pores in host cell membranes and induces necrotic death
(Wang et al., 2014). RIPK3 also migrates, together with Bcl-XL, to mitochondria (pathway
2), prevents caspase-8 activation, and induces formation of the mitochondrial permeability
transition (MPT) pore, depolarizing mitochondria (Zhao et al., 2017). The third pathway is a
consequence of the connection of the cytosolic and mitochondrial NAD+ pools, as shown
previously (Cambronne et al., 2016). Depleting cytosolic NAD+ also strongly reduces NAD
+ levels in mitochondria, compromising the electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP
synthesis. Dashed lines indicate unknown molecular mechanisms.
