Persistence is a characteristic attribute of long-term memories
(LTMs). However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms
that mediate this process. We recently showed that persistence of
LTM requires a late protein synthesis- and BDNF-dependent phase
in the hippocampus. Here, we show that intrahippocampal delivery
of BDNF reverses the deﬁcit in memory persistence caused by
inhibition of hippocampal protein synthesis. Importantly, we
demonstrate that BDNF induces memory persistence by itself,
transforming a nonlasting LTM trace into a persistent one in an
ERK-dependent manner. Thus, BDNF is not only necessary, but
sufﬁcient to induce a late postacquisition phase in the hippocam-
pus essential for persistence of LTM storage.

ong-term storage of information is a hallmark feature of the
brain. Memories may last for hours (short-term memory,
STM) or for days, weeks ,and even a lifetime (long-term mem-
ory, LTM). LTM requires, whereas STM does not, a gene
expression and protein synthesis-dependent stabilization process
named consolidation that takes place in restricted areas of the
brain, particularly in the hippocampus (1–3). Depending on the
strength and/or saliency of the information to be remembered,
consolidated LTMs can persist for just 24–48 h or for many days
or weeks (4–6). For LTM to become long-lasting, changes must
persist after acquisition to render the trace immune to molecular
turnover (1, 2, 7). However, little is known about the molecular
mechanisms that make some LTMs persist more than others.
BDNF regulates neuronal structure and function (8, 9). In
particular, it is critical for synaptic plasticity and memory-
processing in the adult brain (9–12). In fact, BDNF induces and
is sufficient for long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocam-
pus (13–16), a form of synaptic plasticity thought to underlie
LTM formation (17–19). Recently, we described the require-
ment of a late phase of protein synthesis and BDNF expression
in the hippocampus, 12 h after training, for persistence of
consolidated LTM (12). We found that blocking BDNF expres-
sion and function in the hippocampus during a critical time
period caused a deficit in memory persistence without affecting
LTM formation, indicating that synthesis of BDNF during this
late protein synthesis-dependent phase is crucial for persistence
of memory storage. Here, we investigated whether BDNF is
sufficient for memory persistence and whether it can, by itself,
promote persistence of LTM storage. Given that BDNF activates
several signaling effectors, including ERK (20, 21), we examined
the mechanisms for BDNF-induced LTM persistence.
Results
To determine the effect of BDNF on LTM persistence, we used
a one-trial inhibitory avoidance (IA) paradigm, a hippocampus-
dependent task extensively used for studying posttraining mem-
ory processing and recall (2, 19, 22, 23). To test whether BDNF
action during the late posttraining critical time period is not only
required but sufficient for persistence of LTM storage, we
infused the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin (Ani; 80
g/0.8 l per side) in the dorsal hippocampus [supporting
information (SI) Fig. 4] 12 h after IA training, which causes a
selective deficit in memory retention 7 days, but not 2 days, after
training (12). Fifteen minutes after Ani infusion, we delivered
human recombinant BDNF (hrBDNF, 0.25 g/0.8 l per side)
or vehicle (Veh) into the hippocampus and tested the animals for
retention 7 days thereafter. The impairment in LTM at 7 days
after training caused by Ani given at 12 h after training was
completely rescued by hrBDNF (Fig. 1A), indicating that BDNF
is a key factor synthesized during this late protein synthesis-
dependent phase necessary for persistence of LTM storage. We
also confirmed that BDNF is required for persistence of LTM
storage (12). Infusion of BDNF antisense oligonucleotides
[BDNF ASO; (24)] into the dorsal hippocampus 10 h after
training, a treatment that blocks expression of BDNF 12 h after
training, impaired persistence but not formation of IA LTM
(Fig. 1B). We next explored whether BDNF can induce persis-
tence of memory storage by itself. Differences in LTM duration
can be achieved by modifying the amount or the strength of
training (Fig. 2A) (5). Thus, IA training using a strong foot
shock, which generates a persistent LTM, resulted in increased
BDNF expression in the dorsal hippocampus 12 h after training,
whereas training with a mild foot shock, which produces a rapidly
decaying LTM, did not change BDNF levels at 12 h after training
[Fig. 2 A and B (12)]. Therefore, to determine whether BDNF
infusion in the hippocampus 12 h after training induces persis-
tence of IA LTM storage, we used a weak training protocol. In
animals thus trained, infusion of hrBDNF (0.25 g/0.8 l) 12 h
after training induced persistence of memory retention mea-
sured at 7 days (Fig. 2C). Consistent with the hypothesis that, late
after training, BDNF expression induces LTM persistence but
not LTM formation, rats infused with hrBDNF or Veh 12 h after
training showed no differences in IA memory retention 2 days
later (Figs. 1A and 2C; see also ref.12). When given 24 h after
training, BDNF did not affect 7-day-old IA LTM (Fig. 2D).
Besides promoting LTM persistence, BDNF could also facil-
itate retention of a 7-day-old long-lasting memory trace. In a
different set of experiments, we replicated our previous findings
by observing that intrahippocampal infusion of hrBDNF 12 h
after a weak IA training induced a fourfold increase in retention
scores at 7 days after training [435% vs. Veh-injected animals
(n  8), P  0.01]. However, this same treatment did not affect
retention when rats were trained by using a strong training
protocol (Fig. 2E). This suggests that BDNF have no effect on

memory persistence when infused 12 h after training if the
training experience is strong enough to induce late BDNF
expression by itself (see also Fig. 2B).
The increase in LTM persistence after BDNF infusion 12 h
after weak IA training cannot be explained by a protracted effect
on attention, motivation, perception, and/or motor coordination,
because rats given BDNF 12 h after IA acquired and retained an
object-recognition LTM 7 days later as unfailingly as control
animals did (SI Fig. 5). Moreover, delayed infusion of BDNF
24 h after training did not affect IA LTM retention at 7 days,
indicating that hrBDNF injected several hours after the critical
time period does not produce any effect on performance (Fig.
2D) and ruling out the possibility that late posttraining admin-
istration of BDNF caused a protracted action on memory
retrieval. Furthermore, the fact that the effect of BDNF on LTM
persistence was only observed after weak, but not strong, IA
training demonstrates that it results from a specific action that
induces persistence of the memory trace in a time-dependent
manner and not from a nonspecific enhancement of the animal’s
performance.
BDNF promotes ERK activation and BDNF-induced LTP
requires ERK activity (10, 20, 25). A strong, but not a weak,
training protocol that increases BDNF levels 12 h after training
(Fig. 2B) induced ERK phosphorylation at 12 h after training
(Fig. 3A). So we next examined whether blocking ERK activation
in the hippocampus 12 h after training also produced a selective
impairment in memory persistence (12). Intrahippocampal in-
fusion of the MEK inhibitor, U0126 (0.38 g/0.8 l) 12 h after
training impaired IA LTM retention 7, but not 2, days after
training (Fig. 3B). In contrast, pretraining infusion of U0126
resulted in a clear-cut deficit in LTM retention at 2 and 7 days
after training, thus confirming that the ERK cascade is required
at the moment of training for LTM formation (25, 26). U0126
decreased hippocampal ERK phosphorylation in vivo by 34% (SI
Fig. 6). Thus, ERK activation is required during training for
LTM formation and again 12 h thereafter for persistence of LTM
storage. In addition to ERK, BDNF can also activate the
phosphoinositide-3 kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin
(PI3K/mTOR) cascade (20, 21). In fact, when given in the
hippocampus 15 min before training, both Ly294002 (10 mM/0.8
l), a PI3K inhibitor, and rapamycin (60 nM/0.8 l), a mTOR
inhibitor (27), blocked IA LTM formation (SI Fig. 7 A and C).
However, Ly294002 and rapamycin had no effect on LTM
persistence when infused 12 h after IA training (SI Fig. 7 A and
C). Moreover, there was no increase in Akt or mTOR phos-
phorylation levels 12 h after training (SI Fig. 7 B and D).
Furthermore, intrahippocampal infusion of the phospholipase C
(PLC) inhibitor U-73122 (0.05 g/1 l) 12 h after training did not
affect IA LTM retention tested at 2 or 7 days after training (SI
Fig. 8). This suggests that, although PLC has been implicated
in BDNF signaling, its activation is not required for LTM
persistence.
Given that BDNF-induced ERK-activation can be blocked by
selective MEK inhibitors [SI Fig. 6 (10)] and that intrahippocam-
pal infusion of BDNF antisense oligonucleotides hinders the IA
training-induced activation of ERK at 12 h (Fig. 3C), we
examined whether ERK is indeed required for BDNF-induced
persistence of memory storage. As shown in Fig. 3D, intra-
hipocampal infusion of U0126 at 5 min before BDNF application
12 h after training, blocked the effect of BDNF on memory
persistence.
Discussion
In this report, we show that infusion of recombinant BDNF in the
CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus 12 h after IA training
reverses the deficit in memory persistence caused by local
inhibition of protein synthesis. Importantly, we also demonstrate
that BDNF is able to induce memory persistence by itself,
transforming a nonlasting long-term memory trace into a per-
sistent one through an ERK-dependent mechanism. Our results
suggest that BDNF is not only necessary, but sufficient to induce
a late postacquisition memory-processing phase in the hip-
pocampus essential for persistence of LTM storage.
What are the mechanistic differences between a persistent LTM
and another LTM that is rapidly forgotten? Our experiments
indicate that BDNF is a key molecule involved in memory persis-
tence, because the deleterious effect of general protein synthesis

inhibition can be overcome by exogenous BDNF infusion closer in
time. Interestingly, it has been recently shown that the blocking
effect of Ani on LTP maintenance can also be reversed by BDNF
administration (13). We have also demonstrated that persistent
LTMs (i.e., those lasting at least 7 days) are associated with
increased BDNF protein levels and ERK activation in the hip-
pocampus 12 h after training, whereas rapidly decaying LTMs are
not (see Figs. 2B and 3B and SI Fig. 4). This BDNF-induced

memory phase is essential for creating persistent LTM traces that
last longer than 1 or 2 days. Administration of BDNF protein 12 h,
but not 24 h, after training transforms a rapidly decaying memory
trace into a persistent one, suggesting that the increase in hip-
pocampal BDNF that occurs 12 h after training is critical to prevent
memory loss. In this sense, memory maintenance might be the
result of recurrent waves of protein expression, such as BDNF,
either in the hippocampus or in other brain structures. Our results
also point to the existence of an information processing phase
specifically implicated in the generation of a persistent form of
LTM. Just as there is a protein synthesis-independent STM that
maintains the accessibility of memory while protein synthesis-
dependent LTM is being formed, there seems to be a BDNF-
dependent mechanism that mediates persistence of long-lasting
LTMs. The mechanisms that trigger this BDNF-dependent phase
remain to be elucidated. One possibility is that, during training, a

protracted gene expression and protein synthesis process that may
last for several hours or days is switched on (28–30), first to
consolidate and then to ensure LTM persistence.
Memory storage is thought to rely on structural modification
of synaptic connections and neuronal growth (1–3). In agree-
ment with this idea, BDNF increases the number of dendritic
spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons (31). Consistently with findings
showing that ERK 1/2 pathway regulates dendritic and spine
morphology (21), both the effects of BDNF on spine morpho-
genesis (32) and LTM persistence are ERK-dependent (see Fig.
3D). It has also been shown that BDNF released by  activity
promotes actin polymerization in dendritic spines in the hip-
pocampal CA1 region (33). Interestingly, a recent report shows
that, after their initial appearance, dendritic spines form syn-
apses within 15–19 h, close to the 12-h time point critical for
persistence of LTM storage (34). In addition, deficits in BDNF
and in ERK signaling are associated to memory impairment in
the aging brain (35, 36). Age-related memory impairments have
often been characterized in terms of rapid forgetting, in which
aged animals have relatively comparable learning and memory
on tests performed 24–48 h after training, but poor LTM
retention at later times (6). Unraveling the molecular mecha-
nisms involved in memory persistence may help to understand
and treat the deficits in memory storage associated with normal
and pathological aging.
Importantly, the present findings may bridge the concepts of
cellular consolidation developed by McGaugh (2) and exten-
sively studied over the years by his group and by many others (18,
22, 23), including ours (6, 17, 19, 29, 39), and that of systems
consolidation, originally posited by Squire and his collaborators
(40–44). Squire and his associates produced substantial evidence
that there is a consolidation process that may last for weeks in
rodents and for years in humans (40). The brain systems involved
in these prolonged processes are different from those involved in
early posttraining cellular consolidation and include, to a large
extent, the neocortex (41–45). The findings here and elsewhere
(12) that defined cellular and molecular mechanisms in the
hippocampus may define whether a given memory will persist
over just a few days or over at least a week in rats clearly suggests
a link between consolidation processes lasting a few hours and
consolidation processes that take more than that (45).
Materials and Methods
Subjects. Male Wistar rats (2.5 months old/220–250 g) from our own breeding
colony were used. Animals were housed ﬁve to a cage at 23°C, with water and
food ad libitum, under a 12-h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 a.m.). The
procedures followed the guidelines of the National Institutes of Health Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Animal
Care and Use Committees of the University of Buenos Aires and the Pontiﬁcal
Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul.
Surgery. Rats were implanted under thionembutal anesthesia with 22-g guide
cannulae in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus at coordinates A 4.3,
L  3.0, V 1.4 of the atlas of Paxinos and Watson (37). Cannulae were ﬁxed to
the skull with dental acrylic.
Inhibitory Avoidance. After recovery from surgery, animals were handled once
a day for 2 days and then trained in inhibitory avoidance (between 7:00 and
9:00 a.m.) as described (29). Brieﬂy, the training apparatus was a 50  25 
25-cm Plexiglas box with a 5-cm-high, 7-cm-wide, and 25-cm-long platform on
the left end of a series of bronze bars that made up the ﬂoor of the box. For
training, animals were placed on the platform facing the left rear corner of the
training box. When they stepped down and placed their four paws on the grid,
they received either a 3-s, 0.7-mA scrambled foot shock (strong training) or a
3-s, 0.35-mA scrambled foot shock (weak training). Memory retention was
evaluated in a nonreinforced test session carried out 2, 4, or 7 days after
training. All animals were tested only once.
Object Recognition. The task was conducted in a 60  40  50-cm box built of
white and transparent acrylic. Before training, animals were habituated to the
experimental arena by allowing them to freely explore it 20 min per day for
2 days in the absence of stimulus objects. The stimulus objects were made of
metal, glass, or plastic. The role (familiar or novel) and the relative position of
the objects were counterbalanced and randomly permuted for each experi-
mental animal. In the training session, each animal was introduced for 5 min
in the arena containing two identical objects. Exploration was deﬁned as
snifﬁng or touching the stimulus object with the nose and/or forepaws. Sitting
on or turning around the objects was not considered exploratory behavior.
The time spent exploring each object was registered by an observer blind to
the treatment and expressed as percentage of the total exploration time.
Twenty-four hours after training, animals were tested by reintroducing them
in the arena for 5 minutes. One of the objects was familiar (meaning it had
been presented the day before) and the other was novel. Exploration was
registered as in the training session.
Drugs and Infusion Procedures. Oligonucleotides (ODN) (Genbiotech) were
HPLC-puriﬁed phosphorothioate end-capped 18-mer sequences, resuspended
in sterile saline to a concentration of 2 nmol/l. BDNF antisense ODN (BDNF
ASO), 5-TCT TCC CCT TTT AAT GGT-3; BDNF missense ODN (BDNF MSO),
5-ATA CTT TCT GTT CTT GCC-3. Both ODN sequences were subjected to a
BLAST search on the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST
server using the GenBank database. The ASO sequence had positive matches
only for their target mRNA sequences and no other rat or human coding
sequences. The control MSO sequence, which included the same 18 nt as the
ASO but in a scrambled order, did not generate any full match to identiﬁed
gene sequences in the database. Anisomycin (Ani) was purchased from Sigma.
It was ﬁrst dissolved in 3 M HCl, the pH adjusted to 7 with 3 M NaOH, further
diluted to working concentration with saline and bilaterally infused at a dose
of 80 g per side. Human recombinant BDNF (Alomone) was dissolved in
sterile saline and injected at a dose of 0.25 g per side. U0126 was purchased
form Cell Signaling Technology and injected at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.38 g
per side in 10% DMSO in saline. Rapamycin was purchased from Sigma,
dissolved in 0.1% DMSO, and infused at a dose of 60 nM per side. Ly294002 was
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, dissolved in 10% DMSO, and
infused at a dose of 5 mM per side. U-73122 was purchased from Sigma; it was
ﬁrst dissolved in DMSO and then diluted in saline to working concentration
(ﬁnal concentration of DMSO, 8%). U-73122 was injected at a dose of 0.05 g
per side.
Histological Analysis. After the behavioral procedures, rats received an over-
dose of thionembutal and were perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline and
4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were removed and placed in 10% buffered
formalin containing 30% sucrose. For analysis of ODN spread, rats were
injected with 2 nmol of biotinylated BDNF antisense ODN (BDNF ASO) and 2 h
later were anesthetized and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde. The brains
were isolated and sliced, and ASO was detected by avidin–biotin staining. By
2 h, ASO diffused throughout the dorsal hippocampus and slightly into the
overlying cortex. For analysis of BDNF delivery and spread, rats were injected
with 0.25 g of hrBDNF and 15 min later were anesthetized and perfused with
4% paraformaldehyde. The brains were isolated and sliced, and BDNF was
detected by immunohistochemistry using highly diluted primary BDNF anti-
body (1:20,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) to minimize endogenous BDNF
staining. BDNF did not diffuse 	1.7 mm3 beyond the injection site (data not
shown). Examination of cannulae placement was performed as described (29).
Brieﬂy, 24 h after the end of the behavioral procedures, 0.8 l of 4% meth-
ylene blue in saline was infused as indicated above. Animals were killed by
decapitation 15 min later and the brains stored in formalin for histological
localization of the infusion sites. Infusions spread with a radius of 1.7 mm3
and were found to be correct (i.e., within 1.5 mm3 of the intended site) in 93%
of the animals. Only data from animals with cannulae located in the intended
sites were included in the ﬁnal analysis.
Immunoblot Assays. Tissue was homogenized in ice-chilled buffer (20 mM
TrisHCl (pH 7.4), 0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, 10
g/ml aprotinin, 15 g/ml leupeptin, 10 g/ml bacitracin, 10 g/ml pepstatin,
15 g/ml trypsin inhibitor, 50 mM NaF, and 1 mM sodium orthovanadate).
Aliquots were subjected to SDS/PAGE under reducing conditions. Proteins
were electrotransferred onto PDVF membranes for 2 h at 100 V at 4°C for BDNF
analysis. For ERK1/2, Akt, and mTOR analysis, proteins were transferred onto
PVDF membranes overnight at 4°C. Immunoblots were performed by incu-
bating membranes with anti-BDNF (1:1,000), anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody
(1:3,000), anti-ERK 1/2 (1:4,000), anti-phospho-Akt (1:2,000), anti-Akt
(1:2,000), anti-phospho-mTOR (1:2,000), or anti-mTOR (1:2,000). All antibod-
