REVIEW
COVID-19: A Global Threat to the
Nervous System
Igor J. Koralnik, MD
,1 and Kenneth L. Tyler, MD2
In less than 6 months, the severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has spread worldwide
infecting nearly 6 million people and killing over 350,000. Initially thought to be restricted to the respiratory system,
we now understand that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also involves multiple other organs, including the central
and peripheral nervous system. The number of recognized neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly
accumulating. These may result from a variety of mechanisms, including virus-induced hyperinﬂammatory and hyper-
coagulable states, direct virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), and postinfectious immune mediated pro-
cesses.
Example
of
COVID-19
CNS
disease
include
encephalopathy,
encephalitis,
acute
disseminated
encephalomyelitis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis, and endothelialitis. In the
peripheral nervous system, COVID-19 is associated with dysfunction of smell and taste, muscle injury, the Guillain-Barre
syndrome, and its variants. Due to its worldwide distribution and multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, COVID-19
poses a global threat to the entire nervous system. Although our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis is
still incomplete and our knowledge is evolving rapidly, we hope that this review will provide a useful framework and
help neurologists in understanding the many neurologic facets of COVID-19.

T
he novel coronavirus, now called severe acute respira-
tory syndrome-coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is
the agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), that
was ﬁrst diagnosed on December 8, 2019, in a patient in
the city of Wuhan in central China. Common symptoms
of COVID-19 include fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness
of breath. Whereas most affected individuals have no or
minor symptoms, some go on to develop pneumonia,
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and succumb
from multiple organ failure. On January 30, 2020, the
World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a Public
Health Emergency of international concern. It has been
estimated that the number of infected individuals during
the early epidemic doubled every 2.4 days, and the R0
value, or number of people that can be infected by a single
individual, may be as high as 4.7 to 6.6.1 After spreading
throughout China, the disease took hold in Europe and
the United States, and in view of this alarming develop-
ment and the rapid growth of cases, public health ofﬁcials
in many jurisdictions ordered people to shelter in place
beginning
with
the
state
of
California
on
March
19, 2020. As of May 29, 2020, there have been 5.88 mil-
lion conﬁrmed cases in 188 countries and 363,000
reported deaths, and most countries are in various phases
of relaxing quarantine requirements while continuing
some social distancing measures.
What are coronaviruses and what makes SARS-
CoV-2 so contagious? Coronaviruses, which have a diame-
ter of approximately 100 nm, are named after their
crown-like appearance on electron microscopy. They
infect many animal species and are part of the family of
Coronaviridae that contain four distinct Genera. Cor-
onaviruses are positive strand, single stranded ribonucleic
acid (+ss-RNA) viruses. They have the largest genome of
all RNA viruses, approximately 30 kilobases in length.
The full sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was published on
January 7, 2020, and revealed that it is was a β-coronavi-
rus, similar to other human coronaviruses that are respon-
sible for 15% of all cases of acute viral nasopharyngitis,
also known as “common cold.”2 However, SARS-CoV-2

contains unique sequences, including a polybasic cleavage
site in the spike protein, which is a potential determinant
of increased transmissibility.3
Coronaviruses have caused deadly outbreaks in the
past. The ﬁrst one caused by SARS-CoV, occurred in
China in 2003 and affected approximately 8,000 people,
with a 10% mortality rate. The Middle-East Respiratory
Syndrome (MERS) outbreak began in Saudi Arabia in
2012, and affected 2,500 individuals with a 35% mortal-
ity rate. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 80% sequence
homology with SARS-CoV, but 96% homology with a
bat coronavirus and 92% with a pangolin coronavirus,
suggesting it arouse in animals and then spread between
species to humans. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2
binds to its cellular receptor, the angiotensin converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2), which also acts as receptor for SARS-
CoV. Viral entry occurs after proteolytic cleavage of the
spike protein by the transmembrane protease TMPRSS2.
ACE2 is expressed abundantly in lung alveolar cells, but
also in many cell types and organs in the body, including
the cerebral cortex, digestive tract, kidney, gallbladder, tes-
tis, and adrenal gland.4
Experience with the neurological complications of
MERS and SARS provides a framework for considering
both reported and potential neurological complications
with SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.5–10 In both MERS
and SARS, signiﬁcant neurological complications were for-
tunately extremely rare. Reported cases of neurological dis-
ease suggests a minimum incidence of ~1:200 cases
(MERS) -1:1,000 cases (SARS). It is important to recog-
nize, however, that the total number of conﬁrmed cases of
MERS and SARS together is only ~10,500 cases. It is
likely that the sheer numeracy of COVID-19 compared to
MERS and SARS, with nearly 6 million cases reported
worldwide to date, will bring out a broader spectrum of
neurological manifestations. In MERS and SARS neurologi-
cal disease could be considered in three major categories:
(1) the neurological consequences of the associated pulmo-
nary and systemic diseases, including encephalopathy and
stroke, (2) direct central nervous system (CNS) invasion by
virus, including encephalitis, and (3) postinfectious and
potentially
immune-mediated
complications,
including
Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) and its variants and acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM).
Neurological Complications of Systemic
COVID-19
In a review of 214 patients hospitalized in 3 dedicated
COVID-19 hospitals in Wuhan, China, 36% of patients
had nerurologic.11 These were further subdivided into
those thought to reﬂect CNS, peripheral nervous system
(PNS), and skeletal muscle injury. Overall, 25% of
patients had symptoms considered as evidence of CNS
dysfunction, including dizziness (17%), headache (13%),
impaired consciousness (7.5%), acute cerebrovascular dis-
ease (3%), ataxia (0.5%), and seizures (0.5%). Conﬁrming
this low incidence of seizures, no cases of status epilepticus
or new onset seizures were reported in a large cohort of
over 304 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Hubei
Province, China,12 although there have been isolated case
reports describing seizures at presentation in both adult
and pediatric patients with COVID-19.13,14
In the series by Mao and colleagues,11 the patients
were subdivided based on the severity of their pneumonia
and pulmonary impairment, and among those with
“severe” disease (n = 88) the incidence of CNS symptoms
was higher (31%) compared to the non-severe group
(21%), although the results were not statistically signiﬁ-
cant (p = 0.09). Although all the categorized CNS symp-
toms occurred more frequently in patients with severe
disease compared to non-severe disease, only impaired
consciousness (15% in severe vs 2% in non-severe,
p < 0.001) and acute cerebrovascular disease (5.7% vs
0.8%; p = 0.03) were signiﬁcantly different between the
two groups. Diagnostic studies were limited, but the
impairment of consciousness seems most consistent with
encephalopathy. Not surprisingly, when compared to
those with non-severe disease, the severe cohort were older
(58  15 years vs 49  15 years), and more likely to have
comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, malig-
nancy, cardiac, cerebrovascular, or kidney disease (48% vs
33%; p = 0.03). The severe group also had more evidence
of systemic inﬂammation, including elevated C-reactive
protein (CRP; median 37 mg/L) and D-dimer (median
0.9 mg/L) compared to non-severe cases, and were also
more likely to have evidence of hepatic (elevated alanine
and aspartate aminotransferases) and renal (elevated BUN
and creatinine) dysfunction.
A second survey of 58 hospitalized patients (median
age 63 years) with COVID-19 ARDS at Strasbourg Uni-
versity Hospital found that 69% of patients had agitation,
67% had corticospinal tract signs, and 36% had a
“dysexecutive” syndrome with difﬁculty in concentration,
attention, orientation, and following commands.15 All
patients studied (11/11) had evidence of frontal hypo-
perfusion on arterial spin label and dynamic susceptibility-
weighted perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Only seven patients had a cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) exam-
ination, none had a pleocytosis, and none had SARS-
CoV-2 RNA detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). One patient did have elevated
immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels and “mildly” elevated
total protein. CSF speciﬁc oligoclonal bands (OCBs) were

not detected, but one patient had “mirror pattern” OCBs
in CSF and serum.
In a study of MRI abnormalities in patients in the
intensive
care
unit
(ICU)
with
COVID-19,
21%
(50/235) of patients developed neurological symptoms.16
In this group of neurologically symptomatic patients, only
27 had MRIs performed, and of these 44% (12/27) had
new acute ﬁndings. Surprisingly, 56% (15/27) had no
new MRI changes. The most common new abnormalities
were multifocal areas of cortical ﬂuid-attenuated inversion
recovery (FLAIR) signal (10/12), accompanied in three
patients by areas of increased FLAIR signal in the subcor-
tical and deep white matter. One patient each had new
transverse sinus thrombosis and acute middle cerebral
artery infarction. Five of the 10 patients with cortical
FLAIR abnormalities had a CSF examination, and none
of these patients had a pleocytosis elevated IgG index, or
OCBs (0/3 tested), although 4 patients had an elevated
protein (mean 80 mg/dl; range = 60–110). RT-PCR for
SARS-CoV-2 was negative in all 5 cases tested. In another
MRI series of critically ill patients on mechanical ventila-
tion, many were found to have conﬂuent T2 hyper-
intensities and restricted diffusion in the deep and
subcortical white matter, in some cases, accompanied by
punctate microhemorrhages in the juxtacortical and cal-
losal white matter that resembled ﬁndings seen in delayed
post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy.17
The mechanism of encephalopathy in COVID-19
remains
to
be
determined.
From
available
studies,
COVID-19 encephalopathy seems to be more common in
patients
with
more
severe
disease,
associated
com-
orbidities, evidence of multi-organ system dysfunction,
including hypoxemia, and renal and hepatic impairment,
and elevated markers of systemic inﬂammation. Virus is
not detected in CSF by RT-PCR and pleocytosis is usually
absent. Some patients may have altered perfusion detect-
able by MRI, others have leukoencephalopathy with or
without punctate microhemorrhages. This group needs to
be distinguished from patients with encephalitis (who have
a
pleocytosis)
and
postinfectious
immune-mediated
encephalitis (see below).
In
a
series
of
ﬁve
consecutive
patients
with
COVID-19 with delayed awakening post-mechanical venti-
lation for ARDS, MRI showed enhancement of the wall of
basal skull arteries without enlargement of the vessel wall or
stenosis. Toxic-metabolic derangements and seizures were
ruled out, CSF SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was negative in all
and they showed marked improvement in alertness 48 to
72 hours after treatment with methylprednisolone 0.5
g/days iv for 5 days. These ﬁndings suggest that an endo-
thelialitis rather than a vasculitis was responsible for the
encephalopathy.18 Direct infection of endothelial cells by
SARS-CoV-2 and associated endothelial inﬂammation has
been demonstrated histologically in postmortem specimens
from a variety of organs, which did not include the brain.19
However, in an autopsy series, including examina-
tion of the brain, of 20 patients with COVID-19, six had
microthrombi and acute infarctions and two focal paren-
chymal inﬁltrates of T-lymphocytes, whereas the others
mainly had minimal inﬂammation and slight neuronal loss
without acute hypoxic–ischemic changes in most cases.
There was no evidence of meningoencephalitis, microglial
nodules, or viral inclusions, including in the olfactory
bulbs and brainstem, and no demyelination. ACE2 was
expressed in lung and brain capillaries. All cases had evi-
dence of systemic inﬂammation.20
A second major manifestation of systemic COVID-
19 disease is acute cerebrovascular disease. In the study by
Mao and colleagues,11 this was present in 6 of the
214 (3%) hospitalized cases, but 5 of the 6 events
occurred in those with severe disease (incidence 6%;
p = 0.03 vs non-severe disease).11 Five of the six reported
events were ischemic strokes, and one was hemorrhagic.
In the review of cases at Strasbourg University Hospital,15
3 of 13 (23%) had cerebral ischemic stroke. In a single
center retrospective study from China of 221 patients hos-
pitalized with COVID-19, 13 had acute strokes, including
11 ischemic, 1 hemorrhagic, and 1 venous sinus thrombo-
sis.21 The stroke patients were older, had more com-
orbidities, including diabetes, hypertension, and a prior
stroke, and elevated inﬂammatory markers, including
D-dimer and CRP. Another review of six consecutive
patients with COVID-19 admitted to the National Hospi-
tal in Queen Square with stroke, noted that occlusions
typically involved large vessels and often occurred in mul-
tiple vascular territories.22 In 5 of 6 cases, the strokes
occurred 8 to 24 days after onset of COVID-19 symp-
toms. All patients had a highly prothrombotic state with
very high D-dimer levels and elevated ferritin. Five of the
six patients had detectable lupus anticoagulant, suggesting
another potential prothrombotic mechanism for stroke in
COVID-19. Anticardiolipin IgA and antiphospholipid
IgA and IgM antibodies directed against β2-glycoprotein-1
were also found in three patients with COVID-associated
multiple territory large vessel infarctions.23 Finally, a post-
mortem MRI study showed subcortical micro- and macro-
bleeds (two decedents), cortico-subcortical edematous
changes evocative of posterior reversible encephalopathy
syndrome (PRES; one decedent), and nonspeciﬁc deep
white matter changes (one decedent).24
Although initial reports emphasized acute cerebro-
vascular disease in older patients with COVID-19, a
recent report described ﬁve cases of large vessel stroke as a
presenting feature of COVID-19 in younger individuals,
July 2020

two of whom lacked classic stroke risk factors.25 These
patients ranged in age from 33 to 49 years. Two of the
ﬁve patients had diabetes, one of whom had had a mild
prior stroke, and one had hypertension and dyslipidemia.
The infarcts involved large vessel territories, including the
middle cerebral artery (3), posterior cerebral artery (1), and
internal carotid artery (1). Two patients had preceding
COVID-19 symptoms, including fever, chills, cough, and
headache; one patient had only lethargy. Surprisingly, two
of the ﬁve patients had no COVID-19-related symptoms
preceding their stroke presentation. These ﬁve patients had
elevated prothrombin (range = 12.8–15.2 seconds) and acti-
vated partial thromboplastin times (range = 25–42.7 seconds),
elevated ﬁbrinogen (range = 370–739 mg/dl), D-dimer
(range = 52–13,800 ng/ml) and ferritin (range = 7–1,564
ng/ml) consistent with a hypercoagulable state and the pres-
ence of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
COVID-19 cerebrovascular disease seems to be pre-
dominantly ischemic and to involve large vessels. In older
individuals, it reﬂects the underlying severity of systemic dis-
ease as well as the hyperinﬂammatory state, whereas in
younger patients, it seems to be due to hypercoagulopathy.
Children with a Kawasaki disease-like multisystem inﬂam-
matory syndrome (MIS) have recently been described.26,27
Patients
with
Kawasaki
disease
can
develop
cerebral
vasculopathy and forms of neurological involvement, and in
one series of 10 COVID-19 associated cases of MIS, two
patients had meningeal symptoms.27 As noted, in addition
to hypercoagulable states, SARS-CoV-2 can infect and
injure endothelial cells. However, it remains to be deter-
mined whether virus-induced injury to endothelial cells
(a vasculopathy) or even true vasculitis contributes to
COVID-19 related cerebrovascular syndromes, and this
determination will require additional detailed vessel imaging
and neuropathological analyses. Similarly, the number of
cases is too small to determine the comparative therapeutic
beneﬁt, if any, of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs or
immunomodulatory therapies in COVID-19 associated neu-
rovascular syndromes.
Neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV-2
In contrast to encephalopathy, in which evidence for
direct invasion by virus of the CNS is absent, encephalitis
occurs when direct invasion of the CNS by virus produces
tissue injury and neurological dysfunction. Evidence for
direct invasion of the CNS was seen in patients with
SARS. Xu and colleagues described a fatal case in a
39-year-old man with delirium that progressed to somno-
lence and coma.10 At postmortem, the SARS-CoV antigen
was detected in brain tissue by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) and viral RNA by in situ hybridization (ISH).
SARS-CoV virions were seen by transmission electron
microscopy of brain tissue inoculated cell culture. In a
postmortem analysis of four patients with SARS, low level
infection of cerebral neurons with SARS-CoV (1–24% of
cells) was seen in the cerebrum in all four cases by IHC
and ISH, although none of the cases had virus detected in
the cerebellum.28
By deﬁnition, encephalitis is an inﬂammatory pro-
cess, with supportive evidence, including the presence of a
CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein. However, in studies
of transgenic mice expressing the human SARS-CoV
receptor, ACE2, infection with SARS-CoV was associated
with viral entry into the CNS, spread within the CNS,
and neuronal injury with relatively limited inﬂamma-
tion.29 This suggests the possibility that, in some cases of
SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion, that signs of inﬂammation
could be modest or even absent. Regardless of the pres-
ence or absence of inﬂammation, diagnostic studies may
show evidence of either a generalized or focal CNS pro-
cess, including areas of attenuation on computed tomogra-
phy (CT), hyperintense signal on FLAIR, or T2-weighted
sequences on MRI, and focal patterns, including seizures
on
electroencephalogram
(EEG).
Deﬁnitive
evidence
supporting direct viral invasion would include a positive
CSF RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2, demonstration of intra-
thecal synthesis of SARS-CoV-2-speciﬁc antibodies, or
detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigen or RNA in brain tissue
obtained at biopsy or autopsy.
Cases
meeting
strict
criteria
for
encephalitis
resulting
from
direct
SARS-CoV-2
are
currently
extremely rare, although several plausible case reports
have now surfaced. Moriguchi et al described a 24-year-
old
man
with
COVID-19
disease
who
developed
nuchal rigidity,
progressively
decreased
consciousness
(Glasgow Coma Scale [GCS] = 6), and generalized sei-
zures.30 CSF showed a slight mononuclear predominant
pleocytosis (12 cells/μl3) and elevated opening pressure
(>320 mm H20). Neuroimaging showed hippocampal
and mesial temporal increased FLAIR signal and the CSF
RT-PCR was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately,
studies to exclude other viral etiologies of encephalitis
were limited. A second case involved a 41-year-old
woman with headache, fever, a new onset seizure, and
photophobia and nuchal rigidity, followed by hallucina-
tions and disorientation. A head CT scan was normal and
MRI was not performed. An EEG showed generalized
slowing. The CSF examination showed a lymphocytic
pleocytosis (70 cells/μl; 100% lymphocytes), and elevated
protein (100 mg/dl), and a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-
PCR.31,32
Several cases have emerged in which patients had
inﬂammatory features consistent with encephalitis, but

who did not have evidence of direct viral CNS invasion.
Bernard-Valnet et al reported on two patients with
“meningoencephalitis
concomitant
to
SARS-CoV2.”33
These patients had nuchal rigidity, altered mental status,
mild CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis (17–21 cells/μl3 on ini-
tial lumbar puncture [LP]), and mildly elevated CSF pro-
tein (46–47 mg/dl). However, in both patients, the MRI
was normal and neither patient had a positive CSF RT-
PCR for SARS-CoV-2. Similarly, Pilotto et al describe a
60-year-old man with COVID-19 who developed confu-
sion, irritability, and then apathy progressing to “akinetic
mutism” with nuchal rigidity.34 The CSF showed a mild
lymphocytic pleocytosis (18 cells/μl3) and elevated protein
(70 mg/dl). An EEG showed generalized slowing with an
anterior predominance. The CT and MRI were normal,
and CSF RT-PCR was negative twice for SARS-CoV-2.
Although treated with a wide variety of medications, this
patient showed improvement coincident to administration
of
high
dose
methylprednisolone.34
Another
study
reported on six critically ill patients with severe ARDS,
elevated inﬂammatory markers, and depressed conscious-
ness and/or agitation, who were considered to have “auto-
immune meningoencephalitis.”35 No patient had a CSF
pleocytosis but ﬁve had elevated CSF protein (52–131
mg/dL) and three had an MRI that showed cortical hyper-
intensities with sulcal effacement. There were no controls
but patients were felt to have responded to plasma
exchange. In one report, a patient with neuropsychiatric
symptoms and COVID-19 had a “hematic” CSF tap with
960 “red and white blood cells” and an elevated protein
(65
mg/dL)
and
detectable
N-methyl-D-aspartate
(NMDA) receptor antibodies. This currently isolated case
also raises the possibility that COVID-19 may trigger
auto-antibody production.36
The available studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 can
rarely produce a true encephalitis or meningoencephalitis
with associated evidence of direct viral invasion of the
CNS. The failure to detect virus in CSF in the other
reported cases,
despite evidence of inﬂammation as
evidenced by CSF pleocytosis and elevated protein, raises
the possibility that some cases of COVID-19 encephalitis
may occur in the absence of direct virus invasion, and
could potentially result from immune-mediated inﬂamma-
tory mechanisms (see below). It is important to realize
that techniques, including detection of intrathecal SARS-
CoV-2 antibody synthesis or of viral antigen or nucleic
acid in brain tissue, may establish evidence for viral inva-
sion when CSF RT-PCR studies are negative. For exam-
ple,
detection
of
intrathecal
antibody
synthesis
is
signiﬁcantly more sensitive than CSF nucleic acid ampliﬁ-
cation tests for diagnosis of both West Nile Virus
neuroinvasive
disease
and
Enterovirus
(EV)-D68
associated acute ﬂaccid myelitis (AFM).37–39 In the case of
EV-D68-associated
AFM,
nasopharyngeal
and
throat
swabs are frequently positive for virus by RT-PCR when
obtained early after disease onset, yet, CSF RT-PCR tests
are only positive in a small minority (<3%) of cases.40
The sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in properly per-
formed nasopharyngeal swabs for detection of acute
COVID-19 is high, but data are currently too limited to
evaluate sensitivity of this technique in CSF in patients
with neurological disease.
Post-Infectious and Immune-Mediated
Complications of SARS-CoV-2
The identiﬁcation of postinfectious complications of
SARS-CoV-2 would be expected to temporally lag behind
those resulting from acute infection. Occasional cases of
GBS and its variants and of ADEM were reported after
MERS and SARS.5,7,9 Reports are now emerging of simi-
lar associations with COVID-19 and GBS, and with GBS
variants, including the Miller-Fisher syndrome.41–46 The
largest series to date, describes ﬁve patients.47 In this
series, all patients developed GBS 5 to 10 days following
COVID-19 symptom onset. The clinical presentation
included bilateral multi-limb ﬂaccid weakness with are-
ﬂexia. Three patients had associated respiratory failure and
two had associated facial weakness. MRI showed caudal
root nerve enhancement in two cases and enhancement of
the
facial
nerve
in
a
third
case.
The
CSF
was
normocellular in all ﬁve cases, and had an elevated protein
consistent with albuminocytological dissociation in three
cases. Electrophysiological studies showed reduced com-
pound motor amplitudes and prolonged distal latencies,
and the overall pattern was felt to be consistent with
demyelination in two cases and axonal neuropathy in
three cases. Fibrillation potentials were seen by electromy-
ography (EMG) acutely in three patients and later in a
fourth patient. None of the patients had SARS-CoV-2
detected in the CSF by RT-PCR. Antiganglioside anti-
bodies were absent in the three tested patients. All patients
received intravenous immunoglobulin (ivIG) and one
plasma exchange, although improvement was noted in
only two cases (one “mild improvement” only).
Cases of acute necrotizing encephalopathy (ANE)
have been reported in COVID-19.48,49 One patient was a
50-year-old woman with COVID-19 conﬁrmed by naso-
pharyngeal RT-PCR who developed altered mental status
and MRI and CT ﬁndings typical of ANE, including
bilateral thalamic lesions. Unfortunately, CSF studies were
limited and CSF RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was
not performed. A second case occurred in a 59-year-old
woman with aplastic anemia who developed seizures and

reduced

10 days
after
onset
of
her
COVID-19 symptoms.49 The mechanism behind ANE
remains unknown, and either direct viral or postinfectious
inﬂammatory processes have been postulated to play a
role, and many cases have been reported after upper respi-
ratory infections, including inﬂuenza. Some patients have
mutations in RAN binding protein-2 (RANBP2), indicat-
ing that host genetic factors may also play a role in
susceptibility.
Rare cases of ADEM were associated with MERS.6
The ﬁrst case of “COVID-19 associated disseminated
encephalomyelitis”
was
reported
in
a
40-year-old
woman.50 This individual had COVID-19 symptoms
followed 11 days later by dysarthria, dysphagia, facial
weakness, and a gaze preference. A chest X-ray showed
pneumonia and nasopharyngeal RT-PCR was positive for
SARS-CoV-2. Head CT showed multiple areas of patchy
hypoattenuation and an MRI showed areas of increased
FLAIR and T2 signal in the subcortical and deep white
matter that were felt to be consistent with demyelination.
Her CSF was normal. A second reported case was in a
54-year-old woman who developed seizures and neurologi-
cal deterioration (GCS = 12) and had chest X-ray lesions
consistent with COVID-19 and a positive nasopharyngeal
RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2.51 Her MRI showed multiple
periventricular T2 hyperintense, nonenhancing, lesions in
the white matter of the cerebrum, brainstem, and spinal
cord consistent with multifocal demyelination. Her CSF
studies were unremarkable, including a negative CSF RT-
PCR for SARS CoV-2. She was treated with high dose
dexamethasone and her symptoms gradually resolved. A
single case of acute ﬂaccid myelitis has also been described
in COVID-19.52 This patient developed upper limb
weakness and a ﬂaccid areﬂexic lower limb paralysis, uri-
nary and bowel incontinence, and a T10 sensory level.
Unfortunately, neither spine imaging nor CSF studies
were available so the mechanism remains unknown. The
most convincing example of ADEM-like pathology associ-
ated with COVID-19 was in a 71-year-old man who
developed
symptoms
immediately
following
coronary
bypass graft surgery that progressed to respiratory failure
and a hyperinﬂammatory state. A postmortem examina-
tion showed brain swelling and disseminated hemorrhagic
lesions and subcortical white matter pathology with peri-
venular myelin injury but also necrotic blood vessels and
perivascular inﬂammation. The lesions had features of
both acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis and of acute
disseminated encephalomyelitis.53
The rarity of postinfectious potentially immune-
mediated cases following COVID-19 other than GBS and
its variants, and the general paucity of details, makes their
status unclear. The cases of ADEM-like illness are hard to
distinguish from some of the patients with acute encepha-
lopathy and associated MRI white matter lesions, but can
be differentiated from cases of encephalitis by the absence
of CSF pleocytosis. GBS is a common neurological disease
even in the absence of COVID-19, and identifying the
magnitude of the COVID-19 risk and association will
require better epidemiological data. However, the 5 cases
of GBS occurring in a population of 1,000 to 1,200
patients with COVID-19 seen over a 1 month period by
Toscano et al in Northern Italy suggest an incidence that
is much higher than that can be expected in the general
population (~1/100,000 person-years).54 The mechanism
of pathogenesis will need to be identiﬁed, and the efﬁcacy
of conventional therapies, including ivIG and plasma
exchange, evaluated.
Other COVID-19 Related Neurological
Disorders
One of the more striking reported symptom manifesta-
tions in patients with COVID-19 is loss or perturbation
of smell (anosmia or hyposmia) and/or taste (dysgeusia).
The frequency of these symptoms, their speciﬁcity as a
potential diagnostic clue for COVID-19 infection as
opposed to inﬂuenza or other symptomatologic similar
diseases, and their implication for understanding viral
pathogenesis
all
remain
uncertain.
In
the
Wuhan
COVID-19 series, impairment of smell was noted in 5%
and of taste in 6% of the 214 hospitalized patients.11 It is
likely that the frequency was under-represented due to
incomplete evaluations in these hospitalized sick patients.
A later study of 31 patients, suggested that disorders of
taste occurred in 81% of COVID-19 cases (46% anosmia,
29% hyposmia, and 6% dysosmia) and disorders of taste
in 94% (ageusia 45%, hypogeusia 23%, and dysgeusia
26%).55 The average duration of smell and taste disorders
in the COVID-19 cases was 7.1  3.1 days. A multicen-
ter European study of 417 cases with “mild-to-moderate”
COVID-19 disease found a similarly high frequency of
olfactory dysfunction (86%), with 80% of those affected
having anosmia and 20% hyposmia.56 Approximately
70% of patients had recovered within 8 days of symptom
onset. It has been suggested that olfactory and/or gusta-
tory dysfunction may be indicative of neuro-invasion and
provide a route from the nasopharynx or oropharynx to
cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla, based on studies
of transgenic mice expressing the human SARS virus
receptor (ACE2) and infected with SARS-CoV, however,
no evidence supporting host entry via this pathway yet
exists in man.29 The transient nature of the dysfunction
in most patients would seem to make direct viral infection
and subsequent killing of olfactory or gustatory neurons

unlikely. MRI of the olfactory bulb was normal in one
RT-PCR conﬁrmed patient with anosmia.57
In the Wuhan COVID-19 series, 11% of patients
were reported to have evidence of skeletal muscle injury
(deﬁned as a creatine kinase [CK] >200 U/L and skeletal
muscle pain).11 Injury was signiﬁcantly more common in
patients with “severe” disease (19%) compared to non-
severe disease (5%; p < 0.001). Unfortunately, almost no
clinical details were provided beyond the presence of asso-
ciated
muscle
pain.
Subsequently
two
reports
have
emerged of rhabdomyolysis as either a presenting feature
or a late complication of COVID-19.58,59 One patient
had limb pain and weakness with a peak CK of ~12,000
U/L and myoglobulin >12,000 μg/L, and the other had a
peak CK of 13,581 U/L. Neither patient had muscle
biopsy performed. The mechanism of injury remains to be
determined.
Immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and
Implication for Management and Treatment
of Neurologic Manifestations
One of the most puzzling features of SARS-CoV-2 infec-
tion is that it is asymptomatic or associated with minor
symptoms in approximately 80% of patients, especially
children and young adults, whereas 20% will develop
COVID-19 with various degrees of severity. Can knowl-
edge gathered on SARS-CoV inform us about the immu-
nopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2? A successful production
of type I interferon (IFN) response is a key ﬁrst line
defense for suppressing replication of many neurotropic
viruses at the site of entry and dissemination. SARS-CoV
suppresses type I IFN response and downstream signaling
using multiple strategies, and this dampening is closely
associated with disease severity.60
Because SARS-CoV-2 shares an overall genomic sim-
ilarity of 80% with SARS-CoV and uses the same recep-
tor, it is reasonable to expect that the innate immune
mechanisms involved in pathogenesis will be similar for
the two viruses. SARS-CoV has developed multiple strate-
gies to evade the innate immune response in order to
optimize its replication capacity.61 It seems likely that
SARS-CoV-2 uses the same strategy. The magnitude of
the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 needs to be
precisely calibrated to control viral replication without
triggering
immunopathogenic
injury.
A
hyper-
inﬂammatory response likely plays a major role in ARDS
and, in a subset of children, may contribute to the devel-
opment of a Kawasaki-like multisystem inﬂammatory dis-
order.20 In a mouse model of SARS, rapid SARS-CoV
replication and delay in IFN-I signaling led to inﬂamma-
tory monocyte–macrophage accumulation, resulting in
elevated lung cytokine/chemokine levels and associated
vascular leakage and lethal pneumonia. This “cytokine
storm,” in turn, was associated with a decrease in T cell
counts and suboptimal T cell responses to SARS-CoV
infection.62
The same pattern is found in 522 patients with
COVID-19, where the number of total T cells, CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells, were dramatically reduced, especially in those
requiring ICU care, and T cell numbers were negatively cor-
related to serum IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α concentration.
Conversely, patients in the disease resolution period showed
reduced IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α levels and restored T cell
counts.63 These data were corroborated by other groups
who also noticed a decrease in type 1 interferon response in
severely affected patients.64,65 It has been suggested that
reduced and delayed IFN gamma production (“too little
and too late”) in the lungs and depletion of both CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells may combine to potentiate viral injury, by
reducing control of viral replication and enhancing the
upregulation
of
pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines,
including
TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-10 (“cytokine storm”), and that it
may be the immune dysregulation as much or more than
the direct viral infection that results in pulmonary epithelial
cell injury, and similar mechanisms could be operative in
the CNS.66
What are the possible mechanisms for the apparent
immune dysregulation seen in those patients and could
they have a role in the neuropathogenesis of COVID-19?
The source of cytokines found in the serum in unclear,
but they could be produced by lung macrophages. IL-6
could also come from infected neurons, as seen in a trans-
genic mouse model of SARS-Cov.29 A high level of circu-
lating cytokines, in turn, could lead to lymphocytopenia.
TNF-α, a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine, may cause T cell
apoptosis via interacting with its receptor, TNFR1, which
expression is increased in aged T cells.67,68 IL-6, that has
both pro-inﬂammatory and anti-inﬂammatory properties,
contributes to host defense in response to infections.
However, continual synthesis of IL-6 has been shown to
play a pathological role in chronic inﬂammation and
infection.69,70 IL-10, an inhibitory cytokine that prevents
T cell proliferation, can also induce T cell exhaustion.
Interestingly, patients with COVID-19 have high levels
of the PD-1 and Tim-3 exhaustion markers on their
T cells.63 In turn, decreased numbers of CD4+ and
CD8+ T lymphocytes will considerably weaken the cellu-
lar immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in severe cases, all-
owing further viral replication. This can be compounded
by the use of corticosteroids. Of note, a study in convales-
cent patients with SARS-CoV showed that CD8+ T cell
responses were more frequent and had a greater magni-
tude of response than CD4+ T cells.71 Finally, one

autopsy series of patients with COVID-19 showed histo-
logical features suggestive of secondary hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), also known as macrophage
activation syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by
an imbalance of innate and adaptive immune responses
with aberrant activation of macrophages, and a blunted
adaptive immune response.20
This dysregulated immune response may have a
role in the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 encephalopa-
thy. High levels of circulating pro-inﬂammatory cyto-
kines
can
cause
a
confusion
and
alteration
of
consciousness, whereas a weakened T cell response may
be unable to eliminate virus-infected cells in the brain
causing further neurologic dysfunction. Careful studies
of the CSF cytokine proﬁle and T cell response to SARS-
CoV-2 as well as postmortem studies, including CNS
and muscle tissues, are urgently needed to better under-
stand the neuropathogenesis of COVID-19. These will
help inform whether therapeutic strategies aimed at
blocking pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, including the IL-6
inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab, could have a bene-
ﬁcial effect on encephalopathy or whether corticosteroids
that dampened the adaptive cellular immune response to
viruses are contra-indicated. As we strive to ﬁnd medica-
tions to counter the deleterious inﬂammatory state trig-
gered by SARS-CoV-2, lessons can also be learned from
COVID-19 outcomes in patients with neurological dis-
eases, such as multiple sclerosis or myasthenia gravis,
treated with immunomodulatory therapies.
Although we are only starting to grasp the complex-
ity of SARS-CoV-2 biology, it is already apparent that
COVID-19 causes a global threat to the entire nervous
system, both through its worldwide distribution and mul-
tifactorial pathogenic mechanisms (Fig). As we hope for a
vaccine or a cure, neurologists will play an important role
in diagnosing, investigating, and treating the many neuro-
logic manifestations of COVID-19 (Table).72
