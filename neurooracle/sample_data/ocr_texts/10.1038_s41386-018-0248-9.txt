Cognitive control represents an essential neuropsychological characteristic that allows for the rapid adaption of a changing
environment by constant re-allocation of cognitive resources. This ﬁnely tuned mechanism is impaired in psychiatric disorders such
as schizophrenia and contributes to cognitive deﬁcits. Neuroimaging has highlighted the contribution of the anterior cingulate
cortex (ACC) and prefrontal regions (PFC) on cognitive control and demonstrated the impact of genetic variation, as well as genetic
liability for schizophrenia. In this study, we aimed to examine the inﬂuence of the functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
rs6265 of a plasticity-related neurotrophic factor gene, BDNF (Val66Met), on cognitive control. Strong evidence implicates BDNF
Val66Met in neural plasticity in humans. Furthermore, several studies suggest that although the variant is not convincingly
associated with schizophrenia risk, it seems to be a modiﬁer of the clinical presentation and course of the disease. In order to clarify
the underlying mechanisms using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we studied the effects of this SNP on ACC and
PFC activation, and the connectivity between these regions in a discovery sample of 85 healthy individuals and sought to replicate
this effect in an independent sample of 253 individuals. Additionally, we tested the identiﬁed imaging phenotype in relation to
schizophrenia familial risk in a sample of 58 unaffected ﬁrst-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients. We found a signiﬁcant
increase in interregional connectivity between ACC and PFC in the risk-associated BDNF 66Met allele carriers. Furthermore, we
replicated this effect in an independent sample and demonstrated its independence of structural confounds, as well as task
speciﬁcity. A similar coupling increase was detectable in individuals with increased familial risk for schizophrenia. Our results show
that a key neural circuit for cognitive control is inﬂuenced by a plasticity-related genetic variant, which may render this circuit
particular susceptible to genetic and environmental risk factors for schizophrenia.

INTRODUCTION
Successful goal-directed behavior critically depends on the ability
to adapt to an ever-changing environment, requiring a ﬂexible yet
resilient control mechanism [1]. Although recent research reports
the involvement of several neural networks in cognitive control
[2], a meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies highlights
the importance of two interacting brain regions, namely the
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the dorsolateral and medial
shares of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) [3]. Theoretical and empirical
accounts suggest a contribution of both regions to different
components of cognitive control. Although the ACC is preferen-
tially involved in conﬂict detection and allocation of cognitive
resources for conﬂict resolution [4, 5], the PFC is associated with
top–down regulatory control and response selection [6, 7].
Primate studies point to a structurally linked network in which
ACC acts as a modulator of signal-to-noise ratios in the PFC via its
projections to inhibitory interneurons in the lateral and medial
parts of Brodmann area 9 (BA9) [8]. Aberrations in cognitive
control form a central component of neuropsychological deﬁcits
in
mental
disorders,
e.g.,
in
schizophrenia
[9].
Task-based
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) work relates
cognitive control dysfunction in schizophrenia patients and their
healthy siblings to reduced activity in PFC and ACC, as well as to
aberrant functional connectivity between both regions [10].
Moreover, altered functional interaction of PFC and ACC during
cognitive control has been observed in carriers of a genome-wide
signiﬁcant psychosis risk variant [11]. These data highlight the
value of this neuroimaging phenotype for psychiatric research.

A promising locus for genetic research in cognition is the brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene that stands out for its
impact on synaptic plasticity, neural development [12], and brain
functional
connectivity
[13].
In
BDNF,
a
functional
single-
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at codon 66 leads to a Valine
(Val) to Methionine (Met) substitution (BDNF Val66Met, G to A)
causing the 66Met-carriers (A;G and A;A) of this variant (relative to
the more frequent “wild type” G;G-carriers) to show disrupted
intracellular trafﬁcking of the BDNF-mRNA [14], and diminished
activity-dependent secretion of the neurotrophin [15].
The majority of imaging genetics research on BDNF Val66Met
has focused on memory function, while few studies have
examined the effects of the variant on cognitive control. Using
electroencephalography, Soltesz reported a BDNF-dependent
modulation of error monitoring and behavioral adaptation during
an assay of cognitive control, the ﬂanker task [16]. Here,
66Met allele carriers showed relative decrease in neural activity
and synchrony, pointing to an effect of the variant on the
neuronal networks subserving error and conﬂict monitoring.
A wealth of studies has implicated BDNF Val66Met as a genetic
risk factor and/or modiﬁer of heritable mental disorders such as
bipolar disorder or schizophrenia [17–20]. Speciﬁcally, although
the role of the Met allele as a risk-conferring factor for
schizophrenia has recently been questioned by a genome-wide
association (GWA) data [21, 22], mounting evidence suggests that
BDNF Val66Met plays a role as a modiﬁer of the genetic risk
architecture [19, 23, 24] and clinical presentation of schizophrenia
[25–27], including age of onset [24], severity of cognitive deﬁcits
[28–31], and treatment response [32, 33].
In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of the BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism on cognitive control using fMRI and a
neuroimaging implementation of the ﬂanker task [1]. Our work
pursued speciﬁc aims: ﬁrst, as ACC has been proposed as a critical
modulator of signal-to-noise ratios in the PFC [8], we tested for
potential effects of BDNF genotype on the activation and
functional connectivity of both regions in a discovery sample of
85 healthy individuals; second, we sought to replicate the same
task and comparable neuroimaging procedures in an independent
sample of 253 healthy individuals; third, to address whether the
identiﬁed neuroimaging phenotype may relate to schizophrenia
familial risk, we examined 58 healthy ﬁrst-degree relatives of
schizophrenia patients for the presence of matching neural
alterations. We conducted two follow-up analyses to probe the
speciﬁcity of the identiﬁed connectivity phenotype for active
task performance and its potential relationship to structural
confounds.

center imaging genetics study at three sites in Germany: Bonn,

tary “Methods” section.
Flanker task
Brain function was studied using a well-established cognitive
control task that challenges response inhibition and error
monitoring and provokes activations in a network of brain regions
including dorsal ACC and lateral and medial PFC (mPFC) [1, 10, 11].
In this event-related task, sets of ﬁve symbols are displayed
consisting of a central target arrow (pointing to the left or the
right side), which is ﬂanked by pairs of non-target symbols on
each side. In the “congruent” condition, the central arrow is ﬂanked
by pairs of arrows pointing in the same direction as the central
arrow. In the “incongruent” condition, the ﬂanking arrows are
oriented in the opposite direction of the central arrow. In the
“neutral” condition, the central arrow is ﬂanked by pairs of boxes.
In all three conditions, the subjects are asked to indicate the
direction of the central arrow as quickly and accurately as possible
by pressing the left or right button of an MRI-compatible response
device using their index and middle ﬁnger, respectively. In a
fourth condition (“no go”), the central arrow is ﬂanked by pairs of
the letter “X”, which instruct the individuals to withhold their
responses [1]. Each stimulus was presented for 800 milliseconds
(ms) with a variable interstimulus interval of 2200–5200 ms.
During this interstimulus interval, a ﬁxation crosshair was shown.
Task duration was 10.1 min or 302 whole-brain scans. Task
performance was assessed in terms of response time (RT, in ms)
and accuracy (in percent correct) for each condition.
Resting-state task
Prior to the 5 min (or 150 whole-brain scans) resting-state task, we
instructed participants to close their eyes, relax, and refrain from
any speciﬁc mental activity. After the end of each scan,
investigators veriﬁed with the participants that they had not
fallen asleep during data acquisition.
MRI data acquisition and fMRI data preprocessing
For details on MRI data acquisition and fMRI data processing, see
the supplementary “Methods” section.
Activation analysis
We performed a statistical analysis on individual subject level
using a general linear model (GLM) as implemented in SPM8. The
four task conditions were modeled as separate regressors of
interest, and the six realignment parameters from the preproces-
sing step were added as regressors of no interest to the model.
During model estimation, a high-pass ﬁlter of 128 s (SPMs built-in
DCT ﬁlter) and an autoregressive model of the ﬁrst order were
applied. In order to investigate brain activity related to response
inhibition and interference monitoring, ﬁrst-level models were
deﬁned, and differential contrasts
were calculated for the
contrasts, “no-go vs. neutral” and “incongruent vs. congruent”,
respectively. First-level contrast images were subjected to second-
level statistical inference by means of: (1) one sample t-tests for
within-group analysis of the contrast images to explore the effects
of task, and (2) univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) models for
between-group analyses (Val/Val homozygotes vs. Met allele
carriers, relatives vs. controls) with group as a factor, whereas
age and sex were covariates of no interest. We additionally
covaried for site for all the analyses involving multi-site data
(replication sample, relatives study).
Functional connectivity analysis
Functional connectivity analyses were performed as previously
described and involved a so-called “seeded functional connectiv-
ity” approach, a measure of correlated activity between two
regions across the full task, for which we have demonstrated
superior reliability in earlier work [34]. Consistent with the well-
established role of ACC in interference processing [1], the seed
region was deﬁned based on the group level activation maximum
for the “incongruent vs. congruent” contrast in the dorsal ACC in
the discovery analysis (Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
coordinates: x = 9, y = 32, z = 30). For functional connectivity
measures, the entire time series was used. Following our
previously published procedures [34], individual seed time series
were extracted from 6 mm spheres and ﬁrst-level models were
deﬁned with the subject-speciﬁc time series as regressor of
interest and the following regressors of no interest: (1) the six
movement parameters from the realignment step, (2) the ﬁrst
eigenvariates derived from Cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) and white
matter masks, and (3) the regressors encoding the experimental
conditions in order to remove mean task-related variance. During
model estimation, high-pass ﬁltering and autoregressive modeling
was performed as detailed for the activation analysis. Among the
resulting beta images, the beta image pertaining to the seed
regressor reﬂects the strength of association of voxel time series
with the ACC time course, a well-established measure of
functional connectivity [35, 36]. Between-group ANOVA analyses
followed the procedures described for the activation analyses.
Statistical inference
Our approach for statistical inference followed a two-step
procedure. In our ﬁrst (discovery) analysis, signiﬁcance was
deﬁned at p < 0.05 family-wise error (FWE) corrected for multiple
comparisons across the whole brain. Based on the results of the
discovery analysis, we continued to deﬁne our regional hypothesis
for the subsequent analyses (replication study, relatives study,
resting-state connectivity analysis), and speciﬁcally tested for ACC
functional connectivity effects mapping to the mPFC in a region of
interest (ROI) approach. For this, we selected the overlap between
the bilateral -Talairach Daemon (TD) based medial frontal area [37],
and the BA9 ROI to deﬁne a bilateral anatomical mask of medial
BA9 containing 673 voxels for subsequent correction of results
(p < 0.05 FWE corrected for the ROI).
Resting-state connectivity analysis
We also examined ACC–mPFC connectivity during resting state in
the individuals of the replication sample to investigate whether
the identiﬁed connectivity difference between BDNF genotype
groups is speciﬁc to cognitive control, or alternatively, represents a
task-independent alteration in functional coupling. Resting-state
data were available from the vast majority of participants of this
sample (Val/Val-carriers n = 164, Met-carriers n = 86). Data proces-
sing and analysis steps were kept constant for task-based and
resting-state functional connectivity procedures with the excep-
tion of data ﬁlter choice and target region deﬁnition: data were
processed using a 0.008–0.1 Hz bandpass ﬁlter, and ROIs were
derived from the functional connectivity seed in ACC and the
functional connectivity peak voxel within mPFC in the ﬂanker task.
Thus, we extracted a time series from a 6 mm sphere centered
around the respective voxel (MNI ACC: x = 9, y = 32, z = 30; MNI
mPFC: x = 18, y = 41, z = 18). The extracted time series were
corrected for CSF, White matter (WM), and the six-rigid body
alignment parameters as described above. Groups were compared
using a univariate ANOVA model with age, sex, and site as
covariates of no interest.

Structural analysis
We further analyzed the structural data of the replication
sample with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to test whether
the differences during cognitive control in the identiﬁed
ACC–mPFC functional connectivity phenotype may be inﬂu-
enced by pre-existing structural differences of the examined
regions. High-resolution structural MR images were available
for the vast majority of participants in this sample (Val-
carriers:
n = 163,
Met-carriers:
n = 87).
Data
processing
followed our previously published procedures [38] including
the use of the VBM8 toolbox (http://dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/
vbm8/) with default speciﬁcations. Brieﬂy, the structural
images were tissue segmented, spatially normalized to the
MNI space with a diffeomorphic image registration algorithm
(DARTEL), corrected for image intensity non-uniformity and
global brain gray matter volume, and smoothed with a 10 mm
Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel. We then
extracted mean gray matter volumes for the ACC and PFC as
deﬁned above for resting-state analysis and tested for
genotype-associated group differences by entering these
values as dependent variable in a repeated measurement
ANOVA model that included age, sex, and site as covariates of
no interest.
RESULTS
Demographics and task performance
Details on all demographic and task performance variables
including p-values for group comparisons are provided in Table 1.
Notably, the groups compared in this work did not signiﬁcantly
differ in any of these variables, except for a higher number of
females in the 66Met allele carrier group of the discovery sample.
Notably, however, sex was included as a covariate of no interest in
all of our analyses.
Discovery sample
Flanker activation analysis.
The analysis of brain activation in the
contrasts
“incongruent > congruent”
and
“no
go > neutral”
revealed robust activations of brain areas known to be involved
in conﬂict monitoring and inhibitory control, respectively [1]. See
Supplemental Table 1 and 2 for details. We detected no signiﬁcant
effects of BDNF genotype on brain activation for either contrast in
the discovery sample. Consistent with our step-wise analysis
strategy, the activation data of the replication and relatives
samples were thus not further analyzed.

Seeded functional connectivity analysis demonstrated a sig-
niﬁcant effect of genotype on the functional coupling of the ACC
and PFC. Speciﬁcally, 66Met-carriers showed a signiﬁcant increase
in the seeded connectivity between ACC and medial BA9 surviving
correction for multiple comparisons across the whole brain (x =
12, y = 53, z = 27; t = 5.02; pFWE = 0.022, four voxels surpassing the
peak voxel statistical correction level of signiﬁcance for the whole
brain).
Further analyses
Replication study.
In a second step, we aimed to reproduce the
detected genotype effect in our replication sample. Analogous to
the discovery sample, we detected a signiﬁcant increase in the
seeded connectivity between ACC and the medial parts of PFC
BA9 in 66Met allele carriers (MNI: x = 18, y = 41, z = 18; t = 3.72;
pFWE = 0.022, two voxels surpassing the peak voxel statistical
correction level of signiﬁcance for the ROI). In contrast, the analysis
of the resting-state data of the same individuals revealed no
signiﬁcant effects of genotype on ACC–PFC functional connectiv-
ity (p = 0.762), which suggests that the coupling abnormality
related to 66Met is task dependent. Moreover, there were no
signiﬁcant genotype-dependent differences in the mean gray
matter volume of the seed and target regions (See Supplementary
Figure 1) of the functional connectivity analysis, arguing against a
relevant role of structural confounds.
Relatives study.
We continued to probe the potential relationship
of the identiﬁed phenotype to schizophrenia risk in unaffected
ﬁrst-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients. Consistent with
our genotype ﬁndings, we detected a signiﬁcant increase in the
seeded connectivity between ACC and the medial parts of PFC
BA9 in the healthy ﬁrst-degree relatives of schizophrenia patients
compared with healthy controls without a family history of mental
illness (MNI: x = 15, y = 53, z = 27; t = 3.39; pFWE = 0.05, one voxel
surpassing the peak voxel statistical correction level of signiﬁcance
for the ROI).
DISCUSSION
Cognitive control mechanisms interface key neural processes
ensuring adequate and efﬁcient behavioral responses to goal-
relevant information. Prior research has demonstrated that brain
functional abnormalities during cognitive control are frequent in
heritable mental disorders [9], and that a synergistic brain circuitry
involving ACC and PFC is necessary for accomplishing these
functions [2]. However, the neurogenetic architecture of this
network is still under researched. To address this point, we
examined the potential impact of a functional variant in BDNF
associated with effects on neurodevelopment, synaptic plasticity,
and mental disorders. Focusing on the functional coupling of two
putative key hubs of the cognitive control network, we studied the
impact of BDNF Val66Met genetic variation and schizophrenia
familial risk on brain activation and interregional connectivity with
fMRI and a well-established cognitive control task.
Our study provided several interesting outcomes. In a ﬁrst step,
we examined the effects of BDNF variation on PFC and ACC
activation during conﬂict monitoring and response inhibition in a
discovery sample, which yielded a negative ﬁnding. We simulta-
neously detected a whole-brain signiﬁcant effect of the variant on
ACC–mPFC interregional connectivity during cognitive control,
which manifested as a relative increase in the functional coupling
of regions in the risk-associated Met allele carriers. In a second
step, we were able to reproduce the signiﬁcant increase in
ACC–mPFC connectivity in the 66Met allele carriers in a larger
independent sample. The outcome of the replication analysis
increased our conﬁdence that the effect of the variant on the
identiﬁed coupling phenotype is indeed credible. We further
demonstrated the speciﬁcity of the genotype effect for active task
performance and its independence from brain structural con-
founds within the same individuals. Given that the fMRI data
collected from cognitive performance tasks also carry task-
unrelated (i.e., more generic and/or hemostasis-related) informa-
tion on brain functional states [39], and since the examined
variant in BDNF has been repeatedly associated with brain
structural effects [40, 41], we found these two additional control
analyses to be particularly important.
Interestingly, we did not ﬁnd any effects of BDNF Val66Met on
ACC or PFC activation in response to cognitive control. Similar
dissociations of genotype effects on activity vs. connectivity
phenotypes have been previously described [42] and discussed as
a variant underlying neurobiological mechanism [43]. Notably,
although alterations in dorsal ACC activation have been repeat-
edly related to changes in dopamine transmission [44–46], the
interpretation of the observed ACC–mPFC coupling effect is still
less clear. However, given the established effects of BDNF on the
experience-dependent organization of neural circuits, a neural
plasticity-related mechanism appears plausible. This notion is
supported
by
a
study
demonstrating
effects
of
repetitive
transcranial magnetic stimulation on PFC connectivity, but not
activity, which is in line with a particularly close link of fMRI
coupling signatures to brain plasticity mechanisms [34]. On the
cellular level, Val66Met inﬂuences dendritic growth and synaptic
communication via acute and chronic effects on neurotransmitter
signaling [47, 48]. Thus, a lack of BDNF in the 66Met allele carriers
can result in reduced synaptic efﬁcacy, which in turn may facilitate
a (likely compensatory) increase in ACC interregional coupling at
the neural system level, as observed in this study. We thus
propose that the observed ACC coupling increase in 66Met allele
carriers may indicate a plasticity-related compensatory signal
related to the diminished neurotrophin secretion and synaptic
efﬁcacy in this group [15]. We further propose that this
mechanism requires active challenge of the cognitive network
and is not a mere epiphenomenon of its basic architecture, such
as its structural composition or functional conﬁguration in the
absence of external stimulation.
In psychiatric disorders, alterations in the connectivity of brain
regions as a consequence of genetic variation are typically
interpreted
as
conferring
risk
through
impaired
functional
organization of brain circuits responsible for integrated human
behaviors [49, 50]. As cognitive control deﬁcits [9, 51], and related
alterations in ACC interregional coupling [10] are well-established
observations in psychosis, we tested whether an increase in the
functional coupling of ACC and mPFC during cognitive control is
evident in subjects with familial risk for schizophrenia. Indeed,
compared with controls, unaffected ﬁrst-grade relatives showed a
“compensatory
network
signature”
that
paralleled
the
one
observed in the
66Met allele carriers. Although both sample
stratiﬁcation principles, i.e., BDNF genotype and kinship, base their
rationale on the logic of increased neurogenetic risk, the
distribution of BDNF alleles in our relatives sample did not deviate
from that of a European ancestry population (see Supplementary
Methods). The joined interpretation of these ﬁndings is not simple
and requires further discussion.
Healthy ﬁrst-grade relatives of patients with a heritable
psychiatric condition carry, per deﬁnition, an enriched set of
genetic risk variants that increase their liability to develop the
disorder. Together with the absence of important confounds such
as medication effects, this makes this population particularly
suitable for the exploration of genetic risk-associated “intermedi-
ate” phenotypes at the neural system level. BDNF 66Met, in turn, is
an established genetic risk factor for neural plasticity-related
deﬁcits, including those believed to be effective in neurodevelop-
mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Nevertheless, as BDNF
itself does not increase the genetic risk for schizophrenia directly,
as per the current state of knowledge [22], a simple explanatory
model of our ﬁndings (e.g., BDNF genotype increases psychosis

risk through deﬁcits in ACC–mPFC coupling) is unlikely true.
Interestingly, a recent study found that plasma BDNF levels as a
direct measure of BNDF secretion predicted planning abilities
across different stages of psychosis with low BDNF levels only in
the at-risk state of schizophrenia [52]. Concurrently, neuroimaging
risk markers cannot be attributed to the effects of a single genetic
variant only, but rather reﬂect the accumulation and complex
interplay of many risk factors from different sources, including
gene–environment interactions. As BDNF Val66Met inﬂuences
experience-dependent
plasticity
directly,
and
also
modiﬁes
schizophrenia neurogenetic risk and symptoms indirectly [53],
our data are likely better explained by a model assuming a
convergence of the effects of different risk constellations at the
neural system level. Our results in healthy participants indicate the
investigated neural circuits to be susceptible to plasticity-related
effects, which subsequently may render those circuits more
vulnerable to the impact of adverse events [54]. For example, in
addition to the direct inﬂuence of BDNF on neural plasticity and
ACC–mPFC network function, indirect effects may exist that
facilitate comparable neural deﬁcits through interaction with
psychosis risk-enriched gene sets and/or adverse environmental
factors. Considering that healthy relatives of patients are enriched
for schizophrenia genetic risk, and also share many of the
environmental inﬂuences of their affected family members [55],
we ﬁnd this concept plausible and worthwhile to investigate in
detail in future studies.
In summary, although this similar connectivity pattern in BDNF
66Met allele carriers and unaffected relatives of patients with
schizophrenia on connectivity is intriguing, we interpret these
results as indicators for plasticity-related effects on the cognitive
control circuit. However, a causal relationship between BDNF and
schizophrenia or the genetics of schizophrenia itself cannot be
inferred from these observations.
Our study has several limitations worth considering. First,
although we replicated our genetic association ﬁnding in an
independent sample, both the absent effects of BDNF Val66Met on
ACC activation and the detected association of the 66Met allele
with higher ACC–mPFC coupling merit further study in larger
cohorts. Second, although our groups were balanced for a broad
range of demographic and task performance variables, and we
additionally showed the independence of the coupling effect from
more generic functional and structural facets of the underlying
network, we cannot exclude the possibility that our results were
inﬂuenced by factors that we did not cover. Third, our study
rationale was based on a hypothesis-driven, multi-stage (dis-
covery-replication), and therefore spatially constrained approach.
Although we believe that this strategy is a sound and advisable
way to optimize sensitivity while minimizing false negatives in
imaging genetics, we cannot exclude that relevant connectivity
effects outside the deducted target circuitry remained unnoticed.
Fourth, despite the broad use [56, 57] and established robustness
[34]
of
correlative
connectivity
measures
in
neuroimaging
research, the identiﬁed coupling differences cannot be interpreted
as a proof for a deﬁcit in the causal interaction between ACC and
mPFC. Fifth, although our data suggest a link between the
phenotype and schizophrenia familial risk, the proposed role of
BDNF
as
an
indirect
modiﬁer
of
the
neurocognitive
risk
architecture of psychiatric disorders via its effects on ACC
interregional coupling calls for further inquiry [19, 23, 24]. Sixth,
we did not collect a direct measure of plasma BDNF levels, which
would have provided more detailed information on the relation-
ship between allelic variation in BDNF, BDNF protein levels, and
the identiﬁed neurocognitive imaging phenotype.
In conclusion, we provide evidence for an ACC–mPFC coupling
increase during cognitive control in healthy BDNF 66Met allele
carriers that is replicable speciﬁc to the active challenge of the
cognitive network, independent of structural differences, and
detectable in individuals with an increased schizophrenia familial
risk. Our ﬁndings suggest a mechanism through which common
genetic variation can modify the course of schizophrenia. More-
over, our ﬁndings encourage further study of the direct and indirect
effects of this polymorphism on cognitive control networks in
larger cohorts and heritable disorders with established neuropsy-
chological deﬁcits such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
