Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) establishes a persistent infection, despite inducing antigen-
specific T-cell responses. Although T cells arrive at the site of infection, they do not provide 
sterilizing immunity. The molecular basis of how Mtb impairs T-cell function is not clear. Mtb has 
been reported to block major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) antigen presentation; 
however, no bacterial effector or host-cell target mediating this effect has been identified. We 
recently found that Mtb EsxH, which is secreted by the Esx-3 type VII secretion system, directly 
inhibits the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. Here, we 
showed that ESCRT is required for optimal antigen processing; correspondingly, overexpression 
and loss-of-function studies demonstrated that EsxH inhibited the ability of macrophages and 
dendritic cells to activate Mtb antigen-specific CD4+ T cells. Compared with the wild-type strain, 
the esxH-deficient strain induced fivefold more antigen-specific CD4+ T-cell proliferation in the 
mediastinal lymph nodes of mice. We also found that EsxH undermined the ability of effector

CD4+ T cells to recognize infected macrophages and clear Mtb. These results provide a molecular 
explanation for how Mtb impairs the adaptive immune response.
Host defences, both innate and adaptive, are subverted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(Mtb). During Mtb infection, there is a delay in priming antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ 
cells by dendritic cells (DCs) in the lymph node1. When the effector CD4+ T cells traffic to 
the site of infection in the lungs, although they promote the antimycobacterial activity of 
macrophages by secreting cytokines such as interferon (IFN)-γ2, they fail to generate 
sterilizing immunity. Currently, we lack a comprehensive and detailed understanding as to 
why major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) antigen presentation fails during 
Mtb infection. In naive macrophages, Mtb can act through Toll-like receptor 2 to block IFN-
γ-induced MHC-II transcription3–5, although the contribution this plays in vivo is unclear6. 
How Mtb impairs antigen presentation in macrophages already expressing MHC-II is less 
well understood. One proposed mechanism is that by blocking phagosome maturation Mtb 
impairs efficient processing of antigen and the MHC-II-associated invariant chain7,8. 
However, there have been contradictory results regarding the impact of phagosome 
maturation on antigen presentation8–11. Contradictory results have also been reported in 
DCs. Some studies have demonstrated that Mtb inhibits DCs maturation, thereby impairing 
mobilization of MHC-II molecules to the cell surface12, whereas others have shown that Mtb 
upregulates DC expression of MHC-II, co-stimulatory molecules and inflammatory 
cytokines13,14. More recent data have shown that Mtb-infected DCs are inefficient at 
priming antigen-specific CD4+ T cells15–17. Rather, bystander uninfected cells take up Mtb 
antigen and prime CD4+ T cells18,19.
Our group recently found that Mtb EsxH inhibits phagosome maturation by targeting the 
host endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)20. EsxH forms a 
heterodimer with EsxG (EsxGHMt), which is secreted by the Esx-3 type VII secretion 
system. EsxGHMt is involved in iron and zinc acquisition21–25, and recent work has 
demonstrated that EsxGHMt also plays an additional role in virulence20,26,27. EsxGHMt 
binds the host protein hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS, 
also known as HRS), a component of the ESCRT machinery20. ESCRT plays a well-
described role in directing cell-surface receptors into intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular 
bodies so they can be degraded in the lysosome28. We found that ESCRT is also required for 
phagosome maturation20,29, and we hypothesized that ESCRT, and by extension EsxGHMt, 
regulates MHC-II antigen presentation. In this study, we showed that ESCRT promotes T-
cell activation during Mtb infection by facilitating antigen processing. We demonstrated that 
EsxGHMt impairs the ability of macrophages and DCs to present mycobacterial antigens and 
activate CD4+ T cells, resulting in impaired T-cell priming and defective effector function. 
Overall, our data support a model in which EsxH inhibits ESCRT, thereby undermining two 
key aspects of the adaptive immune response: (1) efficient priming of naive T cells, and (2) 
recognition of Mtb-infected cells by CD4+ T cells.

Results
ESCRT promotes antigen presentation during Mtb infection
To test the hypothesis that ESCRT contributes to antigen presentation, we depleted HRS and 
TSG101, components of ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I, from bone marrow-derived macrophages 
(BMDMs) (Fig. 1a). Following ESCRT depletion, BMDMs were activated with IFN-γ to 
induce MHC-II expression and infected the following day with Mtb. The ability of the 
infected macrophages to activate CD4+ T cells was assessed using T-helper 1 (TH1) 
polarized CD4+ effector cells that express a transgenic T-cell antigen receptor (TCR-Tg) 
specific for peptide 25 (amino acids 240–254) of Mtb Ag85B protein (P25TCR-Tg TH1 
cells)30, which secrete IFN-γ when co-cultured with Mtb-infected BMDMs. We found that 
macrophages depleted of HRS or TSG101 were poor at stimulating P25TCR-Tg effector 
CD4+ T cells, inducing 30% less IFN-γ release than control cells (Fig. 1b). Similar findings 
were observed with CD4+ TH1 cells specific for another prominent secreted antigen of Mtb, 
EsxA/ESAT-63–15 (C7TCR-Tg TH1 cells; Fig. 1c). IFN-γ production by P25 and C7 TCR 
TH1 cells was antigen specific, as IFN-γ was not made following co-culture with 
macrophages infected with Ag85B- or ESAT-6-null strains of Mtb (ΔfpbB and ΔesxA; Fig. 
1b,c). Importantly, multiple independent small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting Tsg101 
or Hrs impaired the ability of infected macrophages to stimulate T cells (Supplementary Fig. 
1a–c), and the degree of HRS depletion correlated with levels of impairment in T-cell 
activation (Supplementary Fig. 1b,c). At the maximal HRS depletion that we were able to 
achieve, approximately 20% of HRS protein remained, and IFN-γ production was 
suppressed by approximately 40%. These results indicated that ESCRT promotes the ability 
of macrophages to activate Mtb-specific CD4+ effector T cells.
ESCRT facilitates antigen processing by macrophages
The role of ESCRT in antigen presentation has not been studied. In DCs, cell-surface levels 
of MHC-II are regulated by ubiquitin-dependent sorting to lysosomes31,32, suggesting that 
ESCRT might control MHC-II trafficking in DCs, although this has not been tested directly. 
Whether ESCRT would play a similar role in BMDMs is unclear. To assess this directly, we 
compared cell-surface MHC-II levels between control BMDMs and those depleted of HRS 
or TSG101. We found no difference, regardless of infection status, when assayed by flow 
cytometry (Fig. 2a). It is also possible that, by controlling the multivesicular architecture of 
the MHC-II compartment or promoting phagosome maturation20,29, ESCRT might influence 
antigen processing or loading. We found that ESCRT-depleted BMDMs were impaired for 
activating P25TCR-Tg CD4+ effector T cells in the presence of exogenously added 
recombinant Ag85B, but behaved similarly to controls when peptide 25 was used as the 
antigen (Fig. 2b), suggesting that the defect is at the level of processing the protein into 
peptide. To evaluate this further, we used DQ-OVA, a self-quenched conjugate of ovalbumin 
that exhibits bright green fluorescence on proteolytic degradation (Fig. 2c). Quantification of 
fluorescence indicated that ESCRT silencing impaired the degradation of ovalbumin (Fig. 
2d). From these experiments, we concluded that ESCRT promotes antigen presentation by 
facilitating antigen processing.

ESCRT does not restrict bacterial growth in IFN-γ-activated macrophages
Although Mtb arrests phagosome maturation, in naive macrophages a fraction of the bacilli 
are delivered to the lysosome, which we previously showed depends on ESCRT20. As IFN-γ 
partially overcomes the arrest in phagosome maturation imposed by Mtb33–35, we asked 
whether ESCRT is also involved in phagosome maturation in IFN-γ-activated macrophages, 
which we used for the antigen presentation assays. As we reported previously, silencing of 
Tsg101 and Hrs in naive macrophages did not decrease the total lysosomal-associated 
membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) signal but led to diminished co-localization between Mtb and 
LAMP1 (a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes) and enhanced intracellular bacterial 
growth when compared with control cells (Supplementary Fig. 2a,c,d)20. Surprisingly, in 
IFN-γ-activated macrophages, the same silencing had no effect on the co-localization of 
bacteria with LAMP1 or on bacterial survival (Supplementary Fig. 2b–d). Thus, 
phagolysosomal maturation and control of Mtb replication is largely independent of ESCRT 
in IFN-γ-activated macrophages. Therefore, the impairment in antigen presentation seen 
with ESCRT silencing is not due to an overall difference in bacterial degradation.
Antigen presentation is impaired by Mtb EsxGHMt but not by Mycobacterium smegmatis 
EsxGH
As EsxGHMt disrupts ESCRT20, we wondered whether EsxGHMt impairs antigen 
presentation. We found that macrophages infected with a ΔesxH mutant elicited 50% more 
T-cell activation compared with BMDMs infected with wild-type Mtb, as assessed by IFN-γ 
production (Fig. 3 a). Bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) showed an even more 
pronounced effect, as infection with the ΔesxH mutant resulted in a greater than threefold 
enhancement in T-cell activation (Fig. 3b). In both cases, the increase in T-cell activation 
was largely reversed by genetic complementation. The enhanced response was not due to 
more Ag85B secretion from the mutant (Fig. 3c). While the ΔesxH mutant requires 
exogenous siderophore to grow on solid medium, it is only modestly impaired in liquid 
medium26, and there was no difference in the intracellular survival of the wild type and 
ΔesxH at the time the antigen presentation assay was performed (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, 
when ESCRT was silenced, the ΔesxH mutant stimulated P25 T cells to a similar extent as 
control cells infected with wild-type Mtb (Fig. 3e), consistent with the idea that esxH 
impairs antigen presentation by inhibiting HRS. IFN-γ release was greatest in magnitude in 
the case of control cells infected with the ΔesxH mutant, whereas it was least in the context 
of ESCRT-silenced cells infected with Mtb strain H37Rv. The inhibition of IFN-γ by H37Rv 
relative to ΔesxH seen in ESCRT-silenced cells might reflect the fact that RNA interference 
(RNAi)-mediated silencing fails to fully deplete the target protein and that EsxGHMt 
expression does not fully inhibit ESCRT. Alternatively, EsxGHMt may have additional 
targets beyond HRS that suppress antigen presentation.
To test whether additional EsxGHMt expressed from Mtb could further inhibit antigen 
presentation, we examined a wild-type strain that contained esxGHMt on a plasmid20. 
Macrophages infected with the EsxGHMt-overexpressing Mtb strain elicited decreased 
activation of P25 CD4+ T cells compared with those infected with a strain containing the 
vector (Fig. 3f). In addition, when Mtb contained a plasmid bearing EsxGHMs, the M. 
smegmatis homologue of EsxGHMt, which does not inhibit ESCRT20, there was no effect on

antigen presentation (Fig. 3f). The degree of inhibition was comparable if Mtb 
overexpressed EsxGHMt or if ESCRT was silenced in the BMDMs (Fig. 3g). Infecting 
ESCRT-depleted macrophages with the Mtb strain overexpressing EsxGHMt did not result in 
an additive defect in T-cell activation beyond that seen with either manipulation alone. This 
is consistent with the idea that EsxGHMt and siRNAs depleting HRS and TSG101 target a 
common pathway required for antigen presentation. In cells in which Tsg101 or Hrs were 
silenced, there was no statistically significant difference in T-cell activation between 
infection with the vector control strain and the overexpressing strain, although there was a 
trend towards a small decrease from the overexpressing strain. In macrophages infected by 
Mtb overexpressing EsxGHMt, Hrs silencing resulted in a small but statistically significant 
decrease in IFN-γ production relative to macrophages treated with control siRNA. These 
small decreases associated with the combination of the overexpressing strain and ESCRT 
silencing might be because RNAi-mediated silencing and EsxGHMt do not fully inhibit Hrs 
or because EsxGHMt has additional targets. Overall, we concluded that both overexpression 
and loss-of-function studies indicated that EsxGHMt impairs effector T-cell responses, 
similar to the situation seen with ESCRT silencing.
Antigen presentation is unaffected by PE5 and EsxA
In addition to containing esxG and esxH, the esx-3 locus encodes pe5 and ppe4, members of 
the proline-glutamic acid (PE) and proline–proline–glutamic acid (PPE) families, 
respectively. Tufariello et al.26 showed that PE5 is secreted by Esx-3, and, like the ΔesxH 
mutant, Δpe5-ppe4 requires exogenous siderophore-bound iron to grow on solid medium. In 
addition, the ΔesxH mutant fails to secrete PE5, raising the possibility that PE5 is 
responsible for the phenotype of the ΔesxH mutant. However, unlike ΔesxH, the Δpe5-ppe4 
mutant did not result in increased T-cell responses (Fig. 3a,b). Thus, the influence of EsxH 
on antigen presentation is not explained by its role in iron acquisition or its effect on PE5 
secretion. We also tested the role of EsxA, which is secreted by the Esx-1 type VII secretion 
system. Macrophages and DCs infected with the ΔesxA mutant did not showed increased 
ability to activate T cells (Fig. 3a,b), corroborating the idea that enhanced antigen 
presentation does not simply reflect bacterial attenuation.
EsxGHMt impairs priming of naive CD4+ T cells in vivo
We hypothesized that EsxGHMt might contribute to impaired priming of CD4+ T cells in 
vivo. To test this hypothesis, we adoptively transferred carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl 
ester (CFSE)-labelled P25TCR-Tg CD4+ T cells into CD45.2 congenie mice and infected 
them by aerosol with H37Rv or the ΔesxH mutant and assessed the proliferation of 
P25TCR-Tg CD4+ T cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs) and lungs. In initial 
experiments using an inoculum of 102–103 colony-forming units (c.f.u.), ΔesxH was cleared 
from the lungs and failed to disseminate to the draining lymph node. When we used high-
dose ΔesxH (104 c.f.u.), the bacteria disseminated to the MLNs (Fig. 4a), although the 
number of c.f.u. in the lung was much lower than that found in mice infected with 102 c.f.u. 
H37Rv, and there were orders of magnitude fewer ΔesxH mutant in the MLNs than H37Rv 
at 14 d postinfection. Proliferation of the P25TCR-Tg CD4+ T cells in the MLNs was 
observed at this time point in response to both ΔesxH and H37Rv (Fig. 4b), and a similar 
percentage of P25TCR-Tg CD4+ T cells proliferated in the MLNs and lungs in response to

both strains (Fig. 4c). That this degree of T-cell proliferation occurred in response to orders 
of magnitude fewer ΔesxH bacilli in the MLNs suggested that ΔesxH-infected cells might be 
superior to wild-type Mtb-infected cells in priming CD4+ T cells.
To compare P25TCRTg CD4+ T-cell responses with equal numbers of wild-type and ΔesxH 
mutant in vivo, we used intratracheal transfer of infected BMDCs. We adoptively transferred 
naive CFSE-labelled P25TCRTg CD4+ T cells in MHC-II knockout (MHC-II−/−) mice and 
compared their activation following intratracheal transfer of MHC-II-expressing (wild-type) 
BMDCs infected with equal numbers of H37Rv or ΔesxH. This experimental design allowed 
us to assay the contribution of antigen presentation from the infected DCs and eliminated the 
possibility that antigen transfer to uninfected bystander DCs was contributing to T-cell 
priming. Analysis of mediastinal MLNs revealed that, following transfer of DCs infected 
with ΔesxH, there was a threefold increase in the number of P25TCR-Tg CD4+ T cells (Fig. 
5a,b) and five- to six-fold more P25TCR-Tg CD4+ T-cell proliferation (Fig. 5c,d). This 
enhanced CD4+ T-cell priming was not due to a higher bacterial burden, as both groups of 
infected DCs contained similar numbers of bacteria, and equivalent numbers of DCs were 
transferred into recipient animals (Fig. 5e). There was also no difference in the number of 
bacteria in the lungs of the recipient mice (Fig. 5f). Interestingly, and consistent with the 
aerosol experiment above, the MLNs contained approximately half as many ΔesxH mutant 
as wild-type bacteria (Fig. 5g) but led to a fivefold increase in CD4+ T-cell proliferation. 
Thus, following transfer of infected DCs, there was more T-cell proliferation in response to 
fewer ΔesxH than wild-type bacilli. We concluded that EsxH impairs the ability of Mtb-
infected DCs to prime CD4+ T cells in vivo.
EsxH protects Mtb from CD4+ T-cell-mediated killing
Direct recognition of infected macrophages is important for CD4+ T cells to control Mtb36. 
To determine whether EsxH impairs the ability of effector CD4+ T cells to recognize 
infected macrophages, we cocultured BMDMs infected with either wild-type Mtb or the 
ΔesxH mutant with and without P25TCR-Tg CD4+ T cells and plated them to determine the 
number of c.f.u. We found that the addition of P25TCR-Tg CD4+ T cells to naive or IFN-γ-
activated BMDMs had a modest effect on Mtb growth if macrophages were infected with 
wild-type Mtb (Fig. 6a,b). In contrast, addition of effector T cells to macrophages infected 
with the ΔesxH mutant resulted in substantial bacterial killing (Fig. 6a,b). We concluded that 
EsxH limits the ability of T cells to promote clearance of Mtb from infected macrophages. 
The enhanced sensitivity to T cells exhibited by the ΔesxH mutant may also explain why 
there were fewer ΔesxH than wild-type bacilli in the MLNs in the DC transfer experiments 
above (Fig. 5g), while in the lungs ΔesxH and wild type were no different (Fig. 5f). To test 
whether EsxH protected Mtb from T-cell-facilitated killing in vivo, we compared the 
bacterial burden of the ΔesxH mutant in the lungs of C57BL/6 and MHC-II−/− mice, which 
lack CD4+ T cells. Attenuation of the ΔesxH mutant was ameliorated in MHC-II−/− mice; in 
wild-type mice, there was more than a 4-log difference in c.f.u. between ΔesxH and wild 
type. In MHC-II−/−mice, there was a 3-log difference. Although the profound attenuation of 
the ΔesxH mutant is probably multifactorial, reflecting its role in metal homeostasis, 
phagosome maturation arrest and potentially other processes, the observation that there was 
a greater impact of T cells on the ΔesxH mutant than on H37Rv (Fig. 6c) is consistent with

the idea that the in vivo attenuation of ΔesxH depends in part on MHC-II-mediated antigen 
presentation and CD4+ T-cell responses.
Discussion
We showed previously that to promote its intracellular survival Mtb secretes EsxH and 
inhibits the function of ESCRT. The role of ESCRT in antigen presentation has not 
previously been established. Here, we showed that ESCRT contributes to optimal antigen 
processing and that Mtb EsxH impairs the activation of CD4+ T cells and their ability to 
promote bacterial clearance. Macrophages and DCs infected with an Mtb mutant lacking 
EsxH yielded enhanced T-cell activation, whereas infection with a strain that overexpressed 
EsxGHMt elicited diminished T-cell responses. Overexpression of EsxGHMs, which does not 
bind HRS or inhibit ESCRT20, had no effect on T-cell responses. Thus, the ability of 
EsxGHMt to inhibit antigen presentation is probably due to a direct effect on HRS20, 
although additional targets may also play a role. Our findings are in accordance with those 
of Tufariello et al.26 who demonstrated an important role of esxH in virulence that is 
separable from the role in iron acquisition and that cannot be complemented by esxG–esxH 
from M. smegmatis.
This study is also, to the best of our knowledge, the first demonstration that ESCRT is 
required for antigen presentation. In DCs, degradation of peptide-loaded MHC-II is 
regulated by ubiquitination31,32, which has been presumed to be ESCRT dependent. Based 
on the presumption that ESCRT regulates MHC-II degradation, we expected that ESCRT 
silencing would result in enhanced MHC-II surface expression and potentially increased 
antigen presentation. Rather, we found that silencing ESCRT impaired T-cell activation by 
inhibiting antigen processing and presentation. There are several ways in which ESCRT 
might do this. First, the multivesicular architecture of the MHC-II compartment might be 
important for the processing and/or loading of antigen37–39. Alternatively, given the role of 
ESCRT in phagosome maturation20,29, ESCRT might promote antigen processing because it 
assists in trafficking Mtb to an acidic phagosomal environment that contains active 
lysosomal hydrolases. However, the literature does not suggest a simple relationship 
between phagosome maturation arrest, bacterial fitness and antigen presentation, as some 
attenuated strains are reported to enhance antigen presentation, whereas others have no 
effect10,11,40–42. Further complicating this explanation is the fact that lysosomal trafficking 
of Mtb in IFN-γ-activated macrophages does not depend on ESCRT (Supplementary Fig. 2). 
Nonetheless, there may be other aspects of the phagosomal environment that are altered by 
ESCRT inhibition, an explanation that we favour. For example, ESCRT might be required 
for trafficking the antigen processing or loading machinery to the phagolysosome or the 
MHC-II compartment.
Our findings extend well beyond the role of ESCRT in antigen presentation. To the best of 
our knowledge, this is the first example of an Mtb effector and its corresponding cellular 
target impairing MHC-II antigen presentation by a mechanism other than Mtb Toll-like 
receptor 2 agonists blocking IFN-γ signalling. The previously described mechanism cannot 
explain how Mtb downregulates antigen presentation in antigen-presenting cells that already 
express MHC-II or in macrophages that are exposed to IFN-γ shortly after they are infected.

Here, we have provided a molecular explanation for how, in migratory DCs and IFN-γ-
activated macrophages, Mtb blunts T-cell responses. EsxGHMt may provide a double hit for 
Mtb by impairing efficient priming of antigen-specific T cells and preventing effector CD4+ 
T cells from recognizing infected macrophages, which is important for control of Mtb in 
vivo36. Importantly, this mechanism of immune evasion may also undermine the ability of 
pre-existing CD4+ T cells generated by a vaccine or prior infection to be protective. Our 
results demonstrated only a partial suppression of T-cell activation in response to ESCRT 
silencing or esxH expression by the bacilli. Thus, there are likely to be additional 
mechanisms that Mtb uses to impair antigen presentation.
The observation that EsxGHMt impairs antigen presentation would seem to be at odds with 
the findings that EsxGMt and EsxHMt, also known as TB9.8 and TB10.4, respectively, are 
prominent T-cell antigens43,44. This apparent conundrum may be explained by the fact that 
antigen transfer from infected to uninfected DCs allows priming of T cells in the lymph 
node18,19. When these T cells arrive in the lung, the EsxGHMt-imposed block in antigen 
presentation in infected macrophages would subvert effector responses. This is an important 
consideration in vaccine candidates that include EsxH; macrophages infected with Mtb 
expressing abundant EsxH might be those that are imperceptible to CD4+ T cells. 
Interestingly, a recent study found that EsxA/ESAT-6, secreted by the Esx-1 type VII 
secretion system, interacts with β2-microglobulin and inhibits MHC class I β2-microglobulin 
surface expression45. Thus, two of the most dominant T-cell antigens, EsxA and EsxH, 
appear to undermine the activation of two major T-cell subsets, leading us to speculate that 
their prominence as T-cell antigens reflects a bacterial strategy to generate an ineffective 
host response.
In conclusion, we have shown that ESCRT stimulates antigen presentation and that Mtb 
EsxGHMt undermines this critical function in activated macrophages and DCs. Our data 
provide a molecular explanation for the failure of the adaptive immune response to kill Mtb. 
Recent work has shown that it is possible to identify small molecules that impair type VII 
secretion46. Esx-3 inhibitors could be particularly potent, as inhibiting this system would 
impair intrinsic bacterial processes involved in metal homeostasis, as well as promoting host 
clearance by restoring macrophage function and T-cell activation.

OADC Enrichment (Fisher Scientific) and 0.2% glycerol. The pJP130 complementing 
plasmid described below (ΔesxH-compl) and the GFP plasmids were selected with 25 μg 
ml−1 kanamycin (Sigma). Mycobactin was not used routinely to supplement the mutants 
during growth in broth culture. When plating for determination of c.f. u., the ΔesxH mutant 
was grown on 7H10 plates supplemented with 200 ng/ml mycobactin J (Allied Monitor).
Tissue culture
RAW264.7 cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine 
serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-glutamine. RAW264.7 cells were obtained from the American 
Type Culture Collection, and were expanded and frozen. After thawing, they were used 
within the first several passages and not tested for mycoplasma contamination. Bone marrow 
was isolated from 6–8-week-old male C57BL/6 mice as described previously49 and cultured 
in BMMO medium (DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 mM 
sodium pyruvate and 20% L929 cell-conditioned medium). BMDMs were collected between 
6 and 7 d, detached from plates by incubation in ice-cold PBS with 5 mM EDTA, and then 
washed and plated in BMMO medium with 10% L929 cell-conditioned medium. Penicillin/
streptomycin (Gibco) was added to the medium for passaging but omitted during infections. 
BMDCs were grown in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1 
mM sodium pyruvate, 1× β-mercaptoethanol (Gibco), 10 mM HEPES and 10 ng ml−1 
recombinant murine granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (Peprotech) for 7 d, 
followed by sorting of CD11c+ DCs using magnetic cell sorting (autoMACS; Miltenyi 
Biotec).
siRNA treatment
Hiperfect (Qiagen) was used to transfect siRNAs 2 or 3d before infection of RAW cells or 
BMDMs, respectively.
CD4+ T-cell isolation
P251,30 and C7TCR-Tg47 TH1 effector cells were generated in vitro as described previously. 
Briefly, CD4+ T cells were isolated magnetically from lymph node cell suspensions from 
P25TCR-Tg and C7TCR-Tg mice using microbeads (MACS) and an autoMACS (both from 
Miltenyi Biotec). The cells were co-cultured with irradiated C57BL/6 splenocytes in the 
presence of mouse interleukin (IL)-12p70, IL-2, anti-IL-4 neutralizing antibody, and peptide 
P25 or ESAT-6(1–20) for 3 d and frozen until used.
Antigen presentation assays
At 7d after collection, 1 × 105 BMDMs per well were plated in 96-well plates and 
transfected with siRNAs. Two days later, they were treated with 200 U ml−1 IFN-γ (Gibco). 
The following day, they were infected with a single-cell suspension of Mtb (multiplicity of 
infection (m.o.i.) of 1–5) prepared as described previously20. After 4 h, extracellular bacteria 
were removed by washing three times with warm PBS. Infected macrophages were 
incubated at 37 °C for an additional 20 h, after which P25TCR TH1 or C7TCR-Tg CD4+ T 
cells were added (5 × 105 cells per well). At 24 h after co-culture of infected BMDMs with

CD4+ T cells, culture supernatants were collected, filtered and assayed for IFN-γ by an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA: BD Biosciences). Alternatively, the antigen 
presentation assay was performed as above but without knocking down ESCRT, or, instead 
of infection with live Mtb, BMDMs were incubated with 0.5 μM P25 peptide or 10 μg ml−1 
recombinant Ag85B protein (BEI Resources). Antigen presentation assays were also done 
using BMDCs as antigen-presenting cells. In this case, cells were not treated with IFN-γ 
before infection.
DQ-OVA processing assay
BMDMs were treated with 50 μg ml−1 DQ-OVA (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C and 
washed three times with ice-cold PBS, followed by incubation in fresh medium at 37 °C for 
24 h, after which they were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Nuclei were stained 
with 2.5 μg ml−1 Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Images were captured using a Nikon 
Eclipse TiE/B automated fluorescent microscope with a Photometrics HQ@ Monochrome 
digital camera. Z-stack images were acquired at a magnification of ×60, and the mean 
fluorescence intensity (fluorescein isothiocyanate) was quantified using NIS-Elements DUO 
software.
Lysosomal trafficking assay
siRNA-transfected RAW cells or BMDMs were infected with GFP-expressing Mtb for 4 h 
as described above. One day before infection, macrophages were treated with IFN-γ (100 U 
ml−1) or left untreated. Cells were fixed with 1% PFA in PBS overnight at 24 h 
postinfection, permeabilized with 0.1% saponin in PBS and blocked with 2% BSA in PBS 
for 1 h. Cells were then immunostained for LAMP1 (1:1000 dilution; Abcam) for at least 1 h 
at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight, followed by treatment with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 
594-conjugated secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Images were captured using a Nikon 
Eclipse TiE/B automated fluorescent microscope described above and analysed using NIS-
Elements DUO software as described previously20.
Intracellular bacterial growth assay
RAW cells or BMDMs were transfected with siRNA and infected as described above (m.o.i. 
of 5). IFN-γ (100 U ml−1) was added 1 d before infection. At 4 h or 2 d postinfection, the 
cells were lysed with 0.2% Triton X-100 and serial dilutions plated. The numbers of c.f.u. 
were calculated 15–21 d later. For co-culture experiments, BMDMs were infected with wild-
type Mtb or ΔesxH mutant (m.o.i. of 3). At 24 h postinfection, P25TCR-Tg effector T cells 
were added or not, and 24 h later, cells were lysed, diluted and plated as described above at 
different time points.
Western blot analysis
BMDMs were transfected with siRNA for 72 h, after which cellular lysates were prepared in 
RIPA buffer with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific) and analysed by 
western blotting. The antibodies used for western blot analysis were against actin (clone C4; 
Millipore), HRS (M79; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and TSG101 (Genetex).

Adoptive transfer and naive P25TCR-Tg CD4+ T-cell proliferation
CD4+ T cells (3 × 106) collected from the lymph nodes and spleens of female P25TCR-Tg 
mice (8–12 weeks old) were labelled with 10 μM CFSE for 7 min and adoptively transferred 
by retro-orbital injections into 8-week-old female recipient mice. After 24 h, recipient mice 
were infected with 2×102 c.f.u. H37Rv or 1×104 c.f.u. ΔesxH mutant by the aerosol route 
using an Inhalation Exposure Unit (Glas-Col), as described previously15. At 7, 14 and 21 d 
after infection, MLNs and lungs were obtained from recipient mice and cells were analysed 
for CFSE dilution by flow cytometry. The experiments were not randomized or blinded. The 
number of animals used was determined based on feasibility and prior experience with the 
assay.
Intratracheal transfer of infected BMDCs
BMDC from wild-type mice were infected overnight with H37Rv or ΔesxH (m.o.i. of 1), 
washed, treated with amikacin (200 pg ml−1 for 40 min) and administered intratracheally to 
MHC-II−/− mice (5×105 DCs per mouse) 1 d after adoptive transfer of CFSE-labelled naive 
P25TCR-Tg CD4 cells (4 × 106 cells per mouse). At 60 h after BMDC transfer, MLNs were 
collected and processed for determination of bacterial c.f.u. and flow cytometry, and the 
lungs were processed for determination of c.f.u.
Flow cytometry
BMDMs were fixed in 1% PFA and stained using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse 
MHC-II (I-A/I-E, clone M5/114.15.2; Biolegend). Single-cell suspensions from infected 
lungs and MLNs were stained using the following fluorescently labelled antibodies: Alexa 
Fluor 700-conjugated anti-mouse CD45.1 antibody (clone A20), peridinin–chlorophyll-
conjugated anti-mouse CD3e (clone 145-2C11) and Pacific Blue-conjugated anti-mouse 
CD4 antibody (clone RM4-5) (all from Biolegend). Flow cytometry was performed using a 
FACSCalibur and LSR II (BD Biosciences) at the New York University Cytometry and Cell 
Sorting Core. FlowJo software was used for data analysis.
Plasmids
pJP130 was used to complement the ΔesxH mutant. It was constructed by inserting Rv0289 
into pYUB1944, which contains esxG–esxH under control of the hsp60 promoter26. Rv0289 
was amplified from Mtb genomic DNA by PCR using forward (5′-
TAGAAGCTTCTCGCGCTACATGGATGC-3′) and reverse (5′-
CCAATCGATTTACGAGGATTGGGTGG-3′) primers, digested with HindIII, and cloned 
into the HindIII site after Rv0288 in pYUB1944. The addition of Rv0289 to pYUB1944 
resulted in enhanced secretion of EsxG and EsxH compared with the parental plasmid.
Mass spectrometry analysis
Triplicate samples of H37Rv and ΔesxH culture filtrate were prepared and analysed by 
liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry using an Easy nLC-1000 on-line with a 
QExactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) as described26. The data was analysed 
with MaxQuant software with the Andromeda search engine for peptide identification.

Figure 4. Fewer ΔesxH c.f.u. are required to initiate proliferation in the MLNs and lungs
Mice with adoptively transferred CFSE-labelled P25TCR-Tg CD4+ T cells were infected by 
aerosol with H37Rv or high-dose ΔesxH. a, The number of c.f.u. in the MLNs and lungs 
was quantified at the indicated times (n = 3 mice per time point for each bacterial strain). 
Results reflect means ± s.e.m. b, Representative CFSE dilution profiles of adoptively 
transferred CFSE-labelled P25TCR-Tg CD4+ T cells in the MLNs and lung at different time 
points after aerosol infection. The y axis indicates the number of events. The horizontal bar 
indicates the percentage of proliferating cells. c, Quantitation of proliferating P25TCR-Tg 
CD4+ T cells in the MLNs and lungs after infection with H37Rv or ΔesxH, as determined by 
flow cytometry. Results reflect means ± s.e.m. Results are representative of two similar 
experiments. *P< 0.05, **P < 0.01 (unpaired Student’s t-test).

Figure 6. EsxH protects Mtb from CD4+ T-cell mediated killing
a, BMDMs infected with H37Rv (wild type) or ΔesxH for 24 h were cultured for an 
additional 96 h in the absence or presence of P25TCR-Tg CD4+ cells as indicated, and the 
number of c.f.u. was determined. b, BMDMs treated with IFN-γ (activated BMDMs) the 
day before they were infected with H37Rv (wild type) or ΔesxH were incubated at 24 h 
postinfection with or without P25TCR-Tg CD4+ cells, and the number of c.f.u. was 
determined at the indicated time points. Data in a and b are expressed as means ± s.e.m. 
from two independent experiments with at least eight individual replicates per experimental 
group. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001, ****P<0.0001 (Student’s t-test corrected for 
multiple comparisons using the Holm-Sidak method). c, C57BL/6 and MHC-II KO mice 
were infected with H37Rv or ΔesxH by aerosol (102 c.f.u. for both strains), and the number 
of c.f.u. was determined in the lungs at 21 d postinfection. Dashed horizontal line indicates 
the limit of detection. Data are from one experiment expressed as means ± s.e.m. (n = 5 per 
group). **P <0.01 (unpaired Student’s t-test). MΦ, macrophage; KO, knockout.
