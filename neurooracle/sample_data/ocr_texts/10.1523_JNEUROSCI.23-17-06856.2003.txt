Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is thought to be involved in neuronal survival, migration, morphological and biochemical
differentiation, and modulation of synaptic function in the CNS. In the rodent cortex, postnatal BDNF expression is initially low but
subsequently increases to reach maximal levels around weaning. Thus, BDNF expression peaks at a time when both structural and
functional maturation of cortical circuitry occurs. Although the function of BDNF has been probed using many approaches, its require-
ments during this phase of life have not previously been examined genetically. To test the in vivo requirements for BDNF during this
important phase of development we generated early-onset forebrain-specific BDNF mutant mice. Although these mice undergo
forebrain-restricteddeletionofBDNFbyCre-mediatedrecombinationduringembryogenesis,theyarehealthy,andwedidnotdetectthe
loss of specific cortical excitatory or inhibitory neurons. However, the neocortex of 5-week-old mice was thinner, attributable at least
partly to neuronal shrinkage. Importantly, although visual cortical layer 2/3 neurons in the mutants initially developed normal dendrite
structure, dendritic retraction became apparent by 3 weeks of age. Thus, our observations suggest that cortically expressed BDNF

This is consistent with a role for BDNF in stabilizing the “survival” of circuitry during the phase of activity-dependent reorganization of
cortical connectivity.

Introduction
BDNF, a secreted neurotrophin, regulates aspects of neuronal
survival, migration, morphological and biochemical differentia-
tion, and synaptic function (Bibel and Barde, 2000; Huang and
Reichardt, 2001). Binding of BDNF to the receptor tyrosine ki-
nase TrkB activates signal transduction pathways known to influ-
ence neuronal proliferation, survival, and differentiation (Miller
and Kaplan, 2001). TrkB is also activated by neurotrophin
(NT)-3 and NT-4/5 (Barbacid, 1994; Patapoutian and Reichardt,
2001). Both BDNF and TrkB are widely expressed in neocortical
neurons. BDNF is expressed at low levels in the rodent cortex
during prenatal development, expression rises dramatically dur-
ing the postnatal period, and BDNF is the most abundant neuro-
trophin in both the adult rodent and human cortex (Maisonpi-
erre et al., 1990; Timmusk et al., 1994; Webster et al., 2002). The
striking and necessary actions of neurotrophic factors in promot-
ing the survival and differentiation of peripheral nervous system
neurons have driven intensive studies of the functions of BDNF
and TrkB signaling in the cortex.
In vitro studies have demonstrated that BDNF has survival-
promoting activity on cortical neurons through a calcium-
dependent mechanism (Finkbeiner, 2000) and potent enhance-
ment of inhibitory interneuron differentiation (Marty et al.,
1997). In addition, BDNF and TrkB signaling can influence cor-
tical dendrite growth. In cultured slice preparations, BDNF
caused enhanced arborization of layer II/III and IV neurons
(Horch et al., 1999; Niblock et al., 2000), but a loss of dendritic
complexity in layer VI (McAllister et al., 1995). In addition to
these influences on the survival and differentiation of cortical
neurons, BDNF and TrkB signaling are known to modulate syn-
aptic strength, and BDNF expression and secretion is regulated
by neural activity, suggesting possible functions in the plasticity
and homeostasis of cortical circuitry (Poo, 2001).
Studies of null BDNF and TrkB mutant mice have suggested
relatively subtle BDNF requirements in the survival of most cor-
tical neurons, but have indicated functions in the migration and
differentiation these cells (Klein et al., 1993; Ernfors et al., 1994;
Jones et al., 1994; Alcantara et al., 1997; Silos-Santiago et al., 1997;
Gates et al., 2000; Polleux et al., 2002). However, interpretation of
the phenotype of these null mutants during the postnatal period
is complicated by their poor health. Circumventing these diffi-
culties, analysis of late-onset (3–4 weeks of age) forebrain-
restricted TrkB mutant mice suggested that some cortical excita-
tory neurons are lost after dendritic retraction over a period of
several weeks (Xu et al., 2000). In addition, profound deficits in

spatial learning were documented by Minichiello et al. (1999)
using a different late-onset TrkB mutant.
Although analysis of prenatal BDNF requirements is feasible
using null mutant mice, and later adult requirements for BDNF
have been indirectly probed using late-onset TrkB mutants, the
initial genetic requirements of the BDNF-TrkB signaling system
in the cortex during the period when BDNF expression rises dra-
matically have not been examined. To test these requirements
specifically, we generated early-onset forebrain-restricted BDNF
mutant mice. Notably, we were unable to detect specific cortical
neuron losses, and layer II/III pyramidal neurons initially devel-
oped normal soma size and basal dendritic tree complexity. How-
ever, these cells subsequently shrank in size and lost dendritic
complexity at 3 weeks of age, when BDNF expression normally
rises dramatically in the cortex, indicating that the onset of BDNF
expression is necessary for the maintenance of dendritic
structure.
Materials and Methods
Generation of the BDNFlox targeting construct. The 5 lox site was inserted
into a DraIII site in the 5 untranslated region (UTR), 14 bp downstream
of the exon V splice acceptor site and 18 bp upstream of the initiation
codon (Hohn et al., 1990). The 3 lox site was inserted into a BssHII site
in the 3 UTR 1 kb 3 of the stop codon, downstream of the first of the two
polyadenylation signals (Timmusk et al., 1993). A Simian Virus 40
(SV40)-polyadenylation trimer (Maxwell et al., 1989) was inserted up-
stream of the lox site and an Escherichia coli lacZ gene was inserted im-
mediately 3 to the lox site, followed by Flp recombinase target (FRT)-
flanked phosphoglycerate phosphoglycarate kinase (PGK) neomycin
cassette (Gorski et al., 2002). The resulting genomic sequence containing
the 5 lox site, beginning with the DraIII site and ending with the DraIII
3 half-site was: CACCAGGTGATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATA-
CGAAGTTATATAACCAGGTG. The 3 lox site, ending with the start
codon of the lacZ gene: ATAACTTCGTATAGCATACATTATAC-
GAAGTTATCCGCCACCATG.
Isolation of mouse strain. The linearized targeting construct was elec-
troporated into D3 embryonic stem cells (Doetschman et al., 1985) and
screened for homologous recombinants using the polymerase chain re-
action. The primers used were P1: ACACACACTTGAGAAGGGGG
(MBDSA9) and P2: CTCTTCTCACCTGGTTATATAACTTCT (Fig.
1A). Targeted clones were identified and expanded and the genomic
structure of the mutated BDNF gene was confirmed by DNA blot analy-
sis. DNA for both PCR and DNA blot analysis was prepared as described
previously (Laird et al., 1991). Correctly targeted clones were injected
into blastocysts, and mice carrying the mutation were derived using stan-
dard methods.
Genetics and genotyping. All animal procedures were conducted in
accord with U.S. Public Health Service guidelines and with the approval
of the University of Colorado Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee. Two BDNF lox strains were isolated from independent embryonic
stem cell clones, and the structure of the targeted locus was confirmed by
DNA blot analysis (Fig. 1B). To eliminate the PGK-neomycin selectable
marker, BDNF lox mice were mated to the FLP-4917 Flp recombinase-
expressing transgenic strain (Dymecki, 1996). Anatomical analyses were
performed on mice backcrossed to C57BL/6J for 3–10 generations from
litters culled between postnatal day 7 (P7) and P14 to five or fewer pups.
BDNF protein ELISA. BDNF protein was quantitated using the BDNF
Emax ImmunoAssay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Tissue was dis-
sected and weighed and protein was extracted and quantitated following
the manufacturer’s protocol, except for a change in lysis buffer (to 50 mM
Tris-HCl, 0.6 M NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1% BSA, 0.1 M benzothonion
chloride, 1 mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM PMSF, pH 7.4). All samples from an
individual animal were run in triplicate, and the resulting quantities were
averaged.
Determination of cortical layer thickness. Mice were heavily sedated by
the intraperitoneal injection of 14 l/g avertin (0.025 gm 2,2,2 tribromo-
ethylalcohol, 0.025 ml tertamyl alcohol in PBS) and transcardially per-
fused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The
brains were either cryoprotected overnight in 22% sucrose in 0.1 M phos-
phate buffer and sectioned coronally at 40 m on a cryostat (Leica,
Nussloch, Germany) or postfixed for over 12 hr and sectioned at 50 m
with a vibrating microtome (Leica). Sections were collected into PBS,
washed in 0.5 M Tris, pH 7.5, mounted on slides (Superfrost; Fisher
Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA), and counterstained with cresyl violet, (0.2%
cresyl violet, 0.5% acetic acid, 0.01 M sodium acetate, and 0.02 M sodium
hydroxide) and coverslipped with Permount (Fisher Scientific). Primary
somatosensory and visual cortices [identified as per Franklin and Paxi-
nos (1997) and Antonini et al. (1999)] were identified at six positions,
100 m apart, along the rostrocaudal axis. Layer boundaries were traced
using a camera lucida drawing tube, the thicknesses of layers II–VI mea-
sured at three locations along the medial-lateral axis on each section, and
these values were averaged. There were no significant differences in the
values obtained for the more rostral sections compared with the more
caudal sections within an animal ( p  0.05, t test), so data from all six
sections per animal were averaged, giving a mean layer thickness for
somatosensory or visual cortex in that animal. One-way ANOVA with a
Tukey post hoc test was used to determine statistical significance between
genotypes.
Neuron counts and density determination. Alternating 50 and 500 m
vibratome sections were prepared as above. A block 2 mm by 2 mm of
the primary visual cortex was dissected from the 500 m sections, em-
bedded in JB4 plastic resin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Wash-
ington, PA), and sectioned coronally at 3 m with a glass knife. Sections
were collected into water, mounted, and counterstained with cresyl vio-
let. Layers were identified, outlined, and measured in the 50 m cresyl
violet–stained sections of primary visual cortex. Although the overall
thickness of the cortex varied across the set of 500 m sections from an
animal, the fractional layer contributions did not vary significantly.
Thus, cortical layer boundaries were defined as percentages of total cor-
tex thickness, which were used to draw layer boundaries onto the 3 m
sections. Neurons (cells with a darkly stained cytoplasm and a large,
distinct, and more lightly stained nucleus with a nucleolus) were counted
in a 215 m wide strip of cortex from pictures taken at 630 magnifica-
tion, cortical area was measured using software (Openlab, Coventry,
England), and the density of neurons was calculated. One-way ANOVA
with a Tukey post hoc test was used to determine statistical significance.
Diolistics. Diolistics was performed as described in Gan et al. (2000)
with slight modification. The lipophilic dyes DiI and DiO (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR) were dissolved in methylene chloride to a final
concentration of 0.06 mg/l in 50 l. The solubilized dyes and 25 mg of
tungsten beads were sonicated in a water bath sonicator to dryness, then
1.5 ml of water was added and the beads were sonicated for 5 min.
Approximately 75 cm of Gold Coat tubing (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was
coated with 3 ml of DiI/DiO tungsten slurry. Coronal sections (200 m)
were prepared as described above on a vibrating microtome. Eight to 12
visual cortical slices were shot using this tubing in a gene gun (Bio-Rad)
at 70–80 psi, through a 3 m pore size and 8.0  10 5 pores/cm 2 density
filter (Falcon cell culture inserts, catalog number 3096; Becton Dickin-
son, Mountain View, CA). The slices were then placed in PBS, incubated
in the dark at room temperature overnight, then at 4°C overnight in 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, washed in 100 mM
Tris, pH 7.4 and mounted onto Superfrost/Plus microscope slides (Fish-
er Scientific) using ProLong Antifade mounting media (Molecular
Probes). Fluorescence images (1000 magnification) were taken at 0.5
m intervals through the entire visible extent of each cell analyzed using
a Zeiss (Oberkochen, Germany) Axioplan deconvolution microscope
with attached Hamamatsu (Bridgewater, NJ) C4742-95 digital camera.
The number of primary dendrites, branches per primary dendrites, and
soma area were analyzed with the investigator unaware of the genotype
using the Open Lab software suite (Improvision, Coventry, UK).
Biocytin analysis of dendritic complexity. Layer II/III neurons were ret-
rogradely filled as described previously (Xu et al., 2000). Vibratome sec-
tions (75 m) were processed for peroxidase staining. Endogenous per-
oxidases were quenched by 30 min incubation in 10% methanol and 3%
H2O2 in PBS. Sections were then rinsed five times in PBS and incubated
for 2–5 hr in 0.4% vectastain solution A and B (Vector Laboratories,

Burlingame, CA) and 0.0075% Triton X-100 in PBS, rinsed three times in
PBS, incubated for 5 min. in 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS, then rinsed
three times in PBS and allowed to develop for 2–5 min. in 0.014% cobalt
chloride, 0.014% nickel chloride, and 0.003% H2O2 0.05% diaminoben-
zidine in PBS. Sections were mounted on slides, dehydrated, and cover-
slipped as described above.
Cells were reconstructed and drawn using a camera lucida drawing
tube at 400 magnification, and a modified Sholl analysis (Sholl, 1953)
was used. Concentric circles in 20 m diameter increments were drawn
around the center of the reconstructed soma, and the number of den-
drites crossing each circle was counted. In addition, the number of pri-
mary, secondary, tertiary, and higher-order dendrites, dendrite branch
points and end points were counted. Soma sizes were measured using
NIH Image software. One-way ANOVA with a Tukey post hoc test was
used to determine statistical significance.
Cell counts using immunocytochemical markers. Cryostat (40 m) or
vibratome (50 m) sections, prepared as described above, were collected
into PBS, incubated in block (Tris-buffered saline, 0.4% Triton X-100,
1% glycine, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1% normal goat serum) for
4 hr at room temperature, and then incubated in primary antibody for 2 d
at 4°C. Primary antibodies specific for -galactosidase (1:1000, ICN
Pharmaceuticals, Auroria, OH; or 1:2000, from C. Yee and T. Finger,
University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO), NeuN
(1:1000, Molecular Probes), Calretinin (1:1000), Calbindin (1:200),
GABA (1:500, Sigma, St Louis, MO), NPY (1:1000, Incstar, Minneapolis,
MN), S100 (1:500, DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), SCIP (1:100, a gift from
Dr. G. Lemke, Salk Institute, San Diego, CA) and ER81 (1:500, a kind gift
from Dr. T. M. Jessell, Columbia University, New York, NY).
Sections were washed three times in TBST (Tris-buffered saline, 0.4%
Triton X-100) for 5 min and incubated in Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG
antibody (1:200, Molecular Probes) and Alexa 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG
antibody (1:200, Molecular Probes) for 2 hr at room temperature. Sec-
tions were washed twice in TBST, once in TBS and once in 0.5 M Tris, pH
7.5, before mounting on Superfrost slides and coverslipped with Fluoro-
mount (Fisher Scientific), or they were incubated in 0.2 M KCl, pH 2, for
2 min, incubated in 0.0001% Bisbenzamide in 0.2 M KCl, pH 2, for 45 sec,
washed in 0.2 M KCl, pH 2, for 2 min and then rinsed in 0.5 M Tris, pH 7.5,
before coverslipping as above. Images were captured using a microscope
(Leica) running Openlab software (Improvision).
Calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive cells were counted in three
strips of primary visual cortex 1200 m wide at 100 magnification.
Immunopositive cells were counted across the entire thickness of the
cortex, except for Calbindin, for which only layers IV–VI were counted
because Calbindin is also expressed in pyramidal neurons in layers II/III.
Between five and eight strips per animal of primary visual cortex 335 m
wide, at 100 magnification, were used to count the ratio of GABA,
SCIP, and ER81-positive cells to NeuN-positive cells. Counts were per-
formed blind to the animal’s genotype. One-way ANOVA with a Tukey
post hoc test was used to determine statistical significance.
Results
Generation of early forebrain-restricted BDNF mutant mice
To enable the generation of tissue-specific BDNF mutant mice
using the Cre-site-specific DNA recombinase, lox sites were in-
serted into exon V, the BDNF protein-coding exon. A trimerized
polyadenylation signal was inserted upstream of the 3 lox site,
and an E. coli lacZ gene was inserted downstream (Fig. 1A). Cre-

mediated recombination deletes the polyadenylation signals, al-
lowing lacZ transcription and translation in place of BDNF (Fig.
1B). Mice homozygous for BDNF lox (BDNF lox/lox) are viable and
fertile, and in 5-week-old BDNF lox/lox mice BDNF protein con-
centration in visual cortex and hippocampus was not signifi-
cantly different from wild-type (n  4 mice/genotype, p  0.05).
To
produce
forebrain-restricted
BDNF
mutant
mice,
BDNF lox/ mice were mated to Emx1 IREScre/; BDNF neo/ mice.
Emx1 IREScre/ mice, heterozygous for the Emx1IREScre allele, ex-
press Cre recombinase by embryonic day 10.5 in the precursors of
cortical and hippocampal excitatory neurons and glia, causing
recombination between lox sites, without expression in most
subcortical structures and peripheral tissues (Gorski et al., 2002).
Forebrain-specific mutant mice have the genotype Emx1 IREScre/;
BDNF neo/lox (referred to hereafter as Emx-BDNF KO). Control ge-
notypes used included mice referred to as wild-type (including
true wild-type, Emx1 IREScre/, and BDNF lox/ genotypes) and
heterozygotes (including BDNF neo/ and BDNF neo/lox).
Extent and specificity of the early forebrain-restricted
BDNF mutation
Although we previously characterized the timing, tissue, and cell-
type specificity of Emx1 IREScre-mediated recombination using
Cre-dependent reporter mouse strains (Gorski et al., 2002), we
wanted to determine directly its activity on the BDNF lox allele.
Spatial and temporal specificity of recombination was character-
ized by X-gal staining of brains from Emx1 IREScre/; BDNF lox/
mice at 2, 3, and 5 weeks of age. Recombination was extensive in
the neocortex, hippocampus, and amygdala and was scarce to
undetectable in other CNS regions. The onset and extent of -Gal
expression in the neocortex and hippocampus of Emx1 IREScre/;
BDNF lox/ mice was both qualitatively (Fig. 1C,D) and quantita-
tively (data not shown) indistinguishable from age-matched BD-
NF lacZ/ mice indicating that Emx IREScre/ causes essentially
complete deletion of the BDNF coding sequences in neocortex
and hippocampus before the onset of BDNF expression.
To further determine the efficacy of the Emx-BDNF KO muta-
tion, BDNF protein from the brains of 5-week-old mice was
quantified. BDNF protein was undetectable in the visual cortex
and hippocampus of Emx-BDNF KO mice (Fig. 1G) (n  3 mice/
genotype, p  0.001). Although BDNF protein in thalamus and
midbrain/hindbrain structures of Emx-BDNF KO mice was re-
duced compared with wild-type mice ( p  0.01), only the cortex
and hippocampus were significantly different compared with
heterozygous mice ( p  0.05), indicating that the subcortical
reductions are attributable mostly to the Emx-BDNF KO mice
having one BDNF neo allele. Thus, these data document an effec-
tively complete loss of BDNF in the cortex and hippocampus of
Emx-BDNF KO mice, and reductions comparable to those found
in heterozygotes in the thalamus and midbrain/hindbrain.
General characteristics of Emx-BDNF KO mice
Emx-BDNF KO mutant mice often opened their eyes 1 d later than
their littermates, at P15 instead of P14, suggesting that they ma-
ture slightly more slowly than their littermates. At the ages of 3
and 5 weeks Emx-BDNF KO mice weighed less than their litter-
mates (Fig. 1E). However, between 2 and 12 weeks, there was not
a significant difference in tibia length between genotypes, indi-
cating that skeletal growth was not affected, and by 8 weeks of age
the body weights of wild-type and Emx-BDNF KO mutant mice
were not significantly different (Fig. 1F). Beyond 16 weeks of age,
Emx-BDNF KO mice developed mild obesity (35% increase in
body mass at 16 weeks compared with wild-type, p  0.05, n 
10). BDNF neo/ mice developed more severe obesity and at a
younger age, by 8 weeks (80% increase in body mass at 8 weeks
compared with wild-type, p  0.05, n  10) as reported previ-
ously (Lyons et al., 1999; Kernie et al., 2000). Interestingly,
Emx1 IREScre; BDNF lox/ mice did not become obese, indicating
that, in contrast to widespread BDNF heterozygosity, forebrain-
restricted BDNF heterozygosity is not sufficient to cause obesity.
Of eight mutants allowed to age, two died between 12 and 14
months, 5 between 14 and 16 months, and 1 at 18 months of age,
suggesting a shortening of lifespan. Emx-BDNF KO mice exhibited
poor fecundity; only two litters were born from 20 matings in
which an Emx-BDNF KO male was paired with a wild-type female
or vice versa (10 matings each way). Emx-BDNF KO males ap-
peared more aggressive than normal and neither males nor fe-
males built normal nests. Detailed behavioral analysis of Emx-
BDNF KO mice has documented that although abnormalities were
not detected in tests for ataxia and anxiety, there are substantial
deficits in spatial and nonspatial learning (Gorski et al., 2003).
Cortical volume is reduced but cell losses are not apparent
Despite the behavioral deficits exhibited by Emx-BDNF KO mice,
initial examination of their brains revealed relatively normal cy-
toarchitecture. Given the evidence supporting a role for BDNF/
TrkB signaling in the survival, differentiation, and function of
cortical neurons, we analyzed more carefully the cortical anat-
omy of Emx-BDNF KO mice. The cortex of 5-week-old Emx-
BDNF KO mice was thinner than in control mice (Fig. 2A–F).
Somatosensory cortical thickness was reduced by 12% ( p 
0.001, n  3) and visual cortical thickness was reduced by 17%
( p  0.001, n  3). Determination of the absolute number of
neurons in specific cortical regions is impractical, thus, we quan-
tified neuronal density. A 22% increase in neuron density was
found in layer II/III of Emx-BDNF KO visual cortex compared
with wild-type (Fig. 2C) ( p  0.01, n  3), suggesting that thin-
ning of the cortex is attributable at least partly to shrinkage of
neurons. Layers IV–VI showed a trend toward increased density
that was not statistically significant (Fig. 2G).
Late-onset forebrain-restricted TrkB mutant mice were re-
ported to lose some excitatory neurons in layer V, between 6 and
10 weeks of age, several weeks after the loss of TrkB (Xu et al.,
2000). The lost neurons included subsets of neurons expressing
ER81, an ETS family transcription factor (Lin et al., 1998), and
SCIP, a POU domain transcription factor (Monuki et al., 1989).
We counted these cells in 5-week-old mice but found no signifi-
cant difference in the ratio of ER81/NeuN or SCIP/NeuN
cells between Emx-BDNF KO mice and control genotypes (Fig.
3A–F) (n  3 mice per genotype). Thus, we did not detect a
requirement for BDNF in the differentiation or survival of SCIP
or ER81-expressing layer V excitatory neurons through 5 weeks
of age.
To test whether cortically produced BDNF is involved in pro-
moting the migration, chemical differentiation, and/or survival
of cortical inhibitory interneurons, we examined the distribution
of GABA-, calbindin-, parvalbumin-, neuropeptide Y (NPY)-
and calretinin-expressing cells in the somatosensory and visual
cortices of 3- and 5-week-old mice. No differences in the quali-
tative pattern of immunostaining (Fig. 4A), or in the number of
GABA-, calbindin-, or parvalbumin-expressing cells were de-
tected between genotypes (Fig. 4B,C). Thus, as determined using
these methods, BDNF was not required for the migration, prolif-

drocytes, and these cells are known to express the truncated TrkB
receptor (Frisen et al., 1993) as well as the full-length TrkB recep-
tor after injury (McKeon et al., 1997), and they have been re-
ported to respond to BDNF (Roback et al., 1995). To determine
whether a disruption of the proportion of glia to neurons con-
tributed to the cortical thinning, we counted non-neuronal cells
in the visual and somatosensory cortex. There was no significant
difference in the ratio of 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole–posi-
tive nuclei or S-100-positive astrocytes to NeuN-positive neurons
(Fig. 3G–I,K,L), suggesting that Emx-BDNF KO mice have neither
lost significant glial populations nor undergone extensive gliosis.
Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that cortically
produced BDNF is not required for survival of the majority of
neurons or glia in the cortex to 5 weeks of age. The absence of
detected cell losses and the observed increase in neuronal density
suggested that shrinkage of cortical neurons could cause cortical
thinning in Emx-BDNF KO mice.

II/III had significantly increased neuron density at 5 weeks of age
(Fig. 2C), we studied layer II/III neurons. At 5 weeks of age, the
soma area was reduced by 29 and 24% in Emx-BDNF KO mice
compared with wild-type and heterozygotes, respectively ( p 
0.001). This result indicated that soma shrinkage contributed to
cortical thinning, but did not discriminate between two possibil-
ities; either a failure in the initial development of soma size or the
development of normal soma size followed by contraction. To
distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed soma size at
two younger ages. At 2 weeks of age the neuron soma area was not
significantly different between the genotypes ( p  0.7) (Fig. 5A–
C), but at 3 weeks of age there was a 28 and 22% decrease in soma
area in Emx-BDNF KO mice compared with wild-type and het-
erozygous mice, respectively ( p  0.001 and p  0.05, respective-
ly). Between 2 and 5 weeks of age, the soma size did not change
significantly in the wild-type and heterozygous mice. Notably,
the soma area shrank between 2 and 3 weeks of age in Emx-
BDNF KO mice ( p  0.001), and again between 3 and 5 weeks
( p  0.05) in these animals. Thus, BDNF is not required for layer
II/III pyramidal neuron somas to grow to their full size, but is
necessary for the maintenance of soma size between 14 and 35 d
of age.
Next, we analyzed the number of primary dendrites, which
increases rapidly during the first two postnatal weeks in rats to
beyond the adult level before declining slightly (Miller, 1988). At
5 weeks, the number of primary dendrites was reduced, by 36%
( p  0.001) compared with wild-type mice and 25% ( p  0.001)
compared with heterozygotes (Fig. 5D–I, K). To distinguish be-
tween possible BDNF requirements for the development or
maintenance of dendrite number, we analyzed younger animals.
At 2 weeks of age there was no difference between the genotypes
(Fig. 5A–C,K), but at 3 weeks the number of primary dendrites
was reduced by 19% ( p  0.05) compared with wild-type. Im-
portantly, the number of primary dendrites in Emx-BDNF KO
mice was significantly reduced between 2 weeks of age and both 3
and 5 weeks of age ( p  0.01), indicating that some primary
dendrites formed in Emx-BDNF KO mice but were subsequently
lost, as opposed to a lack of dendrite growth per se. Thus, BDNF
is required in a similar time frame beginning after 2 weeks of age
for maintenance of both soma size and primary basal dendrite
number in layer II/III of the visual cortex.
Several reports have described BDNF influences on the
branching of cortical dendrites. Thus, we analyzed basal dendrite
branching in layer II/III. At 2 weeks of age there was no difference
in the number of branch points per primary dendrite between the
genotypes, but by 5 weeks of age there was a 29% reduction
compared with wild-type and a 34% reduction compared with
heterozygotes ( p  0.05) (Fig. 5L). Analysis of branch points per
dendrite order revealed significant differences between genotypes
(main effect for genotype F(2,9)  29.03, p  0.0001) (Fig. 5i),
with intermediate to distal dendrites most affected. Modified
Sholl analysis revealed a decrease in basal dendritic arbor com-
plexity at 40 m and greater distances from the neuron soma
(Fig. 5O) ( p  0.001), also indicating that distal dendritic
branching is more severely affected than proximal branching. In
combination, these data revealed that cortical BDNF is not re-
quired for the initial elaboration of layer II/III neuron basal den-
drites, but is required for the maintenance of the dendritic tree.
As described above, we did not detect cortical BDNF require-
ments for the survival or biochemical differentiation of specific
excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but found that cortical BDNF
is required for the maintenance of the size of layer II/III excitatory
neurons. We were curious whether there might be a similar re-
quirement of BDNF for maintenance of interneuron size. We
measured the soma area of cortical inhibitory neurons and found
that at 3 weeks of age the soma area of calbindin-positive neurons
from layers IV–VI was reduced by 20% ( p  0.001) compared
with both wild-type and heterozygous littermates (Fig. 5i). The
soma of parvalbumin-positive neurons was reduced by 10%
( p  0.01) (Fig. 5P). Thus, in addition to excitatory neurons,
some inhibitory neurons require cortically produced BDNF for
normal morphology by 3 weeks of age. Importantly, the timing of
these BDNF requirements correlates well with the timing of the
onset of substantial BDNF expression in visual cortex as deter-
mined using the lacZ marker present in BDNF lacZ/ mice (Fig.
5P–R).
Discussion
Lack of a detected requirement for neuronal survival
Several reports have indicated that BDNF/TrkB signaling sup-
ports the survival of cortical neurons in vitro and in vivo (Ghosh

et al., 1994; Alcantara et al., 1997; Ohgoh et
al., 1998; Araki et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2000;
Catapano et al., 2001). Our counts of spe-
cific neuronal subpopulations and ratios
of neurons to non-neuronal cells revealed
no effect of a loss of cortical BDNF. This
result is notably distinct from the analysis
of late-onset forebrain-restricted TrkB
mutant mice, with reported losses of
ER81- and SCIP-expressing cortical neu-
rons (Xu et al., 2000). The loss of TrkB is
expected to lead to a more severe pheno-
type than the loss of BDNF, because in ad-
dition to BDNF, both NT-4/5 and NT-3
can activate TrkB (Barbacid, 1994; Pata-
poutian and Reichardt, 2001). Increased
expression of alternate TrkB ligands might
compensate for the loss of BDNF. Indeed,
we found that NT-3 protein levels were
significantly elevated in the cortex and hip-
pocampus of 5-week-old Emx-BDNFKO
mice (approximately twofold between Emx-
BDNFKO mice and BDNFlox/, p  0.05,
n  3 mice per genotype), supporting this
hypothesis. Also, developmental compensa-
tions might occur in Emx-BDNFKO mice
that do not occur in the in vitro experiments
or after adult-onset deletion of TrkB. Re-
gardless, our data suggest that BDNF is not
necessary for the survival of most cortical
neurons during the first 5 weeks of life in the
mouse.
Interneuron differentiation
In vitro and in vivo studies have suggested
that BDNF may influence the maturation
of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons
(Marty et al., 1997). P15–P20 BDNF null
mutant mice had reduced expression of
NPY, parvalbumin, and calbindin in the
cortex and hippocampus (Jones et al.,
1994), and mice overexpressing BDNF un-
der control of the CaMKII ( subunit
calcium calmodulin kinase II) promoter
had precocious expression of the inhibi-
tory neuron markers glutamic acid decar-
boxylase
(GAD65)
and
parvalbumin
(Huang et al., 1999). Thus, we were sur-
prised that cortical BDNF, although suffi-
cient to enhance differentiated properties
of inhibitory neurons, was not necessary
for their biochemical maturation, as as-
sayed using immunocytochemistry for
GABA, parvalbumin, and calbindin. Per-
haps subcortical afferents still expressing
BDNF in Emx-BDNF KO mice including
cholinergic afferents from the basal fore-
brain (Beaulieu and Somogyi, 1991), do-
paminergic afferents from the midbrain
(Sesack et al., 1995), or noradrenergic af-
ferents from the brainstem (Paspalas and
Papadopoulos, 1999) provide a source for
the differentiation of interneurons.

Gorski et al. • BDNF Is Required for Cortical Dendrite Maintenance

BDNF is required for maintenance of neuronal morphology
Our results support the hypothesis that BDNF expression in the
developing forebrain is necessary for the maintenance of the an-
atomical characteristics of cortical neurons, both soma size and
dendritic structure. Neuronal soma size has been correlated with
both advancing neuronal development and increased neural ac-
tivity. The molecular regulation of soma size is not well under-
stood. Signaling through Ras G-protein and Akt protein kinase
has been shown to affect cell size in multiple organisms and cell
types, including murine cortical neurons (Heumann et al., 2000;
Kozma and Thomas, 2002) and Ras and Akt are regulated by
TrkB signaling (Miller and Kaplan, 2001), suggesting that re-
duced signaling through Ras and Akt could lead to neuronal
soma shrinkage in the absence of BDNF.
The processes of initial dendrite formation and branching oc-
curred normally in the absence of cortical BDNF through the first
two postnatal weeks. Thus, any influence of the low levels of
BDNF present in the visual cortex before 2 weeks of age on layer
II/III pyramidal neuron development is limited. However, when
BDNF expression normally rises dramatically in the cortex be-
tween 2 and 3 weeks of age (Timmusk et al., 1994) (Fig. 5L), a
requirement for the sustenance of neuronal size and dendritic
complexity became apparent. By 3 and 5 weeks of age, Emx-
BDNF KO mice exhibited significant reductions of basal dendritic
complexity in layer II/III pyramidal neurons.
Similarly, in another in vivo study, Xu et al. (2000) reported
that the loss of TrkB sometime between 2 and 4 weeks of age leads
to reduced layer II/III cortical neuron soma size and basal den-
drite complexity at 6 weeks of age, indicating an ongoing need for
TrkB signaling in the maintenance of these cells. It is important to
note that the timing of mutation is different in our study and that
of Xu et al. (2000). In their mice, there is little loss of TrkB at 2
weeks, but it plateaus at 4 weeks of age (Xu et al., 2000). In
contrast, Emx-BDNF KO mice undergo deletion of the BDNF cod-
ing exon in the embryo. It is possible that the similarities in the
loss of cortical neuron dendritic arborization between 2 and 3
weeks in Emx-BDNF KO mice and 4 and 6 weeks in late-onset
TrkB mutants (Xu et al., 2000) indicate that developmental and
adult functions of BDNF in the cortex are essentially identical.
Previous studies of the effects of added BDNF on dendrites in
cultured cortical slices have been interpreted mostly in the con-
text of roles for BDNF-TrkB signaling in initiating dendrite
growth (McAllister et al., 1995, 1996, 1997; Horch et al., 1999;
Niblock et al., 2000; Yacoubian and Lo, 2000). However, the
ability of TrkB-IgG to cause the loss of previously existing den-
drites in layer IV has been reported previously (McAllister et al.,
1997), consistent with our finding that BDNF is necessary for
dendrite maintenance in layer II/III in vivo.
Although some of the specific anatomical abnormalities in
layer II/III of Emx-BDNF KO mice are similar to predictions from
BDNF effects on cultured cortical slices, others are different. Sim-
ilar to our findings, Niblock et al. (2000) found that bath appli-
cation of BDNF to rat cortical slices caused increased intermedi-
ate basal dendritic arborization of layer II/III somatosensory
pyramidal neurons. In contrast to our findings, they found no
effect on soma size or the number of basal dendrites. Horch et al.
(1999) found that overexpression of BDNF in ferret slices led to
an increase in the number of layer II/III basal dendrites, consis-
tent with our observations of a loss of basal dendrites in the
absence of BDNF. In contrast to our findings, they found reduced
distal arborization and no effect of TrkB-IgG on the number of
basal dendrites. The differences between the results of these in
vitro studies and our analysis of the BDNF mutants are likely to
reside, at least in part, in the presence of a different growth factor
environment and more intact neural circuitry in vivo relative to
cultured slice preparations.
The mechanism by which BDNF exerts its stabilizing effect on
dendrite morphology is uncertain. BDNF-TrkB signaling might
regulate the stability of dendrites directly. For example, TrkB
signaling could regulate the activity of members of the Rho family
of GTPases, known to modify dendrite number, form, and sta-
bility in a variety of neural types including cortical neurons
(Threadgill et al., 1997; Li et al., 2000; Nakayama et al., 2000;
Tashiro et al., 2000; Wong et al., 2000; Hayashi et al., 2002; Luo,
2002). It is known that neurite outgrowth stimulated by NGF
signaling through the TrkA receptor is regulated by interactions
between Rho and Rac (Yamaguchi et al., 2001; Nusser et al.,
2002). Given that NGF-TrkA and BDNF-TrkB signaling share
many common transduction pathways, BDNF is likely to modu-
late dendrite structure and stability in part through the Rho fam-
ily of GTPases.
Alternatively, BDNF could influence dendritic structure indi-
rectly through modulating synaptic activity. The levels and/or
patterns of neuronal activity could be perturbed in the absence of
BDNF. Both the development and the stability of dendritic form
is sensitive to neural activity and is influenced by the process of
synaptogenesis (Cline, 2001; Wong and Ghosh, 2002). BDNF can
directly influence neuronal activity at very short timescales, act-
ing as a neurotransmitter (Kafitz et al., 1999). Over longer time
scales, BDNF can influence cortical synaptic strength and matu-
ration (Akaneya et al., 1996, 1997; Takei et al., 1997; Huber et al.,
1998; Rutherford et al., 1998; Desai et al., 1999; Kinoshita et al.,
1999; Itami et al., 2000; Leslie et al., 2001). The necessity of BDNF
for maximal long-term potentiation of synaptic strength (Poo,
2001) could suggest a requirement for stabilization of many syn-
apses present in wild-type animals.
Regardless of whether BDNF directly
or indirectly influences dendrite structure,
our results indicate that the essential func-
tion for cortical BDNF is not to support
neuronal survival, the classic neurotrophic
function, or to regulate the initial growth
of cortical dendritic trees, as suggested by
in vitro studies. Instead, cortical BDNF ap-
pears to support the “survival” of dendritic
structure that is generated through BDNF-
independent mechanisms. This require-
ment for dendrite maintenance occurs
during the period of life when BDNF ex-
pression normally rises (between eye
opening and weaning in murine visual

cortex). This is particularly intriguing considered in the context
of models of activity-dependent development of circuitry. In
such models, an initially exuberant and relatively nonspecific set
of connections is formed and then subsequently refined through
a process in which connections are selected based upon Hebbian
rules (Katz and Shatz, 1996). A lack of BDNF could interfere with
the maintenance of many connections by not allowing their re-
inforcement. It is apparent from our work that BDNF signaling is
necessary in vivo for the maintenance of cortical neuron mor-
phology during a key phase of life, during which there is activity-
dependent reorganization of cortical circuitry (Gordon and
Stryker, 1996). Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms under-
lying these actions of BDNF on cortical dendrites and synapses
will likely be fruitful in furthering our understanding of cortical
plasticity.
