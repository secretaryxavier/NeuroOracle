ABSTRACT
The persistence of numerous pathogenic bac-
teria important in disease states, such as tuberculosis, in
humans and domestic animals has been ascribed to an inhibi-
tion of fusion between the phagosomal vesicles containing the
bacteria and lysosomes in the host cells [Elsbach, P. & Weiss,
J. (1988) Biochim. Biophys. Adia 974, 29-52; Thoen, C. 0.
(1988)J. Am. Vet. Med. Assoc. 193, 1045-1048]. In tuberculosis
this effect has been indirectly attributed to the production of
cord factor (a,a-trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate). We show here that
cord factor is extraordinarily effective at inhibiting Ca2+-
induced fusion between phospholipid vesicles and suggest a
mechanism by which cord factor confers this effect. These
findings are likely to be important in our understanding of the
pathogenesis and treatment of many diseases of bacterial
etiology.
Foreign bacteria are normally identified as such and phago-
cytized by macrophages in higher animals, including humans
(1-3, 41). In macrophages the phagocytic vesicle containing
the bacteria (the phagosome) fuses with lysosomes, ulti-
mately resulting in degradation of the bacteria. However, in
numerous diseases, phagosomal-lysosomal fusion is inhib-
ited in some way, resulting in persistence of the bacteria
within the host cell. For example, the bacteria Mycobacte-
rium tuberculosis and Nocardia asteroides, the etiological
agents for tuberculosis and nocardiosis, respectively, elicit
normal cellular responses to foreign bacteria such as release
of superoxide and phagocytosis by macrophages (4, 5), but
the bacteria-containing phagosome does not fuse with either
primary or secondary lysosomes (4-7). The bacteria are thus
free to continue to divide and to invade other host cells.
Although the means of persistence of the bacteria are there-
fore clear, the mechanism by which they evade phagosomal-
lysosomal fusion has not been elucidated, despite the impor-
tance ofthis phenomenon in human welfare. In this report we
provide data that suggest such a mechanism.
Cord factor (CF), or a,a-trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate, is a cell
wall glycolipid of Mycobacterium, Nocardia, Rhodococcus,
and Corynebacterium. The term cord factor was coined by
Noll et al. (8) to describe the glycolipid obtained after a gentle
petroleum ether extract of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
which prevented formation of bacterial cords, or filaments.
Observations of the effects of CF and related analogues have
provided the basis for suggesting that this molecule plays a
role in the persistence of the bacteria in the host cell (5-7).
The CF molecule consists of the sugar trehalose esterified to
two mycolic acid residues (Fig. 1), which range in length from
20 to 80 carbons, depending on the bacterial species. Three
decades of research on CF have uncovered a myriad of
biological activities in the pathogenesis of mycobacterial and
nocardial diseases, including high toxicity in mice (9, 10),
antitumor activity (11), immunomodulation (12, 13), and
granulomagenic activity (14). Indirect evidence has been
provided that CF might be responsible for inhibiting fusion
between adjacent membranes in vivo (6). This finding is
particularly appealing in view of the work of Goodrich and
Baldeschwieler (15, 16) and Hoekstra and coworkers (17, 18),
where carbohydrates anchored to the membrane by a hydro-
phobic group have been shown to confer an inhibition of
fusion in model membrane systems. Goodrich and Balde-
schwieler (15, 16) reported that galactose anchored to cho-
lesterol prevents fusion damage to liposomes during freezing
and drying. Using the glycosphingolipid globoside GL-4,
Hoekstra and coworkers (17, 18) have observed that a
reduction in the initial rate of fusion is related to the size of
the headgroup of the globoside. Furthermore, trehalose, a
sugar found at high concentrations in many organisms that
naturally survive freezing or dehydration (19, 20), strongly
inhibits fusion between membranes during freezing (21, 22) or
dehydration (19, 20). This remarkable effect, which is thought
to account partly for the survival of extreme dehydration by
many organisms, requires direct interaction between the
trehalose and the membranes, probably involving hydrogen
bonding between hydroxyl groups on the sugar and the polar
head group of the phospholipids (19, 20). In the present study
we show, using a model liposome system under fusogenic
conditions, that CF is more effective than free trehalose in
inhibiting fusion and suggest a mechanism for this effect that
may help to elucidate the role ofCF under conditions thought
to exist in vivo. We wish to point out at the outset, however,
that in order for CF to inhibit phagosomal-lysosomal fusion
in vivo it must be found in the phagosomal membrane. As yet,
there is no evidence that this molecule is transferred from the
bacterial cell, where it is synthesized, to the phagosomal
membrane. Thus, the data presented here establish only that
CF can strongly inhibit fusion between bilayers but do not
demonstrate that this is the mechanism in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

CF, or a,a-trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate, derived from N.
asteroides strain GUH-2. This strain produces CF with mycolic acid
residues ranging from C48 to C54 in length and 0-4 degrees of
unsaturation.
Puriffication of Cord Factor. N. asteroides CF was purified
from N. asteroides strain GUH-2. N. asteroides was grown
to late logarithmic phase (24 hr) on brain heart infusion
medium containing 1% glycerol at 37°C. Formalin-killed
bacteria were collected by filtration, rinsed of medium with
Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and freeze-dried (ly-
ophilized) prior to extraction of the cell wall. The cell wall
was extracted three times with chloroform/methanol, 1:2
(vol/vol). The chloroform and methanol were removed from
cell wall extract by flash evaporation; the extract was redis-
solved in chloroform. The chloroform-soluble fraction was
purified essentially as described by Silva et al. (23). Purity of
CF was determined by mass spectroscopy (Hewlett-
Packard) and infrared spectroscopy (Perkin-Elmer model
1750). Free mycolic acids were isolated by alkaline hydrol-
ysis of CF and purified by silica gel TLC with n-hexane/
diethyl ether/acetone/acetic acid, 70:30:11:1 (vol/vol) as the
mobile phase.
Liposomes. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) of Pam,-
Ole-PA and PE [1:1 molar ratio (Pam,Ole-PA/PE)] with and
without CF as indicated were prepared by modification of the
ether vaporization method of Deamer (24). Briefly, an ether
emulsion of lipid was injected into aqueous buffer containing
fluorescent probe at 70°C, and the resulting liposomes were
then extruded at 500 psi (1 psi = 6.89 kPa) of N2 through two
0.2-jum Nuclepore filters maintained at 70°C (25). LUVs were
prepared to contain either 25 mM ANTS, 40 mM NaCI, or 90
mM DPX
in
10 mM N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-
aminosulfonic acid (Tes) buffer (26). External, untrapped
buffer and probe were replaced by 10 mM Tes/100 mM NaCl
(pH 7.4 at 25°C) by centrifugation across Bio-Rad P-6 100- to
200-mesh resin (27).
Fusion Assay. Ca2+-induced fusion was measured by the
mixing of aqueous internal contents of two populations of
liposomes. One population was prepared to contain a fluo-
rescent probe (ANTS); the other was prepared to contain a
fluorescent quencher (DPX). Upon fusion of these two lip-
osomes, a decrease in fluorescence is seen by collision-
dependent quenching. Leakage of either probe from the
liposome does not result in fluorescence quenching (28).
Cuvettes were prepared to contain lipid at 0.1 mg/ml in 10
mM Tes/100 mM NaCl. Total fusion (0%1o fluorescence) was
determined by preparation of LUVs containing both fluores-
cent probe and quench probe. Maximum fluorescence for
each sample was determined prior to addition of CaCl2.
Calcium-induced fusion was allowed to take place in a
cuvette at 250C with periodic mixing. Final fluorescence was
measured 5 min after the addition of CaCI2. Independent
measurements of these LUVs indicate that no further
quenching of fluorescent probe occurs after a 5-min incuba-
tion.
Freeze-Fracture Electron Microscopy. Control and calcium-
fused vesicles were quenched from room temperature in
liquid propane and maintained in liquid nitrogen. A Balzers
BAF 400D freeze-fracture apparatus was used to obtain
standard knife-fracture replicas (at - 1000C) by vaporization
ofplatinum at 45'. Replicas were examined and photographed
on a Philips 410 electron microscope.
Photon Correlation Spectroscopy. Quasi-elastic light scat-
tering was performed using a Langley-Ford model 1096
correlator run in the autocorrelation mode. The light source
was the 488-nm line of an argon laser. Scattered light was
collected at 900 by using a Hamamatsu R585 photomultiplier
tube. Data were analyzed by cumulative fit. Liposomes were
incubated with 10 mM Ca2' at 250C for 5 min prior to
sampling. Average frequency (F) was determined by using
cumulative data collected eight times for 120 sec each.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
To investigate the effects of CF on fusion between mem-
branes, we have used as a model system artificial lipid
vesicles (liposomes) prepared with and without CF incorpo-
rated into the bilayer. Separate studies (to be described
elsewhere) suggest that CF is incorporated into the phospho-
lipid bilayers, as one might expect from consideration of the
structure of the CF molecule. Since membrane fusion in cells
is known to be influenced strongly by Ca2l
(29-32), a lipid
mixture was chosen that easily undergoes fusion upon addi-
tion of this cation. We are well aware that this lipid mixture
does not mimic the composition of biological membranes in
vitro, but suggest that it nevertheless provides a useful model.
Results from three independent techniques show that CF
strongly inhibits Ca2+-induced fusion in this model.
Freeze Fracture. The results from freeze-fracture studies
(Fig. 2) provide visual evidence of the stabilizing effect of CF
with respect to fusion. We found that liposomes made either
with or without CF could be kept for hours at room temper-
ature without evidence of fusion. When 10 mM Ca2+ was
added to vesicles that had been prepared without CF, mas-
sive fusion resulted, leading to formation of vesicles
-10
times the diameter of the original vesicles (Fig. 2B). By
contrast, when Ca2+ was added to vesicles containing 0.1 dhol
of CF per mol of phospholipid, only slight amounts of fusion
were evident in the freeze-fracture images (Fig. 2D).
Quasi-Elastic Light Scattering. Data on the size of the
vesicles obtained by quasi-elastic light scattering are consis-
tent with the freeze-fracture data (Table 1). The average
diameter of the unilamellar vesicles as calculated from the
average frequency (F) increased 15-fold in the presence of 10
mM Ca2', whereas those prepared with CF increased in
average diameter less than 4-fold under the same conditions.
Fluorescence Quenching. The effects ofCF on the inhibition
of Ca2l-induced fusion were quantified most extensively by
using fluorescence quenching to monitor fusion (28). In this
particular assay, two water-soluble fluorescent probes were

trapped separately in the aqueous interior of two populations
of vesicles during their preparation (see Materials and Meth-
ods). The two populations of vesicles were mixed at equal
concentrations immediately before the experiment. One of
the two probes (the donor) is quenched by the other (the
acceptor), provided that both probes reside in the same
vesicle. As a result, fluorescence decreases as fusion in-
creases (Fig. 3). Since the probability of fusion of a vesicle
containing the donor probe with one containing the acceptor
probe was the same as that for fusion with one containing the
donor, a decrease in fluorescence of 50% means that every
vesicle has, on average, undergone one fusion event. There-
fore, these data indicate a conservative estimate of the actual
fusion. The resulting data show an inhibition of fusion in the
vesicles made with CF (Fig. 3).
Effects of Components of CF on Fusion. The component of
CF that is responsible for inhibiting fusion was investigated
in the following experiments.
(i) Effects of mycolic acids. The mycolic acids were
de-esterified from CF and purified. Liposomes were then
prepared with the addition of0.2 mol ofmycolic acids per mol
ofphospholipid, an amount equivalent to that added when the
vesicles were made with the intact CF. Since free fatty acids
are known to be fusogenic (33-36), we expected these

Calcium-induced fusion ofPam,Ole-PA/PE LUVs (0) as
a control and Pam,Ole-PA/PE LUVs containing 0.1 mol of CF per
mol of phospholipid (e). These data indicate that fusion is inhibited
by the presence ofCF in the bilayer. The effects offree mycolic acids
(A), trehalose (A), and both free mycolic acids and trehalose (n) on
Ca2+-induced fusion of LUVs are shown. These data indicate that
there is no effect of the trehalose or mycolic acid moieties of CF at
equivalent concentrations to that in vesicles containing CF.
mycolic acids to have similar effects, if they affected fusion
at all. The results showed that addition ofthese hydrocarbons
to the vesicles had no effect (Fig. 3), possibly because the
effects of Ca2+ on fusion are so pronounced that a further
stimulus towards fusion by the mycolic acids could not be
detected by this assay. The conclusion can be drawn, how-
ever, that the mycolic acids clearly do not inhibit fusion.
(ii) Effects of trehalose. Trehalose was added to vesicles
that had been made without CF at 1.25 mM, a concentration
equivalent to that in the vesicles containing CF. Addition of
this amount oftrehalose had no effect on Ca2'-induced fusion
(Fig. 3), and increasing the free trehalose concentration to
200 mM had no further effect on the inhibition offusion (data
not shown).
(iii) Synergism between mycolic acids and trehalose. We
tested the possibility that the free mycolic acids and trehalose
might have a synergistic effect in inhibiting fusion. The
results (Fig. 3) showed that this was not the case. We
concluded from these experiments that the intact CF was
required to inhibit fusion.
Mechanism for Inhibition of Fusion by CF: An Hypothesis.
These data clearly show that CF can inhibit Ca2`-induced
fusion between phospholipid bilayers in vitro, a finding that
is consistent with the suggestion that it may play a similar role
in inhibiting fusion between phagosomes and lysosomes in
vivo. On the basis ofthese and other observations (cf. ref. 19),
we suggest the following mechanism for this effect. Since CF
consists of trehalose attached to a hydrophobic component,
this molecule would be expected to show a hydrophobic
interaction with phospholipid bilayers, thus immobilizing the
trehalose at the aqueous interface between the hydrophobic
interior of the bilayer and the surrounding bulk water. With
the trehalose immobilized at the surface of the bilayer, one
would expect CF to be particularly effective at inhibiting
fusion between phospholipid bilayers, where we suggest it
could affect fusion in at least two ways: it could increase the
hydration force that is known to be an important primary
barrier to fusion (37-40); alternatively, it could act as a steric
block to fusion. We believe that the results reported here will
have important implications for our understanding of the
pathogenic mechanism in diseases such as tuberculosis and
nocardiosis, and they may suggest possible approaches to
clinical treatment by the eventual elucidation of the mecha-
nism of inhibition of fusion between phagosomal and lyso-

somal membranes in vivo. It is conceivable that a greater
understanding ofthis mechanism could lead to drug therapies
that would reduce the length of the therapy and increase the
eradication ofthese and related diseases in many Third World
countries in which they are endemic.
