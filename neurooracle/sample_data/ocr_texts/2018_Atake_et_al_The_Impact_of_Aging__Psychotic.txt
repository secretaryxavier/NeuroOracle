Background: Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia can result in considerable difﬁculty
in performing functions of daily life or social rehabilitation. Cognitive impairment in
schizophrenia is related to various factors, such as the psychotic severity, aging,
medication, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). To date, however, no studies
investigating the impact of these factors on cognitive functioning in chronic schizophrenia
patients have been performed.
Objective: The aim of this study is to identify those factors that inﬂuence the cognitive
functioning in patients with chronic schizophrenia.
Methods: Sixty-ﬁve of 116 long-term hospitalized chronic schizophrenia patients (63.8
± 12.1 years old, M/F = 29/36) were enrolled this cross-sectional study. We investigated
the relationship among the patients’ age, psychotic severity, treatment medication, serum
BDNF levels, and cognitive functioning (measured by the Japanese-language version of
the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia; BACS-J). Additionally, we performed
a multivariable linear regression analysis.
Results:
According to the partial correlation analysis, certain parameters [i.e.,
age, chlorpromazine (CP) equivalent, biperiden (BP) equivalent, and serum BDNF]
were signiﬁcantly correlated with cognitive functioning, including working memory
(WM), motor function (MF), attention and processing speed (AP), and executive
function (EF). For the multivariate analysis, the MF component, which had the
highest correlation, was selected as the dependent variable, and the independent
variables included age, Manchester Scale for chronic psychosis (ManS) total score,
CP equivalent, BP equivalent, serum BDNF, estimated full scale IQ, and years of
education. According to the multiple regression analysis of this model, R (multiple
regression coefﬁcient) was 0.542, the adjusted R2 (coefﬁcient of determination) was
0.201, and only BP equivalent (β = −0.305, p = 0.030), but not age, ManS score, CP
equivalent, or serum BDNF, could signiﬁcantly explain MF at the 5% signiﬁcant level.

The Impact on Cognitive Impairment
Conclusion:
In conclusion, aging, medication (administering more antipsychotics
or anticholinergics), and serum BDNF concentration are signiﬁcantly correlated with
cognitive dysfunction in chronic schizophrenia patients but not with the severity of
psychotic symptoms. Furthermore, only the anticholinergic dosage had a signiﬁcant
causal relationship with MF. Thus, the use of anticholinergics in chronic schizophrenia
patients with deteriorating cognitive functioning must be reconsidered.

INTRODUCTION
Cognitive
impairments
in
schizophrenia
can
result
in
considerable diﬃculty in performing functions of daily life
or social rehabilitation, and cognitive diﬃculty persists even
after the alleviation of psychotic symptoms. Reintegrating into
society is particularly challenging for these patients due to their
severe cognitive impairment. Therefore, ascertaining the level
of cognitive dysfunction remaining after improvement in acute
psychiatric symptoms is important.
Cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is related to various
factors, such as psychotic symptoms, aging, medication, and
genetic variants. In the current study, we investigate the
cognitive functioning in schizophrenia patients using the
Japanese language version of the Brief Assessment of Cognition
in Schizophrenia (BACS-J). Kaneda et al. (1) investigated the
inﬂuence of disease and aging on performance on the BACS-J in
schizophrenic patients. A multiple regression analysis including
all subjects indicated that performance on almost all BACS-J
components were attributable to the disease, aging, the level of
education, and the duration of illness.
In
schizophrenia
patients,
deterioration
in
cognitive
functioning is a symptom of the disease; additionally, medication
also aﬀects functioning. Anticholinergic agents aﬀect cognitive
functioning, and antipsychotics, which are used to treat
schizophrenia, also cause cognitive function to deteriorate.
We previously reported that excessive doses of antipsychotics
can cause deterioration in cognitive functioning in chronic
schizophrenia patients (2), and switching from polypharmacy to
antipsychotic monotherapy improves cognitive functions, such
as attention and executive function (EF) (3).
Additionally,
serum
brain-derived
neurotrophic
factor
(BDNF) levels are positively associated with cognitive functions,
such as immediate memory, in chronic schizophrenia patients
(4). In addition, Zhang et al. (5) found that low BDNF levels
are associated with poor performance on the cognitive factor of
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in chronic
schizophrenia. In particular, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α (TNF-α)
may interact with BDNF and cause cognitive impairment.
In contrast, Buchman et al. (6) reported that higher levels of
brain BDNF expression are associated with a slower cognitive
decline. We previously reported that the serum BDNF levels
are positively correlated with verbal memory (VM), attention,
and processing speed in chronic schizophrenia (7). Altogether,
BDNF is closely associated with symptomatology and cognitive
dysfunction in schizophrenia. Indeed, a recent meta-analysis
demonstrated that higher levels of BDNF correspond to better
performance on several cognitive tests, including reasoning and
problem-solving tasks, on the Measurement and Treatment
Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS)
consensus cognitive battery (MCCB) (8).
Considering these ﬁndings, we aim to identify the factor
(i.e., psychotic severity, aging, medication, or BDNF) that has
the greatest inﬂuence on cognitive functioning in patients with
chronic schizophrenia. Speciﬁcally, the purpose of this study was
to determine the factors that are signiﬁcantly related to cognitive
performance in chronic schizophrenia inpatients and those that
have the greatest impact on their cognitive impairment. To the
best of our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst to examine the
association between the factors described above and cognitive
functioning in long-term hospitalized chronic schizophrenia
inpatients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
One hundred and sixteen chronic schizophrenia inpatients
were recruited from Hiagari Hospital, Tsutsumi Hospital,
Shin-Moji Hospital, and the University of Occupational and
Environmental Health. The participants in the present study
met the following inclusion criteria: (1) age over 20 years;
(2) chronic illness without acute exacerbation; (3) continuous
hospitalization for at least 3 years for schizophrenia; and (4)
continuous treatment with a stable dose of atypical antipsychotic
medication for at least 3 months. The diagnosis of schizophrenia
was based on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-
TR Disorders (SCID) and a comprehensive review of patient
medical records. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) any
comorbid CNS disorder; (2) meeting the DSM-IV-TR criteria
for aﬀective, schizoaﬀective, or schizophreniform psychosis;
alcohol or other substance dependence; or mental retardation; (3)
receiving antidepressants or mood stabilizers; (4) having received
electroconvulsive therapy within the 6 months preceding the
study period; and (5) having received clozapine. We used the
SCID to screen all participants and excluded those patients with
psychiatric disorders. No subjects had a history of neurological,
somatic, or psychiatric illnesses. Sixty-ﬁve patients (63.8 ±
12.1 years old, M/F = 29/36) who met the above-mentioned
criteria, completed all assessments, including blood extraction,
and provided informed consent were enrolled in the present

study. The participants who declined to participate or did not
participate for another reason were not disadvantaged in any
treatment modalities due to their lack of participation in this
study.
Clinical Assessment
The Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) was used to assess
the general functioning of the participants. The participants’
psychotic symptoms were assessed by their primary doctors
using the Manchester Scale for chronic psychosis (ManS).
Their cognitive functioning was assessed using the BACS-
J. Adverse eﬀects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms, were
measured using the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms
Scale (DIEPSS). The use of antipsychotic and anticholinergic
drugs was considered in terms of chlorpromazine (CP) and
biperiden (BP) equivalents.
Neurocognitive Functioning Test
Cognitive functioning was assessed by trained psychiatrists using
the BACS-J. The BACS is an instrument to evaluate the cognitive
functioning in schizophrenic patients. This assessment consists of
six tests, including VM, working memory (WM), motor function
(MF), attention and processing speed (AP), EF, and composite
scores (CS) (9). Patients with chronic schizophrenia have severe
impairments that range from one and a half to two standard
deviations below healthy control subjects in VM, WM, motor
speed, attention, EFs, and verbal ﬂuency (9). The BACS-J has
established reliability and validity and is designed to measure
cognitive functioning in schizophrenia patients. The primary
measures of each subtest of the BACS-J were standardized by
creating z-scores (i.e., the mean of the healthy controls was set
to zero, and the standard deviation was set to one). All data for
the healthy controls were obtained from a study conducted by
Kaneda et al., and a composite score was calculated by averaging
all z-scores for the six primary measures (10). The inﬂuence
of age was adjusted using age-matched cohorts of controls to
calculate the BACS-J z-scores for each schizophrenia patient in
the present study.
Intelligence Test
The IQs of the participants were estimated using the Japanese
Adult Reading Test: JART (11, 12), which is a Japanese version of
the National Adult Reading Test, to exclude mental retardation
and estimate the relevance of IQ for cognitive functioning.
This test reﬂects the premorbid IQs in Japanese patients with
schizophrenia (13).
BDNF Measurement
All blood samples were obtained between 7:00 and 10:00 a.m.
after fasting on the day the clinical assessment was performed.
Fifteen milliliters of venous blood were drawn from subjects
in the supine position after the subjects rested in the supine
position overnight. The serum samples were quickly separated
in a centrifuge and stored at −80◦C until assay. The serum
levels of BDNF were assayed by ELISA using a Milliplex
MAP Kit (HNDG3MAG-36K) on a Milliplex Analyzer 4.2
MAGPIX machine (Millipore) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Statistical Analysis
For the statistical analysis, we supposed that the present
studies’ sample is based on the normal distribution same as
the Kaneda’s previous study. Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcients
were examined to identify the correlations between the patients’
clinical variables and serum BDNF levels and scores on each
BACS-J neuropsychological test component. Subsequently, we
performed a partial correlation analysis to examine the correcter
relationship among the parameters without inﬂuencers. In the
analysis of the partial correlations between the BACS-J z-scores
and the clinical parameters, the six task scores and the composite
score on the BACS-J were set as the dependent variables, while
the clinical parameters, including medication information and
clinical conditions, and the serum BDNF concentration, were set
as the independent variables. Parameters thought to inﬂuence
the results of the test battery, such as estimated full-scale IQ and
years of education, were set as control variables. Furthermore, we
performed a regression analysis to investigate the causality. In the
multivariable linear regression analysis, we analyzed the linearity
of the BACS-J components that were statistically signiﬁcant in
the partial correlation analysis and set the parameters of interest
in the current study (i.e., age, CP equivalent, BP equivalent,
and serum BDNF) as independent variables. The results were
considered signiﬁcant at p < 0.05. All statistical analyses were
performed using SPSS software (SPSS version 23.0J; SPSS, Tokyo,
Japan).
Consent
This study protocol was approved by the review board of our
institute; the Ethics Committee of the University of Occupational
and Environmental Health. Written informed consent was
obtained from all subjects who participated in this study in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
RESULTS
Background Data of Participants
Sixty-ﬁve of 116 subjects (63.8 ± 12.1 years old, M/F = 29/36)
who consented to participate in the study and provided full
data for all assessment items were enrolled in the study. On the
occasion of statistical analysis, we supposed that these samples
are based on the normal distribution in the track of the Kaneda’s
previous study. Across all subjects (n = 65), the mean number
of administered antipsychotic agents was 2.0 ± 1.1. The CP
equivalent dose of the antipsychotic agents was 908.3 ± 627.1
mg/day, and the BP equivalent dose of the anticholinergic drugs
was 2.01 ± 2.58 mg/day. The mean GAF score was 38.2 ± 15.0,
and the mean ManS total score was 12.6 ± 5.8; thus, the disease
severity of the enrolled patients ranged from mildly to moderately
ill. The mean education level was 11.4 ± 2.1 years, and the
premorbid IQ, which was calculated according to the JART, was
90.8 ± 11.1. The demographic data of the enrolled participants
are shown in Table 1. Additionally, the mean BACS-J z-score of
six components in the present study were as follows, respectively,

Simple Correlation Analyses
Signiﬁcant correlations were observed between (1) working

and processing speed (AP) (r = −0.331, p = 0.007) and executive
function (EF) (r = −0.316, p = 0.010) and CP equivalent dosage;
(3) verbal memory (VM) (r = −0.270, p = 0.029), motor function
(MF) (r = −0.403, p = 0.001), AP (r = −0.262, p = 0.035),
composite scores (CS) (r = −0.255, p = 0.041), and BP equivalent
dosage; (4) AP (r = 0.340, p = 0.006), EF (r = 0.314, p =
0.011), and the estimated full-scale IQ; (5) VM (r = 0.258, p =
0.045), AP (r = 0.261, p = 0.042), CS (r = 0.261, p = 0.042),
and education; and (6) MF (r = −0.252, r = 0.043) and serum
BDNF concentration (Table 2). No correlations were observed
between the BACS-J components and the GAF score or DIEPSS
total score.
Partial Correlation Analyses
In the analyses of the partial correlations between the BACS-
J z-scores and multiple clinical parameters, the six task scores
and the composite score of the BACS-J were set as dependent
variables, while the clinical parameters (i.e., CP equivalent,
BP equivalent, GAF score, ManS total score, DIEPSS total
score, and serum BDNF) were set as independent variables.
Additionally, those parameters known to inﬂuence the results of
the test battery, such as the estimated full-scale IQ and years of
education, were set as control variables. By this correction, several
signiﬁcant relationship found in the simple correlation analysis
couldn’t be conﬁrmed in the partial correlation analysis. The
partial correlations were calculated based on the aforementioned
conditions. Signiﬁcant correlations were observed between (1)
WM (r = −0.297, p = 0.022) and age; (2) MF (r = −0.290, p =
0.026), AP (r = −0.336, p = 0.009), EF (r = −0.310, p = 0.017),
and CP equivalent dosage; (3) MF (r = −0.434, p = 0.001) and
BP equivalent; and (4) MF (r = −0.287, p = 0.027) and serum
BDNF concentration (Table 3). The BACS-J components were
not correlated with the GAF score or DIEPSS total score.
Multiple Regression Analysis
In the multivariable linear regression analysis, we analyzed
the MF component because this component exhibited more
signiﬁcant associations than the other components. We included
the parameters of interest in the current study (i.e., age, CP
equivalent, BP equivalent, and serum BDNF concentration)
as independent variables. Speciﬁcally, the MF component was
included as the dependent variable, and the independent
variables such as age, ManS total score, CP equivalent, BP
equivalent, serum BDNF concentration, estimated full-scale
IQ, and years of education were loaded all by the forced
entry method. Any collinearity was not found among the
following independent variables based on the value of variance
inﬂation factor (VIF) (i.e., age, 1.183; ManS total score, 1.209;
CP equivalent, 1.483; BP equivalent, 1.411; serum BDNF,
1.074; estimated full-scale IQ, 1.293; educated years, 1.242),
respectively. The multiple regression coeﬃcient of this model,
R, was 0.542; the adjusted R2 (coeﬃcient of determination) was
0.201. Additionally, the signiﬁcance of the F-test in the analysis
of variance was p < 0.007, which was signiﬁcant at the 1% level.
The β-values, which indicate the strength of the eﬀect of each
variable, and the signiﬁcance probability were as follows: age
(β = −0.115, p = 0.363), ManS total score (β = −0.082, p =
0.648), CP equivalent (β = −0.133, p = 0.347), BP equivalent
(β = −0.305, p = 0.030), serum BDNF (β = −0.205, p =
0.092), estimated full-scale IQ (β = −0.180, p = 0.175), and
years of education (β = 0.166, p = 0.204) (Table 4). Thus, BP
equivalent signiﬁcantly explained MF at the 5% signiﬁcance level;
in contrast, age, ManS score, CP equivalent, and serum BDNF
were not signiﬁcantly associated with MF. Overall, only the BP
equivalent dosage had a causal relationship with MF according to
the ﬁnal analysis.
DISCUSSION
Kaneda et al. (1) mentioned that BACS is aﬀected negatively
not only by schizophrenia but also by the level of education
and aging. However, there were some diﬀerences between the
Kaneda’s paper and the present study. For example, the mean
age of participants in the present study was higher (more than
20 years older), and, in addition, the mean z-score of respective
components in the present study was lower than in Kaneda
et al. (1).
The main ﬁnding in the present study was a negative
causal relationship between the anticholinergic agent dosage
and MF. The partial correlation analyses revealed the following
correlations: age and WM (r = −0.297, p = 0.022); antipsychotic
agent dose and MF (r = −0.336, p = 0.009) or EF (r = −0.310,
p = 0.017); anticholinergic agent dose and MF (r = −0.434, p =
0.001); and serum BDNF and MF (r = −0.287, p = 0.027).
Many studies have compared BACS scores before and
after the administration of antipsychotic medication (14, 15).
Additionally, we previously reported an association between
cognitive functioning and schizophrenia medication use in which
polypharmacy adversely aﬀected cognitive functioning (2), and
switching to antipsychotic monotherapy from polypharmacy

improved cognitive functions, including AP (3). The results of
the current study are similar to those of these reports.
To date, multiple studies have reported that anticholinergic
drugs may be associated with cognitive impairment, particularly
in older adults (16–18). However, few studies have focused
on MF in investigations of the anticholinergic inﬂuences on
cognitive impairment. The MF component of the BACS-J
assesses the agility and accuracy of hand movements as patients
place a token in a container. The results may be aﬀected
by the degree of extrapyramidal symptoms independently of
the anticholinergic dosage even though MF and the DIEPSS
total score were not correlated in this study. Therefore, the
eﬀect of anticholinergics on MF is considered independent of
extrapyramidal symptoms.
Blood BDNF concentrations reﬂect brain BDNF levels in rats,
mice, or pigs (19), so peripheral BDNF levels might partially
reﬂect a synthesis, secretion and metabolism of brain BDNF
in schizophrenia patients. In short, measuring blood BDNF
levels may be valuable for assuming brain BDNF dynamics. A
meta-analysis showed that the blood BDNF concentration in
schizophrenia patients is lower than that in healthy controls
(20, 21). BDNF levels are related to the negative symptoms

(22). Chiou et al. (23) also reported that pretreatment negative
symptoms played a pivotal role in the trajectories of the serum
BDNF levels. Thus, BDNF likely aﬀects cognitive functioning
via the negative symptoms. We also reported that decision
making, which was tested using the Iowa Gambling Task, was
inﬂuenced by the PANSS-G scores and serum BDNF levels in
chronic schizophrenia patients (24); however, in the present
study, we found a signiﬁcant relationship between MF and
serum BDNF in chronic schizophrenia patients. Moreover,
these eﬀects were detected not only in the simple correlation
analysis but also in the partial correlation analysis, which was
adjusted for the estimated full-scale IQ and years of education.
Thus, BDNF likely inﬂuences certain cognitive functions,
such as decision making or MF, in chronic schizophrenia
patients.
From an anatomical perspective, Rao et al. (25) reported that
BDNF protein levels in the prefrontal cortex gray matter were
signiﬁcantly lower in elderly patients in both non-psychiatric
and psychiatric patients, while BDNF levels in the white matter
did not signiﬁcantly decrease with age in either group. In
animal aging studies, older age is associated with reduced
BDNF expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus
(26). Therefore, BDNF may be considered a useful biomarker
for re-examining the assumed neurodegenerative course in
schizophrenia. The prefrontal cortex BDNF levels linearly
decrease from 20 to 80 years of age in non-psychiatric samples.
In schizophrenia, the age eﬀect is similarly linear in younger
patients, but a decline does not occur in older patients. Thus,
the prefrontal cortex BDNF levels do not follow a normative
linear age eﬀect in schizophrenia patients with increasing age,
which may represent a “ﬂoor eﬀect” due to an earlier decline
(25). In summary, aging in schizophrenia patients could lessen
the inﬂuence of the disease, and BDNF changes may decelerate as
schizophrenia patients’ age. These hypotheses could explain the
correlation between cognitive functioning (MF) and age observed
in the present study.
Many previous reports using small sample sizes (at least a
few dozen) have demonstrated a positive correlation between
peripheral BDNF levels and cognition as follows: higher levels
of BDNF are associated with better cognitive functioning in
schizophrenia. However, this ﬁnding is not robust. In the
present study, we demonstrated a negative correlation between
serum BDNF and MF in chronic schizophrenia patients. Thus,
whether peripheral BDNF reﬂects cognitive functioning in
schizophrenia patients remains unknown. According to a recent
report, peripheral BDNF concentrations are signiﬁcantly lower
in schizophrenia patients than those in healthy subjects. In
addition, BDNF is not correlated with the severity of the
positive and negative symptom (20) and cognitive impairment
(27). Considering these evidences, we may be able to think
as follows. Low BDNF may contribute to the pathogenesis of
schizophrenia indeed, however, it may not contribute to its
cognitive impairments directly. We cannot explain the cause of
the negative correlation between MF and serum BDNF.
Regarding the relationship between BDNF and motor
functioning, many articles focus on Parkinson’s disease, where
limited MF appears to indicate lower levels of peripheral BDNF.
The ﬁndings in the present study, i.e., that the anticholinergic
dosage is strongly negatively correlated with MF, depend on
various confounding factors, such as the eﬀects of schizophrenia,
other medications, and other factors aﬀecting the participants’
cognitive states. The cause of this discrepancy is currently
unknown.
As
described
above,
the
multiple
regression
analysis
considered seven parameters (i.e., age, ManS total score, CP
equivalent, BP equivalent, serum BDNF, estimated full-scale IQ,
and years education) as independent variables. The standardized
regression coeﬃcient “β” suggests that BP equivalent dosage
had the greatest inﬂuence on cognitive impairment, followed in
order by serum BDNF concentration, estimated full-scale IQ,
years of education, CP equivalent dosage, age, and ManS total
score. However, only the BP equivalent dosage (β = −0.305, p
= 0.030) signiﬁcantly explained MF at the 5% signiﬁcance level.
Thus, treating patients with lower doses of anticholinergic drugs
is optimal for improving MF. We may wish to reconsider the
prescriptions given to patients who have been hospitalized for
a long time to determine whether we can reduce their intake of
anticholinergic agents.
Our study has several limitations. First, this study was a
cross-sectional survey without control subjects. Although we
considered the factor of age, the data do not directly indicate
the eﬀect of aging. Second, the sample size was too small
to characterize the relationships described above. Third, the
study considered the eﬀect of antipsychotic and anticholinergic
drugs but did not consider other drugs, such as benzodiazepine
compounds. Fourth, the data were not adjusted for other control
variables, such as smoking, obesity, platelet count, lifestyle
factors, sleep, and diet. Fifth, the MF might be inﬂuenced by
age and medication and the impairment of MF might aﬀect
other components of cognitive function, however the present
study did not consider the points. Finally, we did not analyze
of possible diﬀerences in any of these outcomes between male
and female patients. Further studies considering these variables

should be performed to conﬁrm the results of this preliminary
study.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we conﬁrmed that aging, medication (administering
more antipsychotic or anticholinergic drugs) and higher
serum BDNF concentrations were signiﬁcantly correlated
with cognitive dysfunction in chronic schizophrenia but not
the severity of psychotic symptoms. Additionally, the BP
equivalent dosage had the highest impact on MF. Diminishing
the use of anticholinergic drugs may improve cognitive
dysfunction, particularly in terms of motor functioning, in
chronic schizophrenia patients.
