Go´mez-Pinilla, Fernando, Zhe Ying, Roland R. Roy, Raffaella
Molteni, and V. Reggie Edgerton. Voluntary exercise induces a
BDNF-mediated mechanism that promotes neuroplasticity. J Neuro-
physiol 88: 2187–2195, 2002; 10.1152/jn.00152.2002. We have in-
vestigated potential mechanisms by which exercise can promote
changes in neuronal plasticity via modulation of neurotrophins. Ro-
dents were exposed to voluntary wheel running for 3 or 7 days, and
their lumbar spinal cord and soleus muscle were assessed for changes
in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its signal transduction
receptor (trkB), and downstream effectors for the action of BDNF on
synaptic plasticity. Exercise increased the expression of BDNF and its
receptor, synapsin I (mRNA and phosphorylated protein), growth-
associated protein (GAP-43) mRNA, and cyclic AMP response ele-
ment-binding (CREB) mRNA in the lumbar spinal cord. Synapsin I,
a synaptic mediator for the action of BDNF on neurotransmitter
release, increased in proportion to GAP-43 and trkB mRNA levels.
CREB mRNA levels increased in proportion to BDNF mRNA levels.
In separate experiments, the soleus muscle was paralyzed unilaterally
via intramuscular botulinum toxin type A (BTX-A) injection to de-
termine the effects of reducing the neuromechanical output of a single
muscle on the neurotrophin response to motor activity. In sedentary
BTX-A-treated rats, BDNF and synapsin I mRNAs were reduced
below control levels in the spinal cord and soleus muscle. Exercise did
not change the BDNF mRNA levels in the spinal cord of BTX-A-
treated rats but further reduced the BDNF mRNA levels in the
paralyzed soleus relative to the levels in sedentary BTX-A-treated
rats. Exercise also restored synapsin I to near control levels in the
spinal cord. These results indicate that basal levels of neuromuscular
activity are required to maintain normal levels of BDNF in the
neuromuscular system and the potential for neuroplasticity.
I N T R O D U C T I O N
The capacity of physical activity to maintain and compen-
sate for deterioration of neural function is becoming increas-
ingly recognized (Kempermann et al. 2000). Physical exercise
can preserve cognitive function in elderly populations (Kramer
et al. 1999), promote functional recovery after CNS traumatic
injury (Jones et al. 1999), and induce neurogenesis in the
adult CNS (Kempermann et al. 2000). Physical activity also
increases trophic factor production in select regions of the
brain (Neeper et al. 1995) and spinal cord (Gomez-Pinilla et
al. 2001). How an exercise-induced elevation of select tro-
phic factors can modulate crucial aspects of neural cellular
plasticity, however, remains unknown. Brain-derived neurotro-
phic factor (BDNF) delivered to the injured spinal cord can
promote regenerative growth (Bregman et al. 1997) and can
stimulate hindlimb stepping (Jakeman et al. 1998). These ob-
servations, together with evidence that BDNF is a powerful
modiﬁer of neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission
(Causing et al. 1997; Kaﬁtz et al. 1999; Lu and Figurov 1997),
suggest that BDNF is a crucial effector of experience-depen-
dent plasticity.
Synapsin I, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), and
cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) may
play central roles in the mechanisms by which BDNF affects
neuronal and synaptic plasticity. Synapsin I is a well-charac-
terized member of a family of nerve terminal-speciﬁc phos-
phoproteins and is implicated in neurotransmitter release, ax-
onal elongation, and maintenance of synaptic contacts (Brock
and O’Callaghan 1987; Wang et al. 1995). BDNF affects the
synthesis (Wang et al. 1995) and phosphorylation (Jovanovic
et al. 1996) of synapsin I, resulting in elevated neurotransmitter
release (Jovanovic et al. 2000). GAP-43 is present in growing
axon terminals and has important roles in axonal growth,
neurotransmitter release (Oestreicher et al. 1997), and learning
and memory (Routtenberg et al. 2000). CREB, one of the
best-characterized transcription factors in the brain, is required
for various forms of memory including spatial learning (Silva
et al. 1998) and appears to play a role in neuronal resistance to
insult in conjunction with BDNF (Walton et al. 1999). CREB
is an important regulator of gene expression induced by BDNF
(Finkbeiner 2000).
The physiological signiﬁcance of changes in neurotrophin
expression is contingent on the availability of appropriate
signal transduction receptors. Neurotrophin effects are medi-
ated by a family of speciﬁc transmembrane tyrosine kinase
receptors (trk), with trkB being the primary signal transduction
receptor for BDNF (Barbacid 1994). In the present study, we
evaluate the possibility that exercise induces an integrated
response of BDNF and its receptor that may result in synaptic
modiﬁcation/adaptation. We have chosen to study the neuro-
muscular system because of the well-deﬁned location of the
motor pools innervating speciﬁc hindlimb muscles.

Experimental design
Sprague-Dawley male rats (3 mo old) individually housed in a
12/12 h light/dark vivarium with ad lib access to food and water were
assigned randomly to a voluntary exercise group or a sedentary
control group. The exercise apparatus included a polyethylene cage
(30  40  20 cm) equipped with a running wheel (Ishihara et al.
1998) (diameter, 31.8 cm; width, 10 cm) with adjustable resistance.
The wheel rotates on the shaft whenever the rat moves in either
direction, and the number of revolutions is recorded continuously by
a Macintosh computer. On the ﬁrst day of exercise, the rats were
exposed to freely moving running wheels (no load) as an adaptation
period. The load then was increased to 100 g for all subsequent days.
The lumbar region of the spinal cord was selected for this study
because the motoneuron pools that innervate the hindlimb muscula-
ture are located in this region. The soleus muscle was selected for this
study because of its high level of recruitment during running (Roy et
al. 1991).
After 3 or 7 days of voluntary running, all rats to be used for
biochemical assays (n  5–7 per group at each time point) were killed
around 8 AM, and the entire spinal cord and the soleus muscle were
removed. The spinal cord was laid on a cork strip, carefully oriented,
and frozen on dry ice. Subsequently, the lumbar enlargement was
identiﬁed, separated, and used for analysis. We used the entire en-
largement to evaluate the effects of exercise on motor and sensory
function. The soleus muscle was cleaned of excess fat and connective
tissue, wet weighed, pinned on a cork strip and quick frozen in
isopentane cooled in liquid nitrogen. All fresh-frozen tissues were
stored at 70°C until processed. Rats to be used for the histological
analyses were exercised for 7 days (n  5 per group). After the last
day of running, both exercised and sedentary control rats were anes-
thetized deeply with pentobarbital sodium (75 mg/kg ip) and perfused
intracardially with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4%
paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M Sorensen’s phosphate buffer and 20%
sucrose in PBS. Perfused tissues were stored at 70°C until sectioned
in a cryostat.
BTX injection
To evaluate the possibility that muscle activation associated with
locomotion is the main stimulus for the induction of neurotrophins, we
paralyzed the soleus muscle of the right leg with botulinum toxin type
A (BTX-A, Sigma) in a separate group of rats (n  12). The rats were
deeply anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine hydrochloride (70
mg/kg body wt) and acepromazine maleate (5 mg/kg body wt) ad-
ministered intraperitoneally. Under aseptic conditions, a skin incision
was made on the lateral aspect of the lower leg. The superﬁcial fascia
overlying the lateral gastrocnemius was incised, and the belly of the
lateral gastrocnemius was retracted to expose the soleus muscle.
Using a Hamilton microsyringe (10 l), a single dose of BTX-A (1
ng/kg) was injected at four sites across the midbelly of the muscle,
i.e., near the endplate region of the muscle. Care was taken to
minimize the amount of leakage from the muscle by injecting the
BTX-A slowly and then by using cotton tip applicators to absorb any
ﬂuid emanating from the muscle. The incision sites were ﬂushed
liberally with a saline solution and then closed in layers, i.e., the
fascial layer with 4.0 absorbable gut and the skin with 4.0 Ethicon.
The rats were allowed 1 day of recovery in sedentary cages prior to
being placed in cages with voluntary running wheels for 7 days.
A series of preliminary experiments was conducted to evaluate a
possible effect of mechanical damage related to the intramuscular
injection on BDNF mRNA levels. Saline was injected into the right
soleus muscle, and the levels of BDNF mRNA were measured in the
right and left spinal hemi-cords and soleus muscles. There were no
left/right differences in levels of BDNF mRNA in either the spinal
cord or the soleus muscles of saline-injected rats. In addition, the
levels of BDNF mRNA in saline-injected rats were similar to those in
uninjected rats for each of the tissues examined. Other preliminary
experiments were conducted to determine the correct dosage of
BTX-A. The BTX-A dosage used in the present study was found to
produce a complete silencing of the soleus muscle between 2 and 8
days after injection as determined from the electrical stimulation of
the muscle via its nerve in an in situ preparation. With the rats
anesthetized as described in the preceding text, the muscle did not
respond to either a single or multiple pulses (200 Hz for 300 ms) of
stimulation at voltages ranging from 1 to 10 V. In these preliminary
experiments, it was determined that some of the surrounding muscles,
i.e., particularly the plantaris and lateral gastrocnemius muscles were
modestly affected by the BTX-A injections, i.e., in several cases these
muscles did not respond to a single pulse but were activated by trains
of pulses. For the rats in the present study, we veriﬁed a complete
block of the soleus muscle in two rats just prior to the removal of the
spinal cord and soleus muscles. All animal procedures were approved
by the Animal Use Committee at UCLA and followed the American
Physiological Society Animal Care Guidelines.
Taqman RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the RNA STAT-60 kit (TEL-TEST,
Friendswood, TX) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. The mRNAs
for BDNF, synapsin, GAP-43, and CREB were measured by TaqMan
real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR) using an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System
(Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems). The technique is based on the
ability to directly detect the RT-PCR product with no downstream
processing. This is accomplished with the monitoring of the in-
crease in ﬂuorescence of a dye-labeled DNA probe speciﬁc for each
factor under study plus a probe speciﬁc for the glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene used as an endogenous
control for the assay. Total RNA (100 ng) was converted into cDNA
using TaqMan EZ RT-PCR Core reagents (Perkin-Elmer, Branchburg, NJ).
The sequences of probes, forward and reverse primers, designed by
Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) were BDNF: probe, (5-
AGTCATTTGCGCACAACTTTAAAAGTCTGCATT-3), forward,
(5-GGACATATCCATGACCAGAAAGAAA-3), reverse, (5-GCAA-
CAAACCACAACATTATCGAG-3); synapsin I: probe, (5-CATG-
GCACGTAATGGAGACTACCGCA-3), forward, (5-CCGCCAGCT-
GCCTTC-3), reverse, (5-TGCAGCCCAATGACCAAA-3); GAP-43:
probe, (5-CTCATAAGGCTGCAACCAAAATTCAGGCT-3), forward,
(5-GATGGTGTCAAACCGGAGGAT-3), reverse, (5-CTTGTTATGT-
GTCCACGGAAGC-3); CREB: probe, (5-CATGGCACGTAATG-
GAGACTACCGCA-3), forward, (5-CCGCCAGCATGCCTTC-3),
reverse, (5-TGCAGCCCAATGACCAAA-3); trkB: probe, (5-
CCGACTCTTGCCCTTCGAAC-3), forward, (CCCAATTGTGGTCT-
GCCG), reverse, (CTTCCCTTCCTCCACCGTG). An oligonucleotide
probe speciﬁc for the rat glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) gene was used as an endogenous control to standardize the
amount of sample RNA. The RT reaction conditions were 2 min at
50°C as the initial step to activate uracil glycosylase (UNG), followed
by 30 min at 60°C as the reverse transcription and completed by a
UNG deactivation at 95°C for 5 min. The 40 cycles of the two-step
PCR reaction conditions were 20 s at 94°C and 1 min at 62°C.
Protein immunoassay measurements
Lumbar spinal cord and soleus muscle samples were homogenized
in 3 volumes of homogenization buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 600
mM NaCl, 1% BSA, 0.1 mM PMSF, 220 TIUs/l Aprotinin, 0.1 mM
benzethonium chloride, 1 mM benzamidine HC, and 4% triton
X-100). Homogenates were centrifugated and supernatants collected.
Protein concentrations were estimated with the MicroBCA procedure
(Pierce, Rockford, IL) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the
standard. BDNF protein was quantiﬁed using an enzyme-linked im-

munosorbent assay (ELISA, BDNF Emax ImmunoAssay System Kit,
Promega, Madison, WI) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Unknown
BDNF concentrations were compared with known BDNF concentra-
tions using a calibration curve. Synapsin I and phospho-synapsin I
proteins were analyzed by Western blot, quantiﬁed by densitometric
scanning of the ﬁlm under linear exposure conditions, and normalized
to actin levels. Membranes were incubated with the following primary
antibodies: anti-synapsin I (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA), anti-phospho-synapsin I (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy), anti-actin (1:2000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) followed by
anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
Immunocomplexes were visualized by chemiluminescence using the
ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.
Immunohistochemistry
Spinal cord tissues were sliced in the sagittal plane (30 m),
collected free ﬂoating in PBS and processed for BDNF immunohis-
tochemistry as previously described (Gomez-Pinilla et al. 2001). A
1:1000 dilution was used for the rabbit polyclonal anti-BDNF antisera
(Chemicon International, Temecula, CA).
Statistical analyses
GAPDH and actin were employed as internal standards for real-
time RT-PCR and for Western blots, respectively. For quantiﬁcation
of TaqMan RT-PCR results, ﬂuorescent signal intensities were plotted
against the number of PCR cycles on a semilogarithmic scale. The
ampliﬁcation cycle at which the ﬁrst signiﬁcant increase of ﬂuores-
cence occurred was designated as the threshold cycle (CT). The CT
value of each sample then was compared with those of the internal
standard. This process is fully automated and carried out with ABI
sequence detector software version 1.6.3 (PE Biosystem, Foster City,
CA). Taqman EZ RT-PCR values for GAPDH were subtracted from
BDNF, trkB, synapsin I, CREB, or GAP-43 values. The resulting
corrected values were used to make comparisons across the different
experimental groups. The mean mRNA or protein levels were com-
puted for the control and experimental rats for each time point. Linear
regression analysis was performed on the individual samples to eval-
uate the association between variables. An ANOVA with repeated
measures and Fisher’s test (Statview software, Abacus Concepts)
were used to assess the statistical signiﬁcance among the different
groups. Statistical differences were considered signiﬁcant at P  0.05.
The results were expressed as mean percent of sedentary control
values for graphic clarity and represent the means  SEM of ﬁve to
seven independent determinations. For the BTX-A injection experi-
ments, all results are expressed as a percent of measured mRNA
values in the spinal hemi-cord or soleus muscle contralateral to the
BTX-A injection of sedentary rats.
R E S U L T S
The levels of mRNA for BDNF, its trkB receptor, and the
synaptic associated protein synapsin I were assessed in the
lumbar region of the spinal cord and the soleus muscle of rats
that were exposed to voluntary wheel running for 3 or 7 days.
We measured the mRNA levels of GAP-43 and CREB on the
same tissue used for BDNF and trkB measurements. In another
series of experiments, the right soleus muscle was pharmaco-
logically paralyzed to study the effects of reducing the me-
chanical output during locomotion on the neurotrophin re-
sponse in the lumbar spinal cord and the soleus muscle.
Exercise effects on the spinal cord
BDNF AND TRKB.
BDNF mRNA levels increased to 156%
(P  0.05) of the sedentary controls levels after 3 days of
voluntary exercise, and these levels remained elevated at 7
days (P  0.05; Fig. 1A). There was a direct relationship
between the levels of BDNF mRNA and the distance that the
animals ran (r  0.91; P  0.01; Fig. 1B). Levels of BDNF
protein, assessed using ELISA, were 123% (P  0.35) by day
3 and153% (P  0.05) by day 7 of sedentary controls (Fig.
1C). TrkB mRNA levels were 145% (P  0.07) by day 3 and
158% (P  0.05) by day 7, relative to sedentary controls (Fig.
1D). We performed immunohistochemistry for BDNF in rats
exercised for 7 days (Fig. 2) to determine the phenotypic
expression for the observed increase in BDNF protein (Fig.
1C). BDNF immunoreactivity was localized to ventral horn
motoneurons and their axonal processes coursing through the
white matter in both sedentary control and exercised rats. Fiber
elements in the substantia gelatinosa of the dorsal horn showed
BDNF immunostaining. Sparse astrocyte-like cells in the white
matter also were BDNF immunopositive. A qualitative in-

mRNA were positively correlated (r  0.91, P 

(D, n  5) were increased following 7 days of
exercise. All measurements were performed in
the lumbar region of the spinal cord. Changes in
mRNA levels were detected using real time RT-
PCR and corrected for equivalent levels of total
mRNA using a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehy-
drogenase (GAPDH) cRNA probe in the same assay
solution. BDNF protein was detected and quantiﬁed
using
an
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(ELISA). Means  SE are expressed as a percent of

crease in BDNF immunostaining was observed in the motoneu-
rons and axonal elements in the exercised (Fig. 2, C and D)
compared with the control (Fig. 2, A and B) rats.
SYNAPSIN I.
Levels of synapsin I mRNA were measured on
the same spinal cord tissue used for BDNF and trkB measure-
ments to evaluate a possible effect of exercise on synaptic
formation or function. Synapsin I mRNA levels were signiﬁ-
cantly higher in exercised (P  0.05; Fig. 3A) than control rats
at both day 3 (135%) and day 7 (147%). Synapsin I protein
(measured using Western blot analysis) was signiﬁcantly
higher in exercised (P  0.05; 135%; Fig. 3B) than control rats
at both time points. In the exercised rats, phosphorylated syn-
apsin I was 131 and 136% of control (P  0.05, Fig. 3C) at 3
and 7 days, respectively. Synapsin I mRNA levels were posi-
tively correlated with the distance run (r  0.86; P  0.01, Fig.
3D). Based on evidence that BDNF affects synapsin I function
via an interaction with the trkB receptor complex (Jovanovic et
al. 2000), we examined the interaction between trkB and syn-
apsin I mRNA at the 7-day time point. We found a signiﬁcant
positive correlation between the levels of trkB and synapsin I
mRNA (r  0.88; P  0.05, Fig. 3E).
GAP-43 AND CREB.
GAP-43 mRNA levels were used as an
indicator of axonal growth and synaptic remodeling. GAP-43
mRNA was higher in the exercised than control rats (P  0.05;
Fig. 4A) after 3 days (139%) and 7 days (154%) days of
exercise. A signiﬁcant positive correlation between mRNA
levels for GAP-43 and synapsin I was observed at day 7 (r 
0.80; P  0.05; Fig. 4B). CREB mRNA was measured in the
spinal cord because of the involvement of CREB in several
events associated with the action of BDNF on neuronal plas-
ticity. We found a trend for an increase in CREB mRNA after
3 days of voluntary running (131%; P  0.12) that reached
statistical signiﬁcance (165%; P  0.05) after 7 days of exer-
cise (Fig. 4C). A positive correlation between the levels of
BDNF mRNA and CREB mRNA was observed after 7 days of
exercise (r  0.95; P  0.01; Fig. 4D).

BDNF
immunohistochemistry
was
per-
formed in coronal sections of the lumbar spinal cord of
sedentary and exercised for 7 days rats. Low (A) and
high (B) magniﬁcations show typical BDNF immuno-
staining in a sedentary rat. In sedentary rats, light BDNF
immunostaining was observed in motoneuron cell bod-
ies in the ventral horn (arrows) and astrocyte-like cells
located in the white matter. Low (C) and high (D)
magniﬁcations show typical BDNF immunostaining in
an exercised rat. In trained rats, BDNF staining ap-
peared stronger in exercised than sedentary rats, partic-
ularly in the cell bodies (arrows) and axons (arrow-
heads) of motoneurons. Astrocyte-like-cells distributed
along BDNF-labeled axons also showed strong BDNF
labeling in exercised rats. Calibration is 20 m (bar
shown in C and D, n  5 per group).

Exercise effects on the soleus muscle
BDNF, TRKB, AND SYNAPSIN I.
Compared with sedentary control
levels, there was a robust increase in BDNF mRNA (P  0.01) in
the soleus muscle after 3 days (391%) and 7 days (236%) of
exercise (Fig. 5A). Similarly, BDNF protein levels assessed
using ELISA were signiﬁcantly elevated after 3 days (204%;
P  0.01) and 7 days of voluntary running (164%; P  0.05; Fig.
5B). TrkB mRNA levels in the exercised rats were higher (185%,
P  0.05; Fig. 5C) than control after 3 days of exercise. Synapsin
I mRNA levels also were higher than control after 3 days of
exercise (184%; P  0.05; Fig. 5D). The levels of both trkB
mRNA and synapsin I mRNA returned to control levels after 7
days of exercise. There were no exercise-associated changes in
GAP-43 mRNA in the soleus muscle (data not shown).
FIG. 3.
Relative (% of control) levels of synapsin I mRNA (A), synapsin I protein (B), and phosphorylated synapsin I (C) were
measured in the lumbar region of the spinal cord following 3 (n  6) and 7 (n  6) days of running wheel exercise. Levels of
synapsin I mRNA were positively correlated with the amount of wheel running (D; shown for 7 days; r  0.86, P  0.01, n 
6). Increases in synapsin I mRNA and trkB mRNA were positively correlated (E; shown for 7 days; r  0.88, P  0.05, n  5).
mRNA levels were measured using real time RT-PCR and corrected for equivalent levels of total mRNA using a GAPDH cRNA
probe in the same assay solution. Synapsin I protein was detected and quantiﬁed by Western blots using actin as a standard control.
Values are means  SE expressed as a percent of sedentary control. (*P  0.05, **P  0.01; ANOVA, Fisher test).

Effects of unilateral BTX-A injection into the soleus muscle
BTX-A was injected into the soleus muscle unilaterally
(right side) to determine the effects of eliminating the contrac-
tile activity of this slow plantarﬂexor muscle on the neurotro-
phin response to 7 days of voluntary activity. The BTX-A-
injected soleus muscle showed no visible contractile response
to electrical stimulation of its nerve for 8 days after the
injection (see METHODS).
SPINAL CORD—BDNF MRNA.
In sedentary rats, BDNF mRNA
levels were reduced to (86%, P  0.05) in the hemi-cord
ipsilateral to the BTX-A injection relative to the hemi-cord
contralateral to the injection (Fig. 6A). After 7 days of exercise,
BDNF mRNA levels were elevated (142%, P  0.05) in the
hemi-cord contralateral to the injection and decreased (83%,
P  0.05) in the hemi-cord ipsilateral to the injection, relative
to BDNF mRNA levels in the hemi-cord contralateral to the
injection of sedentary rats.
SOLEUS
MUSCLE—BDNF
MRNA.
In
sedentary
rats,
BDNF
mRNA values were reduced (77%, P  0.05) in the BTX-A
injected relative to the noninjected soleus muscle (Fig. 6B).
After 7 days of voluntary wheel running, BDNF mRNA levels
were elevated (175%, P  0.01) on the noninjected and re-
duced (40%, P  0.01) on the injected side compared with the
noninjected side of sedentary rats.
SPINAL CORD—SYNAPSIN I MRNA.
We measured synapsin I
mRNA in the spinal cord to evaluate the possible effects of
BTX-A treatment on synaptic function or plasticity associated
to the action of BDNF. As explained in the preceding text,
BDNF affects synapsin I function (Jovanovic et al. 2000). In
sedentary rats, synapsin I mRNA levels were reduced (65%,
P  0.05) in the hemi-cord ipsilateral to the injection relative

D I S C U S S I O N
Voluntary exercise increased the expression of several mol-
ecules associated with the action of BDNF on synaptic function
and neurite outgrowth in the lumbar region of the spinal cord
and the soleus muscle. The soleus muscle was paralyzed by
BTX-A injection to determine the effects of inactivating this
normally highly recruited slow plantarﬂexor on the neurotro-
phin response to voluntary locomotor activity in the lumbar
spinal cord and in the muscle itself. Following paralysis,
BDNF and synapsin I mRNA levels were reduced in both
tissues, demonstrating that active muscle contraction plays a
role in modulating the levels of BDNF mRNA in both the
muscle and the spinal cord. These results indicate that a basal
level of neuromuscular activity is important to maintain normal
levels of BDNF, and the potential for neuroplasticity, in the
neuromuscular system.
Timing of neurotrophin induction in the spinal cord
and soleus muscle
The time course of the changes in the expression of BDNF
and its receptor in the spinal cord was different from that for
the skeletal muscle (compare Fig. 1 vs. 5). It is possible that
this may be part of a coordinated response between the spinal
cord and muscle, as it is known that motoneurons can retro-
gradely transport BDNF from the skeletal muscle (Koliatsos et
al. 1993; Sagot et al. 1998). An elevation in BDNF protein and
trkB receptor mRNA occurred between exercise days 3 and 7
in the spinal cord (Fig. 1, C and D), whereas BDNF protein
was decreasing in the soleus muscle during the same time
period (Fig. 5B). These observations are consistent with the
possibility that BDNF produced in the muscle was transported
retrogradely into the cell bodies of the associated motoneurons.
Further experiments will be necessary to determine whether
this indeed is the case.
Impact of exercise on neuroplasticity
To evaluate a possible functional role for the increases in the
BDNF system, we measured the levels of various molecules
that have a recognized interaction with BDNF and are impor-
tant for synaptic plasticity. The levels of phosphorylated pro-
tein, total protein, and mRNA for synapsin I were elevated in
the spinal cord of exercised rats. Also, the modulation of
synapsin I mRNA was associated closely with changes in the
levels of trkB mRNA in the spinal cord. BDNF phosphorylates
synapsin I primarily through the trkB receptor to induce the
mitogen-activated protein-kinase-signaling pathway that mod-
ulates neurotransmitter release (Jovanovic et al. 2000). In a
separate set of experiments (Gomez-Pinilla, unpublished ob-
servations), we have been able to reduce the increase in syn-
apsin I mRNA associated with exercise in the hippocampus by
blocking BDNF action using the tyrosine kinase receptor
blocker K252a. Therefore it appears that the elevated expres-
sion of BDNF and its receptor after exercise may affect syn-
apsin I at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. The
fact that synapsin I can be modulated by BDNF (Jovanovic et
al. 2000) suggests that increases in BDNF and its receptor as a
result of exercise can impact synaptic growth and/or function.
A potential action of BDNF on synaptic plasticity associated
with exercise would likely involve mechanisms that support
neurite outgrowth. Accordingly, we determined the changes in
GAP-43 given its role on input-dependent alterations of syn-
aptic morphology (Oestreicher et al. 1997). Increases in
BDNF, its receptor, and synapsin I in the spinal cord were
accompanied by increases in GAP-43 mRNA after 3 and 7
days of exercise. Furthermore, the observation that increases in
GAP-43 mRNA and synapsin I mRNA were positively corre-
lated suggests a functional interaction between GAP-43 and
synapsin I in our paradigm. The roles of GAP-43 on axonal
growth, neurotransmitter release, and learning and memory
suggest that exercise-related increases in GAP-43 can be as-
sociated with maintaining synaptic function.
Exercise also increased CREB mRNA in the spinal cord.
CREB is one of the best-characterized transcription factors in
the brain and can be modulated by BDNF (Finkbeiner et al.
1997). CREB is phosphorylated by BDNF at the transcription
regulatory site, and CREB can feed-back on BDNF by regu-
lating its gene transcription via a calcium-dependent mecha-
nism (Finkbeiner 2000). CREB is required for various forms of
memory (Silva et al. 1998) and appears to play a role in
neuronal resistance to insult (Walton et al. 1999). Given the
preponderant effect of BDNF and associated molecules on
synaptic plasticity and function, it is possible that these mole-
cules can participate in the synaptic events associated with
locomotion. For example, BDNF can stimulate central pattern
generation (ﬁctive locomotion) in adult rats, clearly demon-
strating an effect of BDNF on the excitability of spinal loco-
motor networks (Jakeman et al. 1998). BDNF also can affect
muscle excitability. For example, Kleiman et al. (2000) re-
ported that BDNF stimulates the release of acetylcholine at the
neuromuscular synapse of cultured myocytes resulting in the
potentiation of spontaneous twitching. It is notable that BDNF,
synapsin I, CREB, and GAP-43 also have been associated with
learning, and motor learning has been described in the spinal
cord of spinal transected cats (de Leon et al. 1998). Whether
the molecular mechanisms described in the present results are
linked within the speciﬁc neural pathways that demonstrate the
spinal learning remains to be determined.
Neuromuscular activity regulates BDNF levels
and neuroplasticity
We evoked paralysis of the soleus muscle by blocking
neurotransmission using BTX-A in rats maintained under sed-
entary conditions and in rats that were allowed to run volun-
tarily. BTX-A injection in sedentary rats resulted in lower
levels of BDNF mRNA in the soleus muscle and in the spinal
hemi-cord of the injected side. These rats were housed in
sedentary cages and performed minimal spontaneous physical
activity, suggesting that a basal level of neuromuscular activity
is required to maintain normal levels of BDNF in the muscles
and spinal cord. These results also raise the issue as to whether
the BDNF levels are “subnormal” in sedentary rats and only
reach normal levels when the rats are allowed to exercise when
they chose to do so. In this case, one would have to consider
the possibility that a rat housed in a sedentary cage is not an
appropriate control condition for a variety of experiments. On
the other hand, the activity that occurs in rats housed in
sedentary cages may be analogous to the sedentary life of many
humans.
Exercise resulted in an increased expression of BDNF and

synapsin I mRNAs in the spinal cord contralateral to the
BTX-A-injected soleus muscle as would be expected from the
results in noninjected rats. Exercise subsequent to the BTX-A
injection decreased the levels of BDNF mRNA below control
values in the spinal cord ipsilateral to the injection. Adapta-
tions in gene expression were not related to differences in
voluntary exercise levels as differences in mRNA were ob-
served between the ipsilateral and contralateral sides to the
BTX-A injection in the same animals. Some modest and tran-
sient paralysis was detected in muscles immediately adjacent to
the soleus (see METHODS); that may be the result of some
leakage of BTX-A from the injected soleus. This, in turn, could
have further reduced the total level of sensory input normally
associated with active muscle contractions. It is also possible
that less activation of the lumbar circuits from suprasegmental
input could be caused indirectly by the muscle paralysis. Al-
though passive stretching of the paralyzed soleus muscle un-
doubtedly occurred during running, without gamma control it
was not sufﬁcient to sustain BDNF transcription in the spinal
cord at the level observed without paralysis. BTX-A injection
also reduced the levels of synapsin I mRNA in the spinal cord
of sedentary rats. Exercise increased the synapsin I mRNA to
control levels in the hemi-cord ipsilateral to the BTX-A injec-
tion, counteracting the inhibitory effect of BTX-A. These ﬁnd-
ings suggest some compensatory effect of exercise on paraly-
sis-induced synapsin I transcription.
It is also possible that the soleus muscle may have suffered
some “damage” during the initial stages of voluntary wheel
running in our model as has been reported for mice (Irintchev
and Wernig 1987; Wernig et al. 1991). It is plausible that
BDNF may have been involved with these events considering
that this “damage” includes ﬁber type remodeling and en-
hanced sprouting, which are typical components of a regener-
ative response within the spectrum of action of trophic factors.
The possibility of this effect would be consistent with the lack
of an increase in BDNF in the BTX-treated soleus muscle in
our study, as the same authors have reported that denervated
muscle that is passively stretched during running is not dam-
aged.
Decreases in BDNF and synapsin I mRNAs in the spinal
cord after pharmacological inactivation of the soleus muscle
demonstrated the crucial role of muscle activity and perhaps
neuronal activity in the induction of these genes. The obser-
vation that complete paralysis of only one small muscle of the
lower limb depressed the BDNF and synapsin I levels in the
ipsilateral segment that normally receives sensory input from
many muscle and joints of the limb was somewhat of a sur-
prise. However, this substantial depression may reﬂect the
extensive divergence from each sensory receptor projecting
back to the spinal cord. For example, each muscle spindle
sends 10–15 projections to each motor neuron of the homon-
ymous motor pool and to many of the motor neurons of
synergistic motor pools (Nelson and Mendell 1978).
The results clearly demonstrate the capacity of voluntary
physical activity to upregulate select genes associated with
neuronal plasticity in the spinal cord and skeletal muscle. It
appears that BDNF plays a central role in the molecular mech-
anisms by which exercise translates into changes of neuronal
plasticity and function in the neuromuscular system. The re-
sults also show the critical impact of physiological levels of
neural activity in maintaining the expression of select genes
during homeostatic conditions. It is likely that molecular mech-
anisms activated by exercise in the neuromuscular system also
may be applicable to more complex neural systems and provide
molecular substrates for the action of experience on neural
function. Further studies are required to determine the exact
role of BDNF and exercise on speciﬁc functional aspects of
neural plasticity. BDNF-exercise interactions appear to be crit-
ical factors to manipulate in the design of behavioral therapy
for decreasing the neuronal degeneration as occurs with aging
and many other neuromotor disorders.
