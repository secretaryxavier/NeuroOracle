Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) uses efficient strategies to evade the eradication by pro-
fessional phagocytes, involving—as recently confirmed—escape from phagosomal con-
finement. While Mtb determinants, such as the ESX-1 type VII secretion system, that
contribute to this phenomenon are known, the host cell factors governing this important bio-
logical process are yet unexplored. Using a newly developed flow-cytometric approach for
Mtb, we show that macrophages expressing the phagosomal bivalent cation transporter
Nramp-1, are much less susceptible to phagosomal rupture. Together with results from the
use of the phagosome acidification inhibitor bafilomycin, we demonstrate that restriction of
phagosomal acidification is a prerequisite for mycobacterial phagosomal rupture and cyto-
solic contact. Using different in vivo approaches including an enrichment and screen for
tracking rare infected phagocytes carrying the CD45.1 hematopoietic allelic marker, we
here provide first and unique evidence of M. tuberculosis-mediated phagosomal rupture in
mouse spleen and lungs and in numerous phagocyte types. Our results, linking the ability of
restriction of phagosome acidification to cytosolic access, provide an important conceptual
advance for our knowledge on host processes targeted by Mtb evasion strategies.
Author Summary
The intracellular fate of the agent of the human tuberculosis agent in phagocytes is a ques-
tion of great biological relevance. Among the mycobacterial survival strategies, the escape
of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from phagosomes has been subject of scientific debate for a
long time. However, technically improved methods recently reinforced the occurrence of
this phenomenon. Here, we focused on the host factors involved in phagosomal rupture
and provide first and singular evidence of M. tuberculosis-mediated phagosomal rupture

somal acidification, induced by mycobacteria, is a prerequisite for efficient vacuolar break-
age by M. tuberculosis and link maturation arrest, cytosolic contact and the corresponding
immune responses. From our results we conclude that vacuolar breakage induced by M.

inside infected phagocytes within organs during several days that strongly determines the
outcome of infection with this key pathogen.
Introduction
The pathogenic potential of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the etiologic agent of human
tuberculosis (TB), depends largely on the type VII secretion system ESX-1 [1,2], which is re-
sponsible for the secretion of the 6-kDa Early Secreted Antigenic Target (ESAT-6), its protein
partner, the 10-kDa Culture Filtrate Protein (CFP-10), and several ESX-1 associated proteins
(Esps) [3,4]. ESX-1 secretion is evolutionary conserved in most members of the M. tuberculosis
complex [5], and the more distantly related tubercle bacilli of the Mycobacterium canettii clade
[6,7], as well as in some non-tuberculous mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium marinum [8].
This secretion system governs numerous aspects of interaction between pathogenic mycobacte-
ria and the host cell [1,2], including membrane-damaging activity [9–11], thought to be impli-
cated in phagosomal escape at later stages of infection [12–16]. Although this phenomenon is a
matter of debate [2,17–20], by use of a single-cell Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer
(FRET)-based technology [21], we recently demonstrated that ESX-1-proficient Mtb and re-
combinant Mycobacterium bovis BCG::ESX-1 were able to induce phagosome rupture in
human THP-1 macrophage (MF)-like cells [15]. This assay uses the ability of the surface-
exposed BlaC β-lactamase of Mtb [22,23] to cleave the FRET substrate CCF-4, which consists
of a cephalosporin core linking 7-hydroxycoumarin to fluorescein that has also been used for
exploring effector injection and intracellular localization of Gram-negative bacteria [21,24,25].
The ESX-1-induced rupture of the phagosomal membrane, which results in the exit of myco-
bacterial products from the endosomal pathway and in extra-phagosomal localization of bacilli
[13–16] is of relevance for the outcome of the immune control and bacterial dissemination
[26–29]. Phagosomes are reported to be specialized platforms for pathogen recognition [30]
and there is also growing evidence of a link between the functionality of the ESX-1 secretion
system and the presence of mycobacteria-associated molecular patterns in the host cytosol.
Peptidoglycans [31,32] and extracellular mycobacterial DNA [33] were reported to be sensed
by the cytosolic receptors of the innate system with multiple biological consequences. Indeed,
the Mtb-mediated induction of Nucleotide binding Oligomerization Domain (NOD)-Like Re-
ceptor pathways, i.e., NOD2 / Receptor-interacting protein 2 kinase (Rip2) / TANK-Binding
Kinase 1 (TBK1) / Interferon regulatory factor (Irf) 5, is responsible for a significant part of
type I interferon (IFN) production [31,32]. On the other hand, the signaling through the Stim-
ulator of IFN Genes (STING) / TBK1 / Irf3 pathway [33] leads to a type I IFN signature on
which depends the expression of CCL5, CXCL10 and Nitric Oxide Synthase 2 [34,35]. The for-
mation of Nucleotide-binding domain and Leucin-rich Repeat pyrin–containing Protein-3
(NLRP-3) / ASC (Apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a carboxy-terminal
CARD) / caspase-1 inflammasome complex, is required in humans for the processing of the
pro-IL-1β into biologically active pleïotropic immune mediator IL-1β following Mtb infection
[36,37]. Moreover, the ubiquitination of Mtb prior to its delivery to the autophagic machinery
also necessitates the ESX-1-dependent translocation of extracellular Mtb DNA to the cytosol

[16,33,38,39]. Thus, the events arising from mycobacterial cytoplasmic access may substantial-
ly influence both the immune control of Mtb and the inflammation-induced tissue damage.
The impact of selected components of the ESX-1 system on phagosomal rupture has recent-
ly been assessed [13,15,16], however, other potential intervening factors, including those from
the host cell remain largely unexplored. Here, we have investigated the host parameters modu-
lating the Mtb-mediated vacuolar breakage, by developing a CCF-4 FRET-based approach that
can be used for the study of Mtb-infected cells by flow cytometry. This approach, which per-
mits to combine the detection of phagosomal rupture with the analysis of numerous host cell
phenotypic and functional parameters, allowed us to explore multiple phagocyte types, in-
cluding those isolated from mouse airways. Our results provide first and unique evidence that
Mtb-induced phagosomal rupture does occur in vivo inside the lungs and spleens of infected
experimental animals and lasts over several days. Moreover, we here explore the impact of
vacuolar acidification that constitutes a fundamental cellular defense mechanism [40] and
demonstrate that the characteristic partial prevention of phagosomal acidification by Mtb is a
prerequisite for phagosomal escape of the pathogen. Our study thus reveals novel details and
presents a refined model of cellular events during infection with Mtb.
Results
ESX-1-dependent Mtb-mediated phagosomal rupture detected by
FRET-based flow cytometry
To evaluate mycobacteria-mediated phagosomal rupture in different phagocyte types and dif-
ferent physiological contexts, we adapted the previously used microscopy-based CCF-4 FRET
technique [15] for flow cytometry. The latter approach not only allows monitoring of bacteria-
induced phagosomal rupture or tracking of endosome-to-cytosol antigen translocation [25,41],
but also permits the simultaneous inspection of surface markers and analysis of hundreds of
thousands of host cells. At first, we infected differentiated THP-1 cells at a multiplicity of infec-
tion (MOI) of 1 either with Mtb H37Rv WT or the isogenic ΔESX-1 derivative, Mtb H37Rv-
ΔRD1 [10], which both display similar β-lactamase activity [15]. These THP-1 cells were then
incubated with CCF-4-AM, an esterified, lipophilic form of the CCF-4 substrate that can readi-
ly enter into cells, where it is converted by endogenous cytoplasmic esterases into negatively
charged CCF-4, which is retained in the cytosol and emits green fluorescence (500–550 nm)
upon stimulation at 320–380 nm, due to FRET from the coumarin moiety to the fluoroscein
part (S1 Fig.). In the case of Mtb-induced phagosomal rupture, cleavage of CCF-4 by the intrin-
sic Mtb BlaC β-lactamase leads to loss of FRET and a change of the CCF-4 emission spectrum
from green to blue coumarin fluorescence (410–470 nm). As depicted in Fig. 1A, the CCF-4
emission signals of CD11b+ gated THP-1 cells, infected with wild-type (WT) Mtb H37Rv,
showed a marked shift of the CCF-4 emission towards blue at 4 days post infection (dpi). In
contrast, a much weaker shift of the CCF-4 spectrum was observed for Mtb ΔESX-1-infected
cells, validating our experimental setup and confirming the fundamental virulence differences
between the used ESX-1-proficient and ESX-1–deficient Mtb strains [10,15]. The residual blue
shift in Mtb ΔESX-1-infected cells relative to non-infected cells is likely a consequence of para-
formaldehyde (PFA) fixation prior to signal acquisition (S2A–B Fig.). These results were fur-
ther corroborated by ratios of Mean Fluorescence Intensities (MFI) of blue vs. green signals
(Fig. 1B), and blue MFI447 nm (Fig. 1C). Moreover, we also used fluorescent Mtb (DsRed-Mtb
H37Rv) to infect THP-1 cells, at a weaker initial dose (MOI = 0.3), and thereby observed that
the CCF-4 blue emission shift selectively occurred in cells that had engulfed the bacteria
(Fig. 1D). This approach thus allowed a quantitative study of phagosomal rupture in host cells
that have engulfed Mtb, and whose subtype can be identified/determined by staining of the

specific surface markers. Hence, our experimental setup was adapted to be used for various cell
types and physiological situations, including the detection of vacuolar rupture in rare (infected)
cells that were dispersed in a large and heterogeneous cell background population.
Mtb-induced phagosomal rupture in dendritic cells and macrophages,
relationship with the infection rate and cell necrosis
Dendritic cells (DC) and MF do not play the same roles during the infection. DCs that have
engulfed Mtb, are more prone to process and present pathogen-derived antigens and to prime
T cells than Mtb-laden MF which are thought to initiate the inflammatory program and are
considered as long-term Mtb reservoirs. We thus comparatively evaluated the potential of Mtb
to induce phagosome rupture in bone-marrow-derived (BM)-DC and -MF At first, by using
fluorescent DsRed WT and ΔESX-1 Mtb variants, we showed similar uptake and infectivity of
both strains at the beginning of the infection (Fig. 2A). Infection of BM-DC and BM-MF with
WT Mtb then resulted in a strong blue shift at 3 dpi and thereafter, whereas for cells infected
with the ΔESX-1 Mtb strain only a minor blue shift was detected (Fig. 2B). The relatively stable
CCF-4 green signal and its progressively increasing blue shift for WT Mtb resulted in a blue/
green ratio of 15 in BM-DC and 10 in BM-MF respectively, at 6 dpi (Fig. 2C). Similar as ob-
served for THP-1 cells (Fig. 1D), infection of BM-DC with DsRed expressing Mtb showed that
cells, which had engulfed DsRed Mtb, progressively increased their CCF4 blue shift over the
observation period of 3 to 5 dpi (S3 Fig.). Together, these results suggest that ESX-1-dependent,
Mtb-induced phagosomal rupture does occur in DC and MF.
To ascertain that the absence of FRET inhibition in cells infected with the ΔESX-1 Mtb mu-
tant was not due to other molecular reasons than the absence of the ESX-1 secretion system,
we complemented the Mtb ΔESX-1 strain with the integrative cosmid p2F9, containing 32 kb
of the ESX-1 encoding genomic region from Mtb H37Rv [42]. This complementation reconsti-
tuted the ability of the resulting strain to induce phagosomal rupture, and thereby validated the
ΔESX-1 mutants used throughout this study (S2C Fig.).
When uncontrolled inside the host cell, Mtb infection may lead to necrosis [27,43], which
could theoretically allow exchanges between phagosome and cytosol and thereby establish a
contact between mycobacterial β-lactamase located within the phagosome and CCF-4 located
inside the cytosol. To investigate this key question, we determined whether the cytosolic access
of Mtb was a consequence of host cell necrosis. In a dose-response experiment, changes in the
FRET signal for the Mtb WT strain were seen as a function of the MOI (Fig. 2D). Except for an
MOI below 1, the proportions of BM-DC displaying FRET inhibition were higher than the per-
centages of necrotic cells (Fig. 2E). In contrast, BM-DC infected with Mtb ΔESX-1 at the same
MOIs displayed much weaker CCF-4 blue shifts. These data suggest that ESX-1-mediated pha-
gosomal rupture progressively occurs in phagocytes in an MOI-dependent manner and that
the resultant presence of mycobacterial β-lactamase activity in the host cell cytosol does not
arise from host cell necrosis but rather precedes cell death.
Early minor levels of phagosome disruption and their full proportionality
with type I IFN production
So far, Mtb-induced phagosomal rupture has only been observed at later stages of infection, i.e,
3–5 dpi, a kinetic situation, which cannot explain the very early, ESX-1-dependent release of
type I IFNs or IL-1β, that requires recognition of mycobacterial components by the host cyto-
solic sensors [44]. However, our highly sensitive approach allowed now detection of minor lev-
els of FRET inhibition indicated by enhanced MFI447 nm (blue), as early as 3 hours post
infection (hpi) with WT Mtb (Fig. 3A-B). The blue shift then progressively increased at 24 and

48 hpi, although it remained still low compared to values obtained for later time points
(Fig. 2B-C). Comparison of these results with those from infection experiments using the Mtb
ΔESX-1 deletion mutant, which overall showed much lower MFI447nm (blue) values (Fig. 3B),
suggests that Mtb-mediated phagosomal rupture begins already at such early time-points, likely
caused by initial ESX-1-induced pore forming activity, and progresses into stronger phagoso-
mal disassembly over time. These findings suggest that the time during which the Mtb-infected
host cell displays phagosomal rupture and Mtb cytosolic access, prior to host cell death, is lon-
ger than previously estimated [15].
Considering the long Mtb replication time of  20h, such early initiation of Mtb-mediated
phagosomal rupture suggests that this phenomenon does not depend on bacterial replication,
but on the functions of the implicated bacterial virulence factors. The levels of phagosome
disruption were entirely proportional to the amounts of secreted IFN-β (Fig. 3C). A partially
ESX-1-dependent increase in the IFN-α secretion was also detected, which might be linked to
the induction of Irf7 subsequent to IFN-β induction [45]. Therefore, minute levels of early pha-
gosomal rupture are in direct correlation with the kinetics of the induction of type I IFN pro-
duction. In contrast, no differences were found between ESX-1-proficient and ΔESX-1 Mtb
strains when IL-1β secretion was studied (S4 Fig.), which is consistent with the inflammasome/
caspase-1-independent IL-1β secretion in mice during Mtb infection [46] and which is differ-
ent to the situation in humans [36].
Link between the phagosomal environment and the ability to induce
phagosomal rupture
We next evaluated whether the characteristic Mtb-mediated partial inhibition of phagosome
acidification was connected to the phenomenon of phagosome rupture. Given the previously
established role of Natural resistance-associated macrophage protein (Nramp)-1, a phagosomal
bivalent cation transporter, in phagosomal acidification and pH regulation [47–49], we evalu-
ated its possible impact on mycobacteria-mediated phagosomal rupture. We thus used Mtb
WT or ΔESX-1 strains to infect cells from the murine MF cell line Raw264.7, deficient in func-
tional Nramp-1, which had been transfected with a non-functional nramp-1S (Sensitive) or a
functional nramp-1R (Resistance) allele [50]. At 3 dpi, intense CCF-4 blue shifts were observed
in WT Mtb-infected parental Raw264.7 cells and Raw264.7::Nramp-1S cells, whereas much
less FRET inhibition was detected in Raw264.7::Nramp-1R cells (Fig. 4A-C). As assessed for
various MOI, the intracellular mycobacterial load inside parental, Nramp-1S- or Nramp-1R-
transfected Raw264.7 cells was comparable at 3 dpi, when the phagosomal rupture was moni-
tored (Fig. 4D). Thus, the functional Nramp-1R seems to provide protection against Mtb-
induced phagosomal rupture for the benefit of the host cell. The Nramp-1-mediated rescue of
the host cells occurred at any MOI and independently of the host cell proliferation rate, which
as we noticed, both influence the control of the infection (S5 Fig.). We obtained further confir-
mation of our results by using an nramp-1 gene silencing strategy in Raw264.7::Nramp-1R
cells (Fig. 4E), which reversed the phenotype and promoted Mtb-mediated phagosomal rup-
ture (Fig. 4F-G).
We further treated Raw264.7::Nramp-1R cells or, as primary phagocytes, BM-DC from
Sv129 (nramp-1R) mice with bafilomycin, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar proton ATPases,
prior to infection with WT Mtb H37Rv. As shown in Fig. 5A-B, the bafilomycin-mediated
in parallel, in cells from the same BM-DC cultures. The results are representative of 2 independent experiments. Of note, the decrease of the dead cell
percentage for WT Mtb at very high MOI is likely due to generation of cell debris, not anymore measurable by cytometry.

reduction of phagosomal acidification resulted in enhanced phagosomal rupture in both cell
types. This observation provides additional evidence for a link between restriction of phago-
some acidification and the strength of observed phagosomal rupture. In this FRET-based
method, the β-lactamase operates on CCF-4 located in the host cytosol, where the pH remains
neutral [25,41]. However, to further ascertain that the micro-environmental acidity did not af-
fect the functionality of mycobacterial BlaC, we tested the β-lactamase enzymatic activity of
Mtb at different pH levels by the use of nitrocefin, a chromogenic β-lactamase substrate. These
experiments confirmed that Mtb, grown at different pH, ranging from 5 to 7, preserves entirely
its β-lactamase enzymatic activity (Fig. 5C).
Thus, acidification of the phagosomal lumen seems to be a critical host cell parameters,
which exerts an antagonistic effect on Mtb-mediated phagosomal rupture in phagocytes. The
finding that both phenomena are linked provides a new basis for elucidating the molecular key
players that govern the host-pathogen interaction during Mtb infection.
ESX-1-dependent Mtb-mediated phagosome disruption in pulmonary
phagocytes and in vivo in lungs and spleen of infected mice
Previous studies on vacuolar rupture and phagosomal escape of M. marinum [12,51] and Mtb
[13,15,16] used infected MF or DC under in vitro conditions. To extend our investigations to-
wards cells from the lung, we examined the Mtb-mediated phagosomal rupture in different
phagocyte types of mouse airways. To this end, low-density cells isolated from mouse lung pa-
renchyma were infected ex vivo at an MOI of 1 with ΔESX-1 or WT Mtb strains. CCF-4 signals
obtained from monocytes/MF (CD11bhi CD11c-) and DC (CD11bint CD11c+) were analyzed
at 4 dpi, when changes in the FRET signal were detected in lung monocytes/MF and DC
(Fig. 6A), showing the occurrence of Mtb-mediated phagosomal rupture in the primary
lung phagocytes.
To assess the relevance of mycobacteria-mediated phagosomal rupture in phagocytes in
vivo, in a first attempt we used T-/B-cell deficient recombination activation gene (rag) 2 knock-
out mice in which infection with Mtb is more persistent and the innate cell compartments
more developed than in their immunocompetent counterparts. However, flow cytometric
analysis of lung- or spleen-derived MF/monocytes, DC and neutrophils obtained from infected
(1 x 106 CFU i.v. /mouse of WT or ΔESX-1 Mtb) or uninfected rag2°/° mice displayed indistin-
guishable CCF-4 blue profiles (S6 Fig.). The apparent failure in the detection of phagosomal
rupture in this experimental setting seems to be related to the very low frequencies of mycobac-
teria-infected cells within each innate cell subset and/or a possible furtive feature of the phe-
nomenon in vivo due to possible efferocytosis [52] of the primary phagocytes, in which
phagosomal rupture and certain damage signals would have been initiated.
To distinguish infected and non-infected cells, we then used fluorescent DsRed-WT Mtb
(1 x 106 CFU/mouse) for intravenous (i.v.) infection of C57BL/6 mice, which allowed us to
focus on the relatively few Mtb-infected phagocytes present during the initial phase of chronic
infection. At 3 weeks p.i. mice were sacrificed, the spleens homogenized and resulting cells en-
riched and subjected to flow cytometric analysis. We have focused on the phagocytes of the
spleen because this organ is particularly targeted by the i.v. route of infection. When the CCF-4
blue signal of the innate immune cells that contained DsRed Mtb was compared to the other
cells inside each cell subset in the spleen (Fig. 6B), a slight increase in CCF-4 blue signal was
notably detected in Mtb-containing cells in the subsets of neutrophils (CD11bhiCD11c-Ly6G+)
and MF/monocytes (CD11bintCD11c-Ly6G-) (Fig. 6C), which suggests the occurrence of
weak, albeit reproducible, levels of phagosomal rupture in these infected cells. Interestingly, no
DsRed+ cells were detected inside the CD11bloCD11c+Ly6G- DC subset, which might be due to

possible rapid turnover of infected DC or to their CD11b up-regulation. In this chronic infec-
tion model, it was however not possible to compare WT and ΔESX-1 Mtb strains, because of
the non-persistence of the latter. To overcome this limitation we developed an alternative in
vivo model whereby mice were instilled intra-nasally with cells that were infected with Mtb in
vitro prior to transfer, and whose infection status in vivo could be specifically monitored. To
this end, BM-DC from mice with CD45.1 hematopoietic allelic marker were infected in vitro
with WT or ΔESX-1 Mtb, in conditions that allowed up to 70% of the cells to be infected
(Fig. 2A), whereas control cells were left uninfected. At 16 hpi, the cells were instilled into the
airways of congenic CD45.2 recipients. At different time points post-transfer, the lung low-
density cells were isolated and the CCF-4 blue shift in the CD11b+ CD45.1 cell subset of the dif-
ferent experimental groups assessed (Figs. 7A and S7). Strikingly, at day 4 and day 6 post-trans-
fer, in the CD11b+ CD45.1 population infected with WT Mtb, a blue shift was detected in
comparison to the non-infected or ΔESX-1-infected transferred cells (Fig. 7B-C).
Moreover, independent flow cytometric examination of cells extracted directly from surface
lung granuloma tissue of Mtb-infected C57BL/6 mice revealed a small, distinct cell population
that displayed a clear-cut blue signal and a CD11b+ CD11c+ phenotype (Fig. 7D), which points
to the presence of innate cells in these lungs wherein Mtb-mediated phagosomal rupture
had occurred.
Altogether, our data suggest that the Mtb-induced phagosomal rupture does indeed happen
in vivo, in Mtb-infected cells in the organs of small laboratory animals. The detected phago-
cytes containing intracellular bacteria seem to have a life-time of several days, which however
does not exclude the possibility that a portion of the total number of infected phagocytes might
get eliminated by efferocytosis [52], as suggested by the relatively modest differences in blue
shift observed in the in vivo settings.
Discussion
The pathogenic potential of Mtb is intimately linked to the interplay between the host defense
and the persistence of the mycobacteria. The intracellular localization and cytosolic access of
the bacterium has substantial consequences on the recognition of mycobacteria-associated pat-
terns by the cytosolic receptors of the innate immunity that determine innate and adaptive im-
mune responses and ultimately the fate of the host cell and the bacterium [27]. Subsequent to
phagocytosis, in order to avoid the acidified environment generated by the phagosome-lyso-
some fusion, some specialized intracellular bacteria, such as S. flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes
or Francisella tularensis, evolved to rapidly escape from phagosomes into the cytosol
[21,53,54]. In contrast, Mtb has been described as a bacterium that resists degradation in the
phagosome by inhibiting the fusion with lysosomes, a characteristic feature that seems to pro-
tect the bacilli from bactericidal mechanisms of the phagocytes and allows intracellular survival
and multiplication [10,18,55–57]. However, recent reports based on in vitro infection of phago-
cytes also suggest that at later stages of infection ESX-1-dependent vacuolar breakage might be
an important requirement for the pathogenic potential of Mtb, given that ESX-1-deficient
bacilli that are unable to perforate and lyse the phagosomal membrane are—in general—atten-
uated [13,15,16,18,56–59].
In previous studies, Mtb-mediated phagosomal escape has only been reported at late time
points like 2–5 dpi, a kinetic feature that was not reconcilable with the intracellular host im-
mune events, like type I IFN induction, which require the early recognition of mycobacterial
components by cytosolic sensors. Here, the use of highly sensitive FRET-based cytometry en-
abled us to highlight minor levels of cytosolic contact of Mtb and its products initiated as soon
as 3 hpi, which is kinetically concordant and proportional with the amounts of IFN-β released

by DC. While we cannot exclude the possibility that some of this effect may have been caused
by bacterial products translocating through permeable phagosomal membranes [30], the re-
producible differences observed between the WT and the ΔESX-1 Mtb strains argue for a spe-
cific, ESX-1-mediated impact. We also noted that distinct cell types might display different
susceptibility to phagosomal rupture, with THP-1 cells as the most susceptible ones, followed
by BM-DC/BM-MF, and the Raw264.7 MF as the least affected cell types, tested.
Our results show that the phagosomal bivalent cation transporter Nramp-1 interferes with
Mtb-induced phagosomal rupture as observed at 3 dpi, i.e., a time point at which mycobacterial
loads were still comparable in Mtb-infected MF harboring Nramp-1S (non functional)- or
Nramp-1R (functional) allelic forms. In line with that, the effect of bafilomycin, reported to
inhibit phagosomal acidification [60], reconstituted in Nramp-1R-proficient phagocytes the
capacity of Mtb to enhance phagosomal rupture to the level of Nramp-1S phagocytes. Thus,
the partial inhibition of phagosome acidification emerges as a prerequisite to mycobacterial
phagosomal rupture. Plausibly, only when phagosome acidification is partially inhibited,
mycobacteria may survive, use their virulence factors and induce phagosomal membrane
disruption.
Although cellular models may provide important new insights into cell biological mecha-
nisms, evaluation of the accuracy of the findings in an in vivo model, i.e. in tissues or organs is
of crucial importance to emphasize their relevance. Previous electron microscopy analyses of
lung innate cells isolated from TB patients or mycobacteria-infected mice have led to discrep-
ancies with regards to intracellular location [18]. In alveolar MF of TB patients and in granulo-
ma or lung homogenates of infected mice, Mtb has been detected as single bacterium or pairs
of bacilli inside phagosomes [61,62], whereas Mtb has also been observed in membrane-dis-
rupted compartments or free in the cytosol in the mouse granulomas [63,64]. Moreover, heavi-
ly infected human alveolar MF [62] and damaged mouse MF of inflammatory sites [65]
contain multiple mycobacteria per phagosome. In this context, our results from carefully de-
signed in vivo infection experiments add new elements to the discussion. Although the strength
of the FRET-inhibition was found weaker under in vivo conditions (Figs. 6 and 7) than ob-
served for the cell culture-based infection assays (Figs. 1 and 2), the reproducibility and com-
plementarity of the results from the three distinct in vivo settings analyzed, point to biological
relevance of mycobacteria-induced phagosomal rupture in the organs of Mtb-infected labora-
tory animals. It should be noted that in our experiment with BM-DC from mice with the
CD45.1 hematopoietic allelic markers (Fig. 7), we cannot exclude that in the infected DC some
minor cytosolic contact might develop already in vitro, prior to their instillation to the CD45.2
recipient mice. However, the finding that FRET inhibition remains detectable for several days
after the transfer into the lungs of the CD45.2 recipients suggests that the phagocytes in which
cytosolic access of Mtb progressively builds up, can survive in the host environment for some
days. Together with ex vivo results from MF/monocytes and DC isolated from the lung paren-
chyma, the in vivo demonstration of cytosolic access of Mtb provides important new insights
into the cellular events during infection inside the organs. Our data suggest that after infection,
the concerned phagocytes may persist in the organs long enough to have a potential impact on
host defense mechanisms that likely also include key cellular processes, such as autophagy,
which requires Mtb ubiquitination in an ESX-1-dependent manner [16,33,38,39].

The intracellular localization of mycobacteria and mycobacteria-mediated phagosomal rup-
ture have been subject of numerous controversies, which may be explained by the differences be-
tween the level of virulence of mycobacterial strains used, the MOI and the conditions of the
mycobacterial cultures in vitro [18]. For the virulent strains, here we used WT and DsRed Mtb
previously passaged in immunocompetent mice to maintain a normal degree of virulence and to
remain as close to natural infection as possible. We only used mycobacterial cultures in mid-
log10 growth phase to minimize bacterial mortality, and we cultured the bacteria in the presence
of Tween 80 to avoid clumping, as phagocytosis of non-viable or clumped mycobacteria may
lead to rapid phagosome-lysosome fusion and prevent visualization of phagosomal rupture [18].
In addition, we systematically compared the ESX-1-proficient and ESX-1-deficient mycobacterial
strains and detected a relevant phagosomal rupture only with ESX-1-proficient strains.
Previous observations with numerous virulent and attenuated Mtb strains suggest that the
capacity of a strain to induce phagosomal rupture in vitro is often correlated with its virulence
[15,16]. Hence, the ESX-1-dependent, mycobacteria-induced phagosomal rupture emerges as a
major characteristic feature of Mtb infection, which likely initiates the first damages caused by
this intracellular pathogen to the host cell. Consequently, modulation of the parameters, which
orchestrate this phenomenon, may constitute a promising base for vaccinal or therapeutic in-
terventions against TB. For example, we have previously noticed that recombinant BCG and
M. microti strains with a reconstituted ESX-1 secretion system showed enhanced protective ef-
ficacy [66,67]. More recently, a dedicated study identified small molecule inhibitors belonging
to the benzyloxybenzylidene-hydrazine and the benzothiophene chemical classes, which inter-
fered with ESAT-6 secretion and thereby protected host cells from Mtb-induced lysis [68].
Molecules belonging to closely related chemical scaffolds were also identified in a high content
phenotypic screen as agents that interfered with the intracellular growth and the virulence of
Mtb [69]. Hence, it is conceivable that future phenotypic library screening might identify novel
pharmacological compounds that inhibit Mtb-mediated phagosomal rupture in the host cell.
Such molecules would represent interesting anti-virulence compounds to be tested as addition
to conventional treatment regimens against TB.
In conclusion, our study suggests that Mtb is not the passive pathogen that induces patholo-
gy only by the over-boarding reaction of the host immune system. We show that ESX-1-medi-
ated phagosomal rupture contributes in a significant way to establish mycobacterial cytosolic
contact, which is however only possible if the maturation / acidification of the phagosome is
limited in a first process. In this direction, our study also opens new perspectives for future
studies on the mycobacterial components involved in the modulation of phagosomal acidifica-
tion such as the phthiocerol dimycocerosates and other mycobacterial factors, reported to in-
tervene in this process [70,71].
The ESX-1 system might thus represent one of the final members in a chain of virulence fac-
tors that determine the pathogenicity of Mtb through the induction of phagosomal rupture,
and its function might therefore have been evolutionary preserved [5,7]. As such, our work has
the potential to reconcile the outcome of previous studies on mycobacterial virulence factors
that interfere with vacuolar acidification [71–74] and studies on cellular localization of Mtb
[13–16] and establishes Mtb-mediated phagosomal rupture as a basic biological mechanism in-
volved in TB pathogenesis.
Materials and Methods
Animal infection model
C57BL/6 mice, rag2°/° or CD45.1 were obtained from Animal Facilities of Institut Pasteur.
C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Janvier Le Genest-Saint-Isle France). CD45.2 mice were

anesthetized by i.p. injection of 100 mg/kg Ketamine (Lyon, France) and 10 mg/kg Xylazine
(KCP Kiel, Germany) before cell transfer by i.n. route. Mouse infection with Mtb via aerosol
route was performed as previously described [75]. Granuloma were recovered from the surface
lung parenchyma of infected C57BL/6 mice at 6 weeks p.i.
Ethics statement
Mouse studies were approved by the Institut Pasteur Safety Committee, in accordance with
French and European guidelines and regulations (Directive 86/609/CEE and Decree 87–848 of
19 October 1987) and the Animal Experimentation Ethics Committee Ile-de-France-1 (refer-
ence number 2012–0005).
Cell cultures
THP-1 cells (our laboratory stock collection, initially originating from ATCC provided cells)
were maintained in RPMI, complemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and were treated
with 20 ng/ml of Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate for 72h to induce their differentiation into
MF. Raw264.7 cells transfected with nramp-1S or -1R allele (kind gift of Pr J. Blackwell) [50]
were treated with 8 μg/ml of the selective antibiotic puromycin.
BM-MF or -DC were generated from femur hematopoietic precursors, respectively by use
of M-CSF or GM-CSF. Rat anti-mouse IFN-α mAb (RMMA-1), biotinylated polyclonal rabbit
anti-mouse IFN-α (R&D), rat anti-mouse IFN-β (8.S.415) (LifeSpan BioSciences) and biotiny-
lated polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse IFN-β (R&D) were used to quantify the cytokines produced
in the culture supernatants by ELISA.
Mtb cultures and cell infection
Mtb H37Rv, WT, ΔESX-1 (kind gift of Pr. W. Jacobs) [10] or ΔESX::ESX-1 [42] were main-
tained in 7H9 medium supplemented with ADC (Difco). Seven-to-10 days before cell infection,
bacteria were transferred into Dubos medium, which contains Tween 80, to avoid mycobacteri-
al clumping. DsRed-WT or -ΔESX-1 strains were obtained by complementation with the
pMRF plasmid containing a DsRed cassette, under the hsp60 promoter (kind gift of
Dr. S. Cho) and were cultured in the continuous presence of 20 μg/ml of the selective antibiotic
kanamycin. In in vivo experiments, we used an Mtb H37Rv strain with a plasmid containing
the DsRed and hygromycin resistance genes (kind gift of Dr. O. Neyrolles). Only mycobacteria
grown to mid-log10 phase were used to minimize the frequency of death bacteria.
Raw264.7 cells were infected at various MOI with Mtb in complete antibiotic-free RPMI. At
3 dpi, equal numbers of cells were lysed by addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and the intra-
cellular CFU was determined by plating serial dilutions of cell lysates on 7H9 Agar medium
and incubation at 37°C for 3 weeks.
CCF-4 assay and flow cytometry
The principle of the β-lactamase CCF-4 FRET assay is summarized in S1 Fig.. To measure the
Mtb phagosomal rupture, cells were stained during 1h at RT, with 8 μM CCF-4 (Invitrogen) in
EM buffer (120 mM NaCl, 7 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 0.8 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose and 25
mM Hepes, pH 7.3) complemented with 2.5 μM probenecid. Cells were then stained with anti-
CD11c-PE-Cy7, anti-CD11b-PerCp-Cy5.5 (eBiosciences) or anti-CD11b-APC (BD) mAbs
andfixed with 4% PFA overnight at 4°C. Cell mortality in the same cultures of infected cells
was determined by use of Pacific Blue Dead/Live reagent (Invitrogen), which reacts with free
amines both inside and outside of the plasma membrane, yielding log10 1 more intense

fluorescent staining of dead cells. Anti-CD45.1-PE-Cy7 and anti-CD45.2-PerCpCy5.5 were
from eBiosciences. To avoid fluorochromes with emission signals overlapping with those of
CCF-4 (λem 500–550 nm and λem 410–470 nm), APC (λem 660 nm)-, PerCp-Cy5.5 (λem 696
nm)- or PE-Cy7 (λem 778 nm)-conjugated mAbs were chosen for concomitant cell surface
staining. Cells were analyzed in a CyAn cytometer using Summit software (Beckman Coulter,
France). At least 100,000 events per sample were acquired for in vitro assays. For in vivo detec-
tion of CCF-4 signal in CD45 congenic mouse model, 1,000,000 events per sample have been
acquired. Data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar, OR).
Gene silencing
siRNA transfection to cells was performed by using reverse transfection method. A pool of four
Nramp-1-specific siRNAs, GGUCAAGUCUAGAGAAGUA, GAUCCUAGGCUGUCU
CUUU, GGGCGACUGUGCUAGGUUU and GAAGUCAUCGGGACGGCUA, at final con-
centration of 50 nM, was mixed with 6 μl of lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in 500 μl of PBS in 6-
well plates. After 30 min incubation at RT, 3 x 105 cells contained in 2 ml of complete RPMI
were added to the mixture and incubated for 3 days at 37°C. The efficiency of gene silencing
was determined by qRT-PCR before the infection. One mg of total RNA was transcribed into
cDNA. Then, 4 μL of cDNA was tested by qRT-PCR with LightCycler 480 SYBR Green using
GCCACTGTGCTAGGTTTGCT and AATGGTGATCAGTACACCGC primers. All experi-
ments were run in triplicate and the Livak method [76] was applied for relative quantification
with β-actin.
Mycobacterial β-lactamase activity assay
The β-lactamase activity of Mtb, grown in Dubos broth with various pH, was measured by use
of the chromogenic β-lactamase substrate, nitrocefin. Briefly 1 x 106 bacteria, re-suspended in
100 μl of Dubos broth at indicated pH, were incubated in 96-well plates with 50 μl of nitrocefin,
reconstituted at 0.5 mg/ml in PBS which contained 5% DMSO. Absorbance by nitrocefin at
486 nm was measured after 3 hours of incubation at 37°C.
Enrichment of innate immune cells
Lungs or spleen were removed aseptically and were digested by treatment with 400 U/ml
type IV collagenase and DNase I (Roche). Following a 45 min incubation at 37°C, single-cell
suspensions were prepared by use of a Gentle Macs (Miltenyi) and by passage through
100-μm nylon filters (Cell Strainer, BD Falcon). When indicated, cell suspensions were en-
riched in low-density cells on iodixanol gradient medium (OptiPrep, Axis-Shield), according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Notably this gradient only selects alive cells, as confirmed
by blue Trypan exclusion assay. These cells were either used directly in flow cytometry
analyses or were plated in 12 well culture plates in complete RPMI to be infected ex vivo
with mycobacteria.

bacterial beta-lactamase can not reach the CCF-4 substrate and upon stimulation at ~ 409 nm,
CCF-4 shows Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) that leads to emmision of
“green” light at ~ 535 nm. As shown for step 3, in case of phagosomal rupture and cytosolic
contact the mycobacterial β-lactamase (shown as red dots linked to the bacterium) gets in con-
tact with the CCF-4 substrate trapped in the cytosol, and is inducing cleavage of the substrate
and inhibiting FRET, thereby leading to emission of “blue” light at ~ 450 nm.

However, these levels of shift are ten to hundred of times lower compared to those observed

compared to THP-1 cells, BM-DC or BM-MF, relatively low levels of phagosomal rupture
were generally observable in Raw264.7 MF. Indeed, a CCF-4 blue shift is weakly detectable at
2 dpi, peaks at 3 dpi and then decreases as soon as 4 dpi. This feature seems to be linked to in-
tense proliferative capacity of these cells despite the infection and also to their possible intense
efferocytic capacity.
