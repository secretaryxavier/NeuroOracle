Abstract
Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of depression as well as
neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent studies show a role of BDNF in energy metabolism and body
weight regulation. We examined BDNF levels in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from age matched elderly
depressed and control subjects. Also, the association of BDNF levels with age, gender, body weight, body mass index (BMI),
and cognitive performance was evaluated. We did not find any significant differences in plasma and CSF BDNF levels
between depressed and control subjects. Plasma BDNF levels were negatively correlated with age (but not with BMI and
body weight), when analyses were performed including both depressed and control subjects. A significant reduction in
plasma BDNF levels was observed in females as compared to male subjects, and the change in BDNF levels were
significantly and positively related to body weight in females. Furthermore, significant increases in Total Recall and Delayed
Recall values were found in females as compared to males. In conclusion, the lower BDNF levels observed in females
suggest that changes in peripheral BDNF levels are likely secondary to an altered energy balance. However, further studies
using larger sample size are warranted.

Introduction
Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated
in many neuronal functions including survival, neurogenesis, and
synaptic plasticity [1–2]. BDNF regulates the development and
plasticity of neural circuits involved in mood disorders such as
depression [3]. In vitro studies show that BDNF stimulates the
growth of dendrites and increases the spine density of cortical
pyramidal neurons [4–5]. Exposure to stress and glucocorticoids
has been shown to reduce BDNF expression in several brain
regions including prefrontal cortex [6–8]. Moreover, postmortem
brain studies have shown decreased levels of BDNF in prefrontal
cortex in individuals who were depressed at the time of death [9–
10]. Alterations in BDNF protein levels were also found in
peripheral samples from depressed subjects [11]. A major source
of the peripheral BDNF is platelets, which bind, store, and release
BDNF upon activation [12].
Recent studies suggest that BDNF plays an important role in
regulating energy homeostasis and body weight [13–15]. Studies
in animals have shown that mice with only one functional BDNF
allele exhibited a tendency toward obesity [16]. It is also known
that eripheral injections of BDNF produce hypophagic and
hypoglycemic effects in obese hyperglycemic animals, indicating
antiobesity and antidiabetic effects [17–19]. Moreover, BDNF and
its cognate receptor, TrkB are expressed in various hypothalamic
nuclei implicated in the regulation of eating behavior [16]. In
clinical studies, decreased levels of serum BDNF have been found
in underweight women with anorexia nervosa [20]. In addition, a
recent meta-analysis confirmed a reciprocal link between depres-
sion and obesity in humans [21]. However, the relationship
between BDNF and body weight in depression is not clear.
In the present study, we compared BDNF levels in plasma and
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from subjects diagnosed with
major depressive disorder (MDD) and matched control subjects,
and explored possible relationships between BDNF levels and
factors such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI) or body
weight. Since BDNF plays an important role in cognitive function,
we examined the association of plasma BDNF levels with cognitive
measures.

Results
Plasma and CSF BDNF Levels in Depressed and Control
Subjects
BDNF levels as measured by ELISA did not show any
significant difference between control and MDD subjects in
plasma and CSF samples (Table 1). Furthermore, within the
depression group, BDNF levels in subjects who are actively
depressed and those in remission did not differ from levels in
control subjects (Table 2). We did not find any significant effect of
antidepressant medications on plasma and CSF BDNF levels in
depressed subjects as compared to depressed subjects without
antidepressants or control subjects (data not shown).
Effects of Age, BMI, Gender and Body Weight on BDNF
Levels
A negative correlation was found between age and plasma
BDNF levels, when the analysis was done with depressed and
control subjects together [r = 20.230, p = 0.031; Fig 1a). However,
plasma BDNF did not show any significant correlation with BMI
[r = 0.031,
p = 0.774;
Fig
1b)
or
body
weight
[r = 0.118,
p = 0.277]. The correlation analysis was also performed in
depressed and control subjects separately. No significant correla-
tion was found between the above variables and plasma BDNF or
CSF BDNF levels in each diagnostic group [r = 0.259, p = 0.146].
To determine whether gender plays any significant role in BDNF
levels, plasma as well as CSF BDNF levels were examined in males
and females. We found a significant decrease in plasma BDNF
levels in females as compared to males (p = 0.044; Table 3).
However, no significant change in BDNF levels was found in CSF
samples between females and males.
Since BDNF has been implicated in the regulation of food
intake and body weight we examined the relationship between
BDNF and body weight in our study subjects. We found a
significant reduction in body weight in females as compared to
males (162.61 lbs 631.74 vs. 202.996117.73; p = 0.009). More-
over, when weight was considered as a covariate in ANCOVA, we
did not find any significant difference in plasma BDNF levels
between male and female subjects (p = 0.095) indicating a possible
role of weight in the observed changes in plasma BDNF levels.
When BMI was considered as a covariate in the above analysis the
difference between genders in plasma BDNF levels remained
significant (p = 0.046). However, we were not able to do the
analysis with age as a covariate as the assumptions were not met to
perform the analysis.
Cognitive Performance
Since BDNF plays an important role in cognitive function, we
next examined the association of plasma BDNF levels with
cognitive measures. In depressed subjects, we found a significant
positive correlation of plasma BDNF levels with Delayed recall
(r = 0.366,
p = 0.015,
N = 44),

and

(r = 0.443,

(r = 20.314,

and

scores
(r = 20.383, p = 0.011, N = 43). No correlation between plasma
BDNF and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HamD) scores was
found in control or depressed group.
Next we examined whether the lower BDNF levels observed in
females reflect in their cognitive performance. We did not find any
significant difference in Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-vocab-
ulary (Wais Voc), Elements, Digit Symbol and BNT measure-
ments between males and females (Table 4). However, significant
increases (p,.001) in Total Recall and Delayed Recall values were
found in females as compared to males indicating a better
cognitive performance in these two memory tasks in females.
Relation between Plasma and CSF BDNF Levels
We did not find any significant correlation between plasma and
CSF BDNF levels, when the analysis was done with depressed and
control subjects together (data not shown). However, plasma
BDNF levels showed a significant positive correlation with CSF
BDNF levels in depressed subjects (r = 0.551, p = 0.014, n = 19),
but not in controls. In addition, a significant positive correlation
was found between plasma and CSF BDNF levels in females
(r = 0.601, p = 0.030; N = 13), but not in males, in all subjects.
Discussion
Although BDNF has been well studied for its roles in
neuroprotection and neuroplasticity, recent studies suggest that
BDNF is also involved in energy homeostasis and metabolic
functions. Our results revealed a significant effect of body weight
on plasma BDNF levels in females. Also, plasma BDNF levels were
significantly lower in females indicating gender specific alterations
in circulating BDNF levels.
Our study did not find any change in plasma or CSF BDNF
levels in depressed subjects as compared to controls. In addition,
no significant difference in BDNF levels was found between
subjects who are actively depressed and those in remission,
indicating a lack of plasma BDNF relationship with the severity of
depression. Our observations are not in agreement with many of
the previous findings from preclinical and clinical studies. In
particular, decreases in BDNF levels have been reported in animal
models of depression [22] and BDNF administration has been
shown to produce antidepressant effects [23–25]. In addition,
general physical activity [26] and chronic antidepressant treatment
[27] have been shown to up-regulate BDNF mRNA levels in the
rat hippocampus. Data from clinical studies have reported

reductions in plasma BDNF levels in depressed subjects [28–30].
Moreover, peripheral BDNF levels showed negative correlations
with the severity of depression in many studies [31–33] with the
exception of a few reports showing no significant correlations [34–
35]. The discrepancy between our study and other reports could
be due to many factors such as time of blood withdrawal, time of
storage, food intake before sampling, urbanicity, age, sex, smoking
status and drinking behavior [36–37]. In addition, the present
study examined BDNF levels in the plasma rather than serum
samples from patients and control subjects. It is known that serum
BDNF largely reflects the amount of BDNF stored in circulating
platelets, whereas plasma BDNF may reflect to a larger extent the
steady-state situation and consequently the amount of bioactive
protein [38]. Most of the studies, which found significant
differences in the BDNF levels between depressed and control
subjects have used either platelets or serum samples for BDNF
analysis [28].
An important finding from our study is that plasma BDNF levels
show positive correlations with body weight in all the subjects, but
not in each diagnostic group. BDNF infusion into the rat brain has
been shown to lower body weight and to suppress appetite [39–
40]. In addition, heterozygous BDNF mice exhibit progressive
obesity [41]. The above rodent studies are supported by clinical
evidence that polymorphisms in the BDNF gene are significantly
associated with eating disorders in humans [42–44]. In addition,
BDNF levels in plasma have been shown to decrease significantly
with increasing age or weight in healthy human subjects [45].
These studies suggest an inverse relationship between BDNF and
body weight. According to the above assumptions, we should find
an increase in BDNF levels in females as they have lower body
weight as compared to males in our study. Therefore, the decrease
in plasma BDNF levels in females observed in our study suggests
that changes in peripheral BDNF levels are likely secondary to an
altered
energy
balance.
Consistently,
a
positive
association
between peripheral BDNF and body weight has been found in
women with obesity [46]. Alternatively, peripheral and brain
BDNF levels may be modulated by different regulatory elements
which require further follow up in MDD and control subjects as
well as relevant animal models.
Stress and glucocorticoid hormones are known to impair
cognitive function [47]. Moreover, studies from BDNF heterozy-
gous knockouts and knockdowns revealed impairments in cogni-
tive functions [48] indicating a potential role of BDNF in cognitive
function. Although plasma BDNF levels were lower in female
subjects in our study, these subjects displayed better cognitive

performance in the Total Recall and Delayed Recall tests. In this
regard, BDNF levels have been shown to correlate negatively with
a number of working memory tasks in aged rats, but not young
rats [49]. It is also important to note that peripheral BDNF levels
as determined by routine ELISA methods are poor in differen-
tiating proBDNF and mature BDNF levels. Moreover, studies
have indicated that proBDNF and mature BDNF peptides elicit
opposite cellular responses through the receptors, p75NTR and
TrkB, respectively [50]. Therefore, additional studies using
isoform specific BDNF antibodies as well as additional measure-
ments on cognitive performance are warranted to confirm the role
of peripheral and brain-derived BNDF in cognitive functions.
Since significant changes in plasma BDNF levels were found
only in females, one can speculate that the alterations in plasma
BDNF levels were related to changes in the secretion of estrogens.
Estrogen has been shown to regulate the expression of BDNF, and
estrogen and BDNF have overlapping actions in the brain [51–
52]. Moreover, postmenopausal women exhibit more depressive
behavior [53] and high levels of estrogen enhance associative
memory formation in ovariectomized animals [54]. The average
age of female subjects in our study is 66.15+/?5.3 years. There is
mounting evidence that TrkB is downregulated in specific brain
regions (including CA1 pyramidal neurons and cholinergic basal
forebrain neurons) in mild cognitive impairment [55–56] and
peripheral ganglia during the normal aging process [57–58].
Further studies exploring the relationships between circulating
estrogens and BDNF in the above study subjects would help to
confirm or disregard the role of estrogens in the regulation of
plasma BDNF levels.
In the present study, we observed a significant positive
correlation between plasma and CSF on BDNF levels in depressed
subjects. Few studies have investigated BDNF levels in CSF,
although it has the promise of being the bodily fluid of choice for
biomarker studies to determine brain-specific molecular alterations
and pathological abnormalities [59]. A recent study has demon-
strated a strong relationship between plasma and CSF BDNF
levels in first episode psychosis subjects [60].
Our study has the following limitations. The number of CSF
samples in our study was lower as compared to plasma samples
and therefore, the correlation analysis between plasma and CSF
on BDNF levels was performed only in a small number of matched
samples. Similarly, we were unable to determine the cortisol levels
in plasma samples. Such data would have been helpful to evaluate
the possible role of cortisol in the regulation of BDNF levels in our
study.
In conclusion, the present study reports that plasma BDNF
levels are not different in depressed subjects as compared to
controls, and are not related to the severity of depression. In
addition, plasma BDNF levels are lower in females, and body
weight shows a positive association with BDNF levels in these
subjects. Further assessment of these observations in separate,
larger cohorts is warranted.
Materials and Methods
Ethics
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of
both the Nathan Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research and the
NYU School of Medicine. Participants were all volunteers who
responded to advertisements in local newspapers and flyers. All
subjects provided formal consent before being examined and were
compensated up to $450.
Subjects
Demographic characteristics of the participants are shown in
Table 5. The total number of 133 participants completed the
baseline visit; out of these 133 subjects, a total of 14 participants
were excluded because of evidence in the MRI of confluent deep
or periventricular white matter hyperintensities, defined as one or
more hyperintense lesions measuring at least 10 mm in any
direction, or because of a Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) score
below 28. Out of these 119 remaining subjects, 47 individuals took
part in the optional lumbar puncture procedure in which a CSF
sample for determination of various neurobiological markers,
including cortisol and BDNF, was collected. Of these 47 subjects,
28 were diagnosed with MDD based on clinical evaluation and
SCID for DSM IV, and 19 were controls. Plasma for determi-
nation of BDNF levels was available for 88 subjects out of 119; out
of these 88 individuals, 45 had a diagnosis of MDD and 43 did
not.
Cognitive Tests
Subjects also took part in a neuropsychological evaluation,
which included the following cognitive tests: Vocabulary Subtest of
the WAIS-R [61], Digit-Symbol Substitution subtest of the WAIS-
R, Letter Fluency [62], Category Fluency [63], Boston Naming
Test [64], and the following components of the Buschke Selective
Reminding Task: Total Recall score across seven learning trials,
Delayed Recall after 20 minutes, and Elements defined as the
number of unique incorrect words produced during a recall task
(BSRT) [65–66].

Procedure
This study was conducted over four visits, generally each 1 week
apart. The first three visits were conducted at the Nathan Kline
Institute, Orangeburg, NY and at the Clinical & Translational
Science Institute, NYU Langone Medical Center. During the first
visit, participants were explained the study procedures and
provided informed consent. Also medical and psychiatric history,
and vital signs were obtained at this stage. Subjects also underwent
a psychiatric evaluation, and global cognitive status was assessed
using the MMSE. During visit 2, participants received an MRI
scan of the head to quantify the magnitude of vascular brain
pathology. During the third visit, participants underwent a
comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. During visit 4, for
a subset of our subjects, a lumbar puncture (LP) was performed by
a neuroradiologist. Subjects were required to fast overnight prior
to the lumbar puncture visit, which was performed between 9–
10 AM. After fasting, a total of 15 ml of clear CSF were collected,
centrifuged at 4 degrees C at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes, and stored
at –80 degrees C. For those subjects who did the lumbar
punctures, blood for BDNF assay was drawn in the morning,
under fasting conditions and immediately prior to the LP (Visit 4).
For individuals who chose not to have the LP, blood for BDNF
was also drawn at approximately the same time in the morning
and under fasting conditions, but during the baseline visit (visit 3).
Thus, any correlations between plasma and CSF BDNF levels
pertain to samples drawn at approximately the same time in the
morning and on the same day. Blood samples were centrifuged at
3000 rpm for 30 minutes at 4uC. Plasma was carefully collected
and was stored at 280uC, until used for further analyses.
BDNF Assay
Plasma levels of BDNF were determined with an enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method (BDNF Emax Immunoas-
say System, Promega, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions as described previously [57]. Briefly, 96-well flat
bottom immunoplates were coated with an anti-BDNF monoclo-
nal antibody and incubated at 4uC overnight. After blocking by
non-specific binding with Block & Sample Buffer, standards and
samples were added to the plates and incubated and shaken for
2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, after washing with TBST
wash buffer, plates were incubated for 2 h with Anti-Human
BDNF polyclonal antibody. The last incubation required the
addition of Anti-immunoglobulin Y-horse-radish peroxidase con-
jugate. In the last step of the assay, TMB One solution was added
in order to develop the color. After stopping the reaction with HCl
1 N, the absorbance was read at 450 nm on a microplate reader
and BDNF concentrations were determined automatically accord-
ing to the BDNF standard curve (ranging from 7.8 to 500 pg ml21
purified BDNF). The sensitivity of the assay was 4 pg/ml. All the
samples were analyzed in duplicate in one session by an
investigator blind to experimental set up.
Statistical Analysis
Bivariate correlations (Pearson’s r tests), t-tests and Analyses of
Variance (with control variables; ANCOVA) were performed. All
tests were two-tailed and statistical significance was judged at
a = .05. All analyses were conducted in SPSS 15.0 or PASW 18.0.
