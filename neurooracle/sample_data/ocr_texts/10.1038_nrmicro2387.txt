Abstract
Virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis inhibits apoptosis and triggers necrosis of host macrophages
to evade innate immunity and delay the initiation of adaptive immunity. By contrast, attenuated M.
tuberculosis induces macrophage apoptosis, an innate defence mechanism that reduces bacterial
viability. In this Opinion article, we describe how virulent M. tuberculosis blocks production of
the eicosanoid lipid mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). PGE2 production by infected macrophages
prevents mitochondrial damage and initiates plasma membrane repair, two processes that are
crucial for preventing necrosis and inducing apoptosis. Thus, M. tuberculosis-mediated
modulation of eicosanoid production determines the death modality of the infected macrophage,
which in turn has a substantial impact on the outcome of infection.
As one of the most important bacterial pathogens, Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects and
persists in normal healthy individuals1. The chronic nature of this infection implies that M.
tuberculosis has developed strategies to avoid both the innate and adaptive immune
responses2,3. Manipulation of macro phage death pathways is one of the complex
mechanisms used by M. tuberculosis to evade these host defences.
Subversion of the death modality of macro phages, the principal host cells infected by M.
tuberculosis, is a common feature of several other intracellular pathogens. Various bacteria
and intracellular parasites induce apoptosis or necrosis following infection.
Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella flexneri, Yersinia pestis and
Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium all induce pyroptosis, which is a
form of necrosis that requires caspase 1 activation4,5. S. enterica induces pyroptosis through
the recruitment of ice protease-activating factor (IPAF; also known as NLRC4), an apoptotic
protease-activating factor 1 (APAF1)-related NOD-like receptor protein4,6–9. In general,

caspase 1-knockout mice are more susceptible to infection with these bacteria, suggesting
that pyroptosis leads to pathogen clearance. However, as caspase 1 is crucial for the
processing of mature interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18, two cytokines that are important for
inflammation and host defence, the various consequences of caspase 1 activation are
difficult to dissociate. Nonetheless, the detailed study of these different pathogens is
instructive. For example, virulent S. Typhimurium induces apoptosis in gastrointestinal
epithelial cells, which could prevent inflammation during bacterial penetration of the gut
(Table I). Subsequently, infection of macrophages by S. Typhimurium induces pyroptosis,
which leads to the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, and activates
host immunity. Crucially, the timing of macro phage pyroptosis seems to be modulated by
bacterial virulence factors. By delaying macrophage pyroptosis, S. Typhimurium can
parasitize the macrophage, replicate in a protected niche and use the cell to facilitate
systemic dissemination10. Although stimulation of the host inflammatory response by
pyroptosis is ultimately detrimental to the pathogen, these examples show that the
pathogen’s ability to manipulate the timing of host cell death is sufficient to create
conditions that allow it to establish a systemic infection8.
Pyroptosis might have a crucial role in macrophage defence against M. tuberculosis
infection under certain circumstances, as it has been shown that M. tuberculosis prevents
inflammasome activation and IL-1β processing, which normally lead to improved
mycobacterial clearance and a lower bacterial burden in the lungs of aerosol-infected
mice11. However, it should be noted that macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis
produce IL-1β in a manner that is dependent on bacterial virulence12,13. Furthermore, a
recent study shows that although a major role for IL-1β in host resistance to M. tuberculosis
clearly exists, the production of IL-1β in mice infected with M. tuberculosis can occur by
mechanisms other than caspase 1 and inflammasome activation14.
By contrast, the obligate intracellular parasite Leishmania major, which is transmitted by an
infected sand fly bite, is phagocytosed by neutrophils recruited to the skin. However,
neutrophils are ineffectual at killing L. major and eventually undergo apoptosis. Myeloid
cells, which are also recruited to the site of infection, phagocytose the infected apoptotic
neutrophils15 and, analogous to the Greeks hiding in the Trojan Horse, the parasite gains
entry into the macrophage unannounced16,17. This enables the parasite to undergo
intracellular replication without triggering an innate response. Thus, in this example, the
pathogen takes advantage of apoptotic death to avoid inflammation and detection by the
host’s immune system.
Finally, like M. tuberculosis, several pathogens inhibit macrophage apoptosis, including L.
pneumophila, Coxiella burnetii, Brucella spp., Neisseria spp. and Streptococcus spp.
Although the microbial effectors and host targets have been defined in some cases, the
assumption that the inhibition of apoptosis is a bacterial evasion mechanism has not always
been clearly demonstrated. An exception to this is a study showing that the fates of
macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) differ following L. pneumophila infection18.
Although L. pneumophila inhibits macrophage apoptosis, infected DCs undergo rapid
apoptosis, which is less permissive for bacterial replication. Thus, similarly to M.
tuberculosis, virulent L. pneumophila inhibits macrophage apoptosis and, instead, leads to
necrosis.
Other investigations have shown that the type of macrophage death following infection with
M. tuberculosis determines whether a successful antimycobacterial defence mechanism is
activated. Infection with attenuated M. tuberculosis induces apoptosis19–24. Virulent M.
tuberculosis induces necrosis of both human and mouse macrophages, a property that is not
shared with non-pathogenic mycobacterial species24–26; this allows the bacteria to evade

host defence mechanisms by inducing cellular lysis and spreading of the infection24 (FIG.
1). The concept that virulent M. tuberculosis actively inhibits the induction of macrophage
apoptosis27 is supported by the identification of mutants that induce apoptosis instead of
necrosis28,29.
Thus, the death modality of infected macrophages should be considered an innate defence
mechanism. Dissection of the cellular pathways that are altered by virulent M. tuberculosis
has exposed a key role for host eicosanoid biosynthesis pathways in regulating the death
modality of infected macrophages24–26. Here, we discuss the selective production of specific
eicosanoids that have important functional consequences for the innate control of
intracellular M. tuberculosis infection.
Host lipids modulate macrophage death
Apoptosis and the concomitant antimycobacterial activity of human macrophages can be
triggered by M. tuberculosis through the activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2γ (CPLA2γ;
also known as PLA2G4C), a group IV CPLA2 that catalyses the release of arachidonic acid
from the sn-2 position of membrane phospholipids20. Arachidonic acid and its diverse
products regulate death in several cell types30. This is thought to be due to the fact that
arachidonic acid products are second messengers in tumour necrosis factor-induced
apoptosis31 and the fact that oxygen radicals, which are produced during lipoxygenation of
arachidonic acid, induce the production of reactive oxygen species and are involved in the
induction of cell death32. Arachidonic acid also activates sphingo myelinase, leading to
ceramide production and apoptosis33. However, it is not clear which of these mechanisms
are important in vivo34.
One area of research in this field focuses on the roles of the eicosanoids prostaglandin E2
(PGE2) and lipoxin A4 (LXA4) in the regulation of programmed macrophage death24–26.
The cyclooxygenases COX1 (also known as PTGS1) and COX2 (also known as PTGS2)
convert arachidonic acid into the central intermediate PGH2 35, which is converted by
specific synthases into a diverse range of prostanoids36. Interaction of these prostanoid
species (which include the prostaglandins PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, PGI2 and thromboxane)
with an array of specific prostanoid receptors plays a part in several cellular pathways. In the
case of PGE2, interactions with four PGE2 receptors, EP1, EP2, EP3 and EP4 (also known
as PTGER1, PTGER2, PTGER3 and PTGER4, respectively) trigger intracellular pathways
that either promote or inhibit inflammation37. Importantly, the functional specificity of
PGE2 is largely determined by its interaction with these specific receptors37. EP1 mediates
the elevation of intracellular Ca2+. By contrast, EP2, which is involved in joint inflammation
and neutrophil recruitment, and EP4, which induces cell migration in tumour invasion, are
both involved in the upregulation of intracellular cyclic AMP levels. EP2 activates protein
kinase A (PKA), and EP4 activates adenylyl cyclase and phospho inositide 3-kinase.
Triggering EP3 downregulates cAMP concentrations and is known to mediate fever and
angiogenesis.
Lipid bodies form at distinct cytoplasmic sites following infection of mouse macrophages
with the attenuated strain Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG); these lipid
bodies are the sites of COX2 activity and PGE2 generation38. Indeed, PGE2 production has
been a consistent finding following M. bovis BCG infection of mouse macrophages39.
Macrophages infected with other attenuated M. tuberculosis strains also activate PGE2
production, which prevents necrosis and leads to apoptosis instead26 (FIG. 2a). By contrast,
virulent M. tuberculosis strains, such as M. tuberculosis str. H37Rv or M. tuberculosis str.
erdman, are much weaker inducers of PGE2 production by macrophages26. This raises the
possibility that virulent M. tuberculosis actively inhibits PGE2 production. Thus, an

important strategy that M. tuberculosis exploits to induce or avoid apoptotic cell death is the
subversion of host eicosanoid biosynthesis pathways25,26.
Lipoxins are also generated from arachidonic acid but require the action of different
enzymes, including 5-lipoxygenases and 15-lipoxygenases40. Lipoxins are anti-
inflammatory molecules and modulate chemokine and cytokine expression, monocyte
trafficking and efferocytosis41. In contrast to the attenuated M. tuberculosis str. H37Ra,
which is a weak LXA4 inducer, virulent M. tuberculosis strongly induces the synthesis of
LXA4, which inhibits COX2 production and thus effectively shuts down PGE2
biosynthesis25,26 (FIG. 2b). In a PGE2-poor microenvironment, the macrophage cannot
prevent mitochondrial damage or enable the repair of plasma membrane disruptions
effectively24–26, and both of these processes are required to prevent necrosis and induce
apoptosis25,26. Virulent M. tuberculosis in pre-necrotic macrophages continues to replicate
and, after the cells are lysed, propagates the infection by spreading to uninfected
macrophages. Thus, the balance of PGE2 and LXA4 production by the infected macrophage
regulates the relative amount of apoptosis and necrosis following M. tuberculosis infection
and has important functional consequences for innate control of intracellular M. tuberculosis
infection.
The idea that lipoxin production by M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages is associated with
increased bacterial replication and greater virulence was strengthened by the recent genetic
analysis of zebrafish (Danio rerio) susceptibility to Mycobacterium marinum infection42.
Multiple mutant classes of D. rerio with different innate susceptibilities to M. marinum were
identified42, and a hypersusceptible zebrafish mutant was found with a mutation that
mapped to the lta4h locus, which encodes leukotriene A4 hydrolase (Lta4h), an enzyme that
is required for the final step of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) synthesis. Although Lta4h deficiency
results in the loss of LTB4 production, the addition of LTB4 did not complement the genetic
defect nor increase host resistance. In the absence of Lta4h, its substrate (LTA4)
accumulates and can lead to redirected eicosanoid synthesis and increased lipoxin synthesis.
Therefore, it has been suggested that the increased susceptibility of the zebrafish lta4h
mutant is due to an increase in lipoxin production. The same study presents human genetic
data showing that polymorphisms in the LTA4H gene are associated with susceptibility to
pulmonary and meningeal tuberculosis42. Thus, from fish to humans, the eicosanoids seem
to have an unexpected role in susceptibility to tuberculosis.
Mitochondrial damage and death
The induction of LXA4 by virulent M. tuberculosis inhibits PGE2 production and triggers
the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), leading to irreversible mitochondrial
damage26 (FIG. 3c). By triggering LXA4 production in the host macrophage, virulent M.
tuberculosis inhibits prostanoid production by blocking COX2 mRNA accumulation. By
contrast, attenuated M. tuberculosis induces the synthesis of only minimal amounts of LXA4
and, instead, causes the production of substantial amounts of PGE2. When macrophages are
infected with attenuated M. tuberculosis, PGE2 actively suppresses perturbations of the
mitochondrial inner membrane26 (FIG. 3b).
The MPT shuts down oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a loss of mitochondrial ATP
production and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn results in
necrosis of the infected macrophage43,44 (FIG. 3c). The MPT is accompanied by
permeabilization of the mitochondrial inner membrane and dissipation of the mitochondrial
membrane potential (ΔΨm)44,45. This event is usually irreversible and is frequently
associated with mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP). After
macrophage infection with attenuated M. tuberculosis, a reversible MOMP is triggered,
Behar et al.

leaving the mitochondrial inner membrane intact24,26. This leads to the transient release of
cytochrome c, which results in only moderate activation of caspase 3 and caspase 9, leading
to the induction of apoptosis (FIG. 3b). If macrophages infected with virulent M.
tuberculosis are treated with cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the MPT, cytochrome c release is
substantially reduced46. As cytochrome c release is a consequence of MOMP, this indicates
that during infection with virulent M. tuberculosis excessive MOMP is driven by the MPT.
Cumulatively, these studies suggest that the infection of macrophages with virulent M.
tuberculosis causes mitochondrial inner membrane disruption and irreversible MOMP,
leading to necrosis. By contrast, the transient MOMP caused by avirulent M. tuberculosis
results in apoptosis.
Blocking plasma membrane repair
The interaction of a mycobacterium with a host macrophage results in plasma membrane
microdisruptions. Microdisruptions induced by attenuated M. tuberculosis are rapidly
resealed by plasma membrane repair mechanisms that include recruitment of lysosomal and
Golgi-derived vesicles to the lesions on the macrophage surface25,47,48. Recruitment of these
vesicles to the plasma membrane can be assessed by measuring lysosome-associated
membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1) or α-mannosidase II translocation to the macrophage
surface49,50. Active membrane repair prevents necrosis and is required for the induction of
apoptosis. By contrast, if resealing of the plasma membrane microdisruptions is inhibited, as
is the case with virulent M. tuberculosis infection, necrosis ensues.
Ca2+ sensors are of crucial importance for the recruitment of both lysosomes and Golgi
vesicles to the membrane lesions (FIG. 3b). Gene silencing of the lysosomal Ca2+ sensor
synaptotagmin 7 (SYT7) impairs the recruitment of lysosomes, but not Golgi-derived
vesicles, to the cell surface25,51. The recruitment of Golgi-derived vesicles, which occurs
independently of lysosome recruitment, requires the expression of neuronal calcium sensor 1
(NCS1), a protein that is particularly abundant in the Golgi25,52. Silencing NCS1 expression
or adding brefeldin A, a Golgi-specific transport inhibitor, inhibits translocation of Golgi
vesicles. These data show that both lysosomal and Golgi-derived membranes are involved in
plasma membrane repair and that they are recruited independently to plasma membrane
lesions in infected macrophages (FIG. 3b).
Plasma membrane resealing is cAMP dependent53, and the addition of forskolin, an
activator of adenylyl cyclase, results in greater translocation of lysosomal membranes to the
cell surface25. The protective effect of PGE2 on mitochondrial stability is mediated through
the PGE2 receptor EP226, and PGE2 binding to either EP2 or EP4 causes increased cAMP
accumulation54. Consistent with this, PGE2 treatment of human macrophages infected with
virulent M. tuberculosis str. H37Rv reconstitutes plasma membrane repair mediated by
lysosomal membranes. By contrast, PGE2 does not affect Golgi-mediated repair25. Although
the protective effects of PGE2 on mitochondria require EP2, PGE2-dependent lysosomal
membrane translocation also requires phosphoinositide 3-kinase activation, which indicates
that signalling through EP4 is involved25.
These findings have important functional consequences for the control of intracellular
mycobacterial replication. It was found that arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase-knockout
(Alox5−/−) mice, which are unable to produce LXA4 and other ALOX5-dependent products,
survive longer than wild-type mice after low-dose aerosol infection with virulent M.
tuberculosis55. Conversely, PGE synthase-knockout (Ptges−/−) mice, which are unable to
produce PGE2, succumb earlier than wild-type mice (S.M.B., M.D. and H.R., unpublished
observations). However, as many cell types produce eicosanoids, these results do not
provide information about the role of eicosanoids during innate immunity. In experiments

using macrophages from Ptges−/− and Alox5−/− mice, it was found that Ptges−/− macro
phages were unable to control intracellular M. tuberculosis infection, whereas Alox5−/−
macrophages limited M. tuberculosis replication better than wild-type macrophages25. This
phenotype was replicated in vivo when Ptges−/−, Alox5−/− and wild-type macrophages
infected with M. tuberculosis were adoptively transferred into the lungs of V(D)J
recombination-activating protein 1-deficient (Rag1−/−) mice. Mice that received infected
Alox5−/− macrophages had a substantially lower mycobacterial lung burden than recipients
that received infected Ptges−/− or wild-type macrophages. As Rag1−/− mice lack B cells and
T cells, the greater capacity of Rag1−/− mice to control pulmonary infection following the
transfer of M. tuberculosis-infected Alox5−/− macrophages must be attributed to either an
intrinsic property of Alox5−/− macrophages or a unique interaction between Alox5−/−
macrophages and the innate immune system25.
One conceivable explanation for the role of PGE2 in fostering membrane repair is that PGE2
is required for the generation of SYT7, the lysosomal Ca2+ sensor essential for plasma
membrane repair. As discussed, virulent M. tuberculosis stimulates LXA4 production in
macrophages, which inhibits PGE2 production by downregulating COX2 mRNA
accumulation26. Indeed, it was found that, unlike transcription of Lamp1, transcription of
SYT7 mRNA is specifically induced by PGE2 25. Likewise, Alox5−/− macrophages infected
with virulent M. tuberculosis express more SYT7 than wild-type or Ptges−/−
macrophages25. Collectively, these data indicate that PGE2 is an essential modulator of
SYT7 expression — although it is not known how this modulation occurs — and is therefore
of crucial importance for the prevention of necrosis and induction of apoptosis.
Cumulatively, these studies show that the balance of PGE2 and LXA4 production by
infected macrophages affects the outcome of infection in the microenvironment of the lung.
A new model for pathogenesis
These findings establish causal relationships between the ability of the infected macrophage
to restrict mycobacterial growth and both the protection of mitochondria and the resealing of
plasma membrane lesions. The protection that is promoted by macrophage apoptosis seems
to be based on sequestration of the pathogens in apoptotic bodies. Subsequent phagocytosis
of apoptotic infected macrophages by other uninfected phagocytes could contribute to innate
control of infection; however, the role of efferocytosis in bacterial killing is not well
understood. An additional property of apoptotic macrophages is that the bacterial antigens
that they contain are efficiently cross-presented by DCs, thus promoting a protective T cell
response56 (FIG. 1a). Conversely, by inducing LXA4 production, which blocks PGE2
synthesis, virulent M. tuberculosis causes irreversible mitochondrial damage and inhibits
plasma membrane repair25. Both of these factors contribute to necrosis, which releases M.
tuberculosis from the lysed macrophages into the surrounding tissue, fosters de novo
infection of uninfected bystander macrophages and spreads the infection (FIG. 3c).
Furthermore, pre-necrotic infected macrophages and necrotic ghosts do not engender DC
cross-priming of antigen-specific T cells, which leads to a substantially delayed T cell
response and impairment of antimycobacterial defence mechanisms.
Recent work has identified M. tuberculosis genes that inhibit apoptosis, which supports our
hypothesis that apoptosis is an innate defence mechanism that is actively suppressed by
virulent M. tuberculosis28. However, the induction of necrosis must be a regulated process,
as it would not be advantageous for the bacterium to destroy its niche before it has the
chance to replicate. Therefore, we propose a new model of host–pathogen interaction for M.
tuberculosis infection. We postulate that virulent M. tuberculosis postpones programmed
cell death during the initial phase of intracellular replication to maintain an advantageous
environment for growth. We further suggest that when intracellular conditions are no longer

conducive to bacterial replication, virulent M. tuberculosis uses an active mechanism to
induce necrosis and exit the phagosome and the macrophage (FIG. 3c). Under these
conditions it is crucially important for M. tuberculosis to spread and infect other cells.
Virulent M. tuberculosis induces the production of LXA4 by infected macrophages, which
inhibits COX2 and prostanoid production, leading to a decline in the levels of PGE2 and a
decrease in the expression of PGE2-regulated genes (for example, Syt7), thus impairing
membrane repair by lysosomes. It has been demonstrated that this process leads to plasma
membrane damage, but we propose that the same process also damages the phagosomal
membrane and facilitates bacterial translocation from the phagosome into the cytosol.
Bacterial translocation from the phagosome into the cytosol is a late event occurring 4 days
after infection in human cells57 and even later in mouse macrophages (S.M.B., P. Peters, M.
Skold and N. van der wel, unpublished observations). Virulent M. tuberculosis has been
shown to escape from the phagosome into the cytosol, and we suggest that this is only the
initial step in bacterial exit from the macrophage57.
Although M. tuberculosis has been reported to replicate in the cytosol during the late phase
of infection57, the stage has already been set for the induction of cellular necrosis at this
point. In the absence of PGE2, mitochondrial damage occurs and inhibits the recruitment of
lysosomes to the plasma membrane, leading ultimately to necrosis. As recruitment of Golgi-
derived vesicles to the cell surface is associated with phosphatidylserine flopping and
annexin 1 deposition, two events that are necessary to form the apoptotic envelope, blockade
of the Golgi-mediated repair pathway by virulent M. tuberculosis impairs the formation of
the apoptotic envelope and leads to necrosis. Following necrosis, extracellular M.
tuberculosis can infect other cells to initiate another cycle of replication and necrosis (a
‘boom and bust’ cycle). Although bacterial translocation into the cytosol has been proposed
as an immune evasion strategy that prevents entry of M. tuberculosis antigens into the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II processing pathway57,58, M. tuberculosis
antigens that were translocated into the cytosol would then be more prone to presentation by
MHC class I molecules. We think that, instead of modulating antigen presentation, the
translocation of M. tuberculosis into the cytosol induces macrophage necrosis, functions as
an exit mechanism for the bacterium and ultimately allows M. tuberculosis to infect other
cells.
Our model integrates many experimental findings, but it also raises additional questions.
Although we have concentrated on the early stages of innate immunity, ultimately M.
tuberculosis induces granuloma formation, which is the pathological hallmark of
tuberculosis. During M. marinum infection in zebrafish, early granuloma formation was
shown to be beneficial to bacterial replication42,59. It remains to be determined whether
eicosanoids affect this process, but their pleiotropic effects, including functioning as
chemokines, make it likely that the answer will be yes. By contrast, the formation of
pulmonary granulomas in M. tuberculosis-infected mice is closely associated with the
initiation of T cell immunity60, and mammalian granulomas are widely thought to be
associated with containment of the infection, even if sterilization does not occur. The role of
eicosanoids during these later stages of infection requires elucidation. A better
understanding of their role is important, as it is known that prostaglandins can have both
pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, and some investigators have found that
prostaglandins can impair antimicrobial immunity61,62. In this context, it will be particularly
interesting to determine how eicosanoids affect acquired immunity and whether their effect
on innate immunity influences the development of T cell immunity.

Figure 1. The fate of infected macrophages affects host resistance to Mycobacterium tuberculosis
infection
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects macrophages and then survives and replicates in the
phagosome. Macrophages infected with attenuated strains of M. tuberculosis undergo
apoptosis, a death modality that impairs bacterial replication. Apoptosis of infected
macrophages provides an important link to adaptive immunity, as apoptotic vesicles
containing bacterial antigens are taken up by dendritic cells. The dendritic cells can
efficiently present these antigens to naive T cells, leading to their activation. By contrast,
virulent M. tuberculosis inhibits apoptosis and, instead, induces necrosis. We propose that
damage to the phagosomal membrane facilitates bacterial translocation into the cytosol and
is a precursor to the full-scale induction of macrophage necrosis. Necrosis leads to
intercellular dissemination of M. tuberculosis, as extracellular M. tuberculosis can infect
other macrophages that have been recruited to the lung.

Figure 2. The balance of prostaglandin E2 and lipoxin A4 determine the cellular fate of
macrophages infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis
a | Infection with attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis strongly induces cyclooxygenase 2
(COX2) synthesis, which leads to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. PGE2 has at least
three actions: signalling through PGE2 receptor 2 (EP2; also known as PTGER2) protects
mitochondria from inner-membrane damage and prevents loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential; it also enables the repair of plasma membrane damage, an activity that is probably
mediated by EP4; and it inhibits the production of lipoxin A4 (LXA4). These actions all
prevent necrosis of the infected macrophage and, instead, trigger apoptosis, an innate
defence mechanism. b | Virulent M. tuberculosis strongly induces the production of LXA4,
which prevents the accumulation of COX2 mRNA. Consequently, prostaglandin
biosynthesis falls. Without the protective actions of PGE2, the infected macrophage is more
likely to undergo necrosis, a form of cell death that allows the bacterium to evade innate
immunity and T cell-mediated immunity. AA, arachidonic acid; PGES, PGE synthase (also
known as PTGES). Figure is modified, with permission, from REF. 26 © (2008) The

Figure 3. The antinecrotic action of prostaglandin E2 is mediated through the induction of
membrane repair and the protection of mitochondria
a | In an uninfected macrophage, different Ca2+-regulated sensors are expressed in different
vesicular compartments. Thus, the lysosome contains synaptotagmin 7 (SYT7), and the
Golgi-derived vesicles contain neuronal calcium sensor 1 (NCS1). The mitochondrion has a
double membrane consisting of the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM) and
mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). The mitochondrial intermembrane space contains
pro-apoptotic components, including cytochrome c. The inner leaflet of the MIM is
negatively charged, which leads to specific binding of cationic dyes. b | Membrane
microdisruptions develop during infection with attenuated Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and

the resulting entry of Ca2+ into the cell triggers the recruitment of lysosomes and Golgi-
derived vesicles, both of which act as membrane donors for the repair of membrane damage.
Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is required for membrane repair, because synthesis of the
lysosomal Ca2+ sensor SYT7, which is essential for the recruitment of lysosomes to the
membrane lesions, depends on PGE2. Attenuated M. tuberculosis leads to MOM
permeabilization (referred to as MOMP) but leaves the MIM intact. This allows cytochrome
c to leak into the cytosol and leads to the activation of caspase 9, which contributes to the
activation of caspase 3 and causes apoptosis. c | Infection with virulent M. tuberculosis
induces the production of lipoxin A4, which inhibits the production of cylooxygenase 2 and
effectively prevents prostaglandin biosynthesis. In the absence of PGE2, plasma membrane
microdisruptions remain unrepaired. Concurrently, virulent M. tuberculosis induces MOMP
and permeabilization of the MIM, which parallels the loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential that occurs during necrosis. These conditions trigger macrophage necrosis. We
propose that virulent M. tuberculosis also disrupts the phagosomal membrane and, by
inhibiting membrane repair, facilitates bacterial translocation from the phagosome into the
cytosol, which is a prerequisite for exit from the dying macrophage. Thus, bacterial
inhibition of prostaglandin production is an immune evasion strategy that allows M.
tuberculosis to avoid the detrimental consequences of apoptosis and to exit the macrophage
and propagate the infection.
