Background and purpose:
The spectrum of COVID-19, caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection (SARS-CoV-2), includes diﬀerent
neurologic manifestations of the central and peripheral nervous system.
Methods:
From March through April 2020, in two university hospitals
located in western Switzerland, we examined three patients with Guillain–
Barre syndrome (GBS) following SARS-CoV-2.
Results:
These cases were characterized by a primary demyelinating electro-
physiological pattern (Acute inﬂammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy or
AIDP) and a less severe disease course compared to recently published case
series. Clinical improvement was observed in all patients at week ﬁve. One
patient was discharged from hospital after full recovery with persistence of
minor neurological signs (areﬂexia). Two of the three patients remained hospi-
talized: one was able to walk and the other could stand up with assistance.
Conclusions:
We report three cases of typical GBS (AIDP) occurring after
SARS-CoV-2 infection and presenting with a favourable clinical course. Given
the interval between COVID-19-related symptoms and neurological manifesta-
tions (mean of 15 days) we postulate a secondary immune-mediated mecha-
nism rather than direct viral damage.
The world has been experiencing the outbreak of a
novel infectious agent known as severe acute respira-
tory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is
responsible for the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-
19) [1]. Life-threatening complications described in
SARS-CoV-2-infected patients include acute respira-
tory distress syndrome, acute kidney failure and car-
diac injury [2]. Nonetheless, only few neurological
complications have been described so far [3].
A recent retrospective study performed in the city
of
Wuhan,
China,
reported
that
78/214
patients
(36.4%) with COVID-19 presented with nervous sys-
tem
clinical
ﬁndings:
mainly
dizziness,
headache,
encephalopathy, stroke, smell and taste disorders, and
musculoskeletal injury [4]. Zhao et al. [5] published
the ﬁrst case of a 61-year-old patient presenting with
a rapidly evolving ascending weakness and mild distal
sensory complaints, followed by COVID-19-related
symptoms, leading to the diagnosis of Guillain–Barre
syndrome (GBS). The authors concluded that SARS-
CoV-2 might have triggered GBS in this case, follow-
ing a para-infectious pattern, as described with Zika
virus (ZIKV) infection [6]. A recent series of ﬁve GBS
cases from northern Italy describes a severe disease
course with predominant axonal involvement [7].
We report a series of three cases of typical GBS,
preceded by classic signs and symptoms of biologically
conﬁrmed COVID-19, which were studied in Geneva
and

144 COVID-19 cases were conﬁrmed in Switzerland
and 9,360 in our catchment area.
Materials and methods
Clinical and ancillary test descriptions were personally
retrieved by the authors, who examined the patients.
This report was conducted in compliance with the
Swiss Federal Act on Research involving Human
Beings that waive ethic approval for case reports of
fewer than ﬁve patients.
Case reports
All patients presented with distal paresthesias and
rapidly progressive limb weakness, evolving to either
moderate tetraparesis (2/3) or tetraplegia (1/3) and
areﬂexia (3/3) within the ﬁrst 5 days. One patient
required mechanical ventilation due to respiratory fail-
ure and two underwent functional haemodynamic
monitoring of dysautonomic signs. Additionally, two
patients presented with pain and only one with bulbar
signs
and
facial
biplegia.
Neurological
symptoms
appeared within the ﬁrst 22 days (7, 15 and 22 days)
after the appearance of typical COVID-19-related
symptoms. For clinical details see Appendix S1.
Laboratory ﬁndings showed grade 1 and 2 lym-
phopenia in two out of three patients. Anti-ganglioside
antibodies were negative. Cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF)
analysis showed classic albuminocytological dissocia-
tion in two out of three patients, with a white cell count
of < 4
cell/µl
(additional
results
are
detailed
in
Table 1). Reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reac-
tion (RT-PCR) assay for SARS-CoV-2 of the CSF was
tested in two out of three patients with a negative result.

swab was positive in two cases. The third case showed a
SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion in the serum and the
fourth nasopharyngeal swab was positive. Magnetic
resonance imaging was performed in two patients, and
one disclosed gadolinium enhancement of the lum-
bosacral roots. Nerve conduction studies revealed a
typical
demyelinating
pattern
(3/3)
and
one
case
showed nerve conduction blocks (Table S1), which per-
sisted in an examination conducted one week later.
Needle electromyography was recorded in one patient
showing no abnormal spontaneous activity.
All patients were treated with intravenous immunoglob-
ulin (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days). The clinical outcome was
favourable in one patient who was discharged and able to
walk without assistance (Appendix S1, case 2); another
patient was able to walk 100–200 m with aid (case 3). The
third patient remained bedbound, but was able to rise from
a chair with assistance (case 1).
Discussion
Nerve conduction studies showed a classic demyelinat-
ing pattern (AIDP) in the three patients. This observa-
tion
contrasts
with
previous
publications,
which
reported axonal loss correlating with a more severe
disease course and greater disability at one month [7].
In our cohort, full recovery was observed in one
patient, another one was able to walk with assistance
and the last remained bedridden but was able to rise
to standing up (GBS disability scores at ﬁve weeks
follow-up of 1/6, 3/6 and 4/6, respectively).
The median (range) period between the onset of
COVID-19-related symptoms and neurological com-
plaints was 15 (7–22) days, which was longer than the
interval reported by Toscano et al. (5–10 days) [7]. In
addition, PCR SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in the
CSF of our patients nor in the Italian cohort [7].
These observations support the hypothesis that
SARS-CoV-2 triggers GBS via a secondary immune-
mediated mechanism rather than via direct viral neu-
ropathic damage, as described after ZIKV infection
[6]. Additional clinical data are needed to further elu-
cidate the exact mechanism underlying SARS-CoV-2-
associated GBS.
