Signal peptides (SPs) are short amino acid sequences in the N-terminus of many newly-
synthesized proteins that target their passenger proteins for transfer across, or integration 
into, membranes. Previous tools have been used to predict SPs from amino acid 
sequence, but most cannot distinguish between specific types of signal peptides that 
occur in different organisms. Here, we present a deep neural network-based approach that 
improves SP prediction across all domains of life and distinguishes between three types 
of prokaryotic SPs.  
 
Signal peptides (SPs) are found in a large number of nascent polypeptide chains in 
virtually all organisms and facilitate protein targeting to membrane-embedded export 
machineries in Bacteria1, Archaea2 and Eukaryotes3. SPs are found in secreted or 
transmembrane proteins, as well as proteins that reside inside specific organelles in 
eukaryotic cells. The general secretory pathway (Sec) is found in all domains of life and 
directs protein translocation across the plasma membrane in prokaryotes and the 
endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes. Bacteria, Archaea, chloroplasts and 
some mitochondria also contain another major pathway termed Tat (Twin-Arginine 
Translocation). This pathway recognizes generally longer and less hydrophobic SPs that 
have a distinctive pattern usually containing two consecutive arginines (R-R) in the N-
terminal region4. In contrast to the Sec pathway, which transports proteins in an unfolded 
state, the Tat pathway actively translocates folded proteins across the lipid membrane 
bilayer.  
 
During or after translocation through the membrane, a signal peptidase removes the SP. 
For the most well-known type of SPs, this enzyme is called Signal Peptidase (SPase) I or

3 
LepB in Bacteria, and orthologs of it are found in Archaea and in Eukaryotes, where it 
constitutes the only signal peptidase operating at the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. 
Bacterial lipoproteins are cleaved by a second signal peptidase, termed Signal Peptidase 
II or Lsp, which cleaves SPs that contain a conserved ‘lipobox’ in their C-terminus. This 
motif contains a cysteine immediately following the CS5. This cysteine site is found in 
both Bacteria and Archaea (although the actual SPase II has not been identified in 
Archaea6) and is vital to membrane anchoring7. Lastly, prokaryotic Type IV pilins are 
typically cleaved by a third signal peptidase, known as SPase III or prepilin peptidase 
(PilD) in bacteria and PibD in Archaea8. While bacteria contain Sec substrates that can be 
processed by SPase I, SPase II or SPase III, Tat substrates are only processed by SPase I 
or II. 
 
Many algorithms to predict the presence of SPs and the location of their cleavage sites 
from amino acid sequences have been developed. SignalP was among the first publicly 
available methods9, and has attracted a large number of users. Since then, several updates 
to this software have been published. While version 19 was based on artificial neural 
networks, version 210 additionally introduced hidden Markov models; version 311 
enhanced the cleavage site predictions, and version 412 improved the discrimination 
between signal peptides and transmembrane helices. However, all previous versions have 
only been capable of predicting Sec-translocated SPs cleaved by SPase I; to predict Tat 
translocation or SPase II cleavage, more specialized tools were needed. Some of these 
methods are indeed appropriate only for one type of SPs (e.g. Sec/SPII or Tat/SPI) and 
thus cannot differentiate between all three classes (Supplementary Table 1).

Here, we present SignalP 5.0, a deep Neural Network-based method combined with 
Conditional Random Field classification and optimized transfer learning for improved SP 
prediction. The deep recurrent Neural Network architecture is better suited for 
recognizing sequence motifs of varying length, such as SPs, than traditional feed-forward 
Neural Networks. The Conditional Random Field imposes a defined grammar on the 
prediction and obviates the need for the post-processing step used in earlier versions of 
SignalP. Finally, the transfer learning makes it possible to obtain a decent performance 
also on small divisions of the dataset, notably the archaeal sequences (see Online 
Methods for details). 
 
SignalP 5.0 distinguishes three types of signal peptides in prokaryotes: Sec substrates 
cleaved by SPase I (Sec/SPI), Sec substrates cleaved by SPase II (Sec/SPII), and Tat 
substrates cleaved by SPase I (Tat/SPI).  SignalP 5.0 cannot identify Tat substrates 
cleaved by SPase II, although these are known to exist13. Nor have we been able to 
construct a sufficiently large dataset of SPase III-cleaved proteins for training a machine 
learning method and therefore our algorithm is not able to identify SPaseIII processed 
Sec substrates.  
 
We trained and tested SignalP 5.0 on four groups of organisms (Eukaryotes, Archaea, 
Gram-positive bacteria, and Gram-negative bacteria) and four types of proteins: Sec/SPI, 
Sec/SPII, Tat/SPI and ‘Other’ (globular proteins without SP and transmembrane (TM) 
proteins with an experimentally verified TM segment within the first 70 amino acids

5 
(AAs)). In total, the training data consisted of 20,758 proteins (Supplementary Table 2). 
After collecting the protein sequences, we clustered them using CD-HIT14 at 20% 
sequence identity. The dataset was homology-partitioned into five sets. Each set had the 
same distribution of organisms and types of proteins. For each protein, the AAs were 
encoded using the normalized BLOSUM6215 matrix such that each position in the 
sequence became a vector of length 20 containing the AA substitution probabilities. The 
labels for each AA were: Sec/SPI signal, Tat/SPI signal, Sec/SPII signal, outer region, 
inner region, transmembrane in-out, transmembrane out-in, SPI CS and SPII CS (Online 
Methods). 
 
We benchmarked SignalP 5.0 against 18 SP prediction algorithms–as many as currently 
are available either as web-servers or standalone packages (Supplementary Table 1). 
One particular method, Signal-BLAST16, essentially does a BLAST17 database look-up 
rather than a prediction from scratch and we observed that most of the proteins in our 
benchmark datasets were correctly predicted because they were identical to one of the 
proteins in Signal-BLAST’s reference database. Because its performance therefore would 
be artificially high, Signal-BLAST was excluded from our benchmark (Supplementary 
Note 1)  
 
Prediction performance for all SP detection algorithms was measured using the Matthews 
Correlation Coefficient (MCC)18, where both true and false positive and negative 
predictions are counted at the sequence level.  We used precision and recall to assess 
Cleavage Site (CS) predictions, where precision is defined as the fraction of CS

6 
predictions that are correct, and recall is the fraction of real SPs that are predicted as the 
correct SP type and have the correct CS assigned.  
 
SignalP 5.0 achieved an overall MCC of 0.938, 0.907, 0.890 and 0.966 for predicting 
Sec/SPI SPs for Archaea, Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and Eukaryotes 
respectively. When tested on Sec/SPII SPs, SignalP 5.0 achieved MCCs of 0.956, 0.960 
and 0.957 for Archaea, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. Finally, 
on Tat/SPI SPs, SignalP 5.0 had MCCs of 0.977, 0.981 and 0.868 for Archaea, Gram-
negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively (Supplementary Table 3). In 
Supplementary Table 4, we demonstrate SignalP 5.0’s discrimination performance on 
the different types of signal peptides with a confusion matrix, which shows the numbers 
of real and predicted examples in each class of sequences. Regarding CS precision, 
SignalP 5.0’s performance varies between 0.630 and 0.970, whereas its CS recall varies 
between 0.579 and 0.970 (Supplementary Table 5).  
 
To demonstrate the reliability of SignalP 5.0, we studied the probability distribution of 
correct and incorrect predictions. Prediction confidence was assessed by examining the 
probabilities of the most likely class predicted by the model from the AA sequences 
(Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Fig. 1).  
 
A common problem in CS prediction is that experimental data used to train prediction 
algorithms can have erroneous or uncertain annotations. To account for this uncertainty, 
we considered a window of one, two and three AAs around the annotated CS position,

7 
assuming that, if the annotation was incorrect, the correct position should be nearby. We 
reported a correct prediction if the predicted CS was within that window. The same was 
done for all other methods that were used in our benchmark (Supplementary Note 2 and 
Supplementary Fig. 2).  
 
To construct an independent benchmark set for comparing the performance of SignalP 
5.0 against all other prediction methods, we did a 20% homology reduction with CD-HIT 
between our training dataset and the dataset used for training the most recently published 
method, DeepSig19 (which used SignalP4’s training dataset). The result was a reduced 
benchmark dataset of 8,811 proteins (derived from the 20,758 proteins of the training 
dataset). While the benchmark set is independent with regards to eukaryotic and bacterial 
Sec/SPI data, this is not the case for the Sec/SPII, Tat/SPI and archaeal datasets, where 
many proteins were directly obtained from the training datasets of specialized predictors. 
In Supplementary Table 2, we report the constitution of the datasets for each organism 
type and category, both for training and for comparison.  
 
Given that some methods were designed for a specific type of SPs and that not all 
methods run on all organism groups, we carried out three separate benchmarks (Sec/SPI, 
Sec/SPII and Tat/SPI SPs). Furthermore, because SignalP 5.0 is the only method capable 
of simultaneously predicting all types of SPs, each benchmark was run twice: first with 
only the respective SP type as ‘positive’ dataset and TM/Globular proteins as ‘negative 
dataset’ and then with adding the two remaining SP types to the ‘negative’ dataset. 
Importantly, the performance of SignalP 5.0 is measured on a cross-validated mode,

8 
unlike the methods specialized for archaeal, Sec/SPII or Tat/SPI prediction, which 
contained some (or many) of the proteins of the benchmark already in their respective 
training datasets. 
 
Benchmarks results are summarized in Figs 1-2 and Supplementary Tables 7-12. 
SignalP 5.0 has the best SP discrimination across all organisms in the Sec/SPI 
benchmark, with the exception of Gram-positive bacteria where it ranks second after 
SignalP 4.1 (Supplementary Table 7 and Fig. 1).  It also has the highest CS recall in 
Eukaryotes and Bacteria, and the second highest CS recall in Archaea after PRED-
SIGNAL20, which, however, is a specialized method, trained on archaeal sequences only. 
Finally, Regarding CS precision SignalP 5.0 achieved the highest CS precision across all 
organisms compared with all existing methods (Supplementary Table 8 and Fig. 1).  
 
The performance of the otherwise quite successful methods Philius21, Phobius22 and 
SPOCTOPUS23 on eukaryotic data was notably poorer than previously reported12. The 
reason for this discrepancy is that, in the current benchmark dataset, the number of 
eukaryotic SPs is much lower than in the previous study12 (210 now versus 3,462 before), 
which makes the eukaryotic part of the evaluation dataset much more imbalanced than 
before. Finally, the performance of TOPCONS224, which is the only consensus method 
tested in our benchmark, is high in Bacteria, but not in Archaea or Eukaryotes, where it 
ranks below average. For CS predictions, it is clear that the consensus method is not 
ideal, but this was also not within the intended scope of this tool (Supplementary Tables 
7-8 and Fig. 1).

9 
  
In the Sec/SPII SPs benchmark, SignalP 5.0 had superior performance across all metrics 
for all organisms, outperforming methods that were designed and optimized specifically 
for this this particular type of SPs (Supplementary Tables 9-10 and Fig. 2).  
 
 SignalP 5.0 performs as well as PRED-TAT25 and TATFIND26 for predicting Tat/SPI 
SPs in Archaea and Gram-negative bacteria, although PRED-TAT has better prediction 
performance in Gram-positive bacteria. PRED-TAT achieved the highest CS recall in 
Bacteria, while SignalP 5.0 displayed the best CS prediction in Archaea. SignalP 5.0 
demonstrated superior CS precision compared with PRED-TAT in Archaea and Gram-
positive bacteria, although PRED-TAT achieved the highest CS precision in Gram-
negative bacteria. TATFIND does not make CS predictions, and could therefore not be 
evaluated. When including Sec/SPI and Sec/SPII SPs in the ‘negative’ dataset, SignalP 
5.0 performs as well as PRED-TAT in Archaea and has the highest CS prediction scores 
in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Supplementary Tables 11-12 and Fig. 2).  
 
We used SignalP 5.0 to annotate two well-annotated reference proteomes; Escherichia 
coli (strain K12) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (strain ATCC 204508 / S288c) (Baker's 
yeast). In both cases, SignalP 5.0 accurately detects all but one experimentally verified 
Sec/SPI SPs.  The analysis also identified potentially new SPs, with high probability, 
which may be interesting candidates for verification (Supplementary Note 3). Not only 
is SignalP 5.0 capable of predicting proteome-wide SPs across all organisms; it can also

10 
classify them into Sec/SPI, Sec/SPII and Tat/SPI SPs, in most cases better than 
specialized predictors.

Online Methods  
 
Sequence data 
 
For eukaryotic and bacterial Sec/SPI signal peptides, we relied on the UniProt 
Knowledgebase release 2018_0427.  Only reviewed entries (i.e. from 
UniProtKB/SwissProt) were used, and hypothetical proteins were not included. We 
discarded protein sequences shorter than 30 amino acids and we only considered signal 
peptides which had experimental evidence (ECO: 0000269) for the cleavage site. Gram-
positive bacteria were defined as Firmicutes plus Actinobacteria. We did not include 
Tenericutes (Mycoplasma and related genera) since they do not seem to have a type I 
signal peptidase at all28. Gram-negative bacteria were defined as all other bacteria. All 
sequences were shortened to the 70 N-terminal AAs. For archaeal Sec/SPI signal 
peptides, we added the (few) experimentally verified proteins from SwissProt to the ones 
from the PRED-SIGNAL method.

15 
For Tat/SPI signal peptides, we relied on a combination of the training set of the PRED-
TAT method (which had experimentally verified Tat proteins for Gram-negative and 
Gram-positive bacteria) together with the ‘Twin arginine translocation (Tat) signal 
profile’ (PS51318) entry from the PROSITE database29. The status of PROSITE matches 
against Swiss-Prot entries is manually assessed during the curation process. Swiss-Prot 
curators evaluate the quality of the match according to the match score, the likelihood of 
the protein to contain such a domain and the appearance in other members of the protein 
family. The ‘positive’ status does not necessarily mean that the presence of the domain 
has been experimentally proven, but rather that the protein most probably contains such a 
domain according to the evaluation of the curators. For Archaea, we used proteins that 
were identified in the literature as being Tat/SPI (from the PRED-SIGNAL datasets) 
together with proteins belonging to the PS51318 entry of PROSITE.  
 
A similar strategy was followed for the collection of the Sec/SPII dataset, where we used 
the respective PROSITE entry (‘Prokaryotic membrane lipoprotein lipid attachment site 
profile’ - PS51257), together with experimentally verified lipoproteins, taken from the 
PRED-LIPO30 datasets. It should be noted that there was no overlap between the lists 
from these two PROSITE entries, i.e. we found no examples of proteins that belonged to 
both the Tat/SPII group. 
 
We must stress here that, as it can be seen from Supplementary Table 1, the number of 
Sec/SPI signal peptides is relatively low as compared to the Tat/SPI and Sec/SPII types. 
This is due to the fact that, for Tat/SPI and Sec/SPII signal peptides, we relied mainly on

16 
the PROSITE annotation and the PRED-TAT, PRED-SIGNAL and PRED-LIPO 
datasets, whereas, for Sec/SPI signal peptides, we used the annotation from UniProt. In 
2014, UniProt adopted new evidence ontology. Before the change, an annotation was 
regarded as experimental if it lacked qualifiers such as ‘Potential’, ‘Probable’ or ‘By 
similarity’; after the change, only annotations with a specific literature reference are 
annotated as being experimental (evidence code ECO:0000269). If we compare the 
number of experimental Sec/SPI SPs between the current version of SwissProt and the 
2014_09 version (the last one before adopting the new scheme), then we observe 1,371 
Eukaryotic, 280 Gram-negative and 118 Gram-positive Sec/SPI SPs that have lost their 
‘experimental’ status (i.e. are missing the ECO: 0000269 annotation). SignalP 5.0 
identifies 1,338/1,371 (97.59%) of the Eukaryotic Sec/SPI SPs and, of them 1,089 with a 
correct CS position (79.43%). In Gram-negative bacteria, the corresponding numbers are 
222/280 (79.29%) for identification of Sec/SPI SPs and 195/280 (69.64%) for correct CS 
prediction. Finally, in Gram-positive bacteria, 105/118 (88.98%) of them were correctly 
identified, and 85/118 (72.03%) were found to have the same CS as the annotated one. 
These results are quite close to the overall performance of SignalP 5.0, indicating that 
these proteins could be correct SPs; however, we could not trust their experimental status, 
which is why we did not include them. 
 
For transmembrane (TM) proteins, we relied on the TOPDB31 database, which contains 
topological models of TM proteins based on either structural data (where there is 
interplay with the PDB_TM32 database) or other experimental techniques, such as fusion 
with reporter enzymes, glycosylation studies, protease accessibility, immunolocalisation,

17 
etc. If a TM protein was found to also contain an SP, then this protein was classified 
under the SP dataset. 
 
Finally, we collected a globular proteins dataset, again from UniProt 2018_04, i.e. 
proteins with a subcellular location annotated as cytosolic (cytosolic, nuclear, 
mitochondrial, plastid, and/or peroxisomal in eukaryotes) and not belonging to the 
secretory pathway with experimental evidence (note that UniProt uses the term 
‘cytoplasm’ for cytosol).  
 
Methods for comparison  
In addition to the previous version of SignalP (SignalP 4.1), 17 other methods were 
selected for comparison of predictive performances Supplementary Table 2. Most of the 
methods were downloaded and run locally on our computers or through their respective 
websites. For the methods Signal-3L 2.033, Signal-BLAST, Signal-CF34 and SPEPlip35, 
we wrote Perl scripts to automate the process of submitting a sequence and collecting the 
results. Signal-BLAST was eventually excluded from the benchmark (Supplementary 
Note 1). 
 
SignalP 5.0 model architecture  
SignalP 5.0 has three main novelties compared to previous versions: a) a powerful deep 
learning architecture36 b) optimization using transfer learning37 between multiple 
prediction tasks and c) Conditional Random Field (CRF) classification 38,39.

18 
Deep Learning Model 
The deep learning model (Supplementary Fig. 3), is composed of three primary 
components: 1) one-dimensional convolutions akin to learnable non-linear PSSMs, 
capturing short range correlations, 2) bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)40  
cells capturing long range sequence dependencies and 3) a Conditional Random Field 
(CRF) for predicting the class labels. 
 
Transfer and multimodal learning 
Deep learning models require relatively large amounts of data in order to train the models 
without overfitting and, as described above, we collected a dataset substantially larger 
than datasets previously used to successfully train Deep Learning models on protein 
sequences (see. e.g. Armenteros et al.41 or Zhou & Troyanskaya42). However, some of the 
categories still had limited amounts of data available (Supplementary Table 2). To 
improve performance in organism groups with little data (notably Archaea), SignalP 5.0 
utilizes transfer learning between taxonomic groups as well as multimodal learning 
predicting several related tasks using the same model. We trained a single unified model 
for Archaea, Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and Eukaryotes, which 
improves performance on the low-data task since the model can learn generally useful 
features across all taxonomic groups. To inform the model about which taxonomic group 
a protein belongs to, we input an additional four-dimensional indicator vector into the 
LSTM cells of the model. To further improve performance, we employ multimodal 
learning, predicting both the individual amino acid labels as well as the global signal 
peptide type. Overall, transfer learning and multimodal learning means that, instead of

having eight models, each specialized to one group and one task, we use a single model 
that works for all the groups and performs both predictions at once.

where h = h1 . . . hT is the output of the core neural network model directly below the

Due to the chain structure, inference can be carried out exactly using dynamic 
programming in O(TC2)43. During training, where (x, y) is observed, we need to compute 
Z(h) for each training sequence as part of the likelihood p(y|x). During prediction, where 
only x is observed, we can calculate either the most probable sequence argmaxy p(y|x) 
(using the Viterbi decoding algorithm) or the marginal probabilities p(yt |x), t = 1, . . . , T. 
To make a single global prediction of whether a signal peptide is present or not in a 
protein, we take the average of the marginal probabilities across the sequence (nine 
classes: Sec/SPI signal, Tat/SPI signal, Sec/SPII signal, outer region, inner region, 
transmembrane in-out, transmembrane out-in, Sec SPI/Tat SPI cleavage site and Sec/SPII

20 
cleavage site) and perform an affine linear transformation into four classes (Sec/SPI, 
Sec/SPII, Tat/SPI, Other),

, so as to get the logit of a categorical 
distribution over the presence or not of a signal peptide. To predict the location of the 
cleavage site, we use Viterbi decoding, since this ensures that a predicted sequence of 
signal peptide positions is always followed by prediction of a cleavage site. 
 
 
Neural Network structure and optimization details 
In this section, the neural network structure is described in more detail. The model is 
described sequentially going from the protein sequence input to predictions where the 
output of a layer is used as input for the next: 
1. 1D convolution with 32 filters and a kernel width of three. 
2. Bidirectional LSTM with 64 hidden units in the forward and backward models. 
To include the taxonomic group information in the model, a four-dimensional 
group indicator vector is concatenated to the input of the LSTM cells as illustrated 
in Supplementary Fig. 3.  
3. 1D convolution with 64 filters and kernel widths five. 
4. 1D convolution with nine filters (matching the number of position-specific 
classes) and kernel widths one. 
5. Conditional Random Field for predictions. We calculate both the individual 
marginal probabilities of the labels at each position using the forward-backward 
algorithm and the global most likely label assignment for the entire sequence 
using Viterbi decoding. To predict the global label of the protein sequence, we

21 
average the marginal probabilities across the sequence producing a 9x1 vector. 
We linearly map that vector to a 4x1 vector followed by a softmax function 
producing the global label prediction. 
We used ReLu activation functions in all fully connected and convolutional layers and 
dropout was used to avoid overfitting44. The loss function consists of the sum of two 
terms, one for the individual amino acid label predictions and one for the global protein 
label prediction. Both terms are the cross-entropy between the predicted label distribution 
and the true observed label. All parameters were optimized using Stochastic Gradient 
Descent (SGD) on the loss function with mini batches of size 128 and a learning rate of 
0.005. We optimized hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization45 and five-fold nested 
cross-validation. The inner four folds were used to train four different models, each using 
three folds as training data and one fold as validation data, identifying thus the best set of 
hyperparameters (learning rate, LSTM hidden units, number of convolutional filters, 
convolutional filter width). After optimization, the fifth fold was used to assess the test 
performance and the procedure was repeated using each of the five folds as the test set. 
The advantage of this approach is that we obtain an unbiased test performance for the 
whole dataset at the expense of having to train 5x4 models. All the experiments were run 
using the Tensorflow library46. 
 
The incorporation of the aforementioned techniques improves the performance of SignalP 
5.0 on both the signal type and the cleavage site prediction. Supplementary Table 6 
shows a comparison of the performance on the total training set (20,758 proteins) of the 
model using CRF and the organism group information, the model without the group

22 
information and the model without CRF. The four models achieve similar performances, 
even though there are some differences worth mentioning. Regarding signal peptide 
detection, the CRF does not improve the performance considerably. However, its use is 
beneficial for the cleavage site prediction, where the difference in performance is 
significantly higher. Regarding the use of transfer learning, it is clear that the models 
without this feature are the ones with the worst performance on the signal peptide 
detection. For instance, on archaeal proteins, the model has a performance of 0.913, 
while, for the model that utilizes transfer learning, the performance climbs to 0.966.

Supplementary Figure 1 
Boxplot of the probability of the predicted class for correct and incorrect predictions 
A probability close to 1 means a highly reliable prediction. For Archaea, Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative the probability threshold is
0.25, as there are four possible classes (Sec/SPI, Tat/SPI, Sec/SPII and Other). For Eukarya this threshold is 0.5, as it has only two
classes (Sec/SPI and Other). A probability close to this threshold means a very unreliable prediction. All classes, namely Sec/SPI,
Tat/SPI, Sec/SPII and Other are combined in this plot.

The special case of Signal-BLAST 
Signal-BLAST runs BLAST against a pre-constructed database of signal peptides, and, if it finds 
a hit with high similarity, it essentially conducts a database look-up (current version of Signal-
BLAST uses Uniprot  2017_6 as reference). Because of that, we sought to find out how many of 
the proteins in our datasets fall under the “look-up” category. Interestingly, out of the 7,457 
proteins in Eukaryotes, modes (parameter sets) 1, 2 and 3 of Signal-BLAST find 7,444 /7,457 
(99.8%) with 100% identical sequence in the reference database, and only mode 4 is different 
with 3,160 /7,457 (42.4%). In this benchmark, the overall MCC of modes 1, 2 and 3 was almost 
equal to 1.0, while for the mode 4 it merely reached 0.145. In Archaea, out of 182 proteins, there 
are 126 (for modes 1, 2 and 3) or 109 (from mode 4) proteins with a 100% identity, which 
translates into 69.2% or 59.8% of the total proteins in this set. In Gram-negative bacteria, out of 
783 proteins, there are 723 (for modes 1, 2 and 3) or 684 (from mode 4) proteins with a 100% 
identity in the reference database (constituting 92.3% or 87.4% of them). Finally, in Gram-
positive bacteria, out of 389 proteins, there are 343 (for modes 1, 2 and 3) or 324 (from mode 4) 
proteins with 100% identity to one of the proteins in the reference database, i.e. 88.2% or 83.2% 
of them. Based on this finding, the Signal-BLAST method was not included in our benchmark, 
since its predictive performance would be artificially high. Signal-BLAST further exemplifies 
that the idea of using sequence similarity alone is probably not suited for the task of SP 
prediction, since, if no homology is found, then the prediction performance is very low.

Supplementary Note 2 
Signal peptide classification and Cleavage Site prediction reliability 
We observed that correctly classified proteins have a prediction confidence close to 1, even 
though some outliers were present. The median of these probabilities for Archaea, Gram-positive 
bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and Eukaryotes is 0.996, 0.995, 0.997 and 0.999 respectively. 
In contrast, incorrectly classified proteins have wider probability distributions, ranging between 
0.4 and 1.0. The median of these probabilities for Archaea, Gram-Positive, Gram-Negative and 
Eukaryotes is 0.914, 0.707, 0.800 and 0.788, respectively, highlighting the lower prediction 
confidence of incorrect predictions.  
CS prediction performance for Tat/SPI and Sec/SPI proteins increased across all domains in 
relation to window size (Supplementary Figure 2). For Eukaryotes, recall increases from 0.802 
to 0.923 when considering a window of three amino acids, indicating that a high proportion of 
the erroneous predictions are within 3 AAs of the annotated CS position. We can therefore 
conclude that, when predicting the SPase I CS with SignalP 5.0, we can be highly confident that 
the real CS will be located in a window of three AAs around the predicted CS. For Sec/SPII SPs, 
the cleavage site performance is very high and is not improved by considering a wider window, 
reflecting that the SPase II CS is dependent on the presence of a cysteine residue.

Proteomic analysis using SignalP 5.0 
For Escherichia coli, UniProt reports 498 proteins with a SP, 137 of which are experimentally 
verified and 361 predicted by various ways. Out of the 137 SPs, 122 are Sec/SPI, 11 are Sec/SPII 
and 4 are Tat/SPI SPs. SignalP 5.0 predicts 612 SPs in total, out of which 414 Sec/SPI, 161 
Sec/SPII and 37 Tat/SPI. When we compare the UniProt annotated SPs to the SignalP 5.0 
predicted ones, we observe that SignalP 5.0 detects 136/137 experimental SPs, together with 
their respective type (misses one Tat/SPI SP). Regarding CS prediction, 131/137 are predicted to 
have precisely the same CS, whereas, 5/137 are within the ±3 window. 
The respective analysis for Saccharomyces cerevisiae is as follows: UniProt annotation reports 297 
proteins, 37 of which are experimentally annotated and 260 are predicted by various ways. 
SignalP 5.0 predicts 314 Sec/SPI SPs in total. When we compare the UniProt annotated SPs to 
the SignalP 5.0 predicted ones, we observe that SignalP 5.0 detects 36/37 experimental SPs. 
Regarding CS prediction, 29/37 are predicted to have precisely the same CS, while, a further of 
2/37 are within the ±3 window.  
These two analyses show us that SignalP 5.0’s confident predictions can potentially help towards 
a better annotation of proteomes.

Supplementary Table 11. Benchmarking of Tat/SPI signal peptide detection predictions. The highest 
performance values have been highlighted in bold. ‘MCC1’ refers to signal peptide vs non-signal peptide 
detection when the positive dataset is comprised by Tat/SPI SPs and the negative dataset by 
TM+Globular proteins only; ‘MCC2’ refers to signal peptide vs non-signal peptide detection when the 
positive dataset is comprised by Tat/SPI SPs and the negative dataset by Sec/SPI SPs, Sec/SPII SPs, TM 
and Globular proteins.
