Abstract
Objective—This study sought to determine whether the family environment moderates
psychosocial outcomes after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in young children.
Method—Participants were recruited prospectively from consecutive hospital admissions of 3-6
year old children, and included 19 with severe TBI, 56 with complicated mild/moderate TBI, and 99
with orthopedic injuries (OI). They completed four assessments across the first 18 months post-
injury. The initial assessment included measures of parenting style, family functioning, and the
quality of the home. Children’s behavioral adjustment, adaptive functioning, and social competence
were assessed at each occasion. Mixed model analyses examined the relationship of the family
environment to psychosocial outcomes across time.
Results—The OI and TBI groups differed significantly in social competence, but the family
environment did not moderate the group difference, which was of medium magnitude. In contrast,
group differences in behavioral adjustment became more pronounced across time at high levels of
authoritarian and permissive parenting; among children with severe TBI, however, even those with
low levels of permissive parenting showed increases in behavioral problems. For adaptive
functioning, better home environments provided some protection following TBI, but not over time
for the severe TBI group. These three-way interactions of group, family environment, and time post
injury were all of medium magnitude.

Conclusions—The findings indicate that the family environment moderates the psychosocial
outcomes of TBI in young children, but the moderating influence may wane with time among children
with severe TBI.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the most common causes of death and long-term
disability in children (Kraus, 1995). Nearly half a million children 0-14 years of age sustain
TBI requiring medical care each year in the United States (Langlois et al., 2006). Among
survivors, the consequences of TBI in children include physical disabilities, deficits in
cognitive and academic skills, and problems in school performance, behavioral adjustment,
adaptive functioning, and socialization (Anderson et al., 2006; Ewing-Cobbs et al., 2004a;
Schwartz et al., 2003; Stancin et al., 2002; Yeates et al., 2004).
Research strongly suggests that the effects of pediatric TBI are age-dependent. Younger
children are particularly vulnerable, with deficits most apparent when TBI are sustained prior
to school age (Anderson et al., 2005; Ewing-Cobbs et al., 1997, 2006). Researchers have
speculated that younger children display poorer outcomes because they are more susceptible
to the diffuse brain insult that accompanies severe TBI and its effects on post-injury skill
development (Ewing-Cobbs et al., 1997, 2004b; Taylor & Alden, 1997).
Although TBI appears to be associated with especially poor outcomes in young children at a
group level, substantial variability in outcomes is evident across individual children (Anderson
et al., 2005, 2006; Catroppa, Anderson, Morse, Haritou, & Rosenfeld, 2008). Research
therefore has begun to focus on factors that predict individual differences in outcomes among
young children with TBI. Injury severity is a consistent predictor, but does not account for
most of the variance in outcomes (Anderson et al., 2005, 2006; Catroppa et al., 2008; Taylor
et al, 2008).
In older children, pre-injury environmental factors have been shown to account for variability
in outcomes following TBI, over and above injury severity. Indeed, the pre-injury family
environment not only accounts for individual differences, but also is an important moderator
of the outcomes of TBI in school-age children, such that the deleterious effects of TBI are
buffered by better family environments and exacerbated by poorer family environments
(Taylor et al., 2002; Yeates et al., 1997, 2002). However, research on the outcomes of TBI in
young children has largely neglected to assess outcomes relative to the family and home
environment, despite evidence from the study of normal development showing that the
influence of parenting and the home environment is especially potent in younger children
(Collins, Maccoby, Steinberg, Hetherington, & Bornstein, 2000).
The relative importance of injury severity and the home environment as predictors of outcomes
following TBI in young children may depend on the type of outcome under consideration. In
school-age children, injury severity often accounts for similar amounts of variance in both
cognitive and behavioral outcomes. However, the two types of outcomes are not strongly
correlated, suggesting that their remaining variance may not be accounted for by the same
influences (Fletcher et al., 1990). In general, research in school-age children suggests that the
family environment is more strongly related to behavioral than cognitive outcomes (Taylor et
al., 2002; Yeates et al., 1997, 2002). This may not hold true for young children sustaining TBI,
however, given the heightened importance of parenting and the home environment for
cognitive development at younger as compared to older ages (Landry, Smith, & Swank,
2003).

We recently presented data on acute cognitive and school-readiness outcomes of TBI in young
children based on a prospective, longitudinal study conducted at several hospitals in the
midwest United States (Taylor et al., 2008). Participants included 3-6 year old children
hospitalized for complicated mild to severe TBI, as well as a comparison group of children of
like age hospitalized for orthopedic injuries (OI). Injury severity consistently predicted
cognitive and school-readiness outcomes assessed 6 months post-injury, and environmental
factors helped account for individual differences, but only limited evidence was found for
environmental factors as moderators of cognitive or early academic outcomes relative to
children with OI.
Young children with TBI are known to display psychosocial deficits, and their psychosocial
functioning is also related to socioeconomic status and family functioning (Anderson et al.,
2006; Catroppa et al., 2008), but we are not aware of any studies that have specifically examined
the potential moderating influence of the home environment. Therefore, the primary goal of
the current study was to extend our previous findings by examining psychosocial outcomes
and the potential moderating influence of the pre- and early post-injury home environment in
the same sample of participants. At an initial assessment shortly after injury, we obtained
retrospective ratings of pre-injury parenting style and general family functioning, and also
assessed the concurrent quality of the home environment. We also obtained retrospective
ratings of children’s pre-injury behavioral adjustment, adaptive functioning, and social
competence. Post-injury assessments of the latter psychosocial outcomes were then obtained
every 6 months out to 18 months post injury. Unlike the previous cross-sectional analysis,
therefore, we were able to use growth curve modeling or mixed model analyses to examine
whether the home environment was a predictor of variations in children’s longitudinal
trajectories of psychosocial outcomes following TBI.
We hypothesized that young children hospitalized for TBI would display deficits in behavioral
adjustment, adaptive functioning, and social competence relative to children with OI only. The
deficits were predicted to be most pervasive in children with severe TBI and to become more
pronounced across assessments, based on previous research with both preschool and school-
age children showing that psychosocial functioning following TBI tends to worsen over time
(Anderson et al., 2006; Catroppa et al., 2008; Fay et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2002). We also
expected that psychosocial outcomes would be worse for children from environments
characterized by less effective parenting, worse family functioning, and poorer quality homes
(Anderson et al., 2006). Most importantly, we predicted that such environments would
exacerbate the negative psychosocial consequences of TBI and, conversely, that environments
characterized by more effective parenting, better family functioning, and higher quality home
environments would be associated with less deleterious outcomes (Taylor et al., 1999, 2002;
Yeates et al., 1997).
We also anticipated that the moderating influences of the pre-injury family environment might
vary over time. If the effects of TBI on psychosocial outcomes worsened with time as expected,
then the moderating influence of the family environment might become easier to detect at the
later assessments, especially if the effects of the family environment on psychosocial
functioning only manifest themselves gradually. On the other hand, the moderating influence
might be strongest at the 6-month assessment, which was closest in time to the assessment of
the family environment; this would be especially likely if the family environment itself actually
changed in response to children’s injuries, because of potential bidirectional influences
between psychosocial outcomes and parenting or family functioning (Taylor et al., 2001).

Method
Study Design
The data for the current analyses were drawn from a larger parent study that used a concurrent
cohort, prospective, and longitudinal design in which children ages 3 to 6 years of age
hospitalized for either TBI or OI were followed for approximately 18 months post injury
(Taylor et al., 2008). Following recruitment, which occurred shortly after injury when children
were medically stable, children and caregivers completed an initial assessment, most often at
the hospitals where the children received care for their injuries. Additionally, a home visit was
conducted to assess the quality of the home environment. Three follow-up assessments were
then conducted at 6, 12, and 18 months post-injury. At all occasions, child and caregiver
assessments were conducted in tandem, and included parent interviews and ratings regarding
child and family functioning, tests of children’s cognitive abilities, and video-taped parent-
child interactions.
Participants
Participants were recruited from consecutive inpatient admissions to three tertiary care
children’s hospitals and a general hospital in the Midwestern United States, all of which had
Level 1 trauma centers. All children aged between 3 years and 6 years, 11 months and admitted
for TBI or OI from 2003-2006 were considered for potential participation. Children were
excluded from consideration if child abuse was documented as a cause of injury, the primary
spoken language in the home was other than English, or if they had a previous history of autism,
mental retardation, or neurological disorder.
Children were eligible for the TBI group if they sustained a blunt trauma to the head requiring
overnight admission to the hospital and had either a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS, Teasdale &
Jennett, 1974) score < 15, suggesting altered neurological status, or evidence for TBI-related
brain abnormalities from computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Consistent with previous investigations (Anderson et al., 2006; Fletcher et al., 1990; Taylor et
al., 1999), a GCS score of 8 or less defined a severe TBI. Complicated-mild to moderate TBI
was defined as a GCS score of 9-12 with or without abnormal neuroimaging or a higher GCS
score with abnormal neuroimaging. The GCS score assigned to the child was the lowest one
recorded post-resuscitation. Because the focus of this study was on children with complicated-
mild to severe TBI, a small group of children with uncomplicated mild TBI was excluded from
analysis. Inclusion in the OI group required a documented bone fracture in an area of the body
other than the head that required an overnight hospital stay, and the absence of any evidence
of loss of consciousness or other findings suggestive of TBI.
The study was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating hospitals and
informed consent was obtained from parents or legal guardians prior to participation. A total
of 206 children (23 severe TBI, 64 complicated mild/moderate TBI, 119 OI) and their
caregivers were enrolled in the study. Recruitment rates for families who were contacted were
somewhat higher for the TBI group as a whole than for the OI group (53% vs. 35%). In both
groups, the most common reasons for non-participation were a lack of interest or not having
time for the study. Participants and non-participants did not differ on sex, race, age at injury,
or census-based estimates of neighborhood income. For the purposes of this paper, children
were included only if they had data for all relevant predictors and completed at least one of the
6, 12, or 18 month post-injury assessments. The final sample therefore included 174 children,
with 19 severe TBI, 56 complicated mild/moderate TBI, and 99 OI. Children included in the
analyses did not differ from those who were excluded in sex, race, age at injury, neighborhood
income, or maternal education.

As shown in Table 1, the TBI and OI groups did not differ on a variety of demographic variables.
The only exception was maternal education, which was lowest in the severe TBI group and
highest in the OI group. The groups also did not differ on retrospective ratings of behavioral
adjustment or social competence. Unexpectedly, the groups did differ significantly on
retrospective ratings of adaptive functioning, with lower scores in the severe TBI group.
However, data collected via parent interviews failed to suggest group differences in pre-injury
developmental status as assessed by special education services or prior concerns about the
child’s development, behavior, or learning.
Table 2 lists injury characteristics and acute cognitive ability for the groups. The time between
injury and initial assessment was shorter for the OI group (range = 8 to 70 days) than for the
TBI groups (range = 10 to 116 days across both groups). This difference likely reflected our
willingness to extend recruitment somewhat beyond the desired window (i.e., 3 months post
injury) so as to maximize enrollment of children with TBI. Most of the injuries in the TBI and
OI group were due to transportation or falls, consistent with national trends for young children
(Langlois et al., 2006). Transportation-related injuries were significantly more common in the
TBI groups than in the OI group. The groups differed in their mean New Injury Severity Score
(NISS, Osler et al., 1997), defined as the sum of the squares of the Abbreviated Injury Scale
(AIS) scores for each child’s three most severely injured body regions. Post-hoc tests indicated
higher NISS for the severe and complicated-mild/moderate TBI groups compared with the OI
group. The groups also differed in mean “non-head-injury” NISS, computed as the NISS minus
the AIS for the head region; the severity of injuries to regions other than the head was higher
in the OI group than in the TBI groups. Finally, the groups differed in mean cognitive ability
as measured on the Differential Abilities Scale (Elliott, 1990) at the initial assessment, with
the severe TBI group showing the lowest functioning.
Procedure and Measures
At the initial assessment, which typically took about 3 hours, the children’s primary caregivers
completed retrospective ratings of pre-injury parenting style and general family functioning,
as well as children’s pre-injury behavioral adjustment, adaptive functioning, and social
competence. Caregivers also participated in a home visit during which a concurrent measure
of the quality of the home environment was completed. The time between injury and home
visit was shorter for the OI group (m = 38.69 days, sd = 19.16, range = 4 to 109 days) and
complicated-mild/moderate TBI group (m = 41.60 days, sd = 19.40, range = 12 to 96 days)
than for the severe TBI group (m = 60.61 days, sd = 43.29, range = 7 to 188 days). Post-injury
ratings of the children’s psychosocial outcomes were then obtained from caregivers at 6, 12,
and 18 months post-injury. For 96% of the participants, mothers were the informants at all
assessment occasions; in only two cases did the informant change over time.
Family Environment—Three measures of the family environment were used as predictors
of psychosocial outcomes. The measures were intended to assess parenting style, overall family
functioning, and the quality of the home environment. Preliminary analyses revealed
significant, but modest correlations among the variables (i.e., rs from .38 to -.43). The OI and
TBI groups did not differ on any of the measures.
Parenting style was assessed using the Parenting Practices Questionnaire (Robinson,
Mandleco, Olsen, & Hart, 1995). This 62-item rating scale assesses three dimensions of
parenting style, consistent with Baumrind’s (1971) characterization of authoritarian,
authoritative, and permissive parenting. The scales for each dimension represent composites
of subscales derived through factor analysis. For the purposes of the current study, we used
total scores for each dimension. The measure has shown satisfactory reliability and validity in
previous research (Robinson et al., 2001).

The 12-item General Functioning subscale of the McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD-
GF, Byles, Byrne, Boyle, & Oxford, 1988; Miller, Bishop, Epstein, & Keitner, 1985) was used
to assess family functioning. The measure has shown satisfactory reliability and validity in
previous research (Byles et al., 1988; Miller et al., 1985) and is related to outcomes of TBI
(Taylor, Yeates, Wade, Drotar, & Klein, 1999). For this study, the scores from the General
Functioning Scale were standardized across the entire sample (m = 0, sd = 1). Consistent with
the scaling of the original scores, high scores reflect worse family functioning.
The quality of the home environment was assessed using The Home Observation for Measures
of the Environment (HOME, Bradley & Caldwell, 1984; Caldwell & Bradley, 1984), which
was administered at children’s homes by trained research assistants. The HOME involves a
combination of parent interview and direct observations of parent-child interactions and play
or learning materials in the home to assess the extent to which the home environment is
conducive to positive interactions with children and supportive of their development. The
HOME has shown satisfactory reliability and validity in predicting children’s cognitive and
social/emotional development (Bradley & Caldwell, 1984; Caldwell & Bradley, 1984). In this
study, reliability was assessed by having two research assistants complete the HOME
independently for approximately 5% of the home visits. Inter-rater agreement was satisfactory
(r = .92). The total score from the HOME was used in the current study.
Psychosocial Outcomes—Psychosocial outcomes were assessed using measures designed
to assess behavioral adjustment, adaptive functioning, and social competence. Behavioral
adjustment was assessed using the preschool (for children < 6 years of age) and school-age
(for children 6 or older) forms of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Rescorla,
2000; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001). The CBCL is a well-known rating scale that was
standardized on a large sample of community and clinic-referred children. It has demonstrated
satisfactory reliability and validity in previous research, although it has not always been
sensitive to the effects of childhood TBI (Fletcher et al., 1990, 1996). For the current study,
behavioral adjustment was measured using the total T score from the CBCL (M = 50, SD =
10).
The infant/preschool (for children < 6 years of age) and school-age (for children 6 or older)
versions of the Adaptive Behavior Assessment System-Second Edition (ABAS) were used to
assess adaptive functioning (Harrison, & Oakland, 2003). The ABAS is a standardized
questionnaire that assesses children’s ability to manage the demands of daily life in multiple
settings (e.g., home and school). Overall adaptive functioning is summarized by the General
Adaptive Composite, which is expressed as a standard score (M = 100, SD = 15). The ABAS
demonstrates good reliability and has been shown to be sensitive to developmental differences
and clinical disorders (Harrison, & Oakland, 2003; Oakland & Harrison, in press).
The Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales-Second Edition (PKBS-2; Merrell, 2002)
and the Home and Community Social and Behavior Scales (HCSBS; Merrell & Caldarella,
2002) were used to assess social competence. The PKBS and HCSBS are similar in structure
and content, but are normed for younger (ages 3-6 years) and older (ages 5-18 years) children,
respectively. For the purposes of this study, parents of children younger than 6 years of age
completed the PKBS and those with children ages 6 or older completed the HCSBS. Both
measures have demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity (Lund & Merrell, 2001;
Merrell, 1996; Merrell & Boelter, 2001; Merrell, Streeter, & Boetter, 2001). For this study, we
used the social competence composite from each measure. To enable comparisons across
measures, the corresponding summary scores from each measure were transformed to z scores
with a M of 1 and SD of 0 (i.e., those from the PKBS-2 for children 3 to 5 years and those from
the HCSBS for children 6 years and older). The two sets of z scores demonstrated substantial

correlations across time, supporting the assumption that they provide equivalent measures of
social competence.
Statistical Analysis
Raw group means and standard deviations for the three primary dependent variables (CBCL,
PKBS/HCSBS, ABAS) at 6, 12, and 18 months post-injury are presented in Table 3. This data
was subjected to general linear mixed model analyses to examine the prediction of psychosocial
outcomes over time as a joint function of injury severity and the family environment. Three
analyses were conducted, one for each of the three measures of psychosocial outcome that
served as the dependent variables in the analyses (i.e., CBCL Total T score; ABAS General
Adaptive Composite standard score; PKBS/HCSBS social competence composite z score). All
analyses included the following covariates: retrospective ratings of pre-injury functioning on
the dependent variable in question, obtained at the baseline assessment; child’s race (white vs.
non-white); child’s sex; child’s age at injury; family socioeconomic status (SES); primary
caregiver intimate relationship status (partner in the home vs. no partner in the home); and test
version (all three measures of psychosocial outcomes had different versions for younger versus
older children). SES was defined in terms of maternal education and median income for the
census tract in which the family’s residence was located; a composite was computed by
averaging the sample z scores for the two variables.
Given these covariates, we estimated the effects of the following predictors: injury severity
(two dummy variables, one comparing the severe TBI and OI group and another comparing
the complicated-mild/moderate TBI and OI group); FAD-GF scale; HOME total score; total
scores for authoritarian, authoritative, and permissive parenting styles from the Parenting
Practices Questionnaire; and a linear term for time post injury. Because data were available at
only three time points (6, 12, and 18 months post-injury), the model did not include a parameter
representing the quadratic rate of change (i.e., nonlinearity). The initial model also included
all interactions involving group, time since injury, and each of the measures of the family
environment. Subjects were considered a random effect, so that each subject was initially
modeled with independent slopes and intercepts with respect to time. After fitting an initial
model, we reduced model complexity to achieve the most parsimonious model. We followed
an iterative process, eliminating predictors for which the F tests for fixed effects were not
significant, starting with three-way interactions, and then re-estimating the model before
examining lower-level interactions and, finally, main effects. For any significant interaction,
all of the main effects and lower-level interactions upon which the significant interaction was
based were retained in the model.
Effect sizes were computed by standardizing all continuous predictors (M = 0, SD = 1) other
than time since injury, which was centered at 6 months, and obtaining parameter estimates
based on the final mixed model for each dependent variable. The resulting coefficients are akin
to standardized regression coefficients for continuous predictors and to standardized mean
differences (e.g., d) for categorical variables. Because standardized regression coefficients can
be scaled to correlations (Cohen, 1988), we used conventional definitions of effect size for
correlations to characterize the magnitude of the standardized parameter estimates for
continuous predictors and interactions involving only them (i.e., 0.1 is small, 0.3 is medium,
and 0.5 is large). Likewise, we used conventional definitions of effect size for mean differences
to characterize the magnitude of parameter estimates for categorical predictors and any
interactions involving them (i.e., 0.2 is small, 0.5 is medium, 0.8 is large).

Results
Behavioral Adjustment
The analysis of the CBCL, summarized in Table 4, revealed significant three-way interactions
between group membership, parenting style, and time post injury. Specifically, the interaction
of group, permissive parenting, and time was significant, as was the interaction of group,
authoritarian parenting, and time. The interaction involving authoritarian parenting was
significant and medium in magnitude for both the severe TBI and moderate TBI groups
(standardized estimates =.49 and .43, respectively). The interaction involving permissive
parenting was medium in magnitude for the severe TBI group (standardized estimate = -.43)
but small and not significant for the moderate TBI group (standardized estimate = .22). To
illustrate the interactions, mean CBCL total scores were estimated for children with low and
high levels of permissive (or authoritarian) parenting (i.e., those who were 1 or more standard
deviations above or below the overall sample mean for the respective parenting measures). As
Figure 1 shows, high levels of permissive parenting were associated with larger group
differences in behavioral adjustment than lower levels; however, this did not hold true across
time in the severe TBI group, which showed increases in behavioral problems even at lower
levels of permissive parenting. The relationship of authoritarian parenting to behavioral
adjustment was somewhat different. Figure 2 shows that high levels of authoritarian parenting
were associated with less pronounced group differences initially, but with considerable
worsening of behavioral adjustment among the TBI groups over time; in contrast, low levels
of authoritarian parenting predicted a decline in group differences over time, especially for the
complicated-mild/moderate TBI group.
Neither of the other aspects of the family environment (i.e., HOME, FAD-GF) interacted with
group membership to predict behavioral adjustment. Better family functioning as measured by
the FAD-GF was associated with better behavioral adjustment, but primarily at the final
assessment 18 months post-injury, as reflected in a small but significant FAD-GF X time
interaction (standardized estimate = .11). The HOME was not a significant predictor of
behavioral adjustment.
Several covariates were significant predictors of behavioral adjustment, all with relationships
that were small in magnitude. Children with more premorbid behavioral problems had higher
post-injury ratings on the CBCL (standardized estimate = .69), as did those whose parents were
of lower socioeconomic status (standardized estimate = - .08) or did not have intimate partners
in the home (standardized estimate = -.25). Parent ratings were also higher on the preschool
version of the CBCL than on the school-age version (standardized estimate = -.16).
Adaptive Functioning
In the analysis of the ABAS General Adaptive Composite (see Table 4), the interaction of
group membership, the HOME, and time post injury was significant. The interaction was
medium in magnitude for the severe TBI group (standardized estimate = -.52) but not
significant for the moderate TBI group (standardized estimate = .18). We estimated mean
ABAS General Adaptive Composite scores for children into those with low and high scores
on the HOME to illustrate the interaction. Figure 3 shows that lower quality home environments
were associated with increases in group differences in adaptive functioning over time for those
with complicated-mild/moderate TBI; for the severe TBI group, differences were initially more
pronounced for children from lower quality homes, but this did not hold true over time. Neither
parenting style nor family functioning were predictors of children’s adaptive functioning, either
as main effects or in interaction with group membership or time post injury.

Several covariates predicted adaptive functioning, with effects that were small to large in
magnitude. Children with better premorbid adaptive functioning had higher post-injury ratings
on the ABAS (standardized estimate = .59), as did those whose parents had lower
socioeconomic status (standardized estimate = -.13). Parent ratings were also higher on the
school-age version of the ABAS than on the preschool version (standardized estimate = .41).
Social Competence
Social competence as measured by the PKBS/HCSBS composites was not moderated by the
family environment (see Table 4). The group main effect was significant, largely because the
severe TBI group displayed lower social competence than the OI group. The difference was
of medium magnitude (standardized estimate = -.53). However, the group difference was not
moderated by any of the measures of the family environment. Social competence was predicted
by higher levels of authoritative parenting (standardized estimate = .16) and lower levels of
permissive parenting (standardized estimate = -.15), but these small to medium relationships
did not vary across groups or time. Neither family functioning nor the quality of the home
environment was associated with social competence.
Social competence was also related to several covariates, with small to large effect sizes. Post-
injury ratings on the PKBS/HCSBS were higher in children with better premorbid social
competence (standardized estimate = .44) and among those whose caregivers had intimate
partners in the home (standardized estimate = .28). Parent ratings were also higher on the
HCSBS than on the PKBS (standardized estimate = .24), and increased with time post-injury
(standardized estimate = .19).
Discussion
The findings indicate that the family environment accounts for significant variance in
psychosocial outcomes following TBI in young children. The family environment was an
independent predictor of behavioral adjustment and social competence across groups, but not
of adaptive functioning (i.e., CBCL and PKBS/HCSBS, but not ABAS). More specifically,
better family functioning predicted better behavioral adjustment at 18 months post-injury,
authoritative parenting predicted better social competence across time, and permissive
parenting predicted worse social competence across time; and these relationships held true for
both children with TBI and those with OI. Consistent with previous research (Anderson et al.,
2006; Catroppa et al., 2008), the results provide support for the notion that the family
environment is an important predictor of young children’s functioning after TBI, and must be
considered along with injury-related variables in predicting psychosocial outcomes.
Even more critically, the findings are consistent with our hypothesis that the family
environment is a significant moderator of the impact of TBI. The family environment
moderated group differences in behavioral adjustment and adaptive functioning, but not in
social competence (i.e., CBCL and ABAS, but not PKBS/HCSBS). More specifically,
parenting style moderated behavioral adjustment, with more pronounced effects of TBI seen
among children whose parents reported higher levels of permissive and authoritarian parenting;
and the quality of the home environment moderated adaptive functioning, with more
pronounced group differences tending to be seen among children from lower quality homes.
These findings extend existing research, which has not specifically examined the moderating
influence of the family environment on the outcomes of young children with TBI. Given the
low probability of detecting interactions in non-experimental research designs (McClelland &
Judd, 1993), the presence of multiple significant interactions, all of which were of a similar
nature, argues strongly for the existence of a complex interplay between the damaged brain
and its environmental context during recovery from TBI in young children.

Notably, the moderating effect of the family environment varied as a function of multiple
factors, including injury severity, time post injury, the specific dimension of the environment
under consideration, and the type of outcome assessed (Taylor & Alden, 1997). With regard
to injury severity, the moderating effects of the family environment were most consistent for
children with complicated mild to moderate TBI, whose psychosocial function worsened over
time in the context of more permissive and authoritarian parenting and lower quality home
environments. In contrast, the moderating role of the family environment actually appeared to
wane across time for children with severe TBI, who consistently showed deficits in
psychosocial functioning by 18 months post-injury regardless of the family environment,
despite early variability in outcomes attributable to the family environment. In a previous study
of children sustaining TBI in later childhood, the moderating effects of the family environment
were most apparent for those with severe TBI (Taylor et al., 2002; Yeates et al., 1997, 2002).
The contrast between these findings suggest that children who sustain severe TBI at a young
age may be less able to overcome the deleterious effects of those injuries than older children,
even in the context of a supportive family environment. In contrast, young children with less
severe TBI may be more likely to offset the effects of their injuries in a supportive environment,
but are vulnerable to deleterious effects in less positive environments.
The moderating role of the family environment also varied as a function of time since injury.
For instance, high levels of authoritarian parenting were associated with better behavioral
adjustment at 6 months post injury, but with worse adjustment at 18 months. This result
suggests that authoritarian parenting may suppress behavior problems initially following TBI
in young children, but is not effective and may actually exacerbate problems over the longer
term. More broadly, the finding suggests that the moderating influence of the family
environment can change over time, presumably depending on the status of children’s recovery
from TBI and corresponding changes in how environmental contingencies help shape their
behavior.
The role of the family environment also may vary according to the specific dimension of the
environment being considered. In the current study, parenting and the quality of the home
environment were more consistently related to psychosocial outcomes than was global family
functioning. This may reflect a stronger influence of parenting style and the quality of the home
environment than of family functioning on children’s psychosocial development (Gottfried &
Gottfried, 1984). Another possibility is that the influence of family functioning is largely
indirect, and actually mediated by its impact on parenting and the stimulation offered by the
home environment. Statistical analyses of complex causal models would be needed to
differentiate among these competing explanations.
With regard to outcome measures, injury severity helps account for both cognitive and
behavioral outcomes in this sample, but the family environment is more closely related to the
behavioral outcomes assessed in this study than to the cognitive outcomes reported previously
(Taylor et al., 2008). Family risk factors also have been found to exacerbate the psychosocial
outcomes associated with prematurity and very low birth weight (Breslau, 1995), but are less
predictive of other developmental outcomes (Bendersky & Lewis, 1994; Hack et al., 1992). A
possible explanation for these related findings is that cognitive functioning in young children
depends primarily upon the integrity of the central nervous system following a neurological
insult like TBI, and hence is less affected by the family environment. In contrast, psychosocial
outcomes are likely to depend not only on the integrity of the central nervous system, but also
on the many environmental influences on behavior. Future research is needed that expands on
the current findings by investigating more discrete psychosocial outcomes than the broad-based
measures examined in this study.

Although the focus of this study was the moderating influence of the family environment on
psychosocial outcomes following TBI in young children, we should acknowledge that children
who suffer traumatic injuries not involving the brain may also be vulnerable to psychosocial
difficulties. Moreover, the degree to which they are at risk may be related to the severity or
nature of their injuries (Stancin et al., 2001). In the current study, very few of the children with
orthopedic injuries suffered severe injuries requiring multiple surgeries or resulting in
disfigurement or significant physical disability. However, such children are probably at more
risk of psychosocial difficulties, and their outcomes may also be moderated by the family
environment in a manner akin to that shown in the current study to characterize children with
TBI.
The current study is characterized by several shortcomings. First, analyses were constrained
to an examination of linear change post-injury because of the limited number of time points at
which outcome data were collected. Future studies should involve data collection at more than
three time points, to increase the reliability with which linear change is estimated as well as to
permit modeling of non-linear change. Measurement issues are also a potential concern in the
current study. The ratings of parenting style and family functioning were provided by parents,
who also completed ratings of psychosocial outcomes. Thus, shared rater variance may have
inflated the correlations found between those predictors and outcomes; however, this should
not have confounded the assessment of the moderating effects of the family environment, as
long as the inflation due to shared rater variance was similar for both the TBI and OI groups.
Another measurement limitation was the use of different test versions for children of different
ages. On all three measures of psychosocial functioning, some children were rated using the
preschool version of the test while others were rated using the school-aged version. Test version
was included as a covariate in data analyses, thereby controlling for consistently higher ratings
on the preschool version of all three measures. However, we cannot be certain whether
differences in test versions had inadvertent effects on group comparisons.
Another weakness is that the family environment was only measured once, shortly after the
injury. An alternative explanation for the apparent decline in the moderating influence of the
family environment among the severe TBI group is that the family environments of children
with severe TBI may be more subject to change as a consequence of the injury, and thus the
early post-injury family environment may become less predictive with time for those children.
Future studies are needed to explore the potentially bidirectional relationships over time
between the family environment and children’s psychosocial outcomes (Taylor et al., 2001).
A related concern is that the study also did not take into account the potential influences of
educational, rehabilitative, and other treatment services. A significant proportion of children
with TBI received services outside the home, and such services could have influenced both
family functioning and children’s psychosocial outcomes, potentially reducing the impact of
the pre-and early post-injury family environment, perhaps especially in the severe TBI group.
Attempting to assess the impact of these services is fraught with difficulty, because their
provision is inevitably confounded with injury severity in the context of a naturalistic study.
However, we acknowledge that they could affect the relationship between the pre- and early
post-injury family environment and children’s subsequent psychosocial outcomes.
Despite these weaknesses, the results of the current study have important clinical implications.
They suggest that rehabilitation programs should devote resources not only to the child who
has suffered a TBI, but also to the child’s family. To the extent that the family environment is
related to psychosocial outcomes, and actually moderate the effects of TBI, rehabilitative
interventions should involve efforts to assess parenting skills and home environments, identify
families that are at risk, and foster more effective parenting and the provision of
developmentally-appropriate stimulation at home. We have previously shown in this sample
that TBI results in a disruption of reciprocity in parent-child interactions, so that the usual

positive benefits of warm, responsive parenting are less apparent for young children with TBI
(Wade et al., 2008). Recent studies with parents of children with very low birth weight have
shown that these parenting behaviors can be increased through intervention resulting in
improved cognitive development (Smith, Landry, & Swank, 2005). These findings suggest
that parenting interventions could be adapted to improve developmental outcomes following
TBI in young children (Wade, Oberjohn, Burkhardt, & Greenberg, in press).
