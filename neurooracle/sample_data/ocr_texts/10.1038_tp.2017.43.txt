Evidence demonstrates that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of major depressive
disorder (MDD). Precursor-BDNF (proBDNF) and mature BDNF (mBDNF) have opposing biological effects in neuroplasticity, and the
tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA)/plasmin system is crucial in the cleavage processing of proBDNF to mBDNF. However, very
little is known about the role of the tPA–BDNF pathway in MDD. We examined serum protein concentrations in the tPA–BDNF
pathway, including tPA, BDNF, tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), proBDNF and p75NTR, obtained from 35 drug-free depressed
patients before and after 8 weeks of escitalopram (mean 12.5 mg per day) or duloxetine (mean 64 mg per day) treatment and 35
healthy controls using sandwich ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) methods. Serum tPA and BDNF and the ratio of
BDNF/proBDNF were signiﬁcantly lower in the MDD patients than in controls, whereas TrkB, proBDNF and its receptor p75NTR were
higher. After 8 weeks of treatment, tPA, BDNF and proBDNF and the BDNF/proBDNF ratio were reversed, but p75NTR was higher
than baseline, and TrkB was not signiﬁcantly changed. tPA, BDNF, TrkB, proBDNF and p75NTR all yielded fairly good or excellent
diagnostic performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 40.8 or 0.9). Combination of these ﬁve
proteins demonstrated much better diagnostic effectiveness (AUC: 0.977) and adequate sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 88.1% and
92.7%, respectively. Our results suggest that the tPA–BDNF lysis pathway may be implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD and the
mechanisms underlying antidepressant therapeutic action. The combination of tPA, BDNF, TrkB, proBDNF and p75NTR may provide
a diagnostic biomarker panel for MDD.

INTRODUCTION
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common
psychiatric disorders, with a lifetime risk of 20–25% for women
and 7–12% for men.1 The World Health Organization suggests that
depression will be the foremost contributor to the worldwide
burden of disease by 2030.2 However, the pathophysiology of this
disease is still poorly understood. Treatments are not satisfactory
and are often delayed in their onset and afﬂicted with side effects.
Recently, the neurotrophin hypothesis has received signiﬁcant
attention, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of
the
most
important
neurotrophic
factors
that
is
widely
measured.3–6 The hypothesis proposes that decreased neuro-
trophic signaling is a major factor underlying the pathophysiology
of depression,
and its restoration
underlie
the
actions of
antidepressant treatment.
Studies have reported that BDNF expression levels were
signiﬁcantly decreased in the brains of rats exposed to stress
paradigms,7 but they were increased by chronic tranylcypromine,
sertraline, desipramine and mianserin treatment.8 It has also been
reported that BDNF was lower in the brains of suicidal depressed
patients.9,10 BDNF has an important role in neuron survival,
neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity.11,12 BDNF arises from a
glycosylation precursor, precursor BDNF (proBDNF), which is
proteolytically cleaved to produce mature BDNF (mBDNF).13 The
tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)/plasmin system is the most
signiﬁcant protease involved in the cleavage of proBDNF.14,15
According to the ‘yin-yang neurotrophin hypothesis’,13 mBDNF
binds predominantly to tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB)
receptors that have anti-apoptotic properties and inhibit long-
term depression. However, proBDNF, in binding preferentially to
p75NTR, has opposite effects on mBDNF and favors neuronal
apoptosis
and
long-term
depression.
Thus,
the
proteolytic
processing of proBDNF by the tPA/plasminogen system represents
a powerful means of regulating the direction of BDNF action that
in turn could be implicated in MDD pathogenesis and in the
mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs.13,16 However, very
little is known about the role of the tPA–BDNF pathway in
depression. The diagnosis of MDD is now based on relatively
subjective assessments of symptoms. The development of reliable
diagnostic tests using biomarkers could aid in the diagnosis of
MDD. Compared with a single marker, multiple biomarkers may
reduce
the
impact
of
variation
between
populations
and
subgroups. Serum protein of BDNF and its regulators have also
been reported to be involved in depression.17–21 However, the
diagnostic efﬁcacy of combining these proteins is still unknown.
The aim of this study was (i) to evaluate whether serum protein
levels of BDNF and its regulators in the tPA–BDNF pathway,
including tPA, BDNF, TrkB, proBDNF and p75NTR, are altered in
drug-free MDD patients and to observe their putative changes
during antidepressants treatment; (ii) to observe whether these
proteins could serve as biomarkers for MDD diagnosis and
treatment responsiveness; and (iii) to assess the associations

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The study was approved by the Human Participants Ethics Committee of
ZhongDa Hospital of Southeast University. The trial was registered on the
Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (www.chictr.org.cn) and the identiﬁer is
ChiCTR-OCH-13003133. All the subjects were given informed consent.
Thirty-ﬁve inpatients with MDD (11 males and 24 females; average
43.97 ± 13.33 years old) were recruited at the Afﬁliated ZhongDa Hospital
of Southeast University from July 2013 to March 2015. The patients met the
diagnostic criteria for MDD according to the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders-IV criteria. Before entering the study, all
patients had been drug-free for at least 2 weeks. Exclusion criteria for all
patients were comorbid Axis I diagnosis, including alcohol or substance
abuse or dependence, or other neurological illness, including dementia or
stroke. The severity of depression was assessed by two trained psychiatrists
using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Thirty-ﬁve
healthy controls (19 males and 16 females; average 56.74 ± 4.59 years old)
were recruited from the general community within the same time frame
that the MDD patients were enrolled. They were not on medication, had no
history of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV Axis I or
II disorder, or family history of psychiatric disorders, neurological illness,
alcohol or drug abuse and dependence or other medical conditions. All
controls had HDRS scores o7. We randomly administered the following
antidepressant drugs to the 35 patients for 8 weeks: 20 patients received
escitalopram at a mean dose of 12.5 mg per day and 15 received
duloxetine at a mean dose of 64 mg per day. Response to treatment was
quantiﬁed as a reduction of 450% of the HDRS score from baseline to
week 8.
Blood collection
Following an overnight fast, venous blood samples were collected into
coagulant tubes between 0630 and 0800 h. Then, the blood samples were
centrifuged at 3000 r.p.m. at 4 °C for 20 min and stored at −80 °C until
assay. The serum samples were collected both at baseline and after
8 weeks of antidepressant treatment.
Measurement of serum protein concentrations using enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay
We measured serum protein concentrations of tPA, BDNF, proBDNF,
p75NTR and TrkB using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Serum concentrations of tPA, BDNF and p75NTR were measured by ELISA
kit (tPA (DTPA00; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA); BDNF (DBD00, R&D
Systems); and p75NTR (ab155436, Abcam, Cambridge, UK)) following the
manufacturer’s instructions. ProBDNF and TrkB concentrations were
estimated using Duoset human ELISA Kit (ProBDNF: DY3175 and TrkB:
DYC397; R&D Systems) combined with DuoSet ELISA Ancillary Reagent Kit
(DY008; R&D Systems) following the manufacturer’s instructions. All the
experiments were performed in duplicate. The details of the procedure are
shown in the Supplementary Data.
Statistical analysis
The data were expressed as the mean ± s.d. and analyzed with SPSS 17.0
software (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA). The protein values deviating from the
mean by more than 3 s.d. were deﬁned as outliers, which were left out. The
distributions of all the variables were checked with the Kolmogorov–
Smirnov test. The Chi-square test was performed on the categorical data of
gender. The one-way analysis of variance and nonparametric test (Kruskal–
Wallis H test) were used to compare the general characteristics, clinical and
biological data between controls and ‘pre-treatment’ or ‘post-treatment’. If
the age, education and body mass index (BMI) were correlated with
protein levels, we used multiple linear regression to make a comparison to
limit the possible inﬂuence of these demographics. The analysis of proteins
and HDRS scores between ‘pre-treatment’ and ‘post-treatment’ was
conducted with paired-samples t-test or Wilcoxon test (paired samples).
The correlation between the serum protein and the clinical variables in
MDD patients were calculated by Spearman correlation. Then, we adopted
the linear support vector machine to evaluate the potential diagnostic
effectiveness of these proteins, controlling for the effects of gender, age,
education and BMI. We performed normalization methods to process the
protein levels and the demographic data, including gender, age, education
and BMI. Then, we used ﬁvefold cross-validation to evaluate the
performance of the classiﬁcation method. As a ‘supervised’ learning
algorithm, the support vector machine has been widely used to solve the
problem of data classiﬁcation.22,23 We implemented the linear support
vector machine classiﬁer using the LIBSVM toolbox24 with a default
parameter value. We evaluated the classiﬁcation performance of these ﬁve
proteins by measuring the classiﬁcation accuracy, sensitivity, speciﬁcity
and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC; AUC:
0.9–1 = excellent;
0.8–0.9 = good;
0.7–0.8 = fair;
0.6–0.7 = poor;
0.5–
0.6 = fail). The statistical threshold was set at Po0.05.
RESULTS
Characteristics of MDD patients and controls
The demographic variables of all subjects are shown in Table 1.
There was no signiﬁcant difference in gender between MDD
patients and healthy controls (X2 = 3.68, P = 0.053). However, there
were signiﬁcant differences in age (F = 27.73, Po0.0001), educa-
tion (Z = −4.04, Po0.0001) and BMI (F = 7.52, P = 0.008) between
MDD patients and the controls. The HDRS scores in MDD patients
were signiﬁcantly decreased after 8 weeks of drug treatment
(Z = −5.2, Po0.0001), but they were still higher than the controls
(Z = −2.34, P = 0.019). Most of the patients were responsive to
8 weeks of antidepressant treatment in this study (n = 34), with a
reduction of HDRS scores 450%; only one patient was a non-
responder.
Serum levels of tPA, BDNF, TrkB, proBDNF and p75NTR
Table 1 shows the protein levels in the serum of MDD patients and
controls. We found that the protein levels of tPA and BDNF were
signiﬁcantly lower in patients than controls (tPA: t = −2.82,
P = 0.006; BDNF: t = −3.1, Po0.0001). The concentrations of
proBDNF, p75NTR and TrkB were signiﬁcantly higher in patients
compared
with
the
controls
(proBDNF:
t = 5.80,
Po0.0001;
p75NTR: t = 9.71, Po0.0001; TrkB: Z = −3.20, Po0.0001). The
value of BDNF/proBDNF was lower in patients than controls
(t = 5.92, Po0.0001).
After 8 weeks of drug treatment, serum tPA and BDNF were
signiﬁcantly higher in post-treatment than pre-treatment (tPA:
Z = −2.29, P = 0.022, BDNF: t = −4.82, Po0.0001), and they were
not signiﬁcantly different compared to the controls (tPA: t = −0.07,
P = 0.648; BDNF: F = 0.01, P = 0.933). Moreover, proBDNF levels in
subjects
post-treatment
were
signiﬁcantly
lower
than
pre-
treatment (Z = −2.43, P = 0.015), and this was not signiﬁcantly
different from the controls (t = 0.20, P = 0.66). p75NTR was
upregulated after treatment (t = 2.13, P = 0.041) and even higher
than controls (t = 9.96, Po0.0001). There was a trend for increased
TrkB in post-treatment rather than pre-treatment, although the
difference
did
not
reach
statistical
signiﬁcance
(Z = −1.51,
P = 0.131), and it was still higher than the controls (Z = −3.60,
Po0.0001). The value of BDNF/proBDNF was upregulated by drug
treatment (F = −5.07, Po0.0001) and it was higher than the
controls (t = −3.87, Po0.0001).
Correlations of serum protein levels with clinical variables in MDD
patients
We found no signiﬁcant correlations between these serum protein
levels and the severity of depression (HDRS scores) in MDD
patients (all P40.05). Furthermore, there were no signiﬁcant
correlations among these serum protein levels and age, education,
BMI, episodes and duration of illness (all P40.05), except that
proBDNF was correlated with age (rho = 0.37, P = 0.048) and
education (rho = −0.59, P = 0.001). No signiﬁcant correlation was
observed between changes in protein levels and reduction rates
of HAMD score (tPA: rho = −0.107, P = 0.41, BDNF: rho = −0.191,

P = 0.29, TrkB: rho = −0.341, P = 0.08, proBDNF: rho = −0.054,
P = 0.78, p75NTR: rho = −0.038, P = 0.84) after 8 weeks of drug
treatment.
Discriminant analysis
The diagnostic value of these ﬁve proteins is shown in Table 2 and
Figure 1. tPA (sensitivity = 67.9%, speciﬁcity = 94.1% and accu-
racy = 81.8%) and TrkB (sensitivity = 60.6%, speciﬁcity = 85.0%,
accuracy = 73.8%) demonstrated good diagnostic effectiveness,
with AUC = 0.854 and AUC = 0.826, respectively. In particular,
BDNF, proBDNF and p75NTR showed excellent diagnostic power.
The combination of these ﬁve proteins demonstrated much better
diagnostic power, providing 88.1% for sensitivity and 92.7% for
speciﬁcity, 0.977 for AUC and 90.6% for accuracy for MDD
diagnosis.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found that the dysfunction of the tPA–BDNF lysis
pathway in serum was implicated in MDD pathogenesis, and it
was partially reversed by antidepressant treatment. We found that
serum levels of tPA and BDNF and the ratio of BDNF/proBDNF
were lower in MDD patients than in controls, whereas TrkB,
proBDNF and its receptor p75NTR were higher. The impairment of
the tPA–BDNF cascade was partially reversed after 8 weeks of
treatment, and tPA, BDNF and proBDNF and the value of BDNF/
proBDNF were reversed, but p75NTR was higher than baseline,
and TrkB was not signiﬁcantly changed.
First, we found that BDNF was reduced in depressed patients
and
that
these
levels
normalized
following
antidepressant
treatment. The results are consistent with several previous
studies,17,18 strongly indicating the disruption of BDNF signaling
in depression and the restoration processes induced by anti-
depressant treatment. This result is corroborated by meta-analyses
demonstrating that BDNF levels in the brain and serum are ﬁrmly
connected.25 Interestingly, we found that the TrkB protein is
signiﬁcantly higher in depression patients than in healthy controls.
This result is consistent with one previous study26 but is contrary
to several previous studies reporting that levels of TrkB were lower
in the brain regions27–29 and serum19 of MDD patients. The reason
for this discrepancy is not known; we speculate that it could be
because of the differences in samples and methodology. An
animal study also showed that repeated immobilization stress
could signiﬁcantly increase TrkB mRNA levels.30 The upregulation
of TrkB may be a compensatory response to prolonged, stress-
induced downregulation of BDNF in depression. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report showing that expression of BDNF
and TrkB in serum can be regulated in opposite directions. After
drug treatment, there was a trend for increased trkB in post-
treatment rather than pre-treatment, although the difference did
not reach statistical signiﬁcance. These results indicate that
impaired BDNF-TrkB signaling was modulated by antidepressant
treatment.
As proBDNF binding to p75NTR has opposing biological
consequences to BDNF, it is essential to differentiate proBDNF
from BDNF in depression. However, little information is known
about the role of serum proBDNF. In this study, we found that
proBDNF and its receptor p75NTR were higher in MDD patients
than in the controls, suggesting a potential role of proBDNF/
p75NTR signaling in the pathogenesis of depression. This result is

The tPA–BDNF pathway in depression

consistent with a previous study of higher serum proBDNF and
p75NTR during acute depressive episodes.19 Furthermore, we
report for the ﬁrst time that the increased proBDNF was decreased
by antidepressant treatment, suggesting normalization following
drug treatment.
In addition, we found that the BDNF/proBDNF ratio was
decreased in depression, which is consistent with two previous
studies,19,31 indicating that the imbalance or the insufﬁcient
conversion of proBDNF to BDNF might have a role in major
depression. In addition, another study found that prenatal stress
could inhibit the proteolytic conversion of proBDNF to the BDNF
in the rat hippocampus.26 Interestingly, we report for the ﬁrst time
that the decreased serum BDNF/proBDNF ratio in depression was
reversed
by
antidepressant
treatment,
suggesting
that
the
antidepressant effect might be due to the elevation of the
BDNF/proBDNF ratio. Similarly, animal studies have shown that
early enriched environment and physical activity have antide-
pressive effects that were related to the increased conversion of
proBDNF to BDNF in the mouse hippocampus.32,33
We found that serum tPA was decreased in depression and that
this effect was reversed with drug treatment, suggesting that it
was associated with MDD pathogenesis. Although conventionally
known to be important for thrombosis, the tPA/plasminogen
system was recently discovered to have a vital role in MDD
pathophysiology by involving the cleavage process of proBDNF to
mBDNF.15,33,34 Our results are consistent with previous ﬁndings
that plasma tPA levels were signiﬁcantly decreased during
depression episodes20,21 and acute mental stress.15 In addition,
our precious study found that in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1,
the major inhibitor of tPA, the protein expression was increased in
the
prefrontal
cortex
and
hippocampus
of
rats
showing
depression-like
behaviors
and
in
the
serum
of
depressed
patients.35 Therefore, the decreased activity of the tPA/plasmino-
gen
system
may
cause
the
imbalance
or
the
insufﬁcient
conversion of proBDNF to BDNF, resulting in impaired BDNF
signaling that could cause impaired neural plasticity in depression.
In turn, the high levels of tPA in post-treatment patients may have
promoted a higher rate of cleavage of proBDNF, contributing to
the lower levels of proBDNF and the higher levels of BDNF and the
BDNF/proBDNF ratio observed in this study.31
Moreover, the results of discriminant analysis showed that tPA,
BDNF, TrkB, proBDNF and p75NTR all yielded fairly good or
excellent diagnostic performance, and the combination of these
ﬁve proteins demonstrated much better diagnostic effectiveness.
These results suggested that tPA, BDNF, TrkB, proBDNF and
p75NTR in the tPA–BDNF pathway in serum all should be
considered as a biomarker for MDD diagnosis, and the combina-
tion of these ﬁve proteins may provide a potential biomarker
panel as a diagnostic test for MDD.
Altered peripheral BDNF levels have also been reported in other
common psychiatry disorders, including bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia.36,37 The initial symptom of bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia overlaps with the depressive features of MDD. An
MDD misdiagnosis in bipolar disorder or schizophrenia patients is
commonly associated with inappropriate antidepressant treat-
ment and can worsen the outcome for bipolar disorder or
schizophrenia patients. We will further study these serum protein
levels of the tPA–BDNF pathway in these mental disorders to
determine the utility of this biomarker panel for differentiating
MDD from other psychiatric disorders and identifying subgroups
of patients with MDD.
There are some limitations to the present study. First, the
number of patients with MDD in our study was small. Second,
almost all the patients were responsive to 8 weeks of anti-
depressant treatment in this study, so we are unable to analyze
whether these proteins in the tPA–BDNF pathway could serve as
biomarkers for treatment responsiveness. Finally, the age and
education of the subjects were not well matched in our study.
These preliminary results need further study in larger and well-
matched cohorts.
Collectively, our results suggest that the tPA–BDNF lysis
pathway may be implicated in the pathogenesis of MDD and
the mechanisms underlying antidepressant therapeutic action. A
single protein above in the tPA–BDNF pathway in serum should
be considered a biomarker for MDD diagnosis. The combination of
these ﬁve proteins may provide a potential biomarker panel as a
diagnostic test for MDD.
