Abstract——Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
is the most prevalent growth factor in the central ner-
vous system (CNS). It is essential for the development of
the CNS and for neuronal plasticity. Because BDNF
plays a crucial role in development and plasticity of the
brain, it is widely implicated in psychiatric diseases.
This review provides a summary of clinical and preclin-
ical evidence for the involvement of this ubiquitous
growth factor in major depressive disorder, schizophre-
nia, addiction, Rett syndrome, as well as other psychiat-
ric and neurodevelopmental diseases. In addition, the
review includes a discussion of the role of BDNF in the
mechanism of action of pharmacological therapies cur-
rently used to treat these diseases, such antidepressants
and antipsychotics. The review also covers a critique of
experimental therapies such as BDNF mimetics and dis-
cusses the value of BDNF as a target for future drug
development.
I. Introduction
Neurotrophins are an important class of signaling mol-
ecules in the brain responsible for axon targeting, neuron
growth, maturation of synapses during development, and
synaptic plasticity. This family of molecules includes nerve
growth factor (NGF1) (Levi-Montalcini, 1966), brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (Barde et al., 1982), as
well as neurotrophins 3 and 4 (Hohn et al., 1990). Of these,
BDNF is the best characterized in terms of its role in
synaptic plasticity (Lohof et al., 1993; Levine et al., 1995,
1998; Kossel et al., 2001) and its potential role in the
disease pathology or treatment of many psychiatric dis-
eases (Duman and Monteggia 2006). In this review, we will
provide background on the role of BDNF in the brain, how
BDNF may be involved in psychiatric diseases, and finally
how BDNF may serve as a therapeutic target for treat-
ment of these disorders.
A. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Signaling
through Tropomyosin-Related Kinase B Receptors
The gene structure of BDNF is quite complex and has
recently been reviewed for rodent (Liu et al., 2006; Aid et
al., 2007) and human (Liu et al., 2005). The rodent BDNF
gene contains nine promoters, each of which precedes an
exon (I–IX) that through alternative slicing can result in a
large number of BDNF transcripts that all contain exon
IX, which encodes the BDNF protein (Aid et al., 2007).
Intriguingly, these transcription start sites are differen-
tially activated by neuronal activity and DNA methylation

status, resulting in the regulation of the transcripts. For
example, neuronal depolarization enhances levels of exons
I, IV, V, VII, VIII, and IX, whereas gene demethylation by
DNA methyltransferase increases transcription of exons I,
IV, V, VIII, and IX (Aid et al., 2007). Because exon IV
seems to respond to activity and is a target for activity- and
calcium-sensitive transcription factors, including cAMP re-
sponse-element binding protein (CREB), upstream-
stimulatory factors, calcium-responsive transcription fac-
tor, and methylated CpG binding protein (MeCP2), it is
called the “activity-dependent” exon (Shieh et al., 1998;
Tao et al., 1998; Tabuchi et al., 2002; Chen et al., 2003a,b;
Martinowich et al., 2003). Although the differential
regulation of these transcripts is important and may
affect cellular localization, among other aspects, how
this relates to neuropsychiatric disorders or treatment
is unknown.
BDNF is synthesized as a precursor protein known
as prepro-BDNF that is cleaved into pro-BDNF, which
can then be further cleaved into mature BDNF (Less-
mann et al., 2003). The significance of this precursor
protein seems to be that the full-length proneurotro-
phins get folded (Heymach et al., 1996) and sorted
(Lee et al., 2001) properly. Recent work has suggested
that pro-BDNF (35 kDa) is secreted in an activity-
dependent manner along with the enzyme tissue plas-
minogen activator, which cleaves pro-BDNF to mature
BDNF (14 kDa) (Waterhouse and Xu, 2009). However,
pro-BDNF is not an inactive precursor and has been
shown to have effects in the central nervous system
that are independent of mature BDNF.
Recent data suggest that pro-BDNF and mature BDNF
activate different intracellular signaling pathways (Woo et
al., 2005; Matsumoto et al., 2008; Yang et al., 2009). Pro-
BDNF signals through the low-affinity neurotrophin re-
ceptor p75 that is believed to be involved in apoptosis
(Roux and Barker, 2002; Lessmann et al., 2003). Mature
BDNF signals through its high-affinity tropomyosin-
related kinase B (TrkB) receptor. When BDNF is bound to
TrkB, it induces its dimerization and the receptor tyrosine
kinase is autophosphorylated, leading to activation of in-
tracellular signaling cascades, as well as augmentation of
N-methyl-D-aspartate (NDMA) receptor currents (Levine
et al., 1998). There are at least three signaling transduc-
tion pathways that BDNF-TrkB activation can regulate
(Fig. 1). The phospholipase C  (PLC ) pathway, which
leads to activation of protein kinase C; the phosphatidyl-
inositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, which activates serine/
threonine kinase AKT; and the mitogen-activated protein
kinase [MAPK, or extracellular signal related kinase
(ERK)] pathway, which activates several downstream ef-
fectors. Each of these signaling pathways confer the
unique function of BDNF on cells (for review, see (Mattson,
2008; Yoshii and Constantine-Paton, 2010). In brief, rapid
synaptic and ion channel effects are thought to depend on
PLC -mediated release of intracellular calcium stores,
and longer-lasting effects involving transcription are con-
sidered to be downstream of PI3K and MAPK pathways;
these effects will be discussed in greater detail in the
following section. In addition, there is also evidence that
BDNF may directly activate voltage-gated sodium chan-

Phosphorylation at various sites leads to activation of downstream pathways. The PI3K pathway activates protein kinase B (AKT), leading to cell
survival. The MAPK/ERK pathway leads to cell growth and differentiation. The PLC pathway activates inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor to
release intracellular calcium stores leading to enhanced calmodulin kinase (CamK) activity, leading to synaptic plasticity. All three pathways converge
on transcription factor CREB, which can up-regulate gene expression. DAG, diacylglycerol.

nels to mediate rapid depolarization of target neurons
(Blum et al., 2002).
B. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Functions
in Neurons
Throughout development, BDNF acts as a signal for
proper axonal growth (Yoshii and Constantine-Paton,
2010). BDNF is secreted from target tissues, and TrkB
receptors internalize upon ligand binding and signal to the
nucleus of the cell to stimulate neurite outgrowth (Yoshii
and Constantine-Paton, 2010). BDNF is known to be re-
quired for proper development and survival of dopaminer-
gic, GABAergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic neurons
(Pillai, 2008).
BDNF also serves essential functions in the mature
brain in synaptic plasticity (Poo, 2001) and is crucial for
learning and memory processes (Lu et al., 2008). BDNF
and TrkB are localized at pre- and postsynaptic sites,
where BDNF can be released in an activity-dependent
manner (Waterhouse and Xu, 2009). Presynaptic BDNF
signaling promotes neurotransmitter release, whereas
postsynaptic BDNF signaling is involved in enhancing var-
ious ion channel function including the -amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor, the
NMDA receptor, transient receptor potential cation
channels, as well as sodium and potassium channels
(for detailed review, see Rose et al., 2004). BDNF acts
at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (Kovalchuk
et al., 2004), and experimental evidence suggests that
BDNF may modulate both spontaneous and stimu-
lated neuronal activity (Schuman, 1999; Tyler et al.,
2006).
The action of BDNF signaling on synapses occurs within
seconds of stimulation or application/release of the factor
(Kovalchuk et al., 2004) and may support long-term poten-
tiation (LTP) processes via sustained TrkB activation as a
result of dendritic protein translation or transcription of
BDNF (Kang and Schuman, 1996). This positive transcrip-
tional feedback occurs through TrkB-mediated CREB ac-
tivation, which binds to cAMP response element sites in
the BDNF promoter to enhance gene transcription (Lu et
al., 2008). LTP is the lasting enhancement of synaptic
strength between neurons that is initiated by synchronous
depolarization, and this phenomenon is considered a cel-
lular model for associational learning and memory pro-
cesses. BDNF is known to facilitate LTP by converting
early LTP to late LTP and by potentiating subthreshold
activation to elicit LTP (Nagappan and Lu, 2005). Given
this essential role of BDNF in LTP facilitation, it is not
surprising that experimental loss of BDNF signaling
through genetic models or pharmacological manipulation
leads to impaired LTP (Patterson et al., 1996; Monteggia et
al., 2004) and decreased learning and memory in behav-
ioral paradigms (Lu et al., 2008).
Further studies of loss of BDNF signaling in the adult
brain have led to the discovery of many more roles for
BDNF in the modulation of behavior. In addition to its
importance in learning (for review, see Cowansage et al.,
2010), studies have revealed BDNF’s involvement in cog-
nition as well as mood-related behaviors. For this reason,
BDNF is widely studied in relation to neuropsychiatric
diseases including but not limited to major depressive dis-
order, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, addiction, Rett syn-
drome, and eating disorders.
II. Major Depressive Disorder and Therapies
A. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Regulation by
Major Depressive Disorder and Treatments
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of
disability worldwide. The clinical presentation of MDD
consists of a spectrum of neuropsychiatric symptoms, in-
cluding anxiety, feelings of inappropriate guilt, loss of plea-
sure, appetite changes, and sleep disturbances (Shelton,
2007). It is noteworthy that the incidence of MDD is twice
as high in women compared with men, although the reason
for this difference is currently unknown (Becker et al.,
2007). Pharmacological therapies for treatment of MDD
include selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors,
and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. These drugs tar-
get monoamine neurotransmitter systems to increase sig-
naling at the synapse, which suggests an essential role for
monoaminergic systems in mood-related behavior. How-
ever, given that these drugs have rapid synaptic effects but
are associated with delayed onset of clinical efficacy, it has
been proposed that molecular targets downstream of sero-
tonergic or noradrenergic signaling are responsible for an-
tidepressant efficacy.
Researchers are therefore interested in identifying di-
rect targets for MDD therapy to treat patients more rap-
idly and effectively. MDD has a genetic component of ap-
proximately 50%, which indicates that environmental
effects are a significant contribution to disease onset (Shel-
ton, 2007). Stressful events, including early life trauma as
well as acute stressors, correlate strongly with the occur-
rence of MDD (Charney and Manji, 2004). Intriguingly,
BDNF seems to be a molecular substrate of stress, because
data have demonstrated that BDNF expression is reduced
by stress, an important risk factor for MDD (Martinowich
et al., 2007). Furthermore, antidepressant treatment has
effects on BDNF levels opposite those of stress or depres-
sion (Castre´n and Rantama¨ki, 2010). Given that BDNF
expression is decreased by stress and MDD, increased by
antidepressants, and normalized in patients with MDD
taking an antidepressant, many investigators have fo-
cused on BDNF as a “biomarker” and also a potential
target for treatment of MDD.
1. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Expression in
Human Patients with Depression.
Stress-related dis-
orders, including MDD, correspond anatomically to a
reduction in hippocampal volume in patients (Bremner
et al., 2000). The hippocampus receives input from the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis
that

stress responses and is important in emotional cognition
and memory (McEwen, 2005). BDNF and TrkB levels
are decreased in regions of the hippocampus in postmor-
tem tissue taken from suicide victims or patients with
MDD or in the serum of patients with MDD (Castre´n et
al., 2007; Castre´n and Rantama¨ki, 2010; Thompson Ray
et al., 2011). Given that BDNF expression is decreased
by stress, structural changes in the hippocampus related
to MDD may be attributed in part to the reductions in
BDNF and TrkB (Yu and Chen, 2011). Another region of
the brain essential to emotional processing, the prefron-
tal cortex, has been examined in relation to pathological
features of MDD. In humans with MDD, this brain re-
gion is also decreased in volume, which is correlated
with decreased BDNF and TrkB levels (Dwivedi et al.,
2003; Castre´n, 2004; Pandey et al., 2008). These findings
suggest that both stress and MDD affect BDNF expres-
sion in limbic regions.
It is intriguing that BDNF expression is enhanced by
MDD in other areas of the brain. Studies have revealed
that BDNF protein is increased in the nucleus accumbens
(NAc) tissue from human patients with MDD (Krishnan et
al., 2007). Another interesting neuroanatomical correlate
of MDD is hypertrophy of the amygdala (Tebartz van Elst
et al., 2000; Frodl et al., 2002). Although it is unclear in
human patients whether BDNF is involved in this
structural abnormality, preclinical studies suggest
that BDNF is enhanced in the amygdala in response
to stress (Yu and Chen, 2011). Taken together, these
findings uncover an emergent MDD circuitry in which
BDNF signaling is increased in the amygdala and
nucleus accumbens and decreased in the hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex.
2. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Expression in
Patients Treated with Antidepressants.
BDNF is posi-
tively regulated by antidepressant treatment in hu-
mans. Postmortem tissue studies demonstrate that
BDNF levels are increased in the hippocampus and cor-
tex after long-term antidepressant use. In addition,
studies in live patients indicate that serum levels of
BDNF are normalized in patients suffering from depres-
sion after long-term antidepressant treatment (Duman
and Monteggia, 2006), a finding that has been validated
after meta-analyses of multiple studies (Sen et al.,
2008). However, studies of BDNF in postmortem tissue
are correlative, and the exact origin and function of
serum-derived BDNF remain unclear. Some of these
assumptions have been tested in preclinical models of
reduced
BDNF
signaling
or
in
animal
models
of
depression.
B. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Behavioral
Models of Depression
In rodents, chronic stress is a generally accepted model
of depression because it leads to neurochemical and behav-
ioral alterations that are analogous to those observed in
depressed human patients, including increases in stress
hormones, hippocampal atrophy, increased anxiety- and
depression-related behaviors, and cognitive impairments
(McEwen and Magarinos, 1997; Willner, 2005; Yan et al.,
2010). Studies have repeatedly shown that chronic re-
straint stress or unpredictable stress can lead to decreases
in hippocampal mRNA and protein levels of BDNF in mice
and rats (Duman and Monteggia, 2006). On a related note,
long-term administration of corticosterone, the rodent
stress hormone, is sufficient to produce decreases in hip-
pocampal BDNF expression, further implicating the role of
stress in these molecular alterations (Jacobsen and Mørk,
2006).
1. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Animal Models.
a. Baseline behavior.
To determine whether BDNF is
required for normal depression-like behavior, multiple
animal models of deficient BDNF signaling have been
produced. Constitutive BDNF knockout mouse models
have developmental brain abnormalities and die soon
after birth (Ernfors et al., 1994). Therefore, investiga-
tors have turned to heterozygous, conditional, and re-
gion-specific knockout or knockdown models to study
depression-related
behavior
in
adult
mice.
BDNF
heterozygous mice display 50% reduction of mRNA
and protein throughout the animal. Studies using BDNF
heterozygous mice show no compelling evidence of alter-
ations in depression-like behavior (Chourbaji et al.,
2004). However, baseline behaviors in BDNF heterozy-
gous mice may be difficult to interpret because constitu-
tive reduction of BDNF over the course of development
may result in developmental compensation or it may be
that 50% expression of BDNF is sufficient for normal
behavioral phenotypes. Therefore, investigators have
used conditional and inducible genetic models to remove
BDNF in a regionally and temporally dependent man-
ner. In mouse models in which BDNF is deleted from
forebrain neurons later in development, there are not
profound changes in depression-related behavior (Mon-
teggia et al., 2004), although female mice lacking BDNF
may display alterations in depression behavior in cer-
tain assays (Monteggia et al., 2007). A potential issue
with this type of deletion is that behavioral effects can-
not be attributed to specific neural circuits. However, all
of these lines of mice consistently display an inability to
respond to antidepressant treatment, revealing an es-
sential role for BDNF in the manifestation of behavioral
antidepressant responses (Monteggia et al., 2004; Mal-
berg and Blendy, 2005; Tardito et al., 2006; Monteggia et
al., 2007; Hu and Russek, 2008).
To more accurately target particular brain regions, re-
searchers are using viral-mediated deletion techniques to
remove BDNF from spatially restricted brain regions.
These studies have added to our understanding of how
BDNF operates in neural circuitry and have revealed con-
flicting evidence on the contribution of particular brain
regions to depression-related behavior (Fig. 2, A and B).
Adachi et al. (2008) demonstrated that localized deletion of
BDNF in the cornu ammonis 1 or dentate gyrus subregions
242
AUTRY AND MONTEGGIA

of hippocampus does not alter baseline depression behav-
ior, although dentate gyrus expression of BDNF is re-
quired for antidepressant efficacy. However, region-
specific deletion of BDNF in the mesolimbic dopamine
neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) exerts an
opposing effect, resulting in an antidepressant-like re-
sponse (Berton et al., 2006; Krishnan et al., 2007). Theories
in the field explain this discrepancy as an illustration of
either the complex circuitry associated with mood-related
behaviors (Castre´n et al., 2007) or that deletion of BDNF
and its precursor pro-BDNF results in distinct behavioral
alterations in different brain areas (Martinowich et al.,
2007); sufficient experimental evaluation of these propos-
als has not yet been undertaken. Further examination of
the region-specific contribution of BDNF to depression-like
behavior and antidepressantefficacy will be important to

243

determine how brain circuitry influences these behavioral
processes.
b. Stress paradigms.
BDNF alone may not be suffi-
cient to explain depression-related behaviors, but it re-
mains an important risk factor for depression. Research-
ers have examined the role that BDNF plays in
susceptibility to developing stress-related mood disor-
ders, but preclinical investigations have not yet demon-
strated how loss of BDNF alters vulnerability to stress
(Advani et al., 2009; Autry et al., 2009). Differences in
observations are likely to arise as a result of variations
in the type of stressors, duration of stress, choice of
behavioral assay or endpoint, mouse strain, and brain
pathway examined. Some studies illustrate that BDNF
heterozygous mice have altered depression-related be-
havior after acute or subchronic stress (Advani et al.,
2009). Research on conditional or inducible BDNF mu-
tants suggests that depression behavior in male mice
from these lines is indistinguishable from that in control
mice after chronic mild stress (Ibarguen-Vargas et al.,
2009), although in female mutant mice, alterations in
depression behavior may be more pronounced (Autry et
al., 2009). After chronic social stress, BDNF deletion in
the VTA reduces depression-related behavior (Berton et
al., 2006), again suggesting differences in circuitry or
BDNF/pro-BDNF functions. Further investigation is re-
quired, but current research indicates that BDNF poten-
tially affects stress-induced behavior in a limited and
gender-specific manner.
2. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Produces an An-
tidepressant Response in Animal Models.
Evidence
suggests that, although its role in depression symptoms
is complex, BDNF is essential for antidepressant effi-
cacy. Similar to findings in human tissue, BDNF mRNA
and protein expression are increased after long-term
antidepressant therapies, such as electroconvulsive
therapy, and many drugs, including SSRIs, norepineph-
rine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and
atypical compounds in corticolimbic brain areas, includ-
ing the hippocampus in animal models (Nibuya et al.,
1995; Altar et al., 2003; Balu et al., 2008). Moreover,
infusion of BDNF into the midbrain, ventricles, or re-
gions of the hippocampus results in increased antide-
pressant-like behavior (Shirayama et al., 2002; Hoshaw
et al., 2005; Hu and Russek, 2008). Although many
growth factors such as NGF and insulin growth factor
are also known to increase after antidepressant treat-
ment and to cause behavioral effects similar to those
observed after BDNF infusion (for review, see Duman
and Monteggia, 2006), a preponderance of data suggests
that animal models lacking BDNF are unable to respond
to antidepressants (Saarelainen et al., 2003; Monteggia
et al., 2004, 2007; Adachi et al., 2008). In support of
these findings, overexpression of a dominant-negative
TrkB (TrkB.T1) leads to loss of antidepressant efficacy,
which suggests that TrkB activation is required for an-
tidepressants to produce behavioral effects (Saarelainen
et al., 2003). In a subsequent study, antidepressant
drugs were found to rapidly activate the TrkB receptor
and PLC  signaling, which suggests that this intracel-
lular pathway is a common mechanism for antidepres-
sant drug action (Rantama¨ki et al., 2007). Taken to-
gether, these data indicate that BDNF via TrkB
activation and downstream signaling is both necessary
and sufficient for antidepressant behavioral responses.
3. Interplay between Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Fac-
tor and the Serotonergic System.
BDNF has been
shown to affect the function of serotonergic neurons.
BDNF and the TrkB receptor are expressed on seroto-
nergic neurons in the raphe nucleus, where they can
mediate effects on these neurons (Merlio et al., 1992).
Previous work has also demonstrated that BDNF from
the hippocampus can be retrogradely transported to the
raphe nucleus neurons (Anderson et al., 1995), suggest-
ing a complex interplay in how this neurotrophin can
affect serotonergic function. In the context of MDD, the
findings that BDNF is necessary for antidepressant re-
sponses)such as those from SSRIs in animal models) and
that SSRIs regulate BDNF expression further highlight
the link between these two systems. Studies have at-
tempted to identify structural alterations in mouse mod-
els of BDNF deficiency related to the serotonergic sys-
tem. Mice heterozygous for BDNF show changes in later
life in serotonergic innervation of target regions such as
the cortex, the hypothalamus, and the hippocampus that
could be linked to depression (Lyons et al., 1999). These
changes occur in a regions specific manner; serotonergic
innervation is depleted in the cortex and the hypothal-
amus, whereas it is enhanced in the hippocampus (Ly-
ons et al., 1999).
The idea that SSRIs increase extracellular 5HT levels,
which then promotes up-regulation of BDNF expression,
suggests important roles for 5HT receptors in SSRI effi-
cacy (for review, see Gardier, 2009). Conversely, stress can
down-regulate components of the 5HT system, including
specific receptor subtype expression and/or function, which
may then alter BDNF expression (for review, see Gingrich
and Hen, 2001). A recent study demonstrated this dissoci-
ation between the impact of BDNF on 5HT receptor num-
ber and function (Hensler et al., 2007). In this study, in-
ducible forebrain BDNF knockout mouse show unaltered
5HT1a serotonin receptor number in the hippocampus al-
though the regulation of these 5HT1a receptors in the
presence of the stress hormone corticosterone is affected by
loss of BDNF (Hensler et al., 2007). This review will not
focus further on the link between the 5HT receptor sub-
types and BDNF, given the large number of 5HT receptor
subtypes and their putative roles in depression and anti-
depressant responses.
Studies have inquired into the relationship between
BDNF and the serotonin transporters, which clear 5HT
from the synapse and are the molecular target of SSRIs. In
vitro studies show that BDNF dose-dependently decreases
5HT uptake, suggesting that BDNF affects the function of
244
AUTRY AND MONTEGGIA

serotonin transporters (Mo¨ssner et al., 2000). In addition,
detailed studies of extracellular serotonin levels using
high-speed chronoamperometry reveal an in vivo defi-
ciency in synaptic serotonin removal in mice heterozygous
for BDNF (Daws et al., 2007). In this study, the authors
reported that BDNF heterozygotes are less responsive to
the effects of SSRI drugs, which typically increase extra-
cellular serotonin in wild-type mice (Daws et al., 2007). In
agreement with these findings, in vivo microdialysis stud-
ies demonstrate that BDNF heterozygous mice display
enhanced extracellular serotonin (Deltheil et al., 2008b).
BDNF heterozygotes were also found to have decreased
serotonin outflow after treatment with various SSRIs,
again suggesting that BDNF is involved in the action of
SSRIs (Deltheil et al., 2008b). Investigators further
showed that this impact of BDNF on 5HT function is
region-specific, indicating that BDNF heterozygous mice
display blunted 5HT outflow in ventral hippocampus after
treatment with SSRIs (Deltheil et al., 2008a). These data
suggest that BDNF may serve to provide functional mod-
ulation of the serotonergic system at the level of both the
receptor and the transporter. Future studies are necessary
to further delineate this link between BDNF and seroto-
nergic system functionality.
C. Association of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor
and Neurogenesis in Depression and
Antidepressant Treatment?
Because of the delay in clinical efficacy of antidepres-
sants, investigators have searched for downstream cellular
processes that may confer therapeutic effects. One process
of interest in addition to BDNF-mediated synaptic plastic-
ity enhancement is augmented hippocampal neurogenesis,
which occurs on approximately the same time-scale as
therapeutic effects of antidepressants (3–4 weeks). Studies
have demonstrated that increased cell proliferation in the
hippocampus is associated with MDD treatments such as
electroconvulsive therapy and pharmacological therapies
(for review, see Malberg and Blendy, 2005). Ablation of
neuronal proliferation by cranial irradiation resulted in
attenuation of antidepressant responses, suggesting that
antidepressants were mediating their therapeutic effect
through neurogenesis (Santarelli et al., 2003). However,
Holick et al. (2008) suggested that the link between neu-
rogenesis and antidepressant responses may be dependent
on mouse strain. Intriguingly, BDNF heterozygous mice
have normal neurogenesis but are unable to respond to
antidepressants, suggesting that the BDNF-dependent ef-
fect on antidepressant efficacy is independent of neurogen-
esis (Duman et al., 2001). Furthermore, clinical studies
have demonstrated that ketamine (Berman et al., 2000;
Zarate et al., 2006) and scopolamine (Furey and Drevets,
2006; Drevets and Furey, 2010) may have antidepressant
effects within hours or days, calling into question the con-
tribution of neurogenesis in the mechanism of rapid alter-
ation in mood states. Taken together, these observations
suggest that neurogenesis may not be an essential mech-
anism by which antidepressants exert behavioral effects
and that the link to BDNF, a bona fide target of antide-
pressants, is unclear.
D. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Polymorphisms
Researchers have examined the BDNF gene for single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may be linked to
MDD. The most common BDNF SNP in humans is at
codon 66, resulting in the Val to Met (V66M) protein vari-
ant, which prevents the activity-dependent release of
BDNF (Egan et al., 2003). Although this polymorphism
does seem to affect human cognition, the contribution of
this mutation to the pathological features of MDD or to
suicidality remains unclear (Dwivedi, 2010). Recent stud-
ies have revealed that men homozygous for the mutation
may be at greater risk for MDD (Frielingsdorf et al., 2010).
Other studies suggest that this mutation may increase
susceptibility for MDD after early-life stress (Gatt et al.,
2009). Although mouse models of the V66M mutation seem
to have neuronal development defects that lead to reduced
hippocampal volume, this structure reduction does not
seem to contribute to depression-like behavior in rodents
(Frielingsdorf et al., 2010). Whether this allele is associ-
ated with susceptibility to stress-induced depression-
related behavior has not been thoroughly examined in
mouse models (Martinowich et al., 2007). At present,
it is not yet clear whether BDNF polymorphisms con-
tribute to expression of MDD symptoms or antidepres-
sant efficacy, so further work will be necessary to
examine this possibility.
III. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and
Other Mood-Related Disorders
A. Bipolar Disorder
Bipolar disorder (BD) affects approximately 1% of the
population and consists of alternations between depressive
and manic episodes (Shaltiel et al., 2007). Like MDD,
stressful life events seem to trigger manic episodes in pa-
tients with BD (Sanacora, 2008). Treatment for BD often
includes mood stabilizers such as lithium or valproic acid
and may also include antidepressant.
Both lithium and valproic acid increase BDNF expres-
sion in corticolimbic brain regions and engage signaling
pathways downstream of the TrkB receptor much like
antidepressant therapies (Hashimoto et al., 2002; Chen
and Manji, 2006; Sanacora, 2008). In addition, BDNF pro-
tein levels are decreased in post mortem hippocampal tis-
sue (Knable et al., 2004), and serum BDNF levels are
decreased in patients with BD (Sanacora, 2008). The
V66M BDNF allele is strongly correlated to BD (Neves-
Pereira et al., 2002; Sklar et al., 2002; Lohoff et al., 2005).
Taken together, these data implicate misregulation of
trophic signaling pathways in the disease state as well as
in therapeutic efficacy. Study of BDNF animal models with
respect to BD-associated behavioral paradigms may reveal
BDNF AND NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS
245

a new appreciation for the role of BDNF in this debilitating
mood disorder.
B. Anxiety-Related Disorders
Anxiety disorders in humans are pathological responses
to stressful situations. Anxiety-related disorders include
generalized anxiety disorder as well as phobias, panic dis-
order, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) (Hovatta and Barlow, 2008). These
disorders affect approximately one in five Americans an-
nually (Kessler et al., 2005). Approximately 30% of the risk
for anxiety-related disorders can be attributed to heritable
traits (for review, see Hovatta and Barlow, 2008). Because
of the stress-induced nature and the high comorbidity with
MDD, BDNF is a gene of interest in the study of anxiety-
related disorders.
1. Anxiety in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor
Mouse Models.
Conditional mutants for BDNF using
lines in which the gene was deleted in broad forebrain
areas reveal decreased anxiety in female mice (Monteg-
gia et al., 2007). However, in a study using a different
mouse line, an inducible BDNF mutant, female mice
showed greater susceptibility after stress for enhanced
anxiety than stressed male mutant mice (Autry et al.,
2009). Mice homozygous for the V66M allele show in-
creased anxiety-related behavior (Chen et al., 2006).
Collectively, these data suggest that alterations in
BDNF expression may affect anxiety-related behavior,
although the neural circuitry involved in these processes
remains to be determined.
2. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and Anxiety in
Human Studies.
Human studies of anxiety-related dis-
orders associated with the V66M allele uncover mixed
results. In some studies, association of the V66M SNP
with enhanced anxiety is revealed (Montag et al., 2010),
whereas meta-analysis has no significant impact on anx-
iety to this mutation (Frustaci et al., 2008). Similar to
data in patients with MDD, there may be an interaction
of early-life stress and BDNF SNPs, which precipitate
anxiety-related disorders (Gatt et al., 2009). A recent
study has demonstrated impairments in fear extinction
response in human V66M carriers (Soliman et al., 2010).
Taken together with the potential for anxiety propensity
in these humans, this allele may be relevant in patients
with PTSD (Soliman et al., 2010).
3. Potential Link between Brain-Derived Neurotrophic
Factor and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
Investiga-
tors are studying the role of BDNF in abnormal fear
memory and extinction (Frielingsdorf et al., 2010). Path-
ological fear is a central feature of PTSD, so taken to-
gether with the responsiveness to stress and involve-
ment in memory, BDNF is a gene of interest for PTSD.
In rodent studies, the V66M mutation is correlated with
impaired fear memory (Chen et al., 2006), similar to
findings with another BDNF mouse model (Monteggia et
al., 2004). Targeted knockdown or inhibition of BDNF-
TrkB signaling in the amygdala results in loss of fear
memory acquisition (Rattiner et al., 2004). Hippocampal
deletion of BDNF leads to disrupted extinction of fear
memory (Heldt et al., 2007). Systemic administration of
a TrkB agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone seems to enhance
extinction of fear learning, implicating its potential use-
fulness in PTSD therapy (Andero et al., 2011). Taken
together, these data suggest that BDNF is essential for
fear memory formation and extinction in multiple corti-
colimbic structures and may be a therapeutic target for
PTSD.
IV. Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex, heterogeneous disease
characterized by psychosis that affects approximately 1%
of the population (Regier et al., 1993). Core negative symp-
toms of SZ include cognitive deficits, social avoidance, and
flat affect; positive symptoms include paranoia, hyperac-
tivity, and psychosis. Linkage analyses reflect a high im-
pact of genetics on incidence of SZ, although environmen-
tal effects such as life events and prenatal and early
development may contribute to the disease (Lang et al.,
2007a). Pharmacotherapies for SZ mainly target psychosis
and are grouped into typical and atypical (first and second
generation, respectively) antipsychotic classes that pri-
marily inhibit the dopaminergic system. Although the
mechanisms of these drug classes are not fully understood,
it is generally accepted that typical antipsychotics such as
haloperidol, raclopride, and chlorpromazine have high af-
finity at dopamine receptors, which confers more side ef-
fects such as tremors (Seeman, 2002). Atypical antipsy-
chotics such as clozapine and olanzapine may dissociate
from the dopamine faster and in turn confer fewer side
effects (Seeman, 2002). Given the complex pathology of
schizophrenia, several neurotransmitter systems and mo-
lecular signals have been implicated in SZ. Studies have
demonstrated that patients with SZ have alterations in
brain morphology (Mueser and McGurk, 2004) and altered
activity levels in various cortical and limbic brain regions
compared with healthy controls (Goghari et al., 2010). Fur-
thermore, many neurotransmitter systems including dopa-
mine (Heinz and Schlagenhauf, 2010), the target for anti-
psychotic treatments; GABA (Volk et al., 2000), the
primary inhibitory transmitter; and glutamate (Javitt,
2010), the major excitatory neurotransmitter, have been
implicated in structural and neurochemical changes asso-
ciated with SZ.
A. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor
and Schizophrenia
Because BDNF is involved in development, neurotrans-
mission, and is also reactive to environmental stimuli, it
has been studied in the pathophysiology of SZ. It has been
proposed that developmental abnormalities, as well as per-
sistent cognitive and emotional dysfunction that occur in
development, including circuit-level, genetic, or environ-
mental alterations in BDNF expression, lead to patholog-
246
AUTRY AND MONTEGGIA

ical behavioral and neuronal features associated with SZ
(Durany and Thome, 2004). Post mortem studies of SZ
brain tissue have demonstrated alterations in BDNF in
certain brain regions. Recent studies have shown that
BDNF expression is increased in the frontal cortices of
patients with SZ compared with controls (Takahashi et al.,
2000), whereas others report that BDNF and TrkB are
decreased in the cortices of patients with schizophrenia
(Weickert et al., 2003; Hashimoto et al., 2005b). Some
studies demonstrate enhanced BDNF protein levels in the
hippocampus (Iritani et al., 2003), but others report de-
creased BDNF (Durany et al., 2001). Studies further show
that the TrkB receptor is decreased in the hippocampus
(Takahashi et al., 2000). It is possible that the various
effects are due to antipsychotic therapy, because most pa-
tients with SZ included in these human studies have re-
ceived long-term treatment for psychoses. Alternatively,
these findings may suggest that SZ is associated with
imbalanced circuit-level expression of BDNF, indicating
either an altered developmental trajectory for BDNF ex-
pression, a secondary manifestation of pathological condi-
tions, or antipsychotic action. Further study will be neces-
sary to ascertain how age-related expression of BDNF may
be changed in patients with SZ and how disease onset
versus long-term antipsychotic therapy may affect BDNF
levels.
Studies in live patients have assessed structural abnor-
malities as well as serum levels of BDNF associated with
SZ. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have consistently
shown that structural alterations in the brain are common
in patients with SZ, including enlarged ventricles and re-
duced gray matter (Boos et al., 2007), particularly in the
cortex and hippocampus (Steen et al., 2006). These find-
ings suggest that possible misregulation of BDNF during
brain development in SZ may contribute to reduced gray
matter.
Studies have produced conflicting data regarding the
levels of BDNF in serum of patients with SZ. Some detect
decreased serum BDNF levels (Pillai, 2008); others report
no such differences in control subjects versus patients with
SZ (Durany and Thome, 2004). When investigators specif-
ically examined patients with SZ who were taking antipsy-
chotic drugs, certain drugs, such as clozapine, seem to
increase serum BDNF levels, whereas others, such as ris-
peridone, have no effect on BDNF (Pillai, 2008). It remains
unclear how serum levels of BDNF correlate to brain levels
and function.
B. Antipsychotic Drug Effects on Brain-Derived
Neurotrophic Factor Expression
To further assess the validity of human serum data of
patients with SZ who are taking antipsychotic agents, pre-
clinical research has examined the effects on BDNF ex-
pression of treatment with such agents. Here again, re-
sults indicate that different antipsychotic drugs have
diverse effects on BDNF expression in a brain-region-
specific manner. Haloperidol and risperidone seem to de-
crease BDNF, whereas clozapine and olanzapine may in-
crease BDNF levels in the hippocampus (Pillai, 2008),
although other studies indicate that clozapine may have
opposite effects in the hippocampus (Durany and Thome,
2004). These data do not definitively show how APs affect
brain levels of BDNF.
C. Altered Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Levels in
Animal Models of Schizophrenia
Investigators have developed animal models of schizo-
phrenia based on pathological features associated with the
disease. Common models include neonatal ventral hip-
pocampal lesions, which lead to structural abnormalities
associated with SZ; gestational methylazoxymethanol ac-
etate (MAM) exposure, mimicking defects in brain devel-
opment thought to be correlated to SZ; and long-term am-
phetamine treatment, which may model psychosis
symptoms observed in patients with SZ. In this section, we
will discuss how these models affect levels of BDNF (Fig. 3,
A and B).
1. Neonatal Ventral Hippocampal Lesions.
Neonatal
ventral hippocampal lesions (NVHL) are made with ibo-
tenic acid around postnatal day 7 to mimic the ventric-
ular enlargement and developmental aspects associated
with SZ (for review, see Tseng et al., 2009). Rodents with
these lesions display behavioral symptoms analogous to
SZ, including cognitive, social, and sensorimotor gating
deficits, hyperactivity with sensitivity to psychotic drug-
induced effects, and abnormal stress responses (Tordj-
man et al., 2007). In terms of brain function, the NHVL
model disrupts cortical networks and alters glutamater-
gic and GABAergic responses in adults (Pillai, 2008;
Tseng et al., 2009). BDNF mRNA is reduced in the
cortex and hippocampus in this model, mirroring some
serum and post mortem brain studies (Pillai, 2008).
Many studies suggest that the NVHL model for SZ has
predictive validity for efficacy of risperidone and cloza-
pine (Rueter et al., 2004; Richtand et al., 2006). How
these lesions are linked to decreased BDNF levels, how-
ever, is unclear. Further study will be necessary to de-
termine whether BDNF levels are decreased as a pri-
mary effect of lesion or secondary to systemic damage
induced by the lesions.
2. Gestational Methylazoxymethanol Acetate Expo-
sure.
MAM is an antimitotic agent that causes a severe
loss of neurons in the cortex and hippocampus when
applied during embryogenesis (Di Luca et al., 1994). For
modeling of SZ behavioral deficits such as hyperactivity
and impaired cognition, the toxin is applied between
days 11 and 17 in utero (Fiore et al., 2002; Lodge and
Grace, 2008). Studies report decreased mRNA and pro-
tein levels of BDNF in the adult hippocampus after
gestational MAM exposure (Pillai, 2008). These changes
extend to other trophic factors, such as NGF, suggesting
that there may be overall impairment of growth factor
expression and, by extension, neuronal function after
toxin application (Fiore et al., 2002). Antipsychotic effi-
BDNF AND NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS
247

cacy has not yet been assessed in the gestational MAM
exposure animal model. Again, with this model of SZ, it
is difficult to know whether BDNF changes underlie
behavioral symptoms associated with SZ. In this model
as well as the NVHL model, it would be interesting to
examine whether application of BDNF can rescue be-
havioral deficits associated with SZ.
3. Long-Term Amphetamine Administration.
Inves-
tigators have focused on the role of dopamine in positive
SZ symptoms such as psychosis, hallucinations, and
paranoia because antipsychotic therapies target the do-

AUTRY AND MONTEGGIA

(Ellison, 1994; Pillai, 2008) and has predictive validity
for antipsychotics that typically inhibit dopaminergic
receptors (Tordjman et al., 2007). Mice or rats given
doses of amphetamine for a minimum of 7 days show
psychosis-related behaviors reminiscent of SZ (Feather-
stone et al., 2007). Long-term amphetamine administra-
tion decreases BDNF protein levels in the hypothalamus
and cortical regions (Angelucci et al., 2007a). This treat-
ment also affects NGF in cortical areas, the hypothala-
mus, and the hippocampus (Angelucci et al., 2007a).
These data suggest that long-term amphetamine expo-
sure has a nonspecific effect on growth factors. Never-
theless, all of these animal models report BDNF
decreases in corticolimbic brain regions although speci-
ficity of these changes is uncertain. Given that these
models each replicate behavioral aspects of SZ and that
serum and post mortem brain studies have reported
decreased BDNF levels, these data all seem to suggest
that BDNF may be important in the pathological fea-
tures of SZ. Nonetheless, as stated previously, it re-
mains to be tested whether the nature of BDNF changes
and their relationship to SZ are causative or incidental.
D. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Animal Models
in Schizophrenia-Like Behaviors
Because many animal models of SZ suggest alterations
in BDNF, it is important to understand the impact of loss
of BDNF on SZ-related behavioral measures. Preclinical
paradigms that model SZ symptoms include associative
and spatial memory tasks, sensorimotor gating tasks with
or without AP treatment, novel environment locomotor
activity and subsequent drug-induced sensitization, AP-
induced catalepsy, and social interaction. We have already
discussed stress reactivity of various strains of BDNF mod-
els in the section covering MDD, so here we will focus on
other aspects of SZ-related behavior.
1. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Heterozygous
Mice.
BDNF heterozygous mice have been assessed in
a number of behavioral paradigms; the following is an
overview of behaviors relevant to SZ. As previously men-
tioned, BDNF heterozygous mice display impairments
in contextual fear conditioning that are in part rescued
by hippocampal infusion of recombinant BDNF (Liu et
al., 2004). In addition, this line of mice shows heightened
locomotor activity (Kernie et al., 2000) as well as poten-
tiated locomotor responses to amphetamine treatment
(Dluzen et al., 2001; Saylor and McGinty, 2008), poten-
tially implicating a lower threshold for psychosis-like
behavior. Studies further indicate that BDNF heterozy-
gous mice have deficits in sensorimotor gating (Dluzen
et al., 2001).
2. Conditional/Inducible Brain-Derived Neurotrophic
Factor Deletion Mice.
Likewise, mice with postnatal
neuronal deletion of BDNF have been assessed in mul-
tiple measures of SZ-related behavior. As in heterozy-
gous mice, conditional and inducible lines of BDNF
knockout mice exhibit compromised learning and mem-
ory in spatial learning (Gorski et al., 2003; Monteggia et
al., 2004, 2007) as well as contextual conditioning tasks.
In addition, these mouse lines display increased locomo-
tion in a novel environment (Monteggia et al., 2004,
2007). Knockout of BDNF expression during embryogen-
esis or adulthood in forebrain neurons does not seem to
recapitulate morphological deficits associated with SZ
(Hill et al., 2005); however, loss of BDNF in forebrain
neurons does seem to be essential during both develop-
ment and adulthood for maintaining normal function of
GABAergic interneurons in the cortex (Glorioso et al.,
2006).
Taken together, these rodent studies strongly suggest
that BDNF may underlie aspects of positive symptoms
such as psychosis and hyperactivity as well as cognitive
deficits associated with SZ. Studies exploring the effect of
BDNF deletion in social paradigms would reveal the in-
volvement of BDNF in negative symptoms of SZ. Intrigu-
ingly, altered startle response in maternally separated ro-
dents results in disrupted sensorimotor gating that is
correlated to decreased BDNF levels in the hippocampus
and striatum (Lippmann et al., 2007), suggesting that in-
teraction of BDNF and stress in relation to SZ symptoms
may be important to further investigate. Future study of
the effect of APs in models of sensorimotor gating will be
necessary to determine whether BDNF is essential for AP
efficacy.
E. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Polymorphisms
and Schizophrenia
Clinical studies have searched for genes associated with
SZ to uncover potential contribution to the disease state.
Polymorphisms in several genes have been identified in-
cluding catechol-O-methyltransferase, disrupted in schizo-
phrenia-1, and glutamic acid decarboxylase as well as
BDNF (van Haren et al., 2008). Given the strong correla-
tion between BDNF alterations and SZ in humans and in
rodent models, researchers have examined polymorphisms
in the gene. For the purposes of this review, we discuss two
of the most well studied polymorphisms in SZ, V66M and
C270T.
1. V66M Polymorphism.
As mentioned in the section
about MDD, the V66M polymorphism is known to re-
duce activity-regulated secretion of BDNF and is corre-
lated with cognitive deficits in humans. Because im-
paired learning and memory are core symptoms of SZ,
BDNF may be involved in this pathological condition. In
addition, the V66M allele in some instances has been
linked to development of SZ (Numata et al., 2006); al-
though there is conflicting evidence (Naoe et al., 2007;
Pillai, 2008). It will be necessary to determine whether
these opposite outcomes are due to varying endopheno-
types of the heterogeneous disease, patient population
background, or affective symptoms versus developmen-
tal/neurochemical phenotypes of SZ.
2. C270T Polymorphism.
The C270T polymorphism
lies in the 5 noncoding region of the BDNF gene. The
BDNF AND NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS
249

link between the C270T and SZ is currently not clear.
Early studies showed that the frequency of this allele
seems to be increased in the population of patients with
SZ compared with healthy control subjects (Nanko et al.,
2003; Szekeres et al., 2003). However, many other stud-
ies reported no association between SZ and this BDNF
allele in various populations (Szczepankiewicz et al.,
2005; Watanabe et al., 2006). The possibility that the
samples were not large enough to detect an appreciable
contribution of this low-frequency polymorphism has led
scientists to combine data from these studies in a meta-
analysis. However, the few studies that have combined
data still do not offer a conclusive view of the contribu-
tion of this polymorphism to SZ (Jo¨nsson et al., 2006;
Watanabe et al., 2007; Xu et al., 2007). The conflicting
results suggest that further examination of the associa-
tion of the C270T polymorphism to SZ is necessary,
particularly with respect to severity, symptom spec-
trum, and therapeutic treatments (Durany and Thome,
2004). Preclinical studies that are able to distinguish
among susceptibility, disease mechanisms, and second-
ary changes induced by pathological features of SZ or by
treatment can clarify this issue.
V. Addiction
Addiction is a psychiatric disorder caused by long-term
use of drugs, resulting in substance abuse and/or depen-
dence characterized by tolerance or sensitization to drug
effects (Bu¨ttner, 2011). Withdrawal and craving in the
absence of drug leads to enhanced susceptibility to relapse.
According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy,
addiction to illicit substances, tobacco, and alcohol results
in a $600 billion burden to the United States.
A. Psychomotor Stimulants
Amphetamine and cocaine use in the United States con-
stitutes a large segment of illicit drug use. These drugs act
through mechanisms that ultimately result in increased
synaptic dopamine by action at the dopamine transporter
(DAT). Cocaine inhibits the DAT, leading to increased syn-
aptic levels of dopamine, whereas amphetamine is a sub-
strate for the DAT and after binding can reverse the DAT
to pump dopamine into the synapse as well as enhance
vesicular release of dopamine upon transporter internal-
ization (for review, see Schmitt and Reith, 2010). This high
level of dopaminergic signaling in DAT-enriched regions
such as the “brain reward pathway,” composed of the VTA
and NAc, lead to the pleasurable sensation experienced by
drug users. In animal models, the effects of cocaine or
amphetamine are modeled by behavioral parameters of
self-administration, a model of human voluntary drug-
taking; locomotor activity after drug application, to assess
sensitization to drug application; or the association of drug
application with context, or conditioned place preference
(CPP).
1. Psychomotor Stimulants Alter Brain-Derived Neu-
rotrophic Factor Levels.
Short- and long-term cocaine
administration both cause increases in BDNF levels and
are associated with intracellular signaling pathways in
the brain reward pathway, and these changes persist
during drug withdrawal (Corominas et al., 2007; Russo
et al., 2009). A single dose of cocaine results in increased
BDNF mRNA expression in the NAc shell, but not the
NAc core region, the VTA, or the hippocampus (Russo et
al., 2009). In addition, BDNF protein expression as well
as TrkB autophosphorylation is augmented in NAc of
cocaine self-administering rats (Graham et al., 2007;
Graham et al., 2009) (Fig. 4A, B).
Furthermore, plasticity of reward-pathway circuitry is
known to be altered by long-term cocaine use. Previous
studies have demonstrated increased dendritic arboriza-
tion accompanied by elevated spine numbers after long-
term cocaine administration (Robinson and Kolb, 1999)
that correlates to a decreased threshold for LTP in the
reward pathway (Corominas et al., 2007). These observa-
tions may result from BDNF increases in reward-related
brain regions mentioned above (Russo et al., 2009). For
this reason, BDNF is widely studied in the changes in
behavior, morphology, and gene expression associated
with cocaine addiction.
2. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Infusions Alter
Addiction-Related Behaviors.
Direct infusion of BDNF
into the nigrostriatal and mesolimbic dopaminergic path-
way potentiates the stimulating effects of cocaine admin-
istration as assessed by locomotor activity (Corominas et
al., 2007). Infusion of BDNF into either the NAc or the
VTA results in enhanced locomotor sensitization with re-
peated cocaine administration (Corominas et al., 2007). In
a long-term cocaine self-administration model, infusion of
BDNF into NAc increases drug intake and drug-seeking
behavior, augments drug craving after withdrawal, and
enhances cue- and stress-induced reinstatement (Graham
et al., 2007). VTA targeted infusion of BDNF during with-
drawal also enhances cocaine-seeking behavior (Coromi-
nas et al., 2007). Collectively, these data imply a crucial
role for BDNF in facilitating drug-using, drug-
seeking, and relapse behaviors associated with the
brain reward pathway.
3. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Animal Models
Show Altered Addiction-Related Behaviors.
Locomotor
potentiation after an short-term dose of cocaine is
blunted in BDNF heterozygous mice (Corominas et al.,
2007). In addition, BDNF heterozygous mice show de-
layed locomotor sensitization to repeated cocaine admin-
istration (Corominas et al., 2007) as well as decreased
CPP (Corominas et al., 2007). Localized knockdown of
BDNF in the NAc results in reduced CPP and reduced
cocaine-reinforcement of drug-taking, whereas similar
viral deletion studies reveal that TrkB seems to be es-
sential for CPP (Graham et al., 2007, 2009). These find-
ings reveal that reduced reward-pathway expression of
250
AUTRY AND MONTEGGIA

BDNF or TrkB results in decreased rewarding effects of
cocaine usage.
The effects of BDNF in nucleus accumbens may be me-
diated through its receptor TrkB in a cell-type specific
manner (Lobo et al., 2010). TrkB signaling in NAc neurons
expressing D1 dopamine receptor seem to act to dampen
rewarding properties of cocaine (Lobo et al., 2010). In con-
trast, in D2-expressing neurons, TrkB signaling enhances
the rewarding properties of cocaine (Lobo et al., 2010). The
authors suggest that this difference in modulation is a
result of increased cell excitability in the absence of TrkB
signaling, which confers opposite effects on circuit level

Source of BDNF to NAc
FIG. 4. Schematic of the role of BDNF in the brain reward pathway associated with addiction. A, the brain reward pathway consists of the
mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway that projects from the VTA to the NAc. The NAc also receives excitatory input from limbic regions, including the
cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. The NAc in turn sends GABAergic projections to the thalamus via the “direct” and “indirect” pathways. B,
addictional research demonstrates that BDNF and TrkB signaling are enhanced in the NAc. Although BDNF mRNA levels are typically low in this
area, BDNF may be secreted from limbic regions as well as the VTA. [Adapted from Bolan˜os CA and Nestler EJ (2004) Neurotrophic mechanisms in

activity through D1 or D2 cell effects. Further dissection of
these distinct pathways will be necessary to attribute cell-
type specific effects of BDNF signaling in NAc with respect
to cocaine addiction-related behaviors. These data together
reveal an essential role for NAc BDNF signaling in the
rewarding effects of cocaine and propensity for relapse
with a potentially predominant behavioral effect through
signaling of D2 receptor-expressing cells.
B. Morphine
Abuse of opiate substances including morphine, opium,
and heroin, is a significant issue because of the high risk
for addiction, tolerance, and dependence. Opiates are iso-
lated from the seeds of the poppy plants and their effects
include analgesia, sedation, and euphoria. Opiates confer
these effects by binding to endogenous opioid receptors
divided into , , and  subtypes, which are highly en-
riched in the peripheral and central nervous system (Wit-
tert et al., 1996; Janecka et al., 2004). Like cocaine and
amphetamine, morphine addiction involves the “brain re-
ward circuitry,” in which BDNF seems to play a prominent
role. Intriguingly, human heroin addicts have significantly
lower serum levels of BDNF compared with nonaddicts
(Angelucci et al., 2007b). For this reason, researchers are
interested in studying the role of BDNF in morphine
addiction.
1. Morphine Effects on Brain-Derived Neurotrophic
Factor Signaling.
Animal models examining effects
of morphine demonstrate a significant regulation of
BDNF. Morphine treatment reduces BDNF expression
in VTA neurons (Chu et al., 2007). After withdrawal,
there is an immediate increase in BDNF protein expres-
sion in VTA followed by a decrease after long-term with-
drawal (Chu et al., 2007). BDNF mRNA expression is
also enhanced after long-term withdrawal from self-ad-
ministered heroin (Kuntz-Melcavage et al., 2009). Long-
term morphine administration does not seem to affect
BDNF or TrkB protein expression in hippocampus (Ar-
guello et al., 2009).
In locus ceruleus, the noradrenergic input to the VTA,
long-term morphine treatment in rodents increases bdnf
transcript expression by approximately 10% with no
change in trkb expression (Numan et al., 1998). However,
during opiate withdrawal, BDNF mRNA expression in-
creases by 2- to 3-fold up to 3 days after opiate removal
(Numan et al., 1998). This dramatic increase corresponds
to enhanced TrkB receptor expression within 6 h of with-
drawal (Numan et al., 1998). These data suggest that
BDNF signaling in the locus ceruleus may have an essen-
tial role in opiate withdrawal.
2. Effects of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Infu-
sion on Opiate-Induced Cellular Alterations.
A partic-
ularly striking effect of chronic morphine in rodent mod-
els is decreased VTA dopamine neuron cell size coupled
with enhanced tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression
(Sklair-Tavron et al., 1996). Long-term BDNF infusion
into VTA seems to oppose the effect of morphine to
increase TH levels and to decrease cell size by causing
negative feedback on intracellular ERK expression (Ber-
how et al., 1995, 1996; Sklair-Tavron et al., 1996).
3. Opiates in Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Mod-
els.
In postnatal conditional BDNF knockouts, mor-
phine withdrawal responses are attenuated (Akbarian
et al., 2002). It is noteworthy that loss of BDNF results
in attenuated cell morphology alterations in TH expres-
sion after long-term morphine treatment (Akbarian et
al., 2002). Taken together with previous data, BDNF
expression seems be enhanced during opiate with-
drawal, potentially to oppose the effects of long-term
morphine administration on VTA dopaminergic cell size
decrease. Future studies will be necessary to fully elu-
cidate the relationship of BDNF circuit-level signaling
on opiate addiction and withdrawal.
C. Nicotine and Alcohol
Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable
death in the United States and is responsible for nearly 1
in 5 deaths reported each year (Koop and Luoto, 2006). The
addictive compound in cigarette smoke is nicotine, which
binds to neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Studies
of human subjects addicted to cigarette smoking reveal
association with several BDNF SNPs (Beuten et al., 2005)
including the V66M polymorphism (Lang et al., 2007b) as
well as TrkB SNPs (Beuten et al., 2007), suggesting that
humans with altered BDNF signaling may be more likely
to become addicted and remain addicted to nicotine. A
recent meta-analysis suggests that several BDNF SNPs
are significantly correlated to initiation of smoking (Nu-
man et al., 1998) Gene interaction studies suggest that a
potential explanation for this association may be the influ-
ence of BDNF-TrkB signaling on regulation of nicotinic
receptor subunits 4 and 2 (Li et al., 2008).
Long-term nicotine administration in rodents leads to
increased protein expression of BDNF in the cortex and the
hippocampus (Czubak et al., 2009). Nicotine enhances
TrkB mRNA and protein expression in the cortex and the
striatum and decreases TrkB expression in the VTA (Sun
et al., 2007). In cultured neuroblastoma cells, nicotine in-
duces BDNF secretion (Serres and Carney, 2006). Taken
together, these data suggest that nicotine, via activation of
nicotinic receptors, may lead to BDNF release in the cortex
and the striatum; similar to effects of cocaine, BDNF-TrkB
signaling may enhance the rewarding properties of
smoking.
Alcohol dependence is the third leading cause of prevent-
able death in the United States (Mokdad et al., 2004).
Chronic alcoholism leads to degeneration of brain tissue
and can lead to Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome in adults. In
addition, alcohol consumption by pregnant women can
have severe impact on fetal development and can lead to
fetal alcohol syndrome. Analysis reveals that there may be
significant hereditary regulation of alcohol dependence
(Mokdad et al., 2004). Intriguingly, patients with alcohol
dependence display reduced serum levels of BDNF (Joe et
252
AUTRY AND MONTEGGIA

al., 2007). Human studies of BDNF SNPs show that the
V66M allele may be important for disease severity
(Grzywacz et al., 2010).
In animal studies, there is not a definitive effect of alco-
hol on BDNF expression in any brain region (for review,
see Davis, 2008). In-depth studies focusing on the effects of
long-term alcohol use and alcohol withdrawal are neces-
sary to fully understand the impact of alcohol on
BDNF-TrkB signaling and how mutations, loss, or
overactivation of BDNF signaling pathways may af-
fect alcohol dependence.
VI. Neurodevelopmental Disorders
A. Rett Syndrome
Rett syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurodevelopmental
disorder characterized by regressive cognitive and lan-
guage skills with autistic features, respiratory problems,
and stereotypical hand-wringing (Hagberg et al., 1983).
RTT is an X-linked disorder affecting around 1 in 10,000
live female births (Amaral et al., 2007). RTT is caused by
loss of function mutations in MeCP2 (Amir et al., 1999).
MeCP2 binds to methylated CpG islands, recruits core-
pressor proteins, and has been classically thought to limit
transcription of downstream genes (Lewis et al., 1992; Nan
et al., 1998; Adachi et al., 2009) although more recent
evidence suggests it may also activate transcription (Yasui
et al., 2007; Chahrour et al., 2008). Intriguingly, BDNF is
a target of MeCP2 and, given BDNF’s role in synaptic
plasticity and neuronal development, is of great interest in
the study of RTT (Chen et al., 2003a).
Patients with RTT have been reported to show abnor-
malities in brain structure, primarily shortened dendrites
in cortical and limbic regions (Chapleau et al., 2009). Clin-
ical studies have not yet linked structural alterations to
changes in BDNF levels in serum or cerebrospinal fluid
(Amaral et al., 2007). In mouse models of MeCP2 deletion,
it seems that although deletion of this gene does initially
increase BDNF expression, BDNF expression decreases
over time (Chang et al., 2006). Recent studies have tried to
better elucidate the link between MeCP2 and BDNF using
mouse transgenic models. The combination of MeCP2 null
with deletion of BDNF results in more severe behavioral
and synaptic deficits than MeCP2 deletion alone (Chang et
al., 2006). Conversely, overexpression of BDNF in MeCP2-
null mice delays the onset of RTT-associated features
(Chang et al., 2006), further suggesting a link between
alterations in BDNF levels and MeCP2.
B. Rubinstein-Taybi Syndrome
Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome (RTS) is a rare illness af-
fecting approximately 1 in 100,000 to 125,000 live births
and is associated with mental retardation, delayed growth,
and distinct facial features (Roelfsema and Peters, 2007).
Inheritance patterns show that the disease is autosomal
dominant (Hallam and Bourtchouladze, 2006) and caused
by sporadic de novo gene mutations (Roelfsema and Peters,
2007). Clinical studies have identified a multitude of mu-
tations (for review, see Roelfsema and Peters, 2007) in
CREB binding protein (CBP) and more recently homolog
p300 as causative for 55% of patients presenting with
this rare syndrome (Hennekam, 2006). It remains unclear
whether mutations in CBP lead to loss-of-function or dom-
inant-negative proteins (Hallam and Bourtchouladze,
2006).
CBP and p300 have activity and form complexes with
transcription factors to activate gene transcription (Hal-
lam and Bourtchouladze, 2006). Because only 55% of
patients with RTS have a known mutation, researchers
are interested in examining other proteins involved in
transcriptional activation associated with RTS (Hen-
nekam, 2006). As mentioned in section I.A, BDNF is a gene
with a cAMP response element in its promoter region, and
thus is a target of CREB. Intriguingly, mice heterozygous
for CBP have impairments in learning and memory tasks
accompanied by decreased BDNF transcription (Hallam
and Bourtchouladze, 2006). These observations suggest
that future study of BDNF’s role in symptoms of RTS and
its potential as a therapeutic target for treating RTS may
be worthwhile to pursue.
VII. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor and
Eating Disorders
Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are
the most prevalent eating disorders in the United States
and affect up to 3% of women(Becker et al., 1999). These
disorders are associated with distorted attitudes toward
weight and body image that result in pathological eating
behaviors and inability to maintain a healthy weight
(Klein and Walsh, 2004). Studies have revealed a strong
genetic contribution to eating disorders. Given the high
comorbidity of AN and BN with anxiety and depression-
like symptoms (Ivarsson et al., 2000; Thornton et al.,
2011), BDNF is a gene of interest in feeding behavior and
weight (Rask-Andersen et al., 2010).
A. Animal Studies
Studies of BDNF animal models have revealed that loss
of BDNF results in increased weight. BDNF heterozygous
mice display hyperphagia as well as weight gain in early
life (Hashimoto et al., 2005a). Likewise, conditional BDNF
knockout mice and inducible BDNF KO mice show higher
body weight after BDNF deletion (Monteggia et al., 2004;
Hashimoto et al., 2005a). This elevation in body weight in
conditional BDNF KO mice is associated with increased
levels of circulating hormones such as leptin, insulin, glu-
cose, and cholesterol (Hashimoto et al., 2005a). These hor-
mones are linked to increased food intake (Hashimoto et
al., 2005a). It is noteworthy that the weight phenotype in
BDNF heterozygous mice can be reversed by treatment
with fluoxetine or intraventricular infusion of BDNF
(Hashimoto et al., 2005a). These data suggest an
BDNF AND NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS
253

emerging role for BDNF in feeding behavior and
weight maintenance.
B. Human Studies
Clinical studies have studied potential linkage of the
known C270T and V66M BDNF polymorphisms to eating
disorders. In several patient populations, studies have
shown positive correlations between subtypes of AN and
BN to these BDNF alleles. Several European and Japa-
nese studies have demonstrated that the V66M allele is
associated with eating disorders (Koizumi et al., 2004;
Ribase´s et al., 2005; Dmitrzak-Weglarz et al., 2007), par-
ticularly with all subtypes of AN and purging-type BN,
although this finding is not unequivocal (Friedel et al.,
2005; Dardennes et al., 2007; Rybakowski et al., 2007).
Only a few patient populations have revealed a correlation
between the C270T allele and bulimia nervosa (Ribase´s et
al., 2004); the majority of data suggest no association with
anorexia nervosa or other eating disorders (Ribase´s et al.,
2005; Rybakowski et al., 2007), leaving uncertain the role
of this polymorphism in eating disorder pathophysiology
(Hashimoto et al., 2005a).
VIII. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic
Factor-Based Therapeutics
As described in this review, BDNF is associated with a
multitude of psychiatric disorders. Methods of manipulat-
ing BDNF expression and signaling are of great interest
for development of novel therapeutics for psychiatric ill-
nesses. However, there are major caveats to targeting
BDNF, such as the fact that levels of BDNF are main-
tained within an optimal range in neurons and also be-
cause each disease seems to be associated with brain-
region-specific alterations in BDNF. For example,
therapies that increase or decrease BDNF levels or signal-
ing activity outside this range, or in incorrect neural circuit
regions, may lead to neuronal excitotoxicity, undesired in-
creased growth or survival of tumor cells, or cardiovascular
side effects (Price et al., 2007). Another drawback to use of
chemical modulators of BDNF signaling is the lack of
mechanistic insight into their ability to increase BDNF. As
noted in sections II.A and IV.A, many therapies for schizo-
phrenia and depression have indirect effects on BDNF
levels (Price et al., 2007), although the mechanism for this
modulation is unknown. Furthermore, the use of recombi-
nant BDNF molecules has not been successful in clinical
trials because of side effects (Chao et al., 2006), inability to
cross the blood-brain barrier with systemic treatment, and
complications associated with surgical infusion of proteins
directly into the brain (Monteggia, 2011).
To overcome these limitations, efforts have been made to
synthesize short peptide sequences that mimic growth fac-
tors to more selectively target receptors. BDNF “mimetic”
peptides have been developed in the last several years
(Yang et al., 2005; Fletcher et al., 2008; Jang et al., 2010).
Preclinical studies have yet to fully characterize these
BDNF mimetic peptides, but recent evidence suggests that
7,8-dihydroxyflavone may enhance fear-conditioned mem-
ory in rodents (Andero et al., 2011). Further study will be
necessary to understand the full potential of these mole-
cules in various disease models and characterize specificity
for TrkB receptors.
Recent evidence has suggested that ketamine, a well
known anesthetic with NMDA receptor antagonist activ-
ity, is effective in very low doses for treatment of both MDD
(Berman et al., 2000; Zarate et al., 2006; Price et al., 2009)
and BD (Diazgranados et al., 2010). Our laboratory has
demonstrated that this drug may elevate protein levels of
BDNF through a translational mechanism involving the
eukaryotic elongation factor-2 pathway (Autry et al.,
2011). Intriguingly, we also observed that use of the eu-
karyotic elongation factor-2 kinase inhibitors rottlerin and
1-benzyl-3-cetyl-2-methylimidazolium iodide (NH125) re-
sulted in molecular and behavioral effects similar to those
of ketamine. These exciting findings suggest that modula-
tion of BDNF at the protein level via a fast-acting trans-
lation pathway may offer a clinically applicable mecha-
nism for increasing BDNF in the optimal physiological
range.
IX. Conclusions and Future Directions
By virtue of its critical role in development, synaptic
plasticity, and neuronal cell health, BDNF is a vital com-
ponent to normal brain function. For this reason, it has
been studied extensively in relation to psychiatric disor-
ders associated with abnormal brain development and
function. It is clear that BDNF has a prominent role in the
pathophysiology associated with disorders such as MDD,
SZ, BD, anxiety-related disorders, addiction, RTT, and eat-
ing disorders. However, future work will be necessary to
determine whether BDNF is a risk factor for initiation or
maintenance or in the recovery process with respect to
each of these distinct disorders and how its circuit-level
function contributes at each of these stages. In addition,
the search for more effective and applicable BDNF-based
therapies is crucial in light of the impact BDNF lends to
these disease processes.
