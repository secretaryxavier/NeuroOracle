Abstract
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a role in the maintenance and function of neurons. Although persons with
Alzheimer’s disease have lower cortical levels of BDNF, evidence regarding the association between circulating BDNF and
cognitive function is conflicting. We sought to determine the correlates of BDNF level and whether BDNF level was
prospectively associated with cognitive decline in healthy older adults. We measured serum BDNF near baseline in 912
individuals. Cognitive status was assessed repeatedly with the modified Mini-Mental Status Examination and the Digit
Symbol Substitution test over the next 10 years. We evaluated the association between BDNF and cognitive decline with
longitudinal models. We also assessed the association between BDNF level and demographics, comorbidities and health
behaviors. We found an association between serum BDNF and several characteristics that are also associated with dementia
(race and depression), suggesting that future studies should control for these potential confounders. We did not find
evidence of a longitudinal association between serum BDNF and subsequent cognitive test trajectories in older adults,
although we did identify a potential trend toward a cross-sectional association. Our results suggest that serum BDNF may
have limited utility as a biomarker of prospective cognitive decline.

Introduction
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of a family of
neurotrophins which play an important role in the development,
maintenance and function of neurons [1–4]. In humans, BDNF
levels are lower in AD patients than controls in the hippocampus
and cortical regions associated with AD; in the healthy adult
mouse, BDNF levels are high in brain regions associated with
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [5–9]. BDNF also circulates in the blood,
where it appears to be stored in platelets and is released through
physical or chemical platelet activation [10]. While BDNF can
cross the blood-brain barrier, the extent to which blood derived
BDNF levels are a reasonable proxy for BDNF in the central
nervous system is unclear [11,12].
The research community hoped that circulating BDNF could
provide a less invasive, inexpensive biomarker for dementia; but so
far, there is conflicting evidence in the literature regarding the
association between BDNF and cognition decline and dementia.
Some studies indicate serum BDNF is higher in controls than
persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD or dementia
[13–15], others indicate the opposite direction of association [16],
and some studies show no association [17–19]. Confounding may
explain some of these discrepancies – many studies examining
associations between BDNF and cognitive status used basic tests of
group differences with minimal controls for confounding and few
have examined the longitudinal association between BDNF and
cognitive change. To our knowledge, only two other studies have
examined cognitive change and blood based BDNF; one study in
AD patients found lower BDNF predicted more rapid cognitive
decline but the other study found no association in a group of
healthy older adults [20,21]. Additional studies with careful
controls for potential confounders are necessary.

In this analysis, our goal was two-fold. First, we aimed to
elucidate correlates of BDNF, as they show some inconsistencies in
the
literature.
Substantial
evidence
supports
an association
between depression and lower serum BDNF but evidence
regarding correlations between BDNF and basic characteristics
like sex, age, and BMI is equivocal. Second, we aimed to evaluate
the association between BDNF and cognitive decline, especially
after
consideration
of
potential
confounders
using
a
large
prospective cohort of cognitively healthy older adults with
cognitive performance evaluated at multiple time points over a
lengthy follow-up. The cohort is biracial (black and white) which
allows examination of possible differences in BDNF by race, which
other studies have lacked sufficient diversity to address.
Methods
Ethics Statement
The Institutional Review Boards at all clinical sites (University
of Pittsburgh, University of Tennessee- Memphis) and the
University of California – San Francisco coordinating center
approved the study protocol and all participants signed informed
consent.
Participants
Participants were enrolled in the Health, Aging and Body
Composition (Health ABC) study, a prospective cohort of 3075
community-dwelling black and white older adults living in
Memphis, Tennessee and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Participants
were recruited from a random sample of Medicare-eligible adults
living within designated zip codes. Participants were eligible if they
reported no difficulties performing activities of daily living, walking
a quarter mile, climbing 10 steps without resting, were free from
life-threatening cancers, and planned to remain in the study area
for at least 3 years. All patients signed an informed consent form
that was approved by the institutional review boards of each
clinical site and the data coordinating center. Serum BDNF levels
were measured in a subset of 1000 participants, selected by
stratified random sample, excluding those with possible dementia
(3MS ,80 at baseline). The BDNF measurements for 77
participants were missing for technical reasons, and 11 participants
were missing cognitive testing at included time points leaving an
analytical sample of 912.
Measures
Serum BDNF was measured at the first follow-up visit (year 2).
Fasting blood samples were obtained by standard venipuncture
with serum was stored at 270uC and shipped directly to the
analytical laboratory in Minneapolis, MN. Assays were performed
by R&D Systems’ Analytical Testing Service, employing an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The detection limit
for this assay is 1250 pg/mL. The mean inter-assay coefficient of
variation is 9.2% and the mean coefficient of variation within
assay is 6.5%. Covariates examined were assessed at year 2 where
available. If unavailable, assessments from an adjacent year were
used (e.g., platelet count was measured in year 3, drinking/
smoking behavior measured at baseline). Participants
were
considered depressed if they scored greater or equal to 16 on
the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) at
baseline
or
reported
treatment
for
depression
at
baseline
(medication verified). Potential covariates included demographic
characteristics, cardiovascular comorbidities, Apolipoprotein e4
carrier status, BDNF Val66Met Met(A) carrier status (SNP
rs6265), health behaviors, and platelet count, which was previously
found to be an important predictor of BDNF [22]. Seasonal
fluctuation in serum BDNF has been reported; we examined
December – May vs June – November differences, based on
previously published results [23]. Literacy was measured with the
Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), an
instrument for which individuals read common health-related
words aloud (e.g., germs, prescription, diagnosis) [24]. Cognition
was assessed using repeated measurement of the Modified Mini-
Mental State Examination (3MS) (tested at years 3, 5, 8, 10, and
11) and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) (tested at years
5, 8, 10, and 11) [25,26]. The 3MS test evaluates global cognitive
function and ranges from 0 to 100; the DSST mainly evaluates
executive function and has a range of 0–90.
Statistical Analysis
After examining the distribution of the BDNF measurements
and finding a limited number of extreme values, we trimmed the
data to exclude the top and bottom 1% to reduce the possibility of
influential observations outside of the typical range unduly
impacting the model results. This excluded ten values at or above
47.3 ng/mL (range: 47.3–63.1) and ten values at or below 5.5 ng/
mL (range: 2.3–5.5), resulting in a final data range of 5.6 ng/mL –
47.25 ng/mL. The association between BDNF and participant
demographic and comorbid characteristics was characterized
using BDNF tertiles and tested with Chi-square tests and
ANOVA, where appropriate. We constructed a multivariate
linear regression model using covariates with p,0.20 to examine
the association between predictors and BDNF after simultaneous
adjustment.
We assessed the relationship between BDNF and cognitive test
scores using linear mixed-effects regression models with random
slopes and intercepts. BDNF and platelet count were standardized
so that coefficients could be interpreted as change in cognition
associated with a one standard deviation increase in BDNF or
platelet count. We examined the relationship in both unadjusted
and adjusted models. The adjusted model contained covariates
which differed significantly between BDNF tertiles (p#0.05),
covariates which were significant predictors of BDNF in the
adjusted model (p#0.05), and other covariates known to be
important in modeling cognitive scores (study site, age, APOE e4,
race, literacy, and education).
Results
Correlates of BDNF
BDNF measurements were generally normally distributed with
a small number of extreme values in the right tail. As such, the
data was trimmed to exclude the top and bottom 1% of BDNF
observations. BDNF tertiles were significantly associated with
platelet count, sex, race, Met carrier (Val66Met genotype), history
of MI, and smoking (Table 1). Females, blacks, smokers, and those
with high platelet counts had higher BDNF. History of myocardial
infarction (MI) and carrying the rarer Met allele was associated
with lower BDNF. Although depression did not quite meet the
p,0.20 cut-off from Table 1 (p = 0.22), we included it in the
multivariate model predicting BDNF because of its strong
association with BDNF in the literature. We found that race,
depression, and platelet count were significant predictors of BDNF
after simultaneous adjustment in a multivariate model. BDNF
levels in blacks were 1.81 ng/mL higher than whites (95% CI:
1.19, 2.43) and were 2.84 ng/mL lower in participants with
depression (95% CI:25.17, 20.51). A one standard deviation
increase in platelet count was associated with a 1.81 ng/mL
increase in BDNF levels (95% CI: 1.19, 2.43). The BDNF estimate
for females was 1.04ng/mL higher, although it was no longer

significant (95% CI:20.17, 2.24). Smoking, history of MI, and
Met allele carrier status were no longer significant after adjustment
for other factors.
Cognitive Decline
The median number of 3MS observations per person was 4
(range: 1–5); the median number of DSST observations per person
was 3 (range: 1– 4). In both unadjusted and adjusted analyses, we
found no significant association between BDNF and performance
on either cognitive test, cross-sectionally or longitudinally (Table 2).
There was a slight trend toward higher cross-sectional perfor-
mance on DSST associated with higher BDNF, but it was not
significant (p = 0.09). Performing the same analysis using the log of
BDNF, rather than trimmed BDNF values, resulted in the same
conclusions. There were no significant interactions between race
and BDNF for either cognitive test. A recent study on the
association between dementia treatment and serum BDNF found
that treatment increased BDNF levels in persons with AD [27].
Four participants in this sample were prescribed dementia
medications throughout the follow-up period; results excluding
these individuals did not differ appreciably from the primary
results.
Discussion
Serum BDNF showed strong associations with race, platelet
count, and depression after adjusting for other factors, and weak
associations with a number of other participant characteristics. We
found that blacks had higher levels of BDNF than whites, a unique
finding which has not been addressed in the literature so far. It is
unclear whether the race differential in BDNF is due to
unmeasured factors differing between blacks and whites or true
biological differences. The strong association between BDNF and
platelet count is consistent with theory that BDNF in serum is
derived directly from platelets. Age did not differ significantly
among serum BDNF tertiles which is in concordance with results
from some studies [13–16,28–30] and in conflict with others
[19,31,32], although two of the studies which found an age effect
included a wider age range than our study. Initially, we found that
sex differed significantly between BDNF tertiles but sex was not a

significant predictor of BDNF in a model adjusted for other
covariates.
We did not identify any longitudinal associations between
BDNF and cognition; this is in agreement with the other
longitudinal study of blood based BDNF in cognitively normal
older adults [21]. However, a longitudinal study using CSF-
derived BDNF found that lower baseline CSF BDNF levels were
significantly associated with greater annual decline on several tests
of memory and category fluency in cognitively normal older adults
[33]. This contrast may suggest that blood based measures of
BDNF are not representative of CSF BDNF levels. A study
comparing CSF and serum BDNF measurements in a sample of
AD patients found that they were not correlated (r2 = 0.03, n = 27);
however, a study comparing blood and BDNF levels in pigs and
rats found significant positive correlation between the two in both
pigs and rats (r2 = 0.41, 0.44, respectively) [13,34]. Further study
will be required to better understand the relationship between
cortical, cerebrospinal fluid, and circulating levels of BDNF in
humans. The trend toward a cross-sectional association and the
lack of longitudinal association, combined with previous published
work, may suggest that changes in BDNF occur contemporane-
ously with cognitive decline, as opposed to preceding decline. This
would limit the utility of BDNF as a biomarker for early detection
but does not preclude the potential for BDNF to play a useful
diagnostic role.
Comparison of our raw and adjusted analyses demonstrates that
confounders may have a profound effect on the estimate of the
relationship between BDNF and cognition, particularly cross-
sectionally. Many previous studies chose to use nonparametric
group tests due to concerns that the BDNF distribution showed
departures from normality. While extreme values and departures
from normality are a concern, our results suggest that confounding
may be a much greater concern, especially in the presence of an
adequate sample size.
Strengths of this analysis include the prospective nature of the
study, large biracial sample, and ability to control for multiple
potential confounders. This analysis was limited by data collection
occurring at different time points for some variables, such as
platelet count. The negative impact of this is likely minimal as no
covariate assessment occurred more than a year from BDNF blood
draw and comparisons of platelet counts measured in years 3 and
11 suggest high intra-person correlation of platelet count over time
(Spearman correlation coefficient 0.73). It is possible that our
relatively healthy sample of older adults without dementia at
baseline lacked sufficient variability in BDNF to detect associations
reported elsewhere, although the serum BDNF range exhibited in
our data is consistent with other similar studies. There is evidence
that treatment for depression raises BDNF levels [35]. Our
depression definition was partially based on treatment for
depression, which makes it difficult to untangle the separate
associations with depression and antidepressants. It is possible that
our estimate of the association between BDNF and depression was
attenuated due to the mixture of treated and untreated individuals.
We were limited to evaluating two cognitive tests with repeated
assessment in this sample (DSST and 3MS), which may not
provide a complete picture of cognitive status and change.
After adjustment for confounding, our analysis provides no
evidence that serum BDNF is prospectively associated with decline
on DSST or 3MS. We found that serum BDNF was associated
with a number of characteristics which also associated with
dementia, which suggests that future studies should control for
these potential confounders.
