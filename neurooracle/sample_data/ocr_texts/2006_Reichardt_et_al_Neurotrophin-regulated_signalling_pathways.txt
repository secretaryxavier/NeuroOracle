Neurotrophins are a family of closely related proteins that were identiﬁed initially as survival factors
for sensory and sympathetic neurons, and have since been shown to control many aspects of survival,
development and function of neurons in both the peripheral and the central nervous systems. Each of
the four mammalian neurotrophins has been shown to activate one or more of the three members of
the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TrkA, TrkB and TrkC). In
addition, each neurotrophin activates p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a member of the tumour
necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Through Trk receptors, neurotrophins activate Ras,
phosphatidyl inositol-3 (PI3)-kinase, phospholipase C-g1 and signalling pathways controlled
through these proteins, such as the MAP kinases. Activation of p75NTR results in activation of the
nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) and Jun kinase as well as other signalling pathways. Limiting quantities of
neurotrophins during development control the number of surviving neurons to ensure a match
between neurons and the requirement for a suitable density of target innervation. The neurotrophins
also regulate cell fate decisions, axon growth, dendrite growth and pruning and the expression of
proteins, such as ion channels, transmitter biosynthetic enzymes and neuropeptide transmitters that
are essential for normal neuronal function. Continued presence of the neurotrophins is required in the
adult nervous system, where they control synaptic function and plasticity, and sustain neuronal
survival, morphology and differentiation. They also have additional, subtler roles outside the nervous
system. In recent years, three rare human genetic disorders, which result in deleterious effects on
sensory perception, cognition and a variety of behaviours, have been shown to be attributable to
mutations in brain-derived neurotrophic factor and two of the Trk receptors.

1. INTRODUCTION
Neurotrophins were identiﬁed as promoters of
neuronal survival, but it is appreciated that they
regulate many aspects of neuronal development and
function, including synapse formation and synaptic
plasticity (Lewin & Barde 1996; Bibel & Barde 2000;
Kaplan & Miller 2000; Huang et al. 2001; Poo 2001;
Shooter 2001; Sofroniew et al. 2001; Dechant & Barde
2002; Chao 2003; Huang & Reichardt 2003; Lu et al.
2005). The ﬁrst neurotrophin, nerve growth factor
(NGF), was discovered during a search for survival
factors that could explain the deleterious effects of
deletion of target tissues on the subsequent survival of
motor and sensory neurons (Levi-Montalcini 1987;
Shooter 2001). Its discovery validated the central
model of neurotrophic factor action—that targets of
neuronal innervation secrete limiting amounts of
survival factors, which function to balance the size
of a target tissue with the number of innervating
neurons. The second neurotrophin to be characterized—
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)—was
puriﬁed in a heroic effort from pig brain as a survival
factor for several neuronal populations not responsive to
NGF (Barde et al. 1982). Conserved features of the
sequences of these two proteins made isolation of clones
encoding additional members of this family possible.
Four neurotrophins are expressed in mammals: NGF,
BDNF, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4
(NT-4).Membersofnumerousotherfamiliesofproteins,
most notably the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor
family, also regulate neuronal survival and other aspects
ofneuronaldevelopmentandfunctionthroughactivation
of receptor tyrosine kinases, but the neurotrophins have
continuedtobeafocusforresearchandsourceofsurprise
(ﬁgures 1 and 2).
The neurotrophins have had an unusually important
role in developmental neurobiology. The experiments
leading to their discovery revealed the essential role of
cellular interactions in controlling cell survival and
differentiation ( Jacobson et al. 1997). Preceding
serious studies on membrane transport and endocy-
tosis in other cells, neuroscientists have shown that
NGF was internalized by receptor-dependent pro-
cesses and transported along axons in membranous
vesicles to the cell soma by cytoskeletal and energy-
dependent processes (Thoenen & Barde 1980).
Signalling locally was shown to regulate growth cone
motility, while signalling in the cell soma controlled
cell survival and gene expression. Ligand turnover
was shown to occur in lysosomes. It is clear that all cells
use similar mechanisms to control ligand and receptor
trafﬁcking, signalling and degradation. Finally, neuro-
trophins activate receptor tyrosine kinases (Chao 2003).
During the past 15 years receptor-associated and
cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases have been shown to

regulate almost all aspects of neuronal development
and function, including precursor proliferation and
commitment, cell survival, axon and dendrite growth,
membrane trafﬁcking, synapse formation and function,
as well as glial differentiation and interactions with
neurons. Many of the mechanisms through which
neurotrophins control neural development and func-
tion have proven to be shared with these ligand and
tyrosine kinase families. As a result, studies on
neurotrophins have increased our understanding of
molecular mechanisms of interest to almost all modern
neuroscientists. In addition, recent studies have
revealed a diversity of roles for these factors outside
the
nervous
system,
most
notably
in
cardiac
development, neovascularization and immune system
function (Donovan et al. 2000; Lin et al. 2000; Coppola
et al. 2004; Kermani et al. 2005).
Finally, several human genetic diseases have been
associated with mutations in neurotrophins or their
receptors. Several different mutation types in the trkA
gene, including nonsense, missense, frame shift and
splice site mutations, have been identiﬁed in congenital
insensitivity to pain with anhydrosis (CIPA) patients
(Indo 2001). The phenotypes associated with CIPA are
believed to result in large part from loss of NGF-
dependent neurons, including nociceptive sensory and
sympathetic neurons, during embryogenesis. A domin-
ant mutation in trkB (Y722C) that impairs TrkB kinase
signalling has recently been described in a patient with
severe hyperphagic obesity and severe impairments in
nociception, learning and memory (Yeo et al. 2004).
Several additional missense mutations in trkB have
been identiﬁed in this patient cohort that has not been
characterized functionally. A polymorphism in the bdnf
gene that impairs the transport of BDNF protein has
been associated with impaired hippocampal function
and episodic memory (Egan et al. 2003).
This review focuses on the signalling pathways
stimulated by the neurotrophins that affect the survival,
differentiation and function of cells within the nervous
system. Several excellent reviews describe recent
progress in understanding the developmental and
functional roles of these proteins (Bibel & Barde 2000;
Huang & Reichardt 2001; Patapoutian & Reichardt
2001; Sofroniew et al. 2001; Dechant & Barde 2002;
Chao 2003; Chao & Lee 2004; Lu et al. 2005).
2. NEUROTROPHINS AND THEIR RECEPTORS
The neurotrophins and their genes share homologies in
sequence and structure. The organization of the
genomic segments adjacent to these genes is also
similar. Together, these observations provide compel-
ling evidence that the neurotrophin genes have arisen
through successive duplications of a portion of the
genome derived from an ancestral chordate (Hallbook
1999). Their genes share many similarities, including
the existence of multiple promoters. The protein
product of each gene includes a signal sequence and a
prodomain, followed by the mature neurotrophin
sequence. Thus, each gene product must be processed
by proteolysis to form a mature protein. A surprising
recent work has demonstrated that regulation of their
maturation is an important post-transcriptional control
point that limits and adds speciﬁcity to their actions
(Lee et al. 2001). The mature neurotrophin proteins
are non-covalently associated homodimers. Although
some neurotrophin monomers are able to form
heterodimers with other neurotrophin monomers
in vitro, there is no evidence that these heterodimers
exist at signiﬁcant concentrations in vivo.
The structures of NGF, NT-3 and NT-4 homodimers
and of the BDNF monomer, associated with NT-3 and
NT-4 monomers, have been solved (McDonald et al.
1991; Robinson et al. 1995; Butte et al. 1998). Each of
these four proteins shares a highly homologous structure
with features—tertiary fold and cystine knot—that are
present in several other growth factors, including

Figure 1. Neurotrophin–receptor interactions. This illustrates
the major interactions of each of the four mammalian
neurotrophins. Each proneurotrophin binds p75NTR, but
not the Trk receptors. Following maturation through
proteolysis of the proneurotrophins, each mature neurotro-
phin is able to bind and activate p75NTR, but exhibits more
speciﬁc interactions with the three Trk receptors. NGF binds
speciﬁcally TrkA; BDNF and NT4 recognize TrkB; NT3
activates TrkC. In some cellular contexts, NT3 is also able to
activate TrkA and TrkB with less efﬁciency. For simplicity,
only the major tyrosine kinase-containing isoforms of the Trk
receptors are depicted. Differential splicing generates iso-
forms of TrkB and TrkC that have truncated cytoplasmic
domains lacking a tyrosine kinase motif. Splicing also
generates an isoform of TrkC with a small insert in the kinase
domain that affects substrate speciﬁcity. Splicing of exons that
generate the extracellular domain of each Trk receptor results
in the expression of receptors with small peptide inserts
between the second immunoglobin and transmembrane
domains that affect ligand-binding speciﬁcity. Ligand-binding
speciﬁcity is also affected by the presence of p75NTR.

Figure 2. Neurotrophin signalling. This depicts the interactions of each neurotrophin with Trk and p75NTR receptors and major intracellular signalling pathways activated through each
receptor. The p75NTR receptor regulates three major signalling pathways. NF-kB activation results in transcription of multiple genes, including several that promote neuronal survival.
Activation of the Jun kinase pathway similarly controls activation of several genes, some of which promote neuronal apoptosis. Ligand engagement of p75NTR also regulates the activity of
Rho, which controls growth cone motility. Pro-apoptosis actions of p75NTR appear to require the presence of sortilin, which functions as a co-receptor for the neurotrophins. Sortilin is not
depicted in this ﬁgure, but is described in the text. Each Trk receptor also controls three major signalling pathways. Activation of Ras results in activation of the MAP kinase-signalling
cascade, which promotes neuronal differentiation including neurite outgrowth. Activation of PI3 kinase through Ras or Gab1 promotes survival and growth of neurons and other cells.
Activation of PLC-g1 results in activation of Ca2C- and protein kinase C-regulated pathways that promote synaptic plasticity. Each of these signalling pathways also regulates gene
transcription. Many additional adaptors for p75NTR and Trk receptors have been identiﬁed which are not depicted in this ﬁgure for simplicity, but are described in more detail in the text.

transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) and platelet-
derived growth factor. Additional neurotrophins have
been isolated from ﬁsh, where NT-6 and NT-7 have been
characterized. These do not have orthologues in
mammals or birds and appear to interact with the same
receptors as the mammalian proteins.
The neurotrophins interact with two entirely distinct
classes of receptors. The ﬁrst receptor to be discovered,
named p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), was
identiﬁed as a low-afﬁnity receptor for NGF, but was
subsequently shown to bind each of the neurotrophins
with a similar afﬁnity (Rodriguez-Tebar et al. 1990;
Frade & Barde 1998). p75NTR is a member of the
tumour necrosis receptor superfamily with an extra-
cellular domain that includes four cysteine-rich motifs,
a single transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic
domain that includes a ‘death’ domain similar to those
present in other members of this family (Liepinsh et al.
1997; He & Garcia 2004). Although this receptor does
not contain a catalytic motif, it interacts with several
proteins, to be described in more detail later, that
transmit signals important for regulating neuronal
survival and differentiation as well as synaptic plasticity.
The three-dimensional structure of the extracellular
domain of p75NTR in association with an NGF dimer
has demonstrated that each of the four cysteine-rich
repeats participates in binding to NGF (He & Garcia
2004). Interestingly, p75NTR binds NGF along the
interface between the two NGF monomers and binding
results in a conformational change in NGF that alters
the monomeric interface on the opposite side of the
NGF dimer, eliminating the potential for binding of
one NGF dimer to two p75NTR monomers. The
results suggest that binding of NGF to p75NTR may
result in dissociation of p75NTR multimers and are
compatible with the possibility that tropomyosin-
related kinase (Trk) and p75NTR monomers simul-
taneously bind the same neurotrophin dimer. Of recent
interest, a gene related to p75NTR, named NRH-2,
has recently been identiﬁed. The product of this gene
lacks the extracellular cysteine-rich repeats present in
p75NTR and fails to bind NGF, but it is able to
interact and inﬂuence the ligand-binding properties of
TrkA (Murray et al. 2004).
In mammals, the three members of the Trk
subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases constitute the
second major class of neurotrophin receptors (Chao
2003; Huang & Reichardt 2003). Gene duplication has
resulted in the presence of additional Trk receptors in
ﬁsh. A single Trk orthologue has been characterized in
Amphioxus, which is expressed in sensory neural
precursors and is able to interact with each of the
mammalian neurotrophins (Benito-Gutierrez et al.
2005). In contrast, neither trk nor neurotrophin genes
have been identiﬁed in the genome of the ascidian
Ciona (Dehal et al. 2002). Thus, Trk receptors appear
to have arisen during the chordate radiation before the
cephalochordate–vertebrate split. The extracellular
domain of each of the Trk receptors consists of a
cysteine-rich cluster followed by three leucine-rich
repeats, another cysteine-rich cluster and two immu-
noglobulin-like domains. Each receptor spans the
membrane once and is terminated with a cytoplasmic
domain consisting of a tyrosine kinase domain
surrounded by several tyrosines that serve as phos-
phorylation-dependent docking sites for cytoplasmic
adaptors and enzymes. In contrast to interactions with
p75NTR,
the
neurotrophins
dimerize
the
Trk
receptors, resulting in activation through transphos-
phorylation of the kinases present in their cytoplasmic
domains. The four neurotrophins exhibit speciﬁcity in
their interactions with the three members of this
receptor family with NGF activating TrkA, BDNF
and NT-4 activating TrkB, and NT-3 activating TrkC.
In addition, NT-3 can activate the other Trk receptors
with less efﬁciency. The major site at which neuro-
trophins interact with these receptors is in the
membrane-proximal immunoglobulin-like domain.
The three-dimensional structures of this domain in
each of the Trk receptors have been solved (Ultsch et al.
1999). In addition, the structure of NGF bound to the
TrkA Ig domain has also been determined (Wiesmann
et al. 1999). The results have made it possible to
identify residues in the neurotrophins and the Trk
receptors that account for the speciﬁcity observed in
their interactions (Urfer et al. 1998; Wiesmann &
de Vos 2001).
As a ﬁrst approximation, expression of a speciﬁc Trk
receptor confers responsiveness to the neurotrophins to
which it binds. Splicing, however, introduces some
limitations to this generalization. For example, differ-
ential splicing affects ligand interactions of each of the
Trk receptors through insertions of short amino acid
sequences into the juxtamembrane regions of the
extracellular domains of TrkA, TrkB and TrkC
(Meakin et al. 1992; Clary & Reichardt 1994; Shelton
et al. 1995; Garner et al. 1996; Strohmaier et al. 1996).
For both TrkA and TrkB, the insertion of the sequence
encoded by a small exon enhances the binding of the
receptor to non-preferred ligands. TrkA and TrkB
isoforms that lack these inserts are activated strongly
only by NGF and BDNF, respectively. The isoform of
TrkA including an insert is also activated by NT-3 in
addition to NGF (Clary & Reichardt 1994), while the
similar isoform of TrkB is activated by NT-3 and NT-4
in addition to BDNF (Strohmaier et al. 1996).
Although the TrkA insert was not localized in the
crystal structure of the membrane-proximal Ig domain
complexed to NGF, the organization of this complex is
compatible with the possibility that these residues
participate
directly
in
neurotrophin
binding
(Wiesmann et al. 1999).
Differential splicing of exons encoding portions of
the intracellular domains of Trk receptors also
regulates the signalling initiated by neurotrophin
binding. Splicing generates isoforms of TrkB and
TrkC that include comparatively short cytoplasmic
motifs without a tyrosine kinase domain. Expression of
a non-kinase-containing isoform has been shown to
inhibit productive dimerization of kinase-containing
Trk receptors, thereby inhibiting responses to neuro-
trophins, such as activation of phospholipase C-g1
(PLC-g1; Eide et al. 1996). For many years, it
appeared that these truncated receptors did not directly
signal, but instead functioned to restrict the diffusion of
neurotrophins and possibly participate in their presen-
tation to signal-transducing receptors. Recent work,
however, has demonstrated that the BDNF-mediated
1548

activation of the truncated T1 isoform of TrkB controls
release of Ca2C from intracellular stores through a G
protein and inositol tris-phosphate (IP3)-dependent
pathway (Rose et al. 2003). A truncated isoform of
TrkC associates with the postsynaptic density-95
(PSD-95)/discs large/zona occludens-1 (PDZ) domain
of tamalin in the presence of NT3 (Esteban et al. 2006).
Tamalin forms a complex with the Arf–guanine-
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) ARF nucleotide-
binding site opener (ARNO), so NT3-mediated
signalling through truncated TrkC results in activation
of Arf6, Arf6-dependent activation of Rac and
membrane rufﬂing. Differential splicing of trkC
mRNA also results in expression of a TrkC isoform
with an amino acid insert within the tyrosine kinase
domain. This insert appears to modify the substrate
speciﬁcity of this tyrosine kinase, inhibiting its acti-
vation of several substrates and interfering with its
ability to promote neuronal differentiation (Guiton
et al. 1995; Meakin et al. 1997).
Differential splicing of the Trk receptor mRNAs is
not the only inﬂuence that modulates neurotrophin
binding and action. In some central nervous system
(CNS) neurons, many Trk receptors are localized in
intracellular vesicles. Second signals, such as cAMP or
Ca2C, promote insertion of the receptors into the
surface membrane, where they are accessible to
neurotrophins (Meyer-Franke et al. 1998; Du et al.
2000). In these neurons, responsiveness to neurotro-
phins may require incorporation of neurons into
signalling networks that result in the production of
these second messengers. TrkB has also been shown to
be recruited to cholesterol-rich rafts following ligand
engagement in a Trk-kinase-dependent manner (Du
et al. 2003). Some of the signalling consequences of
TrkB activation are not observed when these rafts are
disrupted. Finally and not surprisingly, Trk receptor
endocytosis is also stimulated by ligand engagement as
well as cytoplasmic Ca2C (Du et al. 2003).
Trk receptor function is regulated in several ways by
the presence of the pan-neurotrophin receptor,
p75NTR. Firstly, p75NTR inhibits activation of Trk
receptors by non-preferred neurotrophins both in vitro
and in vivo (Benedetti et al. 1993; Bibel et al. 1999;
Brennan et al. 1999). Secondly, in vitro studies indicate
that the presence of p75TR potentiates activation of
TrkA by suboptimal concentrations of NGF, although
it does not appear to potentiate the activation of other
Trk receptors similarly by their ligands (Davies et al.
1993; Mahadeo et al. 1994), and that the p75NTR
collaborates with TrkA to form high-afﬁnity binding
sites for NGF (Esposito et al. 2001). In addition to the
promotion of binding of NGF to TrkA, p75NTR has
been shown to promote retrograde transport of several
neurotrophins (Curtis et al. 1995). Two recent papers
provide evidence for two distinct mechanisms through
which the presence of p75NTR promotes Trk signal-
ling. In one paper, it was reported that p75NTR
suppresses ubiquitination of TrkA and TrkB, thereby
delaying Trk receptor internalization and degradation
(Makkerh et al. 2005). The other paper presented data
indicating that the presence of p75NTR promotes
endocytosis of each of the Trk receptors through
recruitment of E2 and E3 ubiquitin ligases that mediate
ubiquitination and subsequent trafﬁcking of the Trk
receptors to endosomal compartments, resulting in
enhanced cell differentiation (Geetha et al. 2005a).
Although there are important discrepancies between
these reports, each suggests a mechanism through
which p75NTR may promote axon growth and target
innervation in vivo as well as in vitro (Bentley & Lee
2000; Harrison et al. 2000). Thus, p75NTR modulates
Trk receptor function on several levels—by promoting
ligand binding, by promoting accessibility to neuro-
trophins through promotion of axon growth and target
innervation, and by promoting endocytosis and retro-
grade transport to membrane compartments where
internal engagement of neurotrophins with Trk
receptors may promote signalling. Signiﬁcant, but
incomplete, sensory and sympathetic deﬁcits are
observed in mice lacking p75NTR (Lee et al. 1994;
Stucky & Koltzenburg 1997). It is not clear which
p75NTR function is the most important in preventing
these deﬁcits.
3. CONTROL OF NEUROTROPHIN RESPONSIVE-
NESS THROUGH GENE EXPRESSION AND
POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL MECHANISMS
Nerve growth factor was puriﬁed as a survival factor for
cultured sympathetic and sensory neurons from the
submaxillary glands of male mice, where it is expressed
at extraordinarily high levels, greatly simplifying its
puriﬁcation (Levi-Montalcini 1987; Shooter 2001).
The evolutionary processes that have resulted in its
high,
sexually
dimorphic
and
species-speciﬁc
expression in these glands remain a mystery, but
there is no evidence that this is an important source
for the NGF, which functions in vivo to promote
neuronal survival. Discovery of the sites of NGF
synthesis relevant to its roles in the nervous system
required development of sensitive two-site ELISA and
mRNA blot assays (Korsching & Thoenen 1983;
Heumann et al. 1984; Davies et al. 1987). With these
assays, it was shown that NGF is synthesized and
secreted by sympathetic and sensory target organs.
After secretion, it is captured through receptor
interactions in nerve terminals, where it acts locally to
regulate target innervation and nerve terminal function
(Campenot 1977; Zhang et al. 2005). After internal-
ization, NGF is transported to neuronal cell bodies,
where it acts to promote neuronal survival and
differentiation (Kuruvilla et al. 2004). Extending the
observations on NGF, each of the other neurotrophins
has also been shown to be a target-derived neuro-
trophic factor (Farinas et al. 1996; Yee et al. 2003).
Within targets, expression of these proteins is localized
to specialized end organs, such as hair follicles, that are
innervated by the axons of responsive neurons.
Through receptor interactions, internalization and
retrograde transport, each of these proteins has local
actions affecting growth cone behaviour and synaptic
function, as well as actions at a distance in the cell body
and nucleus.
There are also other sources of neurotrophins. Of
special importance, during development, neurotro-
phins are expressed in regions innervated by sensory
neuron axons en route to their ﬁnal targets and their
Neurotrophin-regulated signalling pathways

expression there is essential for survival of these
neurons (Farinas et al. 1996, 1998). In addition,
some sensory neurons depend transiently on neuro-
trophin expression by immature cells in the vicinity of
their ﬁnal targets, which sustain these neurons until
specialized cells in the targets, such as hair cells in the
inner ear, have completed differentiation (Coppola
et al. 2001; Farinas et al. 2001). Neurotrophin
expression is also important after injury. After periph-
eral nerve injury, macrophages inﬁltrate the nerve as
part of an inﬂammatory response. These cells secrete
cytokines that induce synthesis of NGF in both
Schwann cells and ﬁbroblasts within the nerve
(Heumann et al. 1987). Nerve growth factor is also
expressed in mast cells from which it is released
following mast cell activation at sites of inﬂammation.
The elevated expression of neurotrophic factors in
injured nerves and targets is believed to be essential for
successful survival and regeneration of injured neurons.
Many neurons also express neurotrophins. For
example, many sensory and sympathetic neurons
express BDNF or NT4. Following secretion, NT4
regulates the innervation of sympathetic neurons by
preganglionic neuron axons emanating from the spinal
cord (Schober et al. 1998; Roosen et al. 2001).
Neurotrophins derived from sensory neurons affect
both peripheral and central targets (Mannion et al.
1999). Within sensory ganglia, BDNF may also have
paracrine or autocrine action.
Neurotrophin expression is controlled initially
through cellular interactions in tissues that determine
sites and levels of neurotrophin gene expression
(Patapoutian et al. 1999). Each of the neurotrophin
genes is regulated through multiple promoters and
enhancers (Selby et al. 1987; Bishop et al. 1994).
Multiple extrinsic stimuli, including Wnt and TGF-b
family members (Buchman et al. 1994), thyroid
hormone (Koibuchi et al. 1999), steroids (Lindholm
et al. 1987; Toran-Allerand 1996) and inﬂammatory
cytokines (Lindholm et al. 1987) have been shown to
control expression from neurotrophin genes. Although
many of the cis elements and transcription factors
involved in neurotrophin gene expression are being
identiﬁed, there is no tissue or cell type in which these
interactions are completely characterized (Lei et al.
2005; Chang et al. 2006).
In studies on neurotrophin expression within
neurons, particular attention has been focused on
control of BDNF expression because BDNF is an
important modulator of synaptic plasticity. Expression
of the BDNF gene is controlled through four distinct
promoters. Of particular interest, expression from one
of these is regulated by neuronal activity through Ca2C
ﬂux via L-type Ca2C-channels. Cytoplasmic Ca2C
activates BDNF transcription through protein kinase-
cascades that result in the activation of several
transcription factors, including cyclic AMP response
element binding protein (CREB), calcium-responsive
transcription factor and upstream stimulatory factors
(Tao et al. 1998, 2002; Chen et al. 2003b). Activation of
BDNF transcription is also enhanced by Ca2C-
dependent phosphorylation of the transcriptional
repressor methyl CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2)
and its release from the BDNF promoter (Chen et al.
2003a). The MeCP2 gene is mutated in Rett syndrome,
and studies in a mouse model have recently demon-
strated that the reduced expression of BDNF observed
in the absence of MeCP2 is important in regulating the
progression of this developmental disorder (Chang
et al. 2006).
Packaging, transport, secretion and processing of
neurotrophins are also important post-transcriptional
regulators of their actions, and again most attention has
been focused upon BDNF owing to its important roles
in controlling neuronal functions in the mature brain.
Present evidence indicates that each of the neurotro-
phins can be sorted into granules whose exocytosis is
regulated by signals, including ligand engagement of
Trk receptors, that mobilize intracellular Ca2C stores
(Heymach et al. 1996; Canossa et al. 2001). The
efﬁciency with which the different neurotrophins are
sorted into the regulated secretion pathway varies
depending upon the cell type. In hippocampal neurons,
NGF and NT3 appear to be largely secreted into a
constitutive secretory pathway, while BDNF is sorted
into a regulated pathway (Mowla et al. 1999; Farhadi
et al. 2000). Sorting of NGF and NT3 into a regulated
secretion pathway appears to require the presence of
the prohormone domain and, as a result, is promoted
by inhibition of the protease furin.
Human genetic studies indicate that regulated
trafﬁcking and secretion of BDNF are exceedingly
important for normal brain function. The presence of a
single nucleotide polymorphism in the BDNF gene
resulting in a V66M mutation in the BDNF prohormone
domain leads to selective impairments in hippocampal
episodic memory and abnormal hippocampal function
(Egan et al. 2003; Hariri et al. 2003). The V66M
mutation inhibits sorting of BDNF into a regulated
secretion pathway and affects its transport and local-
izationwithinneurons. Two proteins have beenidentiﬁed
that direct proBDNF into a regulated secretory pathway.
The large Golgi and endosomal protein sortilin interacts
with the prodomain of proBDNF through a site that
includes the V66M polymorphism (Chen et al. 2005).
RNAi-mediated suppression of sortilin expression
interfereswith BDNF targeting to the regulated secretion
pathway. Interestingly, sortilin interacts much less
effectively with the M66 than V66 isoform of proBDNF.
Sorting of proBDNF also requires interactions with
carboxypeptidase E, and interestingly, the amino acid
residues in BDNF responsible for this interaction
reside in mature BDNF, not in the prohormone domain
(Lou et al. 2005). Both carboxypeptidase E and
sortilin mediate sorting of many proteins in addition to
BDNF. It is not certain whether they act synergistically
or sequentially to direct proBDNF to a regulated
secretory compartment.
Finally, neurotrophin activity is regulated by the
proteases responsible for conversion of the proneuro-
trophins to mature neurotrophins. Interest in these
proteases has been increased tremendously by recent
discoveries documenting that proneurotrophins are
secreted from cells and are biologically active (Lee
et al. 2001). Firstly, intracellular proneurotrophin
processing is not always efﬁcient, so substantial
amounts of proneurotrophins are secreted in some
tissues. Secondly, proneurotrophins bind with high
1550

afﬁnity to the p75NTR receptor and activate signalling
pathways controlled by this receptor, which in many
cells results in promotion of apoptosis (Lee et al. 2001).
Data suggest that secretion of proneurotrophins is
increased following brain injury or degeneration, and
binding of these proteins to p75NTR may increase
neuronal loss in these injury and disease models
(Fahnestock et al. 2001; Harrington et al. 2004;
Pedraza et al. 2005).
Inside the cells, mature forms of NGF, BDNF and
NT3 are generated by furin and other prohormone
convertases in the trans-Golgi network (Seidah et al.
1996). Some trimming of proneurotrophins also occurs
earlier in the biosynthetic pathway in the endoplasmic
reticulum (Mowla et al. 2001). As a result, multiple size
variants of the proneurotrophins are detected in brain
extracts (Lee et al. 2001), but the signiﬁcance of
prohormone proteolysis that does not result in release
of mature neurotrophins is not clear. Extracellular
proBDNF is cleaved by plasmin following its activation
by tissue plasminogen activator (Pang et al. 2004).
Regulation of cleavage of the extracellular proBDNF is a
topic of intense current interest because there are
extensive data indicating that mature BDNF promotes
hippocampal long term potentiation (LTP) through
TrkB (Patterson et al. 1996; Minichiello et al. 2002;
Zakharenko et al. 2003), while recent data indicate that
proBDNF enhances hippocampal long term depression
(LTD) through p75NTR (Patterson et al. 1996;
Minichiello et al. 1999, 2002; Zakharenko et al. 2003;
Pang et al. 2004). Consistent with these observations,
absence of either TrkB or p75NTR compromises the
performance in spatial learning paradigms (Minichiello
et al. 1999; Peterson et al. 1999).
To summarize, the neurotrophins were discovered as
target-derived trophic factors, and cellular interactions
in these targets control the expression of the mRNAs
encoding these proteins. In addition, intracellular
trafﬁcking and intra- and extracellular proteolysis
have proven to be crucial controllers of their actions.
4. Trk RECEPTOR-MEDIATED SIGNALLING
PATHWAYS
The Trk receptors are typical receptor tyrosine kinases
whose activation is stimulated by neurotrophin-
mediated dimerization and transphosphorylation of
activation loop tyrosines (Huang & Reichardt 2003).
The Trk receptors are activated speciﬁcally by the
mature and not the pro-forms of the neurotrophin gene
products (Lee et al. 2001). Thus, the proteases that
control processing of proneurotrophins control Trk
receptor responsiveness. The cytoplasmic domains of
the Trk receptors contain several additional tyrosines
that are also substrates for phosphorylation by each
receptor’s tyrosine kinase. When phosphorylated, these
residues form the cores of binding sites for scaffolds and
enzymes that are intermediates in intracellular signal-
ling cascades. Speciﬁcally, the vertebrate Trk receptors
contain 10 evolutionarily conserved tyrosines in their
cytoplasmic domains, three of which (Y670, Y674 and
Y675 in human TrkA sequence) are in the autoregu-
latory loop of the tyrosine kinase domain, which
controls tyrosine kinase activity. Similar to other
receptor tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of these
tyrosines results in elevated Trk tyrosine kinase activity.
Phosphorylation of other tyrosine residues creates
binding sites for proteins containing phosphotyrosine-
binding (PTB) or Src-homology-2 (SH2) domains.
The major pathways activated by the Trk receptors are
Ras, Rac, PI3-kinase, PLC-g1 and their downstream
effectors (Huang & Reichardt 2003). These include
Ras stimulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)
kinase cascades, phosphatidyl inositol-3 (PI3)-kinase
stimulation of Akt and PLC-g1-dependent generation
of IP3 and diacylglycerol (DAG) that results in
mobilization of Ca2C stores and activation of Ca2C
and DAG-regulated protein kinases. Among the
tyrosines not in the kinase activation loop, two (Y490
and Y785) are the major sites of endogenous phos-
phorylation, although ﬁve of the remaining tyrosines
also contribute to promoting NGF-mediated neurite
outgrowth by PC12 cells (Inagaki et al. 1995).
Phospho-Y490 provides a recruitment site for both
Shc and Frs2, which provide links to Ras, PI3-kinase
and other pathways. Phospho-Y785 recruits the
enzyme PLC-g1, which is then activated through
phosphorylation by the Trk receptors. Through
generation of IP3 and DAG from phosphatidyl
inositides, activation of this enzyme results in Ca2C
and protein kinase C mobilization. In addition,
endocytosis and transfer of Trk receptors to different
membrane compartments control the efﬁciency and
duration of Trk-mediated signalling, in part because
many adaptor proteins are localized to speciﬁc
membrane compartments (York et al. 2000). Interest-
ingly, there is a glutamine, not a tyrosine, at the site
equivalent to Y785 in the single Trk homologue present
in the Amphioxus genome (Benito-Gutierrez et al. 2005,
2006). Although each mammalian neurotrophin is able
to activate survival and differentiation pathways
through the Amphioxus Trk receptor, they do not
activate the PLC-g1 pathway. Thus, signalling through
this pathway appears to be an adaptation incorporated
into Trk receptors early in vertebrate evolution.
Although much of the work on Trk receptors has
focused on signalling pathways initiated through
phosphorylation of Y490 and Y785, analyses of mutant
mice, homozygous for TrkB mutants in which F
replaces Y at these sites, indicate that most of the
additional docking sites have redundant roles in
signalling (Minichiello et al. 1998, 2002; Medina
et al. 2004). Another work has identiﬁed interactions
between Grb2 and other adaptors with phosphorylated
tyrosines in the kinase activation loop that provide
alternative mechanisms for activation of downstream
signalling pathways (Qian et al. 1998; MacDonald et al.
2000). Additional work has identiﬁed adapters and
enzymes, such as c-Abl, that interact with Trk receptors
at different sites, not all of which include a phospho-
tyrosine (Yano et al. 2000; Robinson et al. 2005). Many
of the adaptors studied in cell lines are differentially
expressed in various cell types, so the details of Trk
receptor-stimulated signalling are likely to differ sub-
stantially between different subpopulations of neurons.
Activation of Ras is required for normal neuronal
differentiation and also promotes survival of many
neuronal subpopulations. Recruitment by activated
Neurotrophin-regulated signalling pathways

Trk receptors of several different adapters promotes
Ras activation. Transient activation of Ras is mediated
by the adaptor protein Shc, which is recruited to
phospho-Y490 on Trk receptors via interactions
with the Shc PTB domain (Nimnual et al. 1998).
Trk-mediated phosphorylation of Shc creates a phos-
photyrosine site on Shc that recruits the adaptor Grb2,
which is bound to the Ras exchange factor son of
sevenless (SOS). Additional scaffold proteins, includ-
ing SH2-B, adaptor protein with pleckstrin homology
and Src homology-2 domains (APS) and insulin
receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), also provide links to Ras
in some cell types (Qian & Ginty 2001). Activation of
Ras also appears to be facilitated by neurotrophin-
dependent phosphorylation and activation of the Ras G
protein-releasing factor, RasGRF1 (Robinson et al.
2005). Active Ras stimulates signalling through
c-Raf–Erk, p38MAP kinase and class I PI3 kinase
pathways (Xing et al. 1998; Vanhaesebroeck et al.
2001). Activation of Erk1 and Erk2 is mediated in a
cascade initiated by Ras activation of the protein kinase
Raf. Raf phosphorylates Mek1 and/or Mek2, which in
turn phosphorylate and activate Erk1 and Erk2
(English et al. 1999). Adaptor proteins that link
proteins together in this signalling pathway greatly
increase its efﬁciency. In neurons, p38MAP kinase is
probably activated by a pathway initiated by Ras-
mediated binding and activation of the exchange factor
RalGDS, which results in activation of Ral and
recruitment of Src (Ouwens et al., 2002). In addition,
p38MAP kinase can be activated through neurotro-
phin-stimulated activation of the Ras-family G
proteins, Rin and Rit (Shi & Andres 2005; Shi et al.
2005). Ras also appears to promote activation of these
G proteins through uncharacterized exchange factors
(Spencer et al. 2002). p38MAP kinase in turn activates
MAP kinase-activated protein kinase-2. Ras also
triggers a signalling cascade through sequential activ-
ation of Wnk1, MEKK2 and MEK5 that results in
activation of Erk5 (Watson et al. 2001; Xu et al. 2004;
Wang et al. 2005). Erk5 may also be activated through a
RalGDS–Ral–Src–dependent pathway (Scapoli et al.
2004). The MAP kinase cascades feedback to attenuate
and terminate responses through phosphorylation of
intermediates and activation of phosphatases. As an
example, Erk and Rsk mediate phosphorylation of
SOS, which results in dissociation of the SOS–Grb2
complex (Douville & Downward 1997).
Prolonged activation of MAP kinases appears to
require recruitment of a distinct adaptor, Frs2, to
phospho-Y490 on Trk receptors (Kao et al. 2001; Wu
et al. 2001). Similar to Shc, Frs2 is phosphorylated by
active Trk receptors. Phosphorylation provides recruit-
ment sites for the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Crk, the
tyrosine kinase Src, the cyclin-dependent kinase
substrate p13 suc1 and the protein phosphatase
SH-PTP2 (Meakin et al. 1999). Following recruitment
to Frs2, Crk binds and activates the Rap1 exchange
factor C3G. Alternatively, Crk can be recruited to
activated Trk receptors through binding to the
transmembrane protein ankyrin repeat-rich membrane
spanning adaptor (ARMS), which is closely associated
with Trk receptors in some cells (Arevalo et al. 2004).
Ligand engagement of Trk receptors results in tyrosine
phosphorylation of ARMS, creating a docking site for
Crk, resulting in activation of Rap1 through C3G.
Active Rap1 stimulates the protein kinase B-Raf, which
activates the Erk kinase cascade. In addition to
providing a mechanism for sustained MAP kinase
activation, Frs2 also activates the Grb2–SOS–Ras
pathway. Frs2 also couples Trk signalling to Src family
kinases, which promote differentiation synergistically
with MAP kinases. Finally, recruitment of the protein
phosphatase, SH-PTP2, is believed to facilitate
activation of the Erk cascade, probably by inactivation
of an inhibitor, such as Ras-GAP or MAP kinase
phosphatase.
Each of the MAP kinase cascades summarized
earlier has overlapping, but also distinct targets within
the cell (Pearson et al. 2001). For example, Erk1/2 and
Erk5 phosphorylate and activate the Rsk kinases. Rsks
and MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 each
phosphorylate CREB, which activates transcription of
genes essential for normal differentiation and pro-
longed survival of neurons. In addition to the shared
targets, the different MAP kinase cascades also have
distinct transcription factors as targets (Pearson et al.
2001). For example, Erk5, but not Erk1/2, activates
MEF2, while Erk1/2, but not Erk5, activates Elk1.
Identiﬁcation of all the intermediates in signalling
between proximal Trk receptor activation and various
phenotypes in neurons induced by their signalling
remains an interesting and important challenge.
The neurotrophins also activate several of the Rho
family of GTPases that control organization of the
cytoskeleton, cell motility and growth cone behaviour
(Yuan et al. 2003b). Neurotrophins activate several of
these GTPases, most notably, Cdc42 and Rac, through
pathways that are incompletely characterized. It is clear
though, that neurotrophin effects on axonal growth and
growth cone guidance depend in large measure upon
regulation of these monomeric G proteins, so this
seems an important area for intensive studies (Yuan
et al. 2003b). Trk receptor activation provides several
pathways for regulation of Cdc42 and Rac. First, in
Schwann cells, ligation of TrkC results in phosphoryl-
ation and activation of the Cdc42GEF Double’s Big
Sister (Yamauchi et al. 2005a). It seems likely that
TrkC and other Trk receptors activate this and other
GEFs directly in neurons. Second, the Ras GEF SOS is
also a RacGEF whose RacGEF activity is regulated by
phosphorylation by c-Abl and almost certainly other
tyrosine kinases (Sini et al. 2004). Since c-Abl is
constitutively associated with TrkA (Yano et al. 2000),
it seems plausible that the RacGEF activity of SOS is
activated following Trk receptor activation. Third,
several observations provide evidence for a Ras-
dependent pathway that results in activation of Rac
involving Ras-mediated binding to and activation of
Tiam1, which directly activates Rac (Yamauchi et al.
2005b). Fourth, the Ras-family G proteins Rin and Rit,
each of which is stimulated by Trk receptor signalling,
activate Cdc42 and Rac, most probably through a
ternary complex including Par6 (Hoshino & Nakamura
2003; Hoshino et al. 2005). Finally, the monomeric G
protein RhoG is activated following neurotrophin
application. GTP-bound RhoG interacts with Elmo,
which in turn associates with the RacGEF Dock180,
1552

Neurotrophin-regulated signalling pathways

resulting in activation of Rac. The RhoG–Elmo–
Dock180–Rac pathway is important in promoting
NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth by PC12 cells
(Katoh & Negishi 2003). RhoG may also act directly
on many of the same effectors as Rac (Prieto-Sanchez &
Bustelo 2003). The pathway through which neuro-
trophins activate RhoG is not entirely clear, but
appears to involve regulation of Trio, a GEF for
RhoG (Estrach et al. 2002). Since there are several
hundred GEF genes, many of which are differentially
expressed, both redundancy and neuronal cell-type
speciﬁcity will probably prove to be important in
understanding the mechanisms through which neuro-
trophins activate Rho-family G proteins (Ma et al. 2005).
Generation of P3-phosphorylated phosphoinosi-
tides by PI3-kinase promotes survival of many neurons.
Class I PI3-kinases are activated through Ras-
dependent and -independent pathways, and the
comparative importance of these two mechanisms
differs in various subsets of neurons. In many neurons,
Ras-mediated activation of PI3-kinase initiates the
major pathways through which survival signals are
conveyed (Vaillant et al. 1999). In addition, PI3-kinase
can also be activated through Shc–Grb2 or Irs1 in Ras-
independent pathways. Recruitment of Gab1 by
phosphorylated Grb2 permits subsequent binding
and activation of PI3-kinase (Holgado-Madruga et al.
1997). In addition, in some neurons, Trk receptor
activation results in phosphorylation of IRS1, which
also permits recruitment and activation of PI3-kinase
(Yamada et al. 1997).
The P3-phosphorylated phosphoinosides generated
by PI3-kinase have multiple effects on neuronal
survival and development. First, these lipids are
essential for survival of many neurons. In collaboration
with phosphoinositide-dependent kinases, they activate
the protein kinase Akt, which in turn controls through
phosphorylation the activities of several proteins
important in promoting cell survival (Yuan & Yankner
2000; Brunet et al. 2001; Yuan et al. 2003a). These
include substrates that directly regulate the caspase
cascade, such as BAD, a Bcl2-family member that
promotes apoptosis by binding to Bcl-xL, thereby
preventing Bcl-xL from inhibiting the pro-apoptotic
activity of Bax. Phosphorylated BAD is sequestered by
14-3-3 proteins, preventing its pro-apoptotic actions.
Akt also regulates the activity of several transcription
factors. Through phosphorylation of the forkhead
transcription factor, FKHRL1, it promotes association
of this transcription factor with 14-3-3 proteins,
thereby sequestering it in the cytoplasm and preventing
it from activating transcription of several genes whose
products promote apoptosis (Brunet et al. 2001). Akt-
mediated phosphorylation of IkB results in its
degradation, liberating NF-kB. NF-kB-promoted
gene transcription has been shown to promote sensory
neuron survival (Hamanoue et al. 1999).
In addition, PI3-kinase activation has many targets
that promote axon growth and pathﬁnding, and
neuronal differentiation. The 3-phosphoinositides
generated by PI3-kinase recruit many signalling
proteins to the membrane, including GEFs for
Cdc42, Rac and Rho. These control organization of
the F-actin cytoskeleton and almost certainly account
for the ability of neurotrophin gradients to steer growth
cones (Yuan et al. 2003b). Akt effectors include the S6
kinases, which are important for promoting translation
of subsets of mRNAs (Kimball et al. 2002). Through
PI3-kinase-mediated signalling, Trk receptor ligation
also results in activation of integrin-linked kinase (ILK)
in sympathetic neurons (Zhou et al. 2004). ILK has
many targets, including glycogen synthase kinase 3-b
(GSK3-b), which is inactivated as a result of ILK-
mediated phosphorylation (Zhou et al. 2004). While
ILK has usually been considered a target of Akt in
neuronal cells (Cantley 2002), there is evidence
indicating that it functions upstream of Akt and
inﬂuences Akt activity (Mills et al. 2003). GSK3-b
has been implicated in control of apoptosis through
regulation of caspases and in control of neurite
outgrowth through regulation of Rho family GTPases
and the microtubule plus end-binding protein APC
(Zhou et al. 2004; Chin et al. 2005; Filipenko et al. 2005).
PLC-g1 is recruited to a docking site surrounding
phosphorylated Y785 on TrkA and to similar sites on
TrkB and TrkC, following Trk kinase activation.
Docked PLC-g1 is activated through Trk-mediated
phosphorylation and then hydrolyses PtdIns (4,5)P2 to
generate IP3 and DAG. The presence of IP3 results in
Ca2C release from cytoplasmic stores. DAG stimulates
DAG-regulated isoforms of protein kinase C. Together
these signalling molecules activate many intracellular
enzymes, including almost all PKC isoforms, Ca2C-
calmodulin-dependent protein kinases and other
Ca2C-calmodulin-regulated targets. The proteins
activated as a result of PLC-g1 activation include
PKC-d, which is required for NGF-promoted acti-
vation of MEK1 and Erk1/2 (Corbit et al. 1999).
Signalling through this pathway controls expression
and/or activity of many proteins, including ion channels
and transcription factors (Toledo-Aral et al. 1995;
Minichiello et al. 2002; Klein et al. 2005).
In addition to its effects on cytoplasmic signalling
pathways, PLC-g1-mediated depletion ofPtdIns(4,5)P2
directly affects the activity of membrane proteins that
interact with phosphatidylinositides. Of particular inter-
est, Trk receptor signalling through PLC-g1 activates
several members of the TRP family of cation channels. In
the CNS, TRPC3 is broadly expressed and activated
through TrkB (Li et al. 1999). In nociceptive sensory
neurons, the heat-activated TRP channel VR1 (the
capsaicin receptor) appears to be repressed by PtdIns
(4,5)P2, so PLC-g1-stimulated depletion of PtdIns
(4,5)P2, as a result of TrkA activation, results in
hypersensitization of this channel to thermal and
mechanical stimuli (Chuang et al. 2001; Prescott & Julius
2003). TrkA and VR1 can be co-immunoprecipitated,
indicating that they exist in a macromolecular complex
that almost certainly increases the efﬁciency of Trk
receptor regulation of VR1 activity. Recent work,
however, has challenged the importance of this pathway
in regulation of VR1, with results indicating that the
major pathway through which TrkA promotes VR1
activity is through stimulation of VR1 insertion into the
surface membrane from intracellular vesicles (Zhang
et al. 2005). TrkA-dependent activation of PI3-kinase
results in Src-dependent phosphorylation of VR1 at a
speciﬁc tyrosine residue (Y200), after which VR1 is

inserted into the surface membrane. The deletion of the
putative binding site through which PtdIns (4,5)P2 was
believed to inhibit VR1 (amino acids 777–820) was
shown to increase the level of phosphorylation of VR1 at
Y200, suggesting that amino acids 777–820 modulate
access of kinases or phosphatases to the Y200 residue.
Additional poorly deﬁned pathways also contribute to
NGF-stimulated thermal sensitization and additional
work will be required to characterize these completely.
5. REGULATION OF SIGNALLING THROUGH
COMPARTMENTALIZATION AND TRANSPORT
OF Trk RECEPTORS
The extended geometry of neurons has attracted
interest in neurotrophin transport for decades and
important in vivo and in vitro experiments demon-
strated in the 1970s that neurotrophins affected gene
transcription through retrograde transport as well as
the behaviours of axon terminals through local
signalling pathways (Thoenen & Barde 1980). It is
clear that neurotrophins and activated Trk receptors
are transported together in endocytotic vesicles.
Internalization and transport of Trk receptors serve
two functions—to bring activated Trk receptors into
proximity of cell compartments, such as the nucleus,
where signalling is required to enable speciﬁc cellular
responses, such as gene transcription and to transport
activated Trk receptors to membrane compartments,
where signalling effectors are concentrated (York et al.
2000; Delcroix et al. 2003; Ye et al. 2003).
On the cell surface, Trk receptors become concen-
trated in caveoli-like domains (Huang et al. 1999).
Recruitment by activated Trk receptors of signal-
transducing proteins on the cell surface appears crucial.
Unusually rapid internalization of TrkA induced by
exposure to a NGF-monoclonal antibody complex
prevents NGF-dependent phosphorylation of Frs2,
even though it does not affect phosphorylation of Shc
or transient Erk1/2 activation (Saragovi et al. 1998).
Frs2 is N-myristoylated and preferentially concentrated
in lipid rafts, suggesting that activated Trk receptors
must spend sufﬁcient time on the surface to interact with
Frs2 and other lipid raft-associated proteins.
Neurotrophin binding stimulates Trk receptor
internalization through clathrin-coated pits and macro-
pinocytosis. Exciting recent data have demonstrated
that internalization of Trk receptors is regulated by
ubiquitination,
suggesting
that
the
differential
expression of ubiquitin E2 and E3 ligases may result
in differences in Trk receptor trafﬁcking in different
populations of neurons (Makkerh et al. 2005; Geetha
et al. 2005a; Arevalo et al. 2006b). It will be interesting
to determine whether differential ubiquitination
accounts for the surprising observation that in sym-
pathetic neurons, retrograde transport of TrkA is
promoted by NGF, but not NT3, even though both
neurotrophins bind and activate TrkA on these cells
(Kuruvilla et al. 2004). After internalization, neuro-
trophins are localized together with Trk receptors in
endosomal compartments that recruit and activate
signalling intermediates, such as Shc (Delcroix et al.
2003; Ye et al. 2003). Transport to endosomal
compartments is required for efﬁcient activation
through Frs2 or the Crk–C3G–Rap1 signalling
pathway that results in persistent activation of the
MAP kinase cascade (York et al. 2000; Wu et al. 2001).
Rap1 is preferentially localized to endosomes, provid-
ing an attractive explanation for this observation. The
differential localization of signalling intermediates,
such as Frs2 and Rap1, probably explains why
treatments that either inhibit or accelerate internal-
ization of ligated Trk receptors prevent normal
neuronal responses to these complexes (Saragovi et al.
1998; Zhang et al. 2000).
Through incompletely understood mechanisms, the
signalling potential of intracellular Trk receptors
appears to be further regulated during endocytosis
and transport, possibly by sorting into distinct
populations
of
endosomes.
Using
Campenot
chambers, local application of NGF to distal axons or
cell bodies of sensory neurons was shown to activate
both the Erk1/2 and the Erk5 kinases locally, but
application of NGF to the distal axons activated Erk5,
but not Erk1/2, in the cell body compartment ( Watson
et al. 2001). Trk receptors are internalized through
clathrin-mediated endocytosis and also through pino-
cytosis mediated by a novel protein, Pincher (Valdez
et al. 2005). Pincher-associated endosomes are associ-
ated with Erk5 and are not readily degraded by
lysosomes. RNAi-mediated inhibition of Pincher
severely attenuates the retrograde transport-mediated
survival response of neurons to neurotrophins. Thus,
clathrin and Pincher appear to promote the formation
of endosomal vesicles that differ in their stability and
signalling potential with Pincher promoting the forma-
tion of endosomes, which are preferentially recruited
for retrograde signalling.
6. P75 NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR-MEDIATED
SIGNALLING PATHWAYS
Much of the recent excitements in neurotrophin
research have focused on the surprisingly diverse
functions of p75NTR. As mentioned earlier, this
receptor is known to bind the unprocessed proneuro-
trophins with ligand engagement resulting in dramat-
ically different consequences, such as apoptosis, than
those that follow ligand engagement of Trk receptors
(Lee et al. 2001). The proneurotrophins actually bind
with high afﬁnity to a complex of p75NTR with
sortilin, a Vps10-domain containing protein (Nykjaer
et al. 2004; Chen et al. 2005). Both sortilin and
p75NTR participate directly in binding to the
proneurotrophins. The presence of sortilin is required
to observe apoptosis following engagement of p75NTR
by the proneurotrophins. Each neurotrophin also binds
p75NTR with an approximately 1000-fold lower
afﬁnity. The p75NTR receptor also forms a signal-
transmitting subunit of the Nogo receptor complex
(NogoR, Lingo, p75NTR) that mediates inhibitory
effects on axon growth of three myelin-associated
glycoproteins—Nogo, myelin-associated glycoprotein
and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (Wang et al.
2002; Wong et al. 2002; Mi et al. 2004). Alternatively, a
tumour necrosis factor receptor homologue named
TROY can replace p75NTR to form a functional Nogo
receptor complex (Shao et al. 2005).

Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2006)

Several signalling pathways are activated following
neurotrophin
binding
to
p75NTR.
These
are
mediated through binding p75NTR of several adaptor
proteins, including Traf6, neurotrophin receptor-inter-
acting factor (NRIF), melanoma-associated antigen
(MAGE), neurotrophin receptor p75 interacting
MAGE homologue (NRAGE), Schwann cell factor 1
(SC1), RhoGDI and other proteins (Yamashita et al.
2005). One major pathway activated by p75NTR
engagement by neurotrophins is the Jun kinase-
signalling cascade. Signalling through this cascade
results in activation of p53 and apoptosis. In addition,
the Jun kinase cascade induces expression of Fas ligand
in neuronal cells, promoting apoptosis through acti-
vation of the Fas receptor. p53 has multiple targets,
including the pro-apoptotic gene, bax. Several essential
intermediates in the pathway through which ligand
engagement of p75NTR activates the Jun kinase
cascade have been identiﬁed. Genetic deletion of
NRIF or the E3 ubiquitin ligase Traf6 prevents
activation of Jun kinase signalling in sympathetic
neurons (Yeiser et al. 2004; Linggi et al. 2005). In an
interesting recent work, it has been shown that these
two proteins form a complex and Traf6-mediated K63
ubiquitination of NRIF is required for entry of NRIF
into the nucleus (Geetha et al. 2005b). Nuclear
transport of NRIF complexed to the intracellular
domain
of
p75NTR
requires
ligand-dependent
g-secretase-mediated cleavage of p75NTR (Kench-
appa et al. 2006). Overexpression studies have also
suggested roles for MAGE, NRAGE and SC1 in
promoting apoptosis. In PC12 cells and sympathetic
neurons, activation of the Jun kinase cascade involves
Cdc42 because apoptosis is strongly inhibited by a
dominant negative Cdc42 (Bazenet et al. 1998). The
MAP kinase kinase kinase named apoptosis signal-
regulated kinase 1 (ASK1) is clearly downstream of
Cdc42 because it strongly inhibits cell death promoted
by constitutively active Cdc42 (Kanamoto et al. 2000).
In oligodendrocytes, Rac activation is required for
p75NTR-stimulated
apoptosis,
indicating
that
different cell types may use different Rho family
GTPases as essential intermediates in the pathway
that results in activation of the Jun kinase signalling
pathway (Harrington et al. 2002). The Jun kinase
kinase named MKK7 seems likely to provide a link
between ASK1 and Jun kinase in sympathetic neurons
(Kanamoto et al. 2000). Another MAP kinase kinase
capable of phosphorylating JNK, MKK4, however,
appears to play an anti-apoptotic role during neural
development, so the role of the MKKs is slightly
confusing (Chi et al. 2005). Animals lacking multiple
JNK isoforms show perturbations of neuronal apopto-
sis during early brain development and in response to
stress (Kuan et al. 1999, 2003).
Neurotrophin binding to p75NTR also promotes
activation of NF-kB, thereby promoting NF-kB-
dependent neuronal survival (Hamanoue et al. 1999;
Middleton et al. 2000). As described earlier, neuro-
trophins promote the association of Traf6 with the
cytoplasmic domain of p75NTR (Khursigara et al.
1999).
Interleukin-1
receptor-associated
kinase
(IRAK) is recruited to this complex, resulting in
formation of a complex of Traf6 and IRAK with
atypical protein kinase C-i (aPKC-i) and the aPKC-
interacting protein p62 (Wooten et al. 2001; Vanden-
plas et al. 2002). IkB kinase-b (IKK-b), a known
substrate of aPKC, is recruited to and activated in this
complex. IKK-mediated phosphorylation of IkB
results in release of the transcription factor NF-kB.
Both the p62 and the kinase activity of IRAK are
necessary for activation of NF-kB.
Ligand engagement of p75NTR has been shown to
activate acidic sphingomyelinase, which results in
generation of ceramide (Dobrowsky et al. 1994).
Ceramide has been shown to promote both apoptotic
and prosurvival pathways initiated by p75NTR ligation
(DeFreitas et al. 2001; Song & Posse de Chaves 2003).
Ceramide is known to control many signalling
pathways, including the Erk, Jun kinase, NF-kB
signalling pathways as well as the activity of TrkA
through phosphorylation of this receptor on serine
residues (MacPhee & Barker 1997; Muller et al. 1998).
Ceramide is known to bind Raf, thereby inhibiting
extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signalling (Muller
et al. 1998). Evidence indicates that ceramide also
inhibits or promotes signalling through PI3-kinase by a
variety of mechanisms, depending upon cell type
(MacPhee & Barker 1997; Zundel et al. 2000). The
factors accounting for its different effects in different
neural populations seem likely to involve its differential
regulation of PI3-kinase signalling.
Neurotrophin engagement of p75NTR also controls
Rho family GTPase activity. p75NTR has been shown
to activate RhoA through a direct interaction, thereby
inhibiting neurite outgrowth (Yamashita et al. 1999).
Neurotrophin
binding
to
p75NTR
eliminates
p75NTR-dependent activation of RhoA, stimulating
neurite
outgrowth.
Recent
work
indicates
that
p75NTR functions as displacement factor that facili-
tates release of RhoA from RhoGDI (Yamashita &
Tohyama 2003). p75NTR interacts directly with
RhoGDI to facilitate RhoA release. This group also
reported that activators of the Nogo receptor-signalling
complex increased this association, thereby increasing
the activation of RhoA. It will be interesting to
determine whether the effects of neurotrophin binding
to p75NTR are also mediated through RhoGDI. If so,
the observations predict that neurotrophins would
weaken
the
association
of
RhoGDI
with
the
p75NTR–sortilin complex. While these observations
provide a satisfying model to explain the direct
enhancement of neurite outgrowth by ciliary neurons
observed in vitro following the neurotrophin engage-
ment of p75NTR (Yamashita et al. 1999), they do not
explain the slower growth of sensory and motor
neurones observed in vivo in mice lacking p75NTR
(Bentley & Lee 2000). One possibility is that in vivo
p75NTR is tonically associated with neurotrophins,
thereby reducing levels of active RhoA. Alternatively,
the presence of p75NTR has been shown to promote
retrograde transport of neurotrophins in vivo and may
enhance axon growth through this mechanism (Curtis
et al. 1995). Finally, the presence of p75NTR has
recently been shown to facilitate internalization of Trk
receptors through recruitment of an E2–E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex that ubiquitinates Trk receptors
(Geetha
et
al.
2005a).
As
discussed
earlier,

internalization of Trk receptors appears necessary for
neurotrophin stimulation of persistent MAP kinase
activation and differentiation, including neurite out-
growth. In vivo, the most important function of
p75NTR may be to facilitate Trk internalization and
subsequent signalling events that promote axon growth
at the axon terminal and retrograde transport and
nuclear signalling at the cell soma. Disruption of this
mechanism may explain the otherwise puzzling deﬁcit
in all classes of sensory neurons observed in the
p75NTR mutant (Stucky & Koltzenburg 1997).
Two
different
mutants
in
the
gene
encoding
p75NTR have been isolated with neomycin cassettes
inserted into exon III or IV (Lee et al. 1992; von
Schack et al. 2001). The exon III p75NTR mutant
used in most experiments expresses low quantities of
a
short
receptor
isoform
lacking
the
p75NTR
extracellular domain and, as expected, does not
bind NGF, but this protein retains transmembrane
and
cytoplasmic
domains
and
remains
able
to
interact
with
TrkA
(von
Schack
et
al.
2001).
A cryptic Kozak sequence in the exon IV mutant
also results in expression of a similar short receptor
isoform containing the transmembrane and cyto-
plasmic domains of p75NTR (Paul et al. 2004).
Since
overexpression of
the
transmembrane
and
cytoplasmicdomainstogetheror the cytoplasmicdomain
alone stimulates apoptosis (Majdan et al. 1997; Paul et al.
2004), it is possible, but not likely, that some of the
phenotypes observed in each mutant are caused by
expression of low levels of a truncated receptor.
7. CROSSTALK BETWEEN NEUROTROPHIN
SIGNALLING PATHWAYS ACTIVATED THROUGH
p75 NEUROTROPHIN RECEPTOR AND Trk
RECEPTORS
Neurotrophin-mediated
interactions
through
p75NTR and the Trk receptors have frequently
opposing consequences. For example, ligation of
Trk receptors almost always promotes neuronal
survival and differentiation (Patel et al. 2000), while
engagement of p75NTR frequently, but not invari-
ably, promotes apoptosis (DeFreitas et al. 2001; Teng
et al. 2005). Similarly, BDNF-mediated activation of
TrkB facilitates hippocampal LTP (Zakharenko et al.
2003), while neurotrophin interactions with p75NTR
instead facilitate hippocampal LTD (Woo et al.
2005). How can one understand the opposition and
synergy observed when neurotrophins activate these
two receptor systems? The observation that the two
different receptor classes actually have distinct
preferred ligands—proneurotrophins for p75NTR
and mature neurotrophins for Trk receptors—pro-
vides a partial explanation for this riddle (Lee et al.
2001). In addition, there are important mechanisms
through which these receptors communicate with
each other to ensure a consistent biological response.
Importantly, signalling pathways initiated through
Trk receptors act at several steps to suppress
the major pro-apoptotic-signalling pathway stimu-
lated by p75NTR, the Jun kinase pathway (Yoon
et al. 1998). Activation of Ras in sympathetic neurons
suppresses the Jun kinase cascade. In these neurons,
Ras-mediated activation of PI3-kinase is required to
suppress this signalling pathway (Mazzoni et al.
1999). A Jun kinase scaffold Jnk-interacting protein
1 (JIP1) has also been shown to interact with active
Akt1 (Kim et al. 2002). Interactions with Akt1
displace constituents of the Jun kinase pathway,
thereby reducing its efﬁciency. In addition, JIP1 has
been shown to promote activation of Akt1 through
facilitation of phosphorylation of the activation loop
of Akt1 by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1
(Kim et al. 2003). In addition, the PI3 kinase
pathway acts to suppress Jun kinase signalling by
inhibition of other intermediates. For example, in
some cells, c-Raf has been shown to bind and
inactivate ASK1 (Chen et al. 2001). There are
consequently several mechanisms through which Trk
receptor activation results in suppression of pro-
apoptotic p75NTR-mediated signalling. Notably, Trk
activation does not inhibit induction of NF-kB-
mediated signalling by p75NTR (Yoon et al. 1998).
Consequently, in the presence of Trk signalling,
activation of the NF-kB pathway makes a synergistic
contribution to neuronal survival.
Interactions between p75NTR and Trk receptor
signalling are facilitated by assembly of multiprotein
complexes that include both receptors as constitu-
ents. A protein, named ARMS has been shown to
interact with both receptors and to be phosphory-
lated following Trk activation, thereby providing a
docking site for Crk, which results in prolonged
activation of Rap and Erk signalling (Kong et al.
2001; Arevalo et al. 2004, 2006a). Caveolin provides
another
platform
for
interaction
between
Trk
receptors and p75NTR because it has been shown
to interact with both receptors (Bilderback et al.
1999).
Finally,
the
p62–Traf6–IRAK
complex
described
earlier
also
appears
to
function
as
a
scaffold for association of these two receptors with
Traf6 binding to p75NTR and p62 to TrkA (Wooten
et al. 2001). As described earlier, evidence has
recently been presented indicating that this complex
plays an important role in promoting TrkA-mediated
internalization and signalling (Geetha et al. 2005a).
The E2 ubiquitin ligase UbcH7 is recruited to this
complex together with Traf6, which has E3 ligase
activity, and promotes ubiquitination of K485 on
TrkA and corresponding residues on TrkB and TrkC
that facilitate their internalization. Results from other
laboratories, however, suggest that ubiquitination
may actually inhibit Trk receptor
internalization
(Makkerh
et
al.
2005;
Arevalo
et
al.
2006b).
At present, it is difﬁcult to reconcile these obser-
vations.
In
any
event,
the
overall
picture
that
emerges
from
these
studies
on
p75NTR–Trk
receptor interactions is that the pro-apoptotic signals
of p75NTR are largely suppressed as a result of Trk
receptor-mediated
signalling
and
that
elaborate
mechanisms have evolved to ensure that ligand-
engagement of p75NTR functions to promote the
efﬁcacy of Trk signalling in conditions where Trk
receptors are ligated by neurotrophins. Speciﬁcity in
signalling through the
two families
of receptors
appears to be regulated through proteolysis of the
proneurotrophins.

8. CONCLUSION
Neurotrophins are known to have a wide range of roles
in development and function of the nervous system.
Discovered as target-derived survival factors, they
are known to control cell fate, axon growth and
guidance, dendrite structure and pruning, synapse
formation and synaptic plasticity. Characterization of
their receptors—Trk receptor and p75NTR—has
tremendously advanced their studies and made it
possible to characterize signalling pathways and take
initial steps towards associating individual signalling
pathways with speciﬁc developmental or functional
roles of the neurotrophins. While progress in mechan-
istic studies on individual molecules and pathways has
been rapid, a system-wide analysis to integrate and test
the completeness of our understanding of these
pathways is badly needed. It also seems likely that
different populations of neurons will make differential
use of the various pathways owing to differences in
expression of the proteins that are signalling intermedi-
ates. A major challenge is to devise approaches
appropriate for studying these cell populations and
how neurotrophins affect their integration into the
vastness of the complete nervous system. In summary,
studiesof asmallgroupofproteins—theneurotrophins—
have provided insight into almost all areas of contem-
porary neuroscience. They seem likely to continue to do
so in the future.
