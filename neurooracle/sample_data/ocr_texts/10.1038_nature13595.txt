Biological insights from 108
schizophrenia-associated genetic loci
Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium*
Schizophrenia is a highly heritable disorder. Genetic risk is conferred by a large number of alleles, including common
alleles of small effect that might be detected by genome-wide association studies. Here we report a multi-stage schizo-
phrenia genome-wide association study of up to 36,989 cases and 113,075 controls. We identify 128 independent asso-
ciations spanning 108 conservatively defined loci that meet genome-wide significance, 83 of which have not been
previously reported. Associations were enriched among genes expressed in brain, providing biological plausibility for
the findings. Many findings have the potential to provide entirely new insights into aetiology, but associations at DRD2
and several genes involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission highlight molecules of known and potential therapeutic
relevancetoschizophrenia,andareconsistentwithleadingpathophysiologicalhypotheses.Independentofgenesexpressed
in brain, associations were enriched among genes expressed in tissues that have important roles in immunity, providing
support for the speculated link between the immune system and schizophrenia.

Although pharmacological treatments are available for schizophrenia,
theirefficacyispoorformanypatients4.Allavailableantipsychoticdrugs
are thought to exert their main therapeutic effects through blockade of
thetype2dopaminergicreceptor5,6but,sincethediscoveryofthismech-
anism over 60 years ago, no new antipsychotic drug of proven efficacy
has been developed based on other target molecules. Therapeutic stasis
is in large part a consequence of the fact that the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia is unknown. Identifying the causes of schizophrenia is
therefore a critical step towards improving treatments and outcomes
for those with the disorder.
High heritability points to a major role for inherited genetic variants
in the aetiology of schizophrenia7,8. Although risk variants range in fre-
quency from commonto extremelyrare9, estimates10,11 suggesthalf to a
third of the genetic risk of schizophrenia is indexed by common alleles
genotyped by current genome-wide association study (GWAS) arrays.
Thus, GWAS is potentially an important tool for understanding the
biological underpinnings of schizophrenia.
Todate,around30schizophrenia-associatedloci10–23havebeeniden-
tified through GWAS. Postulating that sample size is one of the most
importantlimitingfactorsinapplyingGWAStoschizophrenia,wecreated
the Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Con-
sortium (PGC). Our primary aim was to combine all available schizo-
phrenia samples with published or unpublished GWAS genotypes into
asingle,systematicanalysis24.Herewereporttheresultsofthatanalysis,
including at least 108 independent genomic loci that exceed genome-
wide significance. Some of the findings support leading pathophysio-
logical hypotheses of schizophrenia or targets of therapeutic relevance,
but most of the findings provide new insights.
108 independent associated loci
Weobtainedgenome-widegenotypedatafromwhichweconstructed49
ancestrymatched,non-overlappingcase-controlsamples(46ofEuropean
and three of east Asian ancestry, 34,241 cases and 45,604 controls) and
3 family-based samples of European ancestry (1,235 parent affected-
offspring trios)(Supplementary Table1 and Supplementary Methods).
These comprise the primary PGC GWAS data set. We processed the
genotypes from all studies using unified quality control procedures fol-
lowed by imputation of SNPs and insertion-deletions using the 1000
Genomes Project reference panel25. In each sample, association testing
wasconductedusingimputedmarkerdosagesandprincipalcomponents
(PCs) to control for population stratification. The results were combined
using an inverse-variance weighted fixed effects model26. After quality
control (imputation INFO score $ 0.6, MAF $ 0.01, and successfully
imputed in $ 20 samples), we considered around 9.5 million variants.

approach (Supplementary Information)11,13. Post hoc analyses revealed
the pattern of effect sizes for associated loci was similar across different

supporting our a priori decision to include samples of this nature.

Additionallinesofevidenceallowustoconcludethedeviationbetween
the observed and null distributions in our primary GWAS indicates a
true polygenic contribution to schizophrenia. First, applying a novel
method30 that uses linkage disequilibrium information to distinguish
between the major potential sources of test statistic inflation, we found
our results are consistent with polygenic architecture but not popula-
tion stratification (Extended Data Fig. 3). Second, the schizophrenia-
associated alleles at 78% of 234 linkage-disequilibrium-independent
SNPs exceeding P , 1 3 1026 in the case-control GWAS were again
overrepresented in cases in the independent samples from deCODE.
This degree of consistency between the case-control GWAS and the
replication data is highly unlikely to occur by chance (P 5 6 3 10219).

analysing the 1,235 parent-proband trios, we again found excess trans-
missionoftheschizophrenia-associatedalleleat69%ofthe263linkage-
disequilibrium-independentSNPswithP, 13 1026inthecase-control
GWAS. This is again unlikely to occur by chance (P 5 1 3 1029) and
additionally excludes population stratification as fully explaining the
associations reaching our threshold for seeking replication. Fourth, we
used the trios trend data to estimate the expected proportion of true
associations at P , 1 3 1026 in the discovery GWAS, allowing for the
fact that half of the index SNPs are expected to show the same allelic
trend in the trios by chance, and that some true associations will show
opposite trends given the limited number of trio samples (Supplemen-
tary Methods). Given the observed trend test results, around 67% (95%
confidence interval: 64–73%) or n 5 176 of the associations in the scan
at P , 1 3 1026 are expected to be true, and therefore the number of
associations that will ultimately be validated from this set of SNPs will
be considerably more than those that now meet genome-wide signifi-
cance.Takentogether,theseanalysesindicatethattheobserveddeviation
of test statistics from the null primarily represents polygenic association
signal and the considerable excess of associations at the tail of extreme
significance largely correspond to true associations.

Characterization of associated loci
Of the 108 loci, 75% include protein-coding genes (40%, a single gene)
and a further 8% are within 20 kb of a gene (Supplementary Table 3).
Notable associations relevant to major hypotheses of the aetiology and
treatmentofschizophreniaincludeDRD2(thetargetofalleffectiveanti-
psychotic drugs) and many genes (for example, GRM3, GRIN2A, SRR,
GRIA1)involvedinglutamatergicneurotransmissionandsynapticplas-

whichencodevoltage-gatedcalciumchannelsubunits,extendprevious

nels,andproteinsinvolvedinglutamatergicneurotransmissionandsyn-
aptic plasticity have been independently implicated in schizophrenia by
studies of rare genetic variation33–35, suggesting convergence at a broad
functional level between studies of common and rare genetic variation.

necessarily the causal elements).
Foreachoftheschizophrenia-associatedloci,weidentifiedacredible
causalsetofSNPs(fordefinition,seeSupplementaryMethods)36.Inonly
10 instances (Supplementary Table4) wastheassociationsignal credibly
attributable to a known non-synonymous exonic polymorphism. The
apparentlylimitedroleofprotein-codingvariantsisconsistentbothwith
exome sequencing findings33 and with the hypothesis that most asso-
ciated variants detected by GWAS exert their effects through altering
gene expression rather than protein structure37,38 and with the obser-
vation that schizophrenia risk loci are enriched for expression quanti-
tative trait loci (eQTL)39.
To try to identify eQTLs that could explain associations with schizo-
phrenia, we merged the credible causal set of SNPs defined above with
eQTLsfromameta-analysisofhumanbraincortexeQTLstudies(n5550)
andaneQTLstudyofperipheralvenousblood(n53,754)40(Supplemen-
taryMethods).Multipleschizophrenialoci containedatleastone eQTL
for a gene within 1 Mb of the locus (Supplementary Table 4). However,
inonly12instanceswastheeQTLplausiblycausal(twoinbrain,andnine
in peripheral blood, one in both). This low proportion suggests that if
most risk variants are regulatory, available eQTL catalogues do not yet
provide power, cellular specificity, or developmental diversity to pro-
vide clear mechanistic hypotheses for follow-up experiments.
The brain and immunity
Tofurtherexploretheregulatorynatureoftheschizophreniaassociations,
wemappedthecrediblesets(n 5 108)ofcausalvariantsontosequences
with epigenetic markers characteristic of active enhancers in 56 differ-
enttissuesandcelllines(SupplementaryMethods).Schizophreniaasso-
ciations were significantly enriched at enhancers active in brain (Fig. 2)
but not in tissues unlikely to be relevant to schizophrenia (for example,
bone,cartilage,kidneyandfibroblasts).Braintissuesusedtodefineenhanc-
ers consist of heterogeneous populations of cells. Seeking greater spe-
cificity, we contrasted genes enriched for expression in neurons and
glia using mouse ribotagged lines41. Genes with strong expression in
multiple cortical and striatal neuronal lineages were enriched for asso-
ciations, providing support for an important neuronal pathology in
schizophrenia (Extended Data Fig. 4) but this is not statistically more
significant than, or exclusionary of, contributions from other lineages42.
Schizophrenia associations were also strongly enriched at enhancers
thatareactiveintissues withimportant immune functions,particularly
B-lymphocytelineagesinvolvedinacquiredimmunity(CD19andCD20
lines, Fig. 2). These enrichments remain significant even after exclud-
ing the extended MHC region and regions containing brain enhancers
(enrichment P for CD20 , 1026), demonstrating that this finding is
not an artefact of correlation between enhancer elements in different
tissuesandnotdrivenbythestronganddiffuseassociationattheextended
MHC. Epidemiological studies have long hinted at a role for immune
dysregulation in schizophrenia, the present findings provide genetic
support for this hypothesis43.
Todevelopadditionalbiologicalhypothesesbeyondthosethatemerge
from inspection of the individual loci, we further undertook a limited
miningofthedatathroughgene-setanalysis.However,asthereisnocon-
sensus methodology by which such analyses should be conducted, nor
anestablishedoptimalsignificancethresholdforincludingloci,wesought
to be conservative, using only two of the many availableapproaches44,45
and restricting analyses to genes within genome-wide significant loci.

Overlap with rare mutations
CNVs associated withschizophreniaoverlapwiththoseassociatedwith
autismspectrumdisorder(ASD)andintellectualdisability9,asdogenes
with deleterious de novo mutations34. Here we find significant overlap
betweengenesintheschizophreniaGWASassociatedintervalsandthose
with de novo non-synonymous mutations in schizophrenia (P 50.0061)
(Extended Data Table 2), suggesting that mechanistic studies of rare
genetic variation in schizophrenia will be informative for schizophrenia
morewidely.We alsofindevidence foroverlap between genes inschizo-
phreniaGWASregions and those with denovonon-synonymous muta-
tionsinintellectualdisability(P50.00024)andASD(P50.035),providing
further support for the hypothesis that these disorders have partly over-
lapping pathophysiologies9,34.
Polygenic risk score profiling
Previous studies have shown that risk profile scores (RPS) constructed
from alleles showing modest association with schizophrenia in a dis-
covery GWAS can predict case-control status in independent samples,
albeitwithlowsensitivityandspecificity10,11,16.Thisfindingwasrobustly
confirmed in the present study. The estimate of Nagelkerke R2 (a mea-
sure of variance in case-control status explained) depends on the spe-
cific target data set and threshold (PT) for selecting risk alleles for RPS

Enrichment (–log10 P)
Figure 2 | Enrichment in enhancers of credible SNPs. Cell and tissue type
specific enhancers were identified using ChIP-seq data sets (H3K27ac signal)
from 56 cell line and tissue samples (y axis). We defined cell and tissue type
enhancers as the top 10% of enhancers with the highest ratio of reads in that cell
or tissue type divided by the total number of reads. Enrichment of credible
causal associated SNPs from the schizophrenia GWAS was compared with
frequency matched sets of 1000 Genomes SNPs (Supplementary Methods).
The x axis is the –log10 P for enrichment. P values are uncorrected for the
number of tissues or cells tested. A –log10 P of roughly 3 can be considered
significant after Bonferroni correction. Descriptions of cell and tissue types at

analysis (Extended Data Fig. 5 and 6a). However, using the same target
sample as earlier studies and PT 5 0.05, R2 is now increased from 0.03
(ref. 10) to 0.184(Extended Data Fig. 5). Assuming a liability-threshold
model, a lifetime risk of 1%, independent SNP effects, and adjusting for
case-controlascertainment,RPSnowexplains about7%ofvariation on
the liability scale46 to schizophrenia across the samples (Extended Data
Fig. 6b), about half of which (3.4%) is explained by genome-wide signi-
ficant loci.
We also evaluated the capacity of RPS to predict case-control status
using a standard epidemiological approach to a continuous risk factor.
We illustrate this in three samples, each with different ascertainment
schemes (Fig. 3). The Danish sample is population-based (that is, inpa-
tient and outpatient facilities), the Swedish sample is based on all cases
hospitalized for schizophrenia in Sweden, and the Molecular Genetics
of Schizophrenia (MGS) sample was ascertained specially for genetic
studies from clinical sources in the US and Australia.We grouped indi-
viduals intoRPSdecilesandestimatedtheoddsratios foraffectedstatus
for each decile with reference to the lowest risk decile. The odds ratios
increased withgreater numberofschizophreniariskalleles ineachsam-
ple, maximizing for the tenth decile in all samples: Denmark 7.8 (95%
confidence interval (CI): 4.4–13.9), Sweden 15.0 (95% CI: 12.1–18.7)
and MGS 20.3 (95% CI: 14.7–28.2). Given the need for measures that
index liability to schizophrenia47,48, the ability to stratify individuals by
RPS offers new opportunities for clinical and epidemiological research.
Nevertheless, we stress that the sensitivity and specificity of RPS do not
support its use as a predictive test. For example, in the Danish epide-
miological sample, the area under the receiver operating curve is only
0.62 (Extended Data Fig. 6c, Supplementary Table 6).
Finally, seeking evidence for non-additive effects on risk, we tested
for statistical interaction between all pairs of 125 autosomal SNPs that
reached genome-wide significance. P values for the interaction terms
weredistributedaccordingtothenull,andnointeractionwassignificant
after correctionformultiplecomparisons.Thus,wefindnoevidencefor
epistatic or non-additive effects between the significant loci (Extended
Data Fig. 7). It is possible that such effects could be present between
other loci, or occur in the form of higher-order interactions.
Discussion
In the largest (to our knowledge) molecular genetic study of schizophre-
nia,orindeedofanyneuropsychiatricdisorder,everconducted,wedem-
onstrate the power of GWAS to identify large numbers of risk loci. We
show that the use of alternative ascertainment and diagnostic schemes
designed to rapidly increase samplesize doesnot inevitably introduce a
crippling degree of heterogeneity. That this is true for a phenotype like
schizophrenia,in whichthere arenobiomarkersorsupportivediagnostic
tests, provides grounds to be optimistic that this approach can be suc-
cessfully applied to GWAS of other clinically defined disorders.
We further show that the associations are not randomly distributed
acrossgenesofallclassesandfunction;rathertheyconvergeupongenes
thatareexpressedincertaintissuesandcellulartypes.Thefindingsinclude
molecules that are the current, or the most promising, targets for ther-
apeutics, and point to systems that align with the predominant aeti-
ological hypotheses of the disorder. This suggests that the many novel
findings we report also provide an aetiologically relevant foundation
formechanisticand treatmentdevelopmentstudies. We also findover-
lap between genes affected by rare variants in schizophrenia and those
within GWAS loci, and broad convergence in the functions of some of
the clusters of genes implicated by both sets of genetic variants, parti-
cularly genes related to abnormal glutamatergic synaptic and calcium
channelfunction.Howvariationinthesegenesimpactfunctiontoincrease
risk for schizophrenia cannot be answered by genetics, but the overlap
strongly suggests that common and rare variant studies are complemen-
tary rather than antagonistic,andthatmechanisticstudies driven by rare
genetic variation will be informative for schizophrenia.

Risk alleles and weights were derived from ‘leave one out’ analyses in which
those samples were excluded from the GWAS meta-analysis (Supplementary
Methods). The threshold for selecting risk alleles was PT , 0.05. The RPS
were converted to deciles (1 5 lowest, 10 5 highest RPS), and nine dummy

Extended Data Figure 1 | Homogeneity of effects across studies. Plot of the
first two principal components (PCs) from principal components analysis
(PCA) of the logistic regression b coefficients for autosomal genome-wide
significant associations. The input data were the b coefficients from 52 samples
for 112 independent SNP associations (excluding 3 chrX SNPs and 13 SNPs
with missing values in Asian samples). PCAs were weighted by the number of
cases. Each circle shows the location of a study on PC1 and PC2. Circle size and
colour are proportional to the number of cases in each sample (larger and
darker redcircles correspondto more cases). Mostsamples cluster. Outliers had
either small numbers of cases (‘small’) or were genotyped on older arrays.
Abbreviations: a500 (Affymetrix 500K); a5 (Affymetrix 5.0). Studies that did
not use conventional research interviews are in the central cluster (CLOZUK,
Sweden, and Denmark-Aarhus studies, see Supplementary Methods for
sample descriptions).

the discovery genome-wide association meta-analysis of 49 case control
samples (34,241 cases and 45,604 controls) and 3 family based association
studies (1,235 parent affected-offspring trios). Expected –log10 P values are
those expected under the null hypothesis. Observed are the GWAS association
results derived by logistic regression (2-tailed) as in Fig. 1. For clarity, we
avoided expansion of the y axis by setting the smallest association P values to
10212. The shaded area surrounded by a red line indicates the 95% confidence
interval under the null. lGC is the observed median x2 test statistic divided
by the median expected x2 test statistic under the null hypothesis.

Extended Data Figure 3 | Linkage disequilibrium score regression
consistent with polygenic inheritance. The relationship between marker x2
association statistics and linkage disequilibrium (LD) as measured by the
linkage disequilibrium score. Linkage disequilibrium score is the sum of the
r2 values between a variant and all other known variants within a 1 cM window,
and quantifies the amount of genetic variation tagged by that variant. Variants
were grouped into 50 equal-sized bins based on linkage disequilibrium score
rank. Linkage disequilibrium score bin and mean x2 denotes mean linkage
disequilibrium score and test statistic for markers each bin. a, b, We simulated
(Supplementary Methods) test statistics under two scenarios: a, no true
association, inflation due to population stratification; and b, polygenic
inheritance (l 5 1.32), in which we assigned independent and identically
distributed per-normalized-genotype effects to a randomly selected subset of
variants. c, Results from the PGC schizophrenia GWAS (l5 1.48). The real
data are strikingly similar to the simulated data summarized in b but not a. The
intercept estimates the inflation in the mean x2 that results from confounding
biases, such as cryptic relatedness or population stratification. Thus, the
intercept of 1.066 for the schizophrenia GWAS suggests that ,90% of the
inflation in the mean x2 results from polygenic signal. The results of the
simulations are also consistent with theoretical expectation (see Supplementary
Methods). l is the median x2 test statistic from the simulations (a, b) or the
observed data (c) divided by the median expected x2 test statistic under the
null hypothesis.

Extended Data Figure 5 | MGS risk profile score analysis. Polygenic risk
profile score (RPS) analyses using the MGS18 sample as target, and deriving risk
alleles from three published schizophrenia data sets (x axis): ISC (2,615
cases and 3,338 controls)10, PGC1 (excluding MGS, 9,320 cases and 10,228
controls)16, and the current meta-analysis (excluding MGS) with 32,838 cases
and 44,357 controls. Samples sizes differ slightly from the original publications
due to different analytical procedures. This shows the increasing RPS
prediction with increasing training data set size reflecting improved precision
of estimates of the SNP effect sizes. The proportion of variance explained
(y axis; Nagelkerke’s R2) was computed by comparison of a full model
(covariates 1 RPS) score to a reduced model (covariates only). Ten different
P value thresholds (PT) for selecting risk alleles are denoted by the colour of
each bar (legend above plot). For significance testing, see the bottom legend
which denotes the P value for the test that R2 is different from zero. All
numerical data and methods used to generate these plots are available in
Supplementary Table 6 and Supplementary Methods.

Extended Data Figure 6 | Risk profile score analysis. We defined 40 target
subgroups of the primary GWAS data set and performed 40 leave-one-out
GWAS analyses (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 7)
from which we derived risk alleles for RPS analysis (x axis) for each target
subgroup. a, The proportion of variance explained (y axis; Nagelkerke’s R2) was
computed for each target by comparison of a full model (covariates 1 RPS)
score to a reduced model (covariates only). For clarity, 3 different P value
thresholds (PT) are presented denoted by the colour of each bar (legend above
plot) as for Extended Data Fig. 5, but for clarity we restrict to fewer P value
thresholds (PT of 53 1028, 13 1024 and 0.05) and removed the significance
values. b, The proportion of variance on the liability scale from risk scores
calculated at the PT 0.05 with 95% CI bar assuming baseline population disease
risk of 1%. c, Area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). All numerical
data and methods used to generate these plots are available in Supplementary
Table 7 and Supplementary Methods.

Extended Data Figure 7 | Pairwise epistasis analysis of significant SNPs.
Quantile-quantile plot for all pair-wise (n 5 7,750) combinations of the 125
independent autosomal genome-wide significant SNPs tested for non-additive
effects on risk using case-control data sets of European ancestry (32,405 cases
and 42,221 controls). We included as covariates the principal components
from the main analysis as well as a study indicator. The interaction model is
described by:
Y~b0z^a1X1z^a2X2z^a3  X
1X2z^a4X4z^a5X5
X1 and X2 are genotypes at the two loci, X
1X2 is the interaction between the two
genotypes modelled in a multiplicative fashion, X4 is the vector of principal
components, X5 is the vector of study indicator variables. Each ^a is the
regression coefficient in the generalized linear model using logistic regression.
The overall distribution of P values did not deviate from the null and the
smallest P value (4.283 1024) did not surpass the Bonferroni correction
threshold (P 5 0.05/7750 5 6.453 1026). The line x 5 y indicates the expected
null distributionwiththegrey area boundedby redlinesindicatingthe expected

Extended Data Table 1 | ALIGATOR and INRICH
Gene sets that have been reported to be enriched for schizophrenia associations and or rare mutations were tested for enrichment for genome-wide significant associations using ALIGATOR44 and INRICH45.
Specifically, we tested the glutamatergic postsynaptic proteins comprising activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) complexes33–35, other curated
synaptic gene-sets14,49, targets of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP)33–35, calcium channels11,33, and TargetScan predicted MIR137 sets11,16. The MIR137 TargetScan sets contain computationally
predicted conserved miRNA target sites in 39 UTRs of human genes50. The current version is v6, but the version used in the prior PGC SCZ report16 was based on v5 (filtered for a probability of conserved targeting
. 0.9). We report the results of both analyses for consistency with previous work. The association at the extended MHC complex was not included given the extensive linkage disequilibrium at this region spans large
numbers of genes. NA means that the pathway in question contained fewer than 2 significant genes (for ALIGATOR) or regions (INRICH).

Extended Data Table 2 | de novo overlap
Test of overlap between genes mapping to schizophrenia-associated loci in the present study and genes affected by non-synonymous (NS) de novo mutations. Enrichment was calculated using the dnenrich
permutation framework as described34. Genes within the GWS loci (Supplementary Table 3) were weighted by 1/N, where N is the number of coding genes within each associated locus. The observed test statistic
(stat) is the sum of weights of genes impacted by de novo mutations. The expected test statistics are calculated by averaging over 50,000 permuted de novo mutation sets. Genes within schizophrenia-associated
loci affected by de novo mutations are listed (multiple hits listed in parentheses). Cohorts: SCZ, schizophrenia; ID, intellectual disability; ASD, autism spectrum disorder. All mutations analysed annotated according
to a unified system (see Supplementary Tables 1 and 2 of ref. 34). Genes with loss-of-function de novo mutations are underlined and in italics.
