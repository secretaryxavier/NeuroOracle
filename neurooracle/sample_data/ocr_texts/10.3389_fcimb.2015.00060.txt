The mycobacterial tlyA gene product, Rv1694 (MtbTlyA), has been annotated as
“hemolysin” which was re-annotated as 2′-O rRNA methyl transferase. In order to
function as a hemolysin, it must reach the extracellular milieu with the help of signal
sequence(s) and/or transmembrane segment(s). However, the MtbTlyA neither has
classical signals sequences that signify general/Sec/Tat pathways nor transmembrane
segments. Interestingly, the tlyA gene appears to be restricted to pathogenic strains such
as H37Rv, M. marinum, M. leprae, than M. smegmatis, M. vaccae, M. kansasii etc., which
highlights the need for a detailed investigation to understand its functions. In this study,
we have provided several evidences which highlight the presence of TlyA on the surface
of M. marinum (native host) and upon expression in M. smegmatis (surrogate host) and
E. coli (heterologous host). The TlyA was visualized at the bacterial-surface by confocal
microscopy and accessible to Proteinase K. In addition, sub-cellular fractionation has
revealed the presence of TlyA in the membrane fractions and this sequestration is
not dependent on TatA, TatC or SecA2 pathways. As a consequence of expression,
the recombinant bacteria exhibit distinct hemolysis. Interestingly, the MtbTlyA was also
detected in both membrane vesicles secreted by M. smegmatis and outer membrane
vesicles secreted by E. coli. Our experimental evidences unambiguously conﬁrm that
the mycobacterial TlyA can reach the extra cellular milieu without any signal sequence.
Hence, the localization of TlyA class of proteins at the bacterial surface may highlight the
existence of non-classical bacterial secretion mechanisms.

Introduction
The causative agent of human tuberculosis disease, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, uses novel
mechanisms for evasion of host responses for its intracellular survival (Berry et al., 2013; Cambier
et al., 2014). Often bacterial pathogenicity depends upon the ability to stash virulence factors which
can be either displayed at the bacterial cell surface or secreted into extracellular milieu in addition
to direct injection into the target cell (Tseng et al., 2009). In bacteria, protein export across the
cytoplasmic membrane represents the ﬁrst step in the delivery of proteins to the cell envelope
or extracellular space. Among many transport mechanisms, two conserved systems account for
a majority of the protein export: the general secretion (Sec) and the Twin-arginine translocation
(Tat) pathways (Lee et al., 2006; Palmer and Berks, 2012; Beckwith, 2013; Denks et al., 2014). The Tat

TlyA reaches extra cellular milieu
and Sec systems recognize amino terminal signal sequences
for their transport across the cytoplasmic membrane and also
the proteins being exported may remain associated with the
cell envelope or may get secreted into the extra-cellular milieu
depending upon the function of the protein. Although, the signal
sequences of Sec and Tat substrates share a seemingly similar
domain structure, the Tat substrates can be distinguished with
the help of twin arginine motif, “R-R-X,” where X can be any
amino acid. The two pathways, viz. Sec and Tat also diﬀer in
their mode of transport. Sec substrates are translocated across
the cytoplasmic membrane in an unfolded state, whereas Tat
substrates are translocated in a folded conformation (Berks, 1996;
DeLisa et al., 2003; McDonough et al., 2008). In mycobacteria,
apart from the Sec and Tat systems, it has another secretion
system, known as Esx-1, which secretes Esat6 and Cfp10. The
Esx-1 module is also present in the ﬁsh pathogen Mycobacterium
marinum and non-pathogenic species Mycobacterium smegmatis
(Abdallah et al., 2007; Champion and Cox, 2007; Simeone
et al., 2015). While the Esx-1 has been shown to be responsible
for virulence in M. tuberculosis and M. marinum, the same
is responsible for conjugation in M. smegmatis (Gao et al.,
2004; Converse and Cox, 2005). Hence, a comprehensive
understanding of protein secretion pathways is essential not
only for delineating the mechanism of translocation but also the
substrates that utilize these modules for exiting into extra cellular
milieu. In this regard, an earlier observation has suggested that
expression of tlyA gene of M. tuberculosis (Rv1694; MtbTlyA)
in M. smegmatis has resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in contact
dependent hemolysis of red blood cells (King et al., 1993; Wren
et al., 1998). However, the basis for the increase in hemolysis has
not been understood or deﬁned because the tlyA gene product
of M. tuberculosis was initially said to be a hemolysin but it has
been later re-annotated as an S-Adenosylmethionine dependent,
rRNA methylase, whose function is to methylate the nucleotides
C1409 and C1920 of 16S and 23S rRNA respectively (Johansen
et al., 2006). Methylation of rRNA reduces the translational
ability in the presence of Capreomycin, a second generation
antibiotic. In contrast to this, the puriﬁed MtbTlyA has been
shown to possess hemolytic activity through formation of stable
oligomers on RBC of both rabbit and human as well as on
phagosomes of mouse macrophages (Rahman et al., 2010). These
two properties are not only diverse but starkly contrasting i.e.,
as a hemolysin the TlyA must be a cell-wall attached entity or as
an rRNA methylase, it must be an intracellular protein. Hence,
there is a need for a detailed investigation of the pathway the
TlyA like proteins utilize to reach the extra-cellular milieu. In this
study, we have used M. marinum (native host), M. smegmatis (as
a surrogate host) and E. coli (as a heterologous host) to study the
transport of TlyA across the cell membrane. Our observations
reveal that in both native and recombinant hosts, the TlyA
can reach the bacterial surface in functional form and such a
sequestration, in principle, may aid the intra-cellular survival
mechanisms.
Materials and Methods
The antibodies to HBHA (NR-13804), GroEL (CS-44), DnaK
(IT-40)
were
obtained
from
BEI
resources,
USA.
TlyA
immunization protocols in mice and rabbit were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of National Centre
for Cell Science, Pune.
Cloning and Expression of TlyA
MtbTlyA (Rv1694) was cloned in two vectors viz. pT7Nc and
pET28a+ between the sites NcoI and HindIII with and without
a C-terminal 6-histidine tag (Rahman et al., 2010). We have
also cloned the MtbTlyA in pMyNT vector for expression in M.
smegmatis (Noens et al., 2011). All the constructs used in this
study have been veriﬁed by di-deoxy nucleotide sequencing.
Titration of Inducer
The expression of MtbTlyA in M. smegmatis was judged by
varying the induction strength i.e., Acetamide from 0.2 to
0.001%. We have set the inducer concentration at 0.001% for all
experiments described here to ensure sub-optimal expression of
the TlyA.
Expression and Puriﬁcation of TlyA
The E. coli expressed MtbTlyA carries a carboxy terminal 6-
histidie tag which was used for puriﬁcation with the help
of Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Germany), essentially following the
procedure reported by us earlier (Rahman et al., 2010). The
purity of the protein was routinely assessed by 12% SDS-PAGE.
The puriﬁcation attempts usually yield about ∼0.7–1 mg of TlyA
from a 2 liter culture volume. The TlyA puriﬁed from both M.
smegmatis and E. coli was veriﬁed by MS-MS sequencing.
Hemolysis Assay of Puriﬁed MtbTlyA
Puriﬁed MtbTlyA was diluted in Sodium phosphate buﬀer
(25 mM, pH 7.4) and NaCl (150 mM) buﬀer, mixed with 1.5%
rabbit red blood cells (rRBC) and incubated at room temperature
(25◦C) for 24 h. After centrifugation, the absorbance of the
supernatant at 540 nm was measured. Water was used as a control
for total RBC lysis. The per cent hemolysis was estimated as
follows: Hemolysis (%) = [(A540 of sample – A540 controls) ×
100]/(A540 of Water lysed sample).
Bioinformatics Analysis
The grand mean of hydropathy (GRAVY) score was calculated
using
the
PROTPARAM
tool
(http://us.expasy.org/tools/
protparam.html).
Transmembrane
regions
were
predicted
using
TMHMM
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM)
and TMPRED (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED_
form.html). Cellular localization and signal sequences were
predicted from CBS Prediction Servers (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services/signal_p). Tat signal sequence was predicted using CBS
Prediction Servers Tat P (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TatP)
and TatFind (http://signalﬁnd.org/tatﬁnd.html).
RNA Isolation, cDNA Synthesis and RT-PCR
Non-transformed M. smegmatis and TlyA transformed bacteria
were grown in 7H9 Middlebrook medium till mid-log phase and
RNA was extracted as described (Kurthkoti and Varshney, 2010).
The total RNA preparation was treated with turbo DNase at 37◦C
for 15 min. The absence of DNA was conﬁrmed by PCR using the
DNase treated RNA as template. The RNA (∼3 µg) was used for

TlyA reaches extra cellular milieu
cDNA synthesis by using Superscript II RT system (Invitrogen).
The reaction mixture containing RNA (3 µg) and of Oligo-dT
primer (250 nmol) was heated to 65◦C for 5 min and quick chilled
on ice for 5 min. The primer was annealed to the template at 60◦C
for 5 min, chilled, and mixed with a cocktail containing, dNTPs
(10 mM), MgCl2 (25 mM), RNasin and Superscript II RT (50U) to
a total volume of 10 µl. The primers annealed to RNA template
were extended at 40◦C for 1 h and heated at 70◦C for 10 min to
terminate the reaction. Aliquots of cDNAs (25 ng) were used as
templates for RT-PCR with the forward and reverse primers (50
pmol each) speciﬁc to MsTlyA and MtbTlyA shown in Table 1.
Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions
All the bacterial strains, vectors used in this study are described
in Table 1. M. marinum, M. smegmatis were maintained in 7H9
Middlebrook medium as described earlier (Noens et al., 2011).
For protein expression, M. smegmatis mc2155 was grown in 7H9
Middlebrook medium supplemented with glucose (0.2% w/v),
Tween-80 (0.05% v/v), and Hygromycin B (50 µg/ml) in a shaker
incubator maintained at 37◦C till OD600 ∼0.5. The culture was
then induced with Acetamide (0.001% w/v) and harvested at
7000 × g. E. coli expression was achieved in LB medium as
reported earlier (Rahman et al., 2010).
Contact Dependent Hemolytic Assay
Contact dependent hemolytic assay was performed as described
previously (Rahman et al., 2010). Brieﬂy the bacterial pellet,
obtained as described above, was re-suspended in Sodium
Phosphate buﬀer (25 mM, pH 7.4) and NaCl (150 mM) and
washed twice with the same buﬀer. Mock transformed and
TlyA expressing bacteria (2 × 107) were mixed with RBC (1%)
brieﬂy centrifuged to establish physical contact with the RBC
and incubated for 24 h at room temperature. At the end of
incubation, the samples were centrifuged and the absorbance of
the supernatant was measured at 540 nm. Water was used to
obtain total RBC lysis value.
LC-MALDI-MS/MS Analysis
LC-MS analysis of the boxed region in Figure 1A was performed
as per the mass spectrometry facility of NCCS using protocols
published earlier (Målen et al., 2007; Prados-Rosales et al., 2011;
Reddy et al., 2015).
Microscopic Visualization of TlyA
M. marinum, TlyA expressing M. smegmatis or E. coli were
pelleted, washed several times with PBS and re-suspended in
the same buﬀer followed by incubation with (1:100) immune
rabbit serum raised against TlyA or other primary antibodies
for 1–2 h on ice and washed thrice with PBS. After washing the
bacteria were further incubated with appropriate ﬂuorophore
tagged secondary antibodies (1:100 dilution) for 1 hr and with
DAPI for 10 min. A thin smear was made on the glass slides for
confocal microscopy. Intracellular staining of TlyA transformed
M. smegmatis was achieved by incubating the bacteria in Triton
X-100 (0.1%) and Lysozyme (2 mg/ml) prior to primary antibody
incubation keeping the rest of the procedure identical.
Limited Proteolytic Digestion of TlyA Expressing
Bacteria
Proteinase K accessibility of the TlyA was examined as described
previously (Delogu et al., 2004). TlyA expressing bacteria were
grown as described above and the bacterial pellet was re-
suspended in PBS. Four aliquots of 200 µl (2 × 108) were taken
and three aliquots were treated with Proteinase-K (Promega,
USA) to a ﬁnal concentration of 100 µg/ml and all four tubes
were incubated at 37◦C. At indicated times aliquots were
centrifuged at 7000 × g for 10 min at 4◦C. Pellet and supernatants
were electrophoresed on 12% SDS–PAGE and immune-probed
with anti TlyA antibody and hemolytic assay was performed as
described (Rahman et al., 2010).
Subcellular Fractionation of TlyA
Separation of cell-wall, soluble and membrane fractions of M.
marinum, M. smegmatis, and M. smegmatis/TlyA was achieved
by following the procedures published earlier (Gibbons et al.,
2007; McDonough et al., 2008). Brieﬂy, bacterial pellets (1 gm
wet weight) were re-suspended in Tris buﬀer (50 mM, pH 8.0),
NaCl (150 mM), and pulse sonicated for 20 min (30 s interval
for every 30 s duty cycle) using Sonics Vibra m cell. Cell debris
and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 3000
× g for 20 min at 4◦C. The resultant supernatant was further
centrifuged at 27000 × g for 30 min at 4◦C. The pellet is referred
as the cell-wall fraction and the supernatant was subjected to
ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 120 min at 4◦C to separate
membrane fraction (pellet) and soluble fraction (supernatant).
The cell wall and membrane fractions were washed once and
then re-suspended in PBS. Total protein content of all fractions
was measured and 20 µg of protein was processed for SDS-PAGE
(12%) Inner membrane, outer membrane, periplasmic, and
cytosolic fractions of TlyA expressing E. coli were prepared as
reported earlier using sucrose density gradient approach (Wai
et al., 2003b).
Immunoblotting
Whole-cell lysates of bacterial cultures were prepared as
described previously and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%) for
immunoblotting. Mouse anti-serum against TlyA was used at a
dilution of 1:10000, and monoclonal antibodies of anti-GroEL
(BEI resources, NR-13813) and anti-HBHA (BEI resources, NR-
13804) at 1:500 dilutions. The anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated
antibody (#7076 cell signaling) was used as a secondary antibody.
The E. coli speciﬁc anti-GroEL (Abcam ab-82592) and anti-β-
lactamase (Abcam ab-12251) antibodies were used at a dilution
of 1:500.
Isolation of Membrane Vesicles (MV) and Outer
Membrane Vesicles (OMV)
MV from M. smegmatis and OMV from E. coli cultures were
isolated as described previously (Wai et al., 2003a; Prados-
Rosales et al., 2011). TlyA transformed bacteria, were harvested
at OD600∼0.8 by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 10 min at
4◦C. The supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0.45 µm-pore size
membrane ﬁlter. An aliquot of the supernatant was re-plated on
an appropriate 7H10/LB-antibiotic plate to ensure the absence

150,000 × g for 2 h at 4◦C using the TLA-100 rotor. The vesicle
pellets were washed once and then re-suspended in PBS and
stored in −20◦C for all experiments.
Immuno Gold Labeling of Intact Bacteria
Negative staining of bacteria for electron microscopy was carried
out as described earlier (Wai et al., 2003a; Elluri et al., 2014).
Brieﬂy, non-transformed and TlyA transformed M. smegmatis
were washed several times with PBS, and re-suspended in the
same buﬀer followed by incubation with immune rabbit serum
raised against TlyA (1:100) for 1–2 h on ice. After washing
thrice with PBS, the samples were further incubated with anti-
rabbit IgG-gold (10 nm, Sigma-Aldrich G-7402) for 1 hr. The
unbound gold conjugated antibody was removed by extensive
washing with PBS. The samples were negatively stained with 2%
Uranylacetate on carbon coated grids for visualization in Jeol
electron microscope.
Immunogold Labeling MV and OMV
MV and OMV samples were isolated as described above. The
specimens for electron microscopy were prepared by incubation
of an aliquot of OMV preparation (100 µl) with TlyA speciﬁc
immune rabbit serum (1:100 dilution) in PBS for 1 h on ice.
The vesicles were separated from the serum by centrifugation
at 150,000 g for 2 h at 4◦C, and washed three times with PBS.
The resultant vesicle fraction was mixed with a colloidal gold
conjugated antibody (Sigma-Aldrich G-7402) and kept on ice
for 1 h and unbound gold particles were removed by washing.
The ﬁnal vesicle preparation was negatively stained with 2%
Uranylacetate on carbon coated grids and examined in Jeol
electron microscope (Elluri et al., 2014).
Statistical Analysis
The results are presented as the mean ± S.D. Statistical
signiﬁcance was calculated using Student t-test.
Results
Endogenous TlyA of M. smegmatis is Not
Detectable
The data presented in Supplementary Figure 1A shows
the
eﬀect
of
inducer,
Acetamide,
on
the
expression
of
MtbTlyA in M. smegmatis. In order to keep low expression
threshold, we have set the inducer concentration at 0.001%
for all the experiments described here. This concentration
of inducer is about 200 fold lower in comparison to the
normal protein expression in M. smegmatis (Noens et al.,
2011).
The
MtbTlyA
can
be
puriﬁed
to
homogeneity
(Supplementary Figure 1B) and its activity exhibits concentration
dependence
(Supplementary
Figure
1C).
The
activity
assays were carried out as described earlier (Rahman et al.,
2010).
M. smegmatis was annotated to contain a tlyA gene product,
referred here as MsTlyA (MSMEG_3751) represented by,
A0QYR0 (UniProtKB) which has ∼75% identity with the
MtbTlyA. However, its existence status (as on Mar 2015)
is “predicted” and no experimental evidence exists for its
expression. A deeper examination of ortho-proteogenomic
approaches (covering over 900 proteins), cell-wall speciﬁc
proteomic studies (covering over 300 proteins) as well as of
proteomic response to various drugs by M. smegmatis (covering
over 2500 proteins) could not detect any peptide corresponding
to the MsTlyA using a variety of mass-spectrometry approaches

Kumar et al.
TlyA reaches extra cellular milieu
(Wang and Marcotte, 2008; Gallien et al., 2009; He and De
Buck, 2010). We therefore, sought to examine the status of
endogenous MsTlyA by RT-PCR for tlyA transcript in M.
smegmatis, immuno blot-detection of whole cell lysate and LC-
MS analysis of whole cell lysate for the MW range ∼21–45
KD (boxed region of Figure 1A). We could not detect any
band corresponding to MsTlyA (Figure 1B) or in membrane
fraction (Figure 1C). We have also not detected the tlyA
transcript despite repeated attempts under varying conditions
(Figure 1D). This is consistent with an earlier observation in
which the tlyA gene was said to be absent in M. smegmatis, M.
vaccae, M. kansasii, M. chelonae, and M. phlei based on PCR
ampliﬁcation. Moreover, southern hybridization using the same
PCR product of M. tuberculosis could not identify any positive
band in M. smegmatis (Wren et al., 1998). In support of these
observations, our proteomic attempt also could not detect any
peptide(s) corresponding to MsTlyA either in whole cell lysate
or enriched membrane fractions (The list of protein identiﬁed
by us are detailed in Supplementary Tables 1–3). We could
easily detect several peptides of MtbTlyA upon expression in
M. smegmatis (Supplementary Table 2). This proteomic attempt
of M. smegmatis has allowed us to conﬁrm the expression of
40 proteins in varying conditions and the identity of these
proteins is listed in Supplementary Table 4, which may help other
investigators. In essence, we could not positively ascertain the
expression of endogenous TlyA of M. smegmatis. It is relevant to
mention here that Akhilesh Pandey and co-workers have detected
three peptides of MtbTlyA, notably, in the culture ﬁltrate of
H37Rv (Kelkar et al., 2011).
TlyA is Present on the Cell-surface
While evidences in the literature indirectly suggested the
presence of “hemolysin like” molecules at the cell wall of M.
tuberculosis, there had been no direct visualization of TlyA to
date. In view of this, we next examined for the cell surface
presence of TlyA by immuno-ﬂuorescence on the surface of wild
type M. marinum, TlyA expressing M. smegmatis and E. coli.
Our confocal visualization showed clear staining for the TlyA on
wild type M. marinum (Figure 1E), M. smegmatis (Figure 1F)
and also on the surface of E. coli (Figure 1G). We have also
performed dual staining of TlyA expressing M. smegmatis with
anti-HBHA protein which is known to be part of cell-wall.
As shown in Figure 1H (top panel), the TlyA is colocalized
with HBHA. It is relevant to mention here that our staining
procedures did not involve either permeabilization or ﬁxation.
For example, the GroEL of M. smegmatis cannot be visualized
without permeabilization (Figure 1H, middle panel) while it can
be seen only after permeabilization (Figure 1H bottom panel).
These results suggest us that our staining procedures are not
detecting the TlyA that is intracellular.
TlyA is a Surface-accessible Protein
We next examined for exposed amino acid segments of TlyA
upon expression in M. smegmatis and E. coli with the help of
limited proteolysis by Proteinase K. In this approach, we have
incubated the bacteria expressing the TlyA with and without
Proteinase K and equal aliquots of bacteria were then analyzed
by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. In principle, even
small surface-exposed loops/amino-acid segments are expected
to be cleaved upon exposure to Proteinase K. As shown in
Figures 2A,C, the intensities of the bands of the full-length

bacteria.(7 × 107) were incubated with 1% rabbit RBC at room temp for 24 h
to assess the degree of lysis by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm of RBC
free supernatant.
TlyA, associated with M. smegmatis (Figure 2A) and E. coli
(Figure 2C), were reduced by more than 50% upon Proteinase
K treatment. In contrast, the intensity of the intracellular GroEL
remained constant over the same period implying that the
Proteinase K treatment of the bacteria has not resulted in
digestion/degradation of intracellular proteins. Consistent with
this observation, the Proteinase K digestion has diminished
the contact dependent hemolytic activity of the M. smegmatis
(Figure 2B) and E. coli (Figure 2D) associated TlyA, which is a
characteristic property of TlyA expressing bacteria (King et al.,
1993; Wren et al., 1998; Rahman et al., 2010). It is clear from
the ﬁgure that the hemolysis has signiﬁcantly reduced in 10 min.
Thus, it is likely that the amino-acid segments of TlyA are
exposed at the bacterial surface of M. smegmatis and E. coli and
accessible to Proteinase K.
Cell Surface Presence of TlyA is not Dependent
on SecA2, TatA and TatC
Both Tat and Sec pathway transport proteins which have
characteristic signal sequence at their N- terminal for secretion
(Lee et al., 2006). The SecA2 is responsible for the export of
a small subset of proteins and is required for virulence of the
pathogenic M. tuberculosis (Braunstein et al., 2003; Gibbons et al.,
2007). M. smegmatis also possesses a SecA2 system, which is
functionally conserved with that of M. tuberculosis (Braunstein
et al., 2001, 2003). In M. tuberculosis it has not been possible
to construct Tat deﬁcient mutants which appears to be essential
(Saint-Joanis et al., 2006; McDonough et al., 2008). It is relevant
to note that the TlyA does not have any signal sequence in favor
of either Sec or Tat pathways. If the TlyA was to utilize either of
these two pathways through non-conventional or pseudo motifs,
the Tat/Sec pathway knock-out strains of M. smegmatis should
not show the presence of TlyA in the membrane fractions. The
TatA, TatC, SecA2 deﬁcient strains of M. smegmatis used in the
present are same as the ones reported earlier (McDonough et al.,
2005, 2008; Gibbons et al., 2007). We, therefore, have carried out
the fractionation of the 1TatA, 1TatC, 1SecA2 expressing the
TlyA construct by using well established procedures (Gibbons
et al., 2007).
The data in Figures 3A,B respectively show the presence of
MtbTlyA and MmTlyA in the membrane fractions of H37Rv and
M. marinum respectively. It is relevant to mention here that the
whole cell lysate and membrane fractions, shown in Figure 3A,
were obtained from BEI resources and serve as an independent
veriﬁcation. As expected, the MmTlyA is also detected in the
membrane fraction as seen Figure 3B.
The immunoblot in Figure 3C shows an unambiguous
presence of MtbTlyA in the membrane fraction of M. smegmatis
upon its expression. Interestingly, the MtbTlyA is also seen in
the membrane fractions of M. smegmatis deﬁcient in 1TatA
(Figure 3D), 1TatC (Figure 3E) and 1SecA2 (Figure 3F). It is
relevant to note that SecA1 deﬁciency is lethal for M. smegmatis
and hence, could not be studied (Braunstein et al., 2001). We
have also examined for HBHA and GroEL as internal controls
of this fractionation. While the HBHA is always restricted to cell-
wall fraction, the GroEL is found only in soluble fraction than
membrane fraction, which validates our fractionation attempt.
After having visualized the TlyA in M. smegmatis, we next
performed sub-cellular fractionation of E. coli/TlyA to separate
outer-membrane, periplasmic, inner-membrane, and cytosolic

soluble fraction of 100,000 g (supernatant). In panel G, the C, P, OM, and IM

fractions by well established protocols (Wai et al., 2003b). The
TlyA is present in inner-membrane, periplasmic space and outer
membrane (Figure 3G). Under the same conditions, the GroEL,
β-lactamase and GFP were observed in cytosolic, periplasmic
and cytosolic fractions which again support our fractionation
attempt. The small periplasmic presence of GFP could be due
to osmotic shock in the procedure. Hence, the presence of
TlyA in the membrane fractions of M. smegmatis or E. coli is
not due to artifact of expression but a speciﬁc sequestration
might be responsible since membrane fractions of both H37Rv,
M. marinum also exhibit an unambiguous presence of TlyA.
In support of all the above observations, we could easily see
the presence of TlyA on the surface of 1TatA, 1TatC, and
1SecA2 deﬁcient strains of M. smegmatis while the mock vector-
transformed bacteria did not exhibit any positive ﬂuorescence
staining as seen in Figure 4A In support of this observation,

supernatant.
all the TlyA expressing 1TatA, 1TatC, and 1SecA2 knockout
strains have exhibited contact dependent hemolytic activity
(Figure 4B). The data shown in Figure 4B clearly let us infer
that there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in hemolytic activity among
the TlyA expressing strains. Hence, the TlyA does not seem
to depend on either Tat or Sec pathways for translocation to
cell-wall of M. smegmatis.
TlyA are Part of Membrane and Outer Membrane
Vehicles (MV and OMV)
Both gram negative and gram positive bacteria secrete Outer
Membrane Vesicles (OMV) and Membrane Vesicles (MV)
respectively (Wai et al., 2003a; Prados-Rosales et al., 2011). We,
therefore, examined whether we can detect TlyA in MV secreted
by M. smegmatis and OMV secreted by E. coli. The supernatants
used for the identiﬁcation of TlyA in the membrane vesicles was
thoroughly assessed for the absence of viable bacteria by plating
an aliquot on appropriate plate after ﬁltration through 0.45 µm
membrane. As shown in Figure 5A (MV from M. smegmatis)
and Figure 5C (OMV from E. coli), the presence of TlyA is
unambiguous in both MV and OMV fractions. In this regard,
we have used DnaK in case of MV from M. smegmatis and
β-lactamase in case of OMV from E. coli to authenticate our
vesicle preparations. Both MV and OMV shown above contain
active TlyA since they are able to lyse rabbit RBC as seen in
Figures 5B,D. We have also attempted to examine these vesicles
by negative staining in transmission electron microscopy. We
have found small outer membrane vesicles surrounding the intact
bacterium with gold particles (Figure 5E right panel) while the
non-transformed bacteria did not exhibit any gold particles on
its periphery (Figure 5E left panel). We have also examined the
puriﬁed MV and OMV by immune-gold labeling and negative
staining. The EM micrographs of MV of M. smegmatis/TlyA
(Figure 5F top right panel) and OMV of E. coli/TlyA (Figure 5F
bottom right panel) have shown gold particles at the periphery of
the vesicles while the non-transformed MV (Figure 5F top left
panel) or OMV (Figure 5F bottom left panel) did not exhibit
any gold particles in their periphery. These observations suggest
that the bacterially expressed TlyA is capable of reaching the
extra-cellular milieu using a vesicle mediated transport.
Discussion
The goal of this study is to ascertain whether or not the TlyA class
of proteins can reach extra-cellular milieu despite the absence
of signal sequences. The TlyA, currently annotated as a rRNA
methyl transferase, can also function as a hemolytic entity. In
order to exert its hemolytic functionality, it is necessary for the
TlyA to establish a physical contact with the target membrane for
this “non-conventional hemolytic trait.”
We have presented several evidences which show the presence
of TlyA on the surface of M. marinum (native host), M. smegmatis
(a surrogate host) and E. coli (a heterologous host) (Figure 1).
The presence of TlyA at the cell-wall of these bacteria was
strengthened with data on protease accessibility as shown in
Figure 2. The TlyA protein was also detected in the membrane
fraction of H37Rv (Figure 3A), M. marinum (Figure 3B), M.

section. The presence of TlyA in the vesicles was ascertained by
developing respective blots with anti-TlyA antibody (A,C). Hemolytic
activity of MV secreted by M. smegmatis (B) and OMV secreted by
E. coli (D) was obtained by mixing 20 µg/ml (total protein) of vesicle
preparation with 1.5% rabbit RBC. After 24 h of incubation, the

note that Kelkar et al. have also detected 3 peptides of TlyA in
the culture ﬁltrate by mass spectroscopy (Kelkar et al., 2011).
Interestingly, the TlyA is not dependent on TatA, TatC or SecA2
pathways to reach the cell-surface. Although it might appear
that the proportion of TlyA present in TatC knockout strain
is relatively less in comparison to other strains but it is not
completely absent and it can be visualized on the surface of the
bacteria (Figure 4A). These observations suggest us that the TlyA
may not utilize the Tat or Sec mediated transport mechanism
to reach the cell-surface. At the outset it might appear that the
TlyA may utilize the Esx-1 secretion pathway of mycobacterial
species. However, it is known that the Esx-1 secretion pathway
of M. smegmatis is involved in conjugation rather than protein
secretion (Flint et al., 2004). Moreover, proteins secreted through
the mycobacterial Esx-1 system appear to contain a conserved

sequence at their C-terminus viz. “WXG” with a size limit of
<100 amino acids. The TlyA is not fulﬁlling either of the criteria
since it has 268 amino acids and does not contain any “WXG”
motif in its C-terminal region. In addition, the TlyA does not
seem to have any “partner” to facilitate the secretion through
dimerization as the well known Esx-1 substrates viz. Esat6 and
Cfp10 are secreted as hetero-dimer. In view of these observations,
we speculate that the TlyA may not be utilizing the Esx-1
pathway. It is relevant to mention here that the mycobacterium
possesses many proteins which do not have the classical signal
sequences that signify the Tat or Sec pathways (listed in Table 2),
yet, found to be present at the cell surface. Hence, more studies
are needed to identify the routes they utilize to reach the cell-
surface and their function. In essence, the TlyA can reach the
bacterial cell-wall despite the absence of signal sequence or
apparent transmembrane segments identiﬁable with the present
knowledge embedded in Bioinformatic tools.
The hemolytic trait of the MtbTlyA discussed here is also in
agreement with certain instances reported in the literature. For
example, the TlyA of H. pylori (our unpublished data and recently
published work of Lata et al., 2014) and a recent study involving
TlyA of L. interrogans have all showed hemolytic activity, while
TlyA of L. interrogans needs a formal conﬁrmation for its rRNA
methylase activity (Rahman et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2012).
Although, we have earlier ruled out the role of other molecules for
the hemolytic activity, it is still possible that other proteins and/or
complexes might be involved for the said hemolytic activity. It
is also possible that not all TlyA proteins (identiﬁed so far in
literature in various species) may exhibit this hemolytic trait as
it may also depend on the environment. For example, the TlyA
of H. pylori was found to be restricted to whole bacterial cells
and insoluble fractions (membrane fractions) based on hemolytic
activity suggesting that the TlyA is somehow associated with
cell-wall (Martino et al., 2001). Interestingly, the TlyA is also
detected in the membrane vesicles secreted by M. smegmatis and
E. coli (Figure 5). In comparison to TlyA protein, the E. coli
ClyA (UniProtKB:P77335) also sequesters into inner membrane,
outer membrane vesicles despite the absence of Tat or Sec signal
sequences (Wai et al., 2003a,b). Though TlyA and ClyA are
not homologous, both appear to get exported through outer
membrane vesicles in a similar fashion.
We have recently shown that TlyA expressing bacteria
adhere better to RAW264.7 macrophages and get phagocytosed
eﬃciently. The internalized bacteria avoid acidiﬁcation to the
extent of >65% in case of E. coli and >80% in case of M.
smegmatis (Mittal et al., 2014). Moreover, both spleen and lung
of TlyA immunized mice have exhibited four fold less CFU
in comparison to the unimmunized mice when the mice were
challenged with TlyA expressing M. smegmatis, while the CFU
of immunized mice challenged with normal M. smegmatis have
remained same as that of the unimmunized mice. This result
suggests that the TlyA is exposed on the surface of the M.
smegmatis and immune serum can recognize it under in vivo
conditions (Mittal et al., 2014). In summary, TlyA can reach
the cell-wall of bacteria that express it despite the absence of
signal sequences. It is interesting to study how the cell-wall
sequestration is orchestrated by the bacteria and the factors that
contribute to it.
