Here we report a novel regulatory mechanism for autophagy-mediated degradation of Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis (Mtb) and speciƤc strategy exploited by the virulent Mtb to evade it. We show while 
both avirulent (H37Ra) and virulent (H37Rv) mycobacteria could readily localize to autophagosomes, 
their maturation into autolysosomes (ƪux) was signiƤcantly inhibited by the latter strain. The 
inhibition of autophagy ƪux by the virulent strain was highly selective, as it did not perturb the basal 
autophagy ƪux in the macrophages. Selective inhibition of ƪux of Mtb-containing autophagosomes 
required virulence regulators PhoP and ESAT-6. We show that the maturation of Mtb-containing 
autophagosomes into autolysosomes required recruitment of the late endosome marker RAB7, 
forming the intermediate compartment amphisomes. Virulent Mtb selectively evaded their targeting 
to the amphisomes. Thus we report a crosstalk between autophagy and phagosome maturation 
pathway and highlight the adaptability of Mtb, manifested by selective regulation of autophagy ƪux.
Autophagy is a degradation process where cellular cargos are delivered to the lysosomes. Initially con-
sidered as a response activated under stress conditions, speciﬁcally nutrient stress, autophagy now is 
known to impact on diverse patho-physiological conditions like aging, neurodegenaration, inﬂammation 
and infection1,2. Recently the new paradigm of selective autophagy has emerged through which damaged 
cellular organelles or intracellular bacterial pathogens could be selectively targeted to autophagy for 
degradation. Te ability to selectively recognize and target its cargo towards degradation has essentially 
led to the recognition of the autophagy pathway as an innate defense mechanism3. Te autophagy of 
intracellular pathogen is termed as xenophagy while those of damaged organelle or other cellular cargo 
as macro-autophagy or simply autophagy4. Not surprisingly therefore, many intracellular pathogens 
including Listeria, Legionella, Shigella, Salmonella, Coxiella, Group A Streptococcus and Mycobacteria are 
known to speciﬁcally evade autophagy5.
Upon infection of macrophages with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the role of phagosome matu-
ration pathway has been well elucidated6. Also known are the mechanisms leading to phagosome matu-
ration arrest that help virulent Mtb escape from being targeted to lysosomes and killing7,8. For instance 
it has been convincingly shown that virulent Mtb-containing phagosomes do not acquire late endosome 
marker RAB7, leading to phagosomal maturation arrest7,8. Interestingly autophagy is yet another mech-
anism which can inﬂuence the targeting of Mtb to the lysosomes and subsequent killing. Despite sev-
eral reports on the involvement of autophagy in regulation of Mtb killing9–11, how these two processes

(autophagy and phagosome maturation) interact with each other and get perturbed by Mtb remains 
poorly understood.
Autophagy involves sequestration of cellular cargo in a double-membrane structure called autopha-
gosomes. Autophagy induction is conventionally monitored as MAP1LC3B (LC3) puncta formation 
through microscopy. It emerges now, autophagy induction does not always lead to degradation of the 
cargo. Degradation typically involves fusion of autophagosomes with the lysosomes thereby forming 
autolysosomes and subsequent action of lysosomal hydrolases. However during the degradation process, 
LC3 on the inner membrane of autophagosomes too gets degraded due to the activity of lysosomal 
hydrolase12. Terefore when active autophagic degradation is taking place, LC3 would be constantly 
degraded leaving only the outer membrane associated LC3 intact and thereby making it diﬃcult to accu-
rately assess autophagy induction. Te degradation of LC3 however can be blocked by vacuolar ATPase 
inhibitors like baﬁlomycin A1 or lysosomal protease inhibitors like E64-d and pepstatin A12. Strangely 
several studies in the past, which showed an important role for autophagy in case of Mtb infections, did 
not monitor autophagy ﬂux9,13,14. In some studies however, in case of Mtb infections autophagy ﬂux as 
a means of bacterial degradation were monitored15–17. One such report suggests strain dependent varia-
tions in autophagy induction which also correlated with the autophagic degradation17. Yet another study 
identiﬁed the immunity regulator molecule TBK1 as key regulator of autophagy maturation15.
In the present study we aimed to investigate the autophagy ﬂux in THP-1 macrophages upon Mtb 
infection in detail using laboratory strains H37Ra (avirulent) and H37Rv (virulent). Interestingly both 
the virulent and avirulent strains localized to the autophagosomes. Later in the infection, the ﬂux of 
Mtb-containing autophagosomes was speciﬁcally inhibited by the virulent Mtb. We then show that the 
inhibition of autophagy ﬂux by H37Rv was the result of its ability to block recruitment of RAB7 on 
Mtb-containing autophagosomes. Terefore through this study we report a RAB7-dependent autophagy 
pathway of mycobacterial killing in macrophages.
Results
Virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis selectively inhibits autophagy ƪux. 
Te laboratory 
strains H37Rv and H37Ra of Mtb, consistent with previous reports, showed distinct survival ability 
within the macrophages (Fig. S1A)18–20. To check how autophagy gets regulated under the two condi-
tions, we monitored targeting of H37Ra or H37Rv to LC3 positive autophagosomes by immuno-stain-
ing followed by confocal microscopy. THP-1 macrophages were infected with H37Ra or H37Rv at 1:10 
MOI following the protocol described previously10. We monitored autophagosome targeting of the two 
strains at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-infection. Troughout the course of infection, both H37Ra and 
H37Rv eﬃciently co-localized with LC3 containing compartments (Fig. 1A). Te antibody used to stain 
endogenous LC3 was highly speciﬁc and did not show any cross-reactivity with the Mtb (Fig. S1B and 
S1C). We calculated the M1 Coeﬃcient with respect to Mtb (herein afer referred to as co-localization 
coeﬃcient, see methods) to measure co-localization of both the strains to autophagosomes. In parallel 
we also had groups where samples were treated with vacuolar ATPase inhibitor Baﬁlomycin A1 (BafA1, 
100 nM) for three hours before the end of each of the time points. Treatment with BafA1 inhibits LC3 
degradation upon maturation by blocking the acidiﬁcation of autolysosomes. We observed a signiﬁcant 
increase in the co-localization coeﬃcient of H37Ra with LC3 in BafA1 treated samples relative to the 
untreated ones from 24 hours post infection (Fig. 1B). Importantly no such increase was observed in case 
of H37Rv across all time points (Fig. 1C).
We also tested these results in mouse bone marrow derived primary macrophages (BMDMs). 
Consistent with the results above, BafA1 treatment in BMDMs led to an increase in the co-localization 
coeﬃcient of H37Ra and LC3, while there was no eﬀect of BafA1 treatment in the case of H37Rv 
(Fig. 1D,E). Interestingly, Western blot analysis of LC3 in the whole cell lysates from H37Ra or H37Rv 
infected as well as uninfected THP-1 macrophages showed increased levels of lipidated LC3 (LC3II, 
Fig. 1F) upon BafA1 treatment, implying maturation of autophagosomes at certain basal state in these 
cells. We also noted both in THP-1 macrophages and in BMDMs, presence of autophagosomes that did 
not contain either H37Ra or H37Rv (arrows in Fig. 1A,D).
Diﬀerential ﬂux of H37Ra and H37Rv containing autophagosomes was also conﬁrmed by monitoring 
co-localization of Mtb with autolysosomes (Fig. 1G,H). Since BafA1 treatment diminishes LysoTracker 
staining of lysosomes, we used lysosomal protease inhibitors E64-d and pepstatin A to monitor H37Ra 
or H37Rv in LC3:LysoTracker double positive compartments representing autolysosomes. We observed 
a signiﬁcantly higher percentage of H37Ra in autolysosomes, as compared to H37Rv, from 24 hour post 
infection (Fig. 1H). We also noted, in both the cases, presence of LC3:LysoTracker double positive com-
partments that did not contain any Mtb (Fig. 1G, arrows).
Mycobacterium tuberculosis PhoP and ESAT-6 help H37Rv inhibit autophagy ƪux. 
Te strain 
H37Ra diﬀers from H37Rv mainly due to a point mutation in the master regulator gene PhoP21 and 
expression of wild-type (WT) PhoP (from H37Rv) in H37Ra is shown to revert the virulent pheno-
type21,22. We asked whether PhoP, a known Mtb virulence regulator, could help H37Rv modulate host 
xenophagy ﬂux. We monitored co-localization of WT-PhoP complemented H37Ra strain (H37Ra:PhoP) 
with LC3 in THP-1 macrophages. PhoP complementation of H37Ra was conﬁrmed by real-time analysis 
of several genes known to be regulated by PhoP (Fig. S2). Te co-localization coeﬃcient of H37Ra:PhoP

with LC3 did not show any increase upon BafA1 treatment at 48 hours post infection (Fig. 2A). Tis 
response was similar to that of H37Rv at 48 hours post infection (Fig. 1A,C). Subsequently, H37Ra:PhoP 
had signiﬁcantly higher intracellular survival with respect to H37Ra at 48 hours post infection (Fig. 2B). 
Partial rescue of the PhoP complemented strain further conﬁrmed the association of autophagic ﬂux 
with Mtb killing.
Te Mtb PhoP is a global transcriptional factor involved in regulating the expression of RD1 region. 
H37Ra shows much diminished secretion of ESAT-6, the major antigen on RD1 locus and a well-known 
mycobacterial virulence eﬀector21,23. To test if PhoP mediated block in the autophagy ﬂux was eﬀected 
by ESAT-6, we used ESAT-6 deleted mutant of H37Rv (∆ESAT-6). BafA1 treatment led to signiﬁcant 
increase in the co-localization of ∆ESAT-6 strain with LC3 (Fig.  2C). To note here is that the block 
in autophagy ﬂux observed in case of H37Rv was released with the deletion of ESAT-6. As expected, 
∆ESAT-6 strain showed compromised survival in the THP-1 macrophages compared to the wild type 
H37Rv (Fig. 2D). Moreover treatment with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, was able to rescue ∆ESAT-6 
from killing (Fig. 2D).
H37Rv inhibits amphisome formation. 
We next wanted to understand the cellular events in the 
host that gets perturbed by virulent Mtb in order to inhibit autophagy ﬂux. Maturation of autophago-
somes involves direct fusion with the lysosome to form auto-lysosome or they can ﬁrst recruit RAB7 
to form amphisomes which eventually fuse with the lysosomes2,24. It is well known that H37Rv inhibits 
RAB7 recruitment to escape lysosomal targeting and killing8. Terefore, we tested whether RAB7 recruit-
ment on autophagosomes (amphisomes) could also represent a mechanism of H37Rv to evade lysosomal 
fusion. Terefore, we monitored co-localization of H37Ra and H37Rv to LC3-RAB7 double positive 
compartment (hereby deﬁned as amphisomes) at 48 hours post-infection.
As expected we observed signiﬁcantly higher co-localization of H37Ra with either LC3 or RAB7 as 
compared to H37Rv (Fig. 3A,B). Consistent with that, the percentage of H37Ra was signiﬁcantly higher 
in amphisome (LC3:RAB7 double positive) as compared to H37Rv at 48 hours post infection (Fig. 3C). 
However, LC3-RAB7 co-localization, representing overall amphisome population in the cell, was similar 
for both the strains. Tese results clearly suggest that RAB7 recruitment to autophagosomes is signif-
icantly higher in H37Ra as compared to H37Rv. Terefore, we next tested whether the inhibition of 
autophagic ﬂux by virulent Mtb is associated with RAB7 recruitment.

was complemented with wild type phoP (called as H37Ra:PhoP strain). Panel A shows M1 co-localization 
coeﬃcient of H37Ra:PhoP with LC3 in the presence or absence of BafA1 treatment, 48 hours post infection. 
Panel (B) shows relative survival percentage in THP-1 macrophages with respect to H37Rv, H37Ra or 
H37Ra:PhoP at 48 hours post-infection (mean ±  SD, *p-value <  0.05). M1 co-localization coeﬃcient of 
∆ESAT-6 mutant of H37Rv with LC3 compartment in BafA1 treated and untreated condition is shown in 2C

macrophages, 48 hours post-infection. Te ∆ESAT-6 strain infected cells were treated with 3-MA (5 mM, 
12 hours) to observe their rescue upon autophagy inhibition (mean ±  SD, *p-value <  0.05, **p-value <  0.001).

Exclusion of RAB7 from Mtb-containing autophagosome allows H37Rv to escape lysosome 
targeting. 
In order to elucidate the role of RAB7 in modulating ﬂux of Mtb-containing autophago-
somes, speciﬁc siRNA was used to knockdown RAB7 in infected THP-1 macrophages. Speciﬁc knock-
down of RAB7 was veriﬁed by Western blots (Fig S3A). As shown in Fig. 4A, RAB7 knockdown inhibited 
the ﬂux of H37Ra-containing autophagosomes. Tere was no eﬀect on ﬂux of H37Rv-containing com-
partments (Fig. 4A). Intriguingly RAB7 siRNA also led to inhibition of general autophagy ﬂux in THP-1 
macrophages (Fig. S3B and S3C). As expected, co-localization of H37Ra to lysosomes was signiﬁcantly 
inhibited in the RAB7 knockdown macrophages (Fig. 4B). Moreover RAB7 depletion also resulted in 
improved intracellular survival of H37Ra (Fig. 4C).
Discussions
Autophagy as a defence mechanism in case of Mtb infection has been shown by several studies in the 
past9,11,25. Given the fundamental role of autophagy in cells as homeostatic mechanism under various 
stress conditions, how Mtb could speciﬁcally manipulate it, remains poorly understood. Tere are studies 
on strain speciﬁc regulation of autophagy, suggesting that the virulent strains of Mtb induce autophagy 
to a lesser extent in contrast to the non-pathogenic, attenuated strains17. Some other reports however 
suggest while the wild-type strains could induce autophagy, the attenuated ones could not14. Here we 
exclusively focused on the regulation of maturation of Mtb-containing autophagosomes and observed a 
distinct pattern of selectivity between the virulent and avirulent strains of Mtb in regulating autophagy 
ﬂux.
We show here that both virulent and avirulent strains of Mtb can readily localize to the autophago-
somes. Our experiments with BafA1 revealed a higher co-localization of H37Ra with autophagosomes 
relative to the untreated set post 24 hours of infection. Since BafA1 inhibits LC3 degradation in the 
autolysosomes, we believe the increase in co-localization was due to the enhanced signals from the accu-
mulated, undegraded LC3 molecules in the autolysosomes. Tis result implies ﬂux of H37Ra-containing 
autophagosomes that were maturing into autolysosomes. On the other hand, we did not observe any 
increase in the co-localization of H37Rv with autophagosomes upon BafA1 treatment throughout the

course of infection, thereby suggesting a block in the ﬂux of H37Rv-containing autophagosomes. Tis 
diﬀerential ﬂux of Mtb-containing autophagosomes was corroborated by higher localization of H37Ra 
with the autolysosomes as compared to H37Rv. We found a crucial role of the virulence factors PhoP and 
ESAT-6 in eﬀecting this maturation block of Mtb-containing autophagosomes. Similar role of ESAT-6 in 
the regulation of autophagy ﬂux in infected dendritic cells has been shown earlier16.
Curiously, we observed several autophagosomes devoid of bacteria in the infected cells. Moreover, 
several of those autophagosomes were at maturation stage co-localizing with the acidiﬁed lysosomes. 
Tis observation indicated that the autophagosomes, which did not contain Mtb, could mature without 
being inﬂuenced by infection. Te LC3 immunoblots provided additional evidence supporting the selec-
tive nature of maturation block brought by the virulent strain. Tis observation opens up an interesting 
possibility that non-Mtb-containing autophagosomes and Mtb-containing autophagosomes (xenophago-
somes) could have distinct maturation dynamics within the same cell. A blanket inhibition of autophagy, 
under many circumstances, would lead to induction of apoptosis, which may be detrimental to Mtb 
survival19. By speciﬁcally blocking the maturation of compartments where H37Rv resides, it avoids being 
killed by lysosomal mechanism. At the same time by allowing cellular autophagy, it ensures extended 
survival of the host26,27. However, this interesting possibility deserves more detailed investigation.
Our results on the role of RAB7 in autophagosome maturation provide novel insights into func-
tioning of this small GTPase. Exclusion of RAB7 on phagosomes by virulent Mtb has been classically 
reported as the mechanism for avoiding lysosomal degradation28. It seems phagosome maturation goes 
hand-in-hand with autophagosome maturation and that at least Mtb-containing autophagosomes do 
not mature into autolysosomes without recruiting RAB7 to form an intermediate amphisome. How the 
resident virulent Mtb could block autophagosome fusion with late endosomes remains unanswered. 
However in case of phagosome maturation, it was shown that the failure to recruit RAB7 to H37Rv 
phagosome was contingent on the lipid product phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns[3]P) and sub-
sequent binding of RAB5 eﬀector EEA129. However it remains unclear if that holds true even in the 
case of autophagosomes. Interestingly a number of studies propose, in other systems, role of RAB7 
in the maturation phase of autophagy30–32. Te importance of maturation step of autophagy in case of 
Mtb infections was also supported by the study where TBK1, an innate immunity regulator was shown 
Figure 4.  Exclusion of RAB7 from Mtb-containing autophagosome allows H37Rv to escape lysosome 
targeting. THP-1 macrophages infected with H37Ra or H37Rv were treated with speciﬁc siRNA against 
RAB7 (50 nM) till 48 hours post infection. Panel (A) shows co-localization coeﬃcient M1 of H37Ra and

to regulate autophagy maturation to eliminate BCG infections15. Intriguingly, upon RAB7 depletion in 
THP-1 macrophages, even the general autophagy ﬂux gets perturbed. Tat raises another question on 
how the selectivity in autophagosome maturation could be ensured by resident virulent Mtb if RAB7 is 
essential for autophagosome maturation in general. One plausible explanation for this may be selective 
modulation of RAB5 eﬀector function by H37Rv leading to altered autophagosome. Tus even though 
late endosomes could eﬃciently fuse with other autophagosomes, H37Rv-containing autophagosomes 
evade this process. Such mechanisms are studied in case of phagosome maturation29, whether similar 
mechanism could be functional in case of autophagy needs further investigations. In this study we could 
not distinguish autophagy from LC3 associated phagocytosis (LAP). Involvement of LAP in Mtb infec-
tions remains debatable despite some reports emerging on it, and needs further investigations33,34. Te 
crosstalk between the autophagy pathway and the phagosome maturation pathway has been schemati-
cally summarized in Fig. 5.
Figure 5.  Revisiting Mtb phagosome maturation pathway. Mtb in the phagosomes could follow many 
pathways. Mtb, especially the virulent strains, is known to escape from the phagosome. Both phagosome 
bound and cytosolic Mtb may get trapped in the autophagosomes. Phagosome may also directly recruit LC3 
to form a LAP vesicle. Further maturation of phagosomes, LAP or autophagosomes depends on recruitment 
of RAB7, which facilitates eventual fusion with the lysosome for degradation. Virulent strains of Mtb 
inhibit RAB7 recruitment on the phagosomes. Tis study shows, similar inhibition of RAB7 recruitment on 
autophagosomes and possibly on LAP by the virulent strain.

In conclusion we report here a mechanism whereby virulent Mtb strain could selectively block matura-
tion of the resident autophagosomes. We show that the virulent Mtb could achieve this by avoiding RAB7 
recruitment to form the amphisomes. Te crucial role of amphisome compartment in the regulation of 
intracellular Mtb survival has added new dimensions to our understanding of cell autonomous defense 
mechanisms in case of Mtb infections. Understanding the regulation of autophagy maturation at molec-
ular level could help identify novel and perhaps better host directed drug targets against tuberculosis.
Materials and Methods
Ethics statement. 
All the experiments with animals were performed in accordance with the approved 
guidelines and regulations of the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC). Te experiments were 
performed upon prior approval from the institutional ethics committee (IAEC) of International Center 
for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (Approval no.: ICGEB/AH/2013/03/IMM-38).
Cells and Infections. 
THP-1 cells were diﬀerentiated with PMA (Sigma, P1269) at a concentration of 
20 ng/ml for 24 hours. For infection, Mtb (H37Ra and H37Rv) single-cell suspensions were prepared as 
described by Kumar et al. and infections were done at an MOI of 1:10 for 4 hours followed by amikacin 
treatment of 2 hours. Te subsequent time points were considered from here on.
Bacterial cultures and media. 
Bacteria were grown as stationary cultures in Middlebrook 7H9 broth 
(BD Difco, Becton Dickinson) supplemented with 10% ADC (Becton Dickinson), 0.4% Glycerol and 
0.05% Tween-80 until the mid-log phase. Te bacteria were then harvested, washed with RPMI and used 
for suspension preparation.
Bacterial suspension preparation and Infection. 
Bacterial whole cell suspension was dispersed by 
aspiration ﬁve times each with a 23- and then a 26-gauge needle, followed by an additional dispersion 
by aspiration 3 times through a 30-gauge needle. Te dispersed bacteria were allowed to stand for 5 min 
to allow the clumps to settle down. Te upper half of the suspension was then used for the experiments. 
Quantitation of bacteria was done by taking absorbance at 600 nm wavelength (0.6 O.D. corresponds to 
~100 ×  106 bacteria). Complete media containing the required number of bacteria was added to the cul-
tured cells at an MOI of 10, followed by a short spin of the culture plates at 700 rpm for 5 minutes. Afer 
4 hours of infection, the cells were washed twice with warm RPMI and treated with Amikacin (200 μ g/
ml, HiMedia laboratories) to remove any extracellular bacteria. Afer two hours of treatment, the cells 
were washed and maintained in complete media. For microscopy experiments, the desired number of 
bacteria were stained with PKH67 (green)(Sigma-Aldrich Co. MINI67-1KT), lipophilic ﬂuorescent dye, 
as per the manufacturer’s protocol. Te stained bacteria were passed thrice through a 26-gauge needle 
and were then used for infection.
Animals and isolation of BMDMs. 
Bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated 
from femurs of BALB/C mice (4-6 weeks old, female). BMDMs were obtained by culturing the marrow 
cells in the presence of macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, eBioscience, 14-8983-80) for 7 
days. Fully diﬀerentiated macrophages were harvested and seeded for infection with H37Ra or H37Rv. 
Te infection protocol was same as described above for THP-1 macrophages.
Inhibitor treatments. 
E64-d (Sigma, E8640) and PepstatinA (Sigma, P5318) treatments were given 
at a concentration of 25 μ g/ml and 10 μ g/ml, respectively for 2 hours prior to ﬁxation. Autophagy was 
inhibited by 3-Methyladenine (Sigma, M9281) treatment, added 48 hours post infection, at a concentra-
tion of 5 mM. Autophagy ﬂux was monitored using BaﬁlomycinA1 (Invivogen, tlrl-baf1) at 100 nM for 
3 hours. LysoTracker Red DND-99 (Molecular Probes, L-7528) was used to monitor acidiﬁed lysosomes 
at 200 nM concentration for one hour.
Construction of PhoP over-expressing Mtb H37Ra strain. 
For expressing H37Rv PhoP in H37Ra, 
gene encoding H37Rv PhoP (Rv 0757) was PCR ampliﬁed and cloned into E.coli-Mycobacterial shuttle 
vector, pSD5hsp35. Te pSD5-phoP construct was then electroporated into Mtb H37Ra and transformants 
were selected on 7H11 medium containing kanamycin (25 ug/ml). Te expression of phoP was under 
strong hsp65 gene promoter from M. leprae.
siRNA treatments. 
We followed established protocols for siRNA treatments of diﬀerentiated THP-1 
cells as described earlier10. RAB7 siRNA were procured from Dharmacon (M-010388-00-0005). Addition 
of RAB7 siRNA was done afer amikacin wash and treatment was done for 48 hours.
Confocal Microscopy. 
One hour prior to the termination of the experiment, complete media con-
taining LysoTracker dye at a concentration of 200 nM was added to the cells for staining of acidiﬁed lys-
osomes. Following the required treatments, the cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 20 
minutes, followed by 3 washes with 1X PBS. Te cells were permeabilized using 0.2% (w/v) TritonX-100 
in 1X PBS for 20 minutes. Blocking was performed using 3%( w/v) BSA and 0.5%Tween20 in 1X PBS 
for one hour. Tis was followed by primary and secondary antibody staining for duration of one hour

each. Te primary antibodies used in the study are LC3 (Novus, NB100-2220, Cell Signaling Technology, 
2775S), RAB7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, SC-6563). Commercially available Alexa dye conjugated sec-
ondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, A31556 and A11057) were used for immunostaining. Antibody 
dilutions were made in blocking solution as per the supplier’s protocol. Te coverslips were washed 
thoroughly with 1X PBS and were mounted onto glass slides with Antifade reagent (Invitrogen Molecular 
Probes). Images were acquired randomly from each set of stained cells with a Nikon EclipseTi-E laser 
scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 60X/1.4NA PlanApochromat DIC objective. Images were 
acquired using the sofwares EZ-C1 3.80 and NIS-Elements. Image analyses were performed using the 
sofware Imaris version 7.6.4 (BitPlane).
Image Capture and analysis. 
Stained cells were observed with a Nikon Ti-E microscope equipped 
with 60X /1.4 NA planapochromat DIC objective lens. Samples were excited at 543 nm with He-Neon 
laser, 488 nm with an Argon ion laser and in the UV range with a blue diode. Images were acquired 
sequentially to avoid bleed-through signal, with a scanning mode format of 512 ×  512 pixels. Te trans-
mission and detector gains were set to achieve best signal to noise ratios and the laser powers were tuned 
to limit bleaching of ﬂuorescence. Te refractive index of the immersion oil used was 1.515 (Nikon 
Corporation). All settings were rigorously maintained for all experiments. All images were qualita-
tively assessed using Imaris version 7.6.4 (BitPlane). All the images are in the Tiﬀ RGB 24 format. M1 
co-localization coeﬃcient of Mtb and various markers were calculated in the sofware. Te percentage 
of Mtb in autolysosomes and amphisomes were estimated by calculating the percentage of Mtb voxels in 
LC3:Lysotracker and LC3:RAB7 colocalized channels. Te results represent an average of at least three 
independent sets of experiments.
Statistical analyses. 
Statistical analyses were performed using Student’s t-tests (two-tailed) with ‘*’ 
and ‘**’ representing signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the tested group at 95% (p <  0.05) and 99% (p <  0.01) 
level of conﬁdence.
