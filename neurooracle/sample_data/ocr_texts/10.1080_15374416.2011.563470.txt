Abstract
This study investigated how parenting accounted for inter-individual differences in developmental
trajectories of different child behaviors across childhood and adolescence. In a cohort sequential
community sample of 1,049 children, latent class growth analysis was applied to three parent-
reported dimensions (monitoring, positive parenting, inconsistent discipline) across 12 annual
assessments (ages 6–18). Four longitudinal parenting styles (authoritative, authoritarian, indulgent,
uninvolved) were differentiated on the basis of levels and rates of change in the constituent
parenting dimensions. Multi-group analyses demonstrated that these parenting styles were
differentially related to changes in parent- and child-reported measures of children’s alcohol and
cigarette use, antisocial behavior, and internalizing symptoms, with the authoritative parenting
class being related to the most optimal long-term development. Practical implications and future
research suggestions are discussed.

A vast literature demonstrates that authoritative parenting – a parenting style combining
high levels of support and behavioral regulation (Baumrind, 1967; Lamborn, Mounts,
Steinberg, & Dornbusch, 1991) – is related to more optimal psychosocial child outcomes
than non-authoritative parenting styles (Steinberg, 2001). However, it is unclear (a) how

changes in parenting dimensions such as support and regulation combine into parenting
styles across time, and (b) how long-term trajectories of children’s internalizing symptoms
and externalizing behaviors are related to such parenting styles. This long term prospective
community study addressed these research questions and, hence, tried to remedy the
relatively static approach to parenting styles prevailing in the literature (Holden & Miller,
1999). Applying such an explicitly developmental approach to the study of parenting and its
correlates can inform prevention and intervention efforts by elucidating to what extent these
variables develop in tandem.
The two most commonly studied parenting dimensions are support (or responsiveness/
positive parenting) and behavioral regulation (Steinberg, 2001). Support refers to the
empathic and responsive recognition of the child’s perspective (Davidov & Grusec, 2006).
Regulation involves (a) supervising and monitoring children’s behavior within reasonably
set boundaries (Dishion & McMahon, 1998), and (b) creating an organized and predictable
environment for children by being consistent in disciplining and communicating
expectations (Holden & Miller, 1999). Four parenting styles are typically distinguished on
the basis of these dimensions (Lamborn et al., 1991; Maccoby & Martin, 1983):
authoritative parenting (high regulation and support), authoritarian parenting (high
regulation, low support), indulgent parenting (low regulation, high support), and uninvolved
parenting (low regulation and support).
Although longitudinal research has focused on stability and change in support and regulation
(e.g., Loeber et al., 2000; McNally, Eisenberg, & Harris, 1991), no research to date
examined how stability and change in these dimensions might vary in different households.
For instance, while parental expressions of affection or support were generally found to
decrease with children’s age (Holden & Miller, 1999), it is unclear whether this decrease is a
function of parenting style (with, for instance, authoritative parents showing the least
decreases). Therefore, our first goal was to chart longitudinal parenting styles or trajectory
classes and to examine how the dimensions of support and regulation develop within each of
these classes.
Numerous cross-sectional studies have focused on psychosocial correlates of the four
parenting styles. Children from authoritative families are less prone to internalizing
symptoms and externalizing behaviors and are less likely to engage in drug use than children
from uninvolved families (Steinberg, 2001). Children from either authoritarian or indulgent
households typically fall somewhere in-between. Monitoring or supervision is commonly
found to be the strongest buffer against externalizing behaviors (Barber, Stolz, & Olsen,
2005). As such, children raised in authoritarian households generally report lower levels of
such behaviors compared to uninvolved (or indulgent) households. Support or
responsiveness is commonly found to buffer against internalizing symptoms (Barber et al.,
2005; Gray & Steinberg, 1999). As such, children raised in indulgent households have been
found to score lower on internalizing symptoms compared to children raised in authoritarian
(and uninvolved) households, although these findings are not consistent across studies
(Lamborn et al., 1991).
However, there is a dearth of prospective studies in community samples investigating – in
line with transactional socialization models (Magnusson, 1988) – to what extent parenting
and children’s behaviors develop in tandem using a wide temporal window. With increasing
age, children, and especially adolescents, are commonly reported to show increased rates of
internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors, although vast inter-individual
differences exist in developmental trajectories (Arnett, 1999). Our second goal was to
investigate whether parenting styles account for such inter-individual differences in long-

term developmental trajectories of internalizing symptoms and externalizing behaviors
(Hoeve et al., 2008).
The Present Study
First, in a large community sample with annual assessments from childhood through
adolescence, longitudinal parenting trajectory classes were identified using latent class
growth analysis (LCGA; Nagin, 2005), based on parent-reports of three dimensions, positive
parenting, monitoring/supervision, and inconsistent discipline (with the latter two
dimensions representing positive and negative indicators of parental regulation,
respectively). Four parenting classes were expected to emerge. The authoritative class would
score high on positive parenting and monitoring and low on inconsistent discipline; the
authoritarian class high on monitoring and low on positive parenting and inconsistent
discipline; the indulgent class high on positive parenting and inconsistent discipline and low
on monitoring; and, finally, the uninvolved class high on inconsistent discipline and low on
positive parenting and monitoring. We did not have a priori expectations about the shape of
developmental changes of the parenting dimensions within these classes, due to a lack of
previous research and theory. For instance, in general, monitoring would show a quadratic
trend across time, that is, rather stable levels in childhood followed by decreases in
adolescence (Loeber et al., 2000), being a time in which youngsters establish an identity and
separate themselves from their parents (Arnett, 1999). These changes, however, might
depend on parenting style, with uninvolved and indulgent parents possibly showing the
steepest decreases.
Second, we investigated how children’s internalizing symptoms and antisocial behavior
(parent-reported) and alcohol and cigarette use (child-reported) developed across time
depending on these parenting classes. We expected children in the authoritative class to have
the lowest levels of internalizing symptoms across time, followed by children in the
indulgent and authoritarian classes. Children belonging to the uninvolved class would score
highest on internalizing symptoms, accompanied by possibly the steepest increases across
time. With respect to substance use and antisocial behavior, all four classes would have
similar and low initial levels in childhood. Children belonging to the indulgent and
uninvolved classes (both characterized by low monitoring) could show the steepest increases
across time in these behaviors. Again, precise hypotheses regarding differential
developmental changes depending on parenting style were difficult to postulate due to a lack
of previous long-term research in community samples.
Methods
Design and Participants
Five grade cohorts (Grade 1–5 at T1) of children and their parents were assessed annually
over 8 years (T1-T8), until they were in Grade 8–12, in the cohort sequential Oregon Youth
Substance Use Project (OYSUP; Andrews, Tildesley, Hops, Duncan, & Severson, 2003).
This design serves as a proxy for a true longitudinal design – where a single cohort is
assessed from Grades 1–12. The OYSUP initially recruited 1,075 children from 15
elementary schools within one school district in Western Oregon. Using stratified random
sampling (by school, grade, and gender), the study recruited parents of 2,127 students; 1,075
(50.7%) consented to participate. Participating children were representative of students in
the school district in terms of race/ethnicity and eligibility for free or reduced lunch, and of
youth in the state of Oregon in terms of substance use and school achievement test scores.
Schools were located in a predominantly working class community; 40% of the sample was
eligible for a free or reduced lunch. An average of 215 students in each of 1st through 5th
grade participated at T1 (50.3% female). Mean age at T1 was 9.0 years (SD = 1.45) across

cohorts. The sample was 86% Caucasian, 7% Hispanic, 1% Afro-American, and 6% of other
or mixed race/ethnicity. Approximately 7% of mothers and 11% of fathers had not obtained
a high school diploma, and 71% and 66%, respectively, had received post-high school
education. All procedures, assents/consents, and instruments were approved by Oregon
Research Institute's IRB annually. Parents provided a signed consent allowing their child to
participate in the first four assessments prior to the child’s first in-school assessment, as well
as consenting to their own participation. We requested that children agree to a verbal assent
for Grades 1–3 or sign a written assent for Grades 4–5. All procedures, consents/assents, and
questionnaires/interviews were translated into Spanish and available for those who needed
it. We obtained renewed consents for following assessments.
Our sample consisted of 1,049 children (50.1% girls) who participated in any of the eight
annual assessments and had at least one parent participating. Children received an age-
adjusted gift and parents received a monetary reward for participating. Most families
completed seven or eight assessments (80.3%), 8.5% five or six assessments, 7.8% three or
four assessments, and 3.4% one or two assessments. Our sample included 731 families
(69.7%) with the same mother and father participating across assessments (95% were
married or living together), 251 families (23.9%) with mother only participating (64.9%
were not living with the child’s father), and 25 families (2.3%) with father only participating
(80% were not living with the child’s mother).
One-way analyses of variance with post hoc Scheffé comparisons revealed no cohort effects
for positive parenting, inconsistent discipline, alcohol use, or cigarette use. For monitoring,
we found limited cohort differences at 4th grade, F(3,727) = 3.11, with Cohort 2 parents
reporting more monitoring than Cohort 4 parents, Cohen’s d = .30, and at 7th grade,
F(3,736) = 4.31, p < .01, and 9th grade, F(3,720) = 2.69, p < .05, with Cohort 1 parents
reporting more monitoring at 7th grade, Cohen’s d = .37 and 9th grade, Cohen’s d = .32, than
Cohort 4 parents. At 8th grade, F(3,730) = 4.54, p < .01, Cohort 1 parents reported more
monitoring than Cohort 3 parents, Cohen’s d = .38. We found only one cohort effect for
children’s internalizing symptoms at 3rd grade, F(2,528) = 3.69, p < .05, with parents of
Cohort 2 children reporting less internalizing symptoms than parents of Cohort 3 children,
Cohen’s d = −.28. Finally, we found limited cohort differences for children’s deviant
behavior at 3rd grade, F(2,530) = 3.83, p < .05, with Cohort 2 parents at 3rd grade reporting
lower deviant behavior than Cohort 3 parents, Cohen’s d =−.29, and Cohort 4 parents,
Cohen’s d = −.16. In sum, because of limited cohort differences, participants were collapsed
across cohorts (Andrews et al., 2003). LCGA was performed with Mplus 5.2 and the
Expectation Maximization algorithm for missing data (Muthén & Muthén, 1998/2008).
Measures
Parenting dimensions—Parents completed three subscales from the Alabama Parenting
Questionnaire (Shelton, Frick, & Wootton, 1996) to assess monitoring/supervision (e.g.,
“don’t check that child is home on time”, “child goes out with friends you do not know”,
“child goes out without a set time to be home” (all reversed); 9 items), inconsistent
discipline (e.g., “threatens to punish, and then doesn’t”, “child talks you out of being
punished after doing something wrong”, “let child out of punishment early”; 6 items), and
positive parenting (e.g., “compliments child”, “praise child if s/he behaves well”, “hug and
kiss child”; 6 items) on a 5-point scale, ranging from 0 = “Never,” to 4 = “Always.” We used
the average of mother and father scores in two-parent families (averaged rs across Grades 1–
12 = .52 for monitoring, .37 for inconsistent discipline, and .35 for positive parenting; ps < .
001) and a single score in single-parent families (Tildesley & Andrews, 2008). With respect
to correlations among the three dimensions, averaged rs across Grades 1–12 were .21
(ranging from r = .10, p < .01 to r = .28, p < .001), −.43 (from r = −.29 to r = −.57, ps < .

001), and −.19 (from r = −.07, p < .05 to r = −.29, p < .001) for associations between
monitoring and positive parenting, monitoring and inconsistent discipline, and inconsistent
discipline and positive parenting, respectively. Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .60 to .83 for
monitoring, from .67 to .78 for inconsistent discipline, and from .78 to .81 for positive
parenting.
Alcohol and cigarette use—Using single items, children indicated their level of use of
cigarettes and alcohol during the past 12 months, ranging from 0 = “Never,” to 5 = “Some
each day.” Such self-report data were used from Grades 6–12.
Antisocial behavior and internalizing symptoms—Parents completed an abbreviated
Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1991) to assess antisocial behavior and internalizing
symptoms. Antisocial behavior was measured using a 6-item subscale (e.g., “steals things”,
“lies or cheats”, “gets in trouble a lot”), internalizing symptoms by using a 9-item
withdrawn subscale (e.g., “shy or timid”, “likes to be alone”, “withdrawn”) on a 3-point
response format from 0=”Not true,” to 2=”Very or often true”. We used the mean of mother
and father scores in two-parent families (average rs across Grades 1–12 = .66 for antisocial
behavior, and .52 for internalizing symptoms; ps < .001) and a single score in single-parent
families. Cronbach’s alphas ranged from .69 to .81 for antisocial behavior and from .75 to .
83 for internalizing symptoms.
Results
LCGA was performed on all three parenting dimensions conjointly. Intercepts and slopes
were modelled using 12 indicators (assessments). Factor loadings of the intercept on all
indicators were set to 1, loadings of the linear slope were set to 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., and loadings
of the quadratic slope were set to equal the square of the linear loadings (0, 1, 4, 9, etc.).
Several criteria were used to decide on the number of classes. The Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) for a solution with k classes should be lower than for a solution with k-1
classes. Classification accuracy was assessed by entropy (E), ranging from 0.00 to 1.00, with
higher values indicating more accurate classification. The bootstrap Lo-Mendell-Rubin Test
(BLRT; Nylund, Asparouhov, & Muthén, 2007) provides a p-value to indicate if there is a
statistically significant improvement in fit through including an additional class. Finally, we
evaluated the practical usefulness of the classes. As expected, LCGA favoured a 4-class
solution (BIC = 22947.52; E = .86) over a 2-class (BIC = 25201.61; E = .89) and 3-class
solution (BIC = 23871.56; E = .87), with BLRT accompanying the 4-class solution
significant at p < .001. In the 5-class solution (BIC = 22124.75; E = .87), some classes were
variations on a single theme, hence our choice for the more parsimonious 4-class solution.
Table 1 presents intercepts and slopes for this solution.
Class 1 (N = 197) was labelled indulgent parenting, characterized by moderate monitoring
during childhood (with steep decreases during adolescence), high positive parenting (with
decreases across time), and high inconsistent discipline (with increases across time). Class 2
(N = 175) was labelled uninvolved parenting, characterized by low monitoring (with
decreases across time), low positive parenting (with decreases across time), and high stable
inconsistent discipline. Class 3 (N = 304) was labelled authoritarian parenting, characterized
by high monitoring (with decreases during adolescence), low positive parenting (with
decreases across time), and low stable inconsistent discipline. Class 4 (N = 375) was labelled
authoritative parenting, characterized by high monitoring (with increases in childhood and
decreases in adolescence), high positive parenting (with slight decreases across time), and
low stable inconsistent discipline. Boys and girls were evenly distributed among these
classes (χ2(3) = 6.83, ns). Figure 1 gives an overview of the model-estimated mean values

for these four classes. Panel A displays monitoring scores, Panel B positive parenting scores,
and Panel C inconsistent discipline scores.
Next, multigroup latent growth curve modeling was conducted to investigate whether
children of these classes developed differently (Duncan, Duncan, Strycker, Li, & Alpert,
1999). All models included a significant quadratic slope, except for alcohol use and
antisocial behavior. First, a fully unconstrained baseline model was estimated with all
growth parameters being freely estimated in all four classes. Second, intercepts were held
equal among all classes, followed by a model in which slopes were held equal. Third, if
these constrained models provided a worse fit to the data than the baseline model (indicating
that the respective growth parameters could not be considered as equal in all four classes),
subsequent multigroup models were estimated in which intercepts and slopes were set free
again in certain classes. Table 2 gives an overview of all final parameter estimates. Figure 2
presents final multigroup models for alcohol use (Panel A), cigarette use (Panel B),
antisocial behavior (Panel C), and internalizing symptoms (Panel D). For alcohol use and
internalizing symptoms, ancillary multigroup analyses demonstrated that intercepts and
slopes could be fixed as equal between boys and girls in all four classes meaning that no
substantial gender differences emerged for these two variables.
For alcohol use, the multigroup model demonstrated that the intercept (with a value of 0.174
in Table 2) could be held equal in all four classes (χ2(85) = 195.47; RMSEA = .07; CFI = .
95) because this was not accompanied by a decrease in fit (Δχ2(3) = 2.43, p = .49) as
compared to the less parsimonious baseline model (χ2(82) = 193.04; RMSEA = .07; CFI = .
95). Next, the linear slope could not be held equal in all classes (χ2(85) = 230.50; RMSEA
= .08; CFI = .93) as this resulted in a significant decrease in fit (Δχ2(3) = 37,46, p < .001)
compared to the baseline model, but the linear slope could be held equal in the authoritarian
and authoritative classes (0.212) on the one hand and the indulgent and uninvolved classes
(0.317) on the other (χ2(87) = 197.61; RMSEA = .07; CFI = .95). Consequently, the final
multigroup model provided an equally good fit (Δχ2(5) = 4.57, p = .47) as the baseline
model. Initially, all children scored equally low on alcohol use and increased their alcohol
use between Grades 6–12, with children of the indulgent and uninvolved classes
demonstrating the steepest increases across time.
For cigarette use, a multigroup model with intercepts held equal in all classes (χ2(75) =
310.44; RMSEA = .11; CFI = .90) provided a worse fit to the data (Δχ2(3) = 8.88, p < .05)
than the baseline model (χ2(72) = 301.56; RMSEA = .11; CFI = .91); when subsequently
freeing the intercept for the authoritative class (0.016 as opposed to 0.073 for the other
classes), the model (χ2(74) = 301.88; RMSEA = .11; CFI = .91) had an equally good fit
(Δχ2(2) = 0.32, p = .85) as the less parsimonious baseline model. Next, a model in which the
linear slope was held equal in all classes (0.017) except for the uninvolved class (0.093), and
the quadratic slope held equal in the authoritarian and authoritative classes (0.026) on the
one hand and the indulgent and uninvolved classes (0.046) on the other (χ2(78) = 303.14;
RMSEA = .10; CFI = .91) provided a similar fit (Δχ2(6) = 1.58, p = .95) as the baseline
model and, hence, was preferred on the basis of parsimony. Initially, all children scored low
on cigarette use and children of the indulgent and especially the uninvolved class showed
the steepest increases between Grades 6–12. Ancillary analyses demonstrated that boys and
girls developed differently within the uninvolved class: the intercept could be fixed as equal
(Δχ2(1) = 0.17, p = .68), whereas the linear (boys: 0.041, ns; girls: 0.310, p < .001) and
quadratic slopes (boys: 0.055, p < .001; girls: 0.005, ns) could not (Δχ2(1) = 16.31, p < .001;
and Δχ2(1) = 4.35, p < .05, respectively). Whereas girls of uninvolved parents increased
linearly across time in smoking, boys of uninvolved parents tended to smoke less at Grades
7–10 but caught up with girls at Grade 11 and tended to smoke more at Grade 12.

For antisocial behavior, multigroup modeling indicated that none of the intercepts could be
fixed as equal because any constraint on the intercept level was accompanied by a decrease
in fit as compared to the baseline model. Hence, the intercept needed to be freely estimated
in all classes as indicated in Table 2. Next, the linear slope could be held equal in the
authoritarian and authoritative classes (0.041) on the one hand and the indulgent and
uninvolved classes (0.097) on the other (χ2(251) = 610.36; RMSEA = .07; CFI = .90) which
provided an equally good fit (Δχ2(2) = 0.48, p = .79) as the baseline model (χ2(249) =
610.088; RMSEA = .07; CFI = .90). Initially, children of the authoritative class scored
lowest on antisocial behavior, followed by the authoritarian, indulgent, and uninvolved
classes, respectively. Children in the indulgent and uninvolved classes demonstrated the
steepest increases across time. Boys and girls developed differently in the uninvolved and
authoritarian classes. In the uninvolved class, the intercept could be fixed as equal (Δχ2(1) =
3.03, p = .08), whereas the linear slope (boys: 0.157, p < .001; girls: 0.088, p < .001) could
not (Δχ2(1) = 3.92, p < .05), indicating that both started off at the same level but boys
increased much steeper. In the authoritarian class, the intercept (boys: 1.220, p < .001; girls:
0.591, p < .001) and linear slope (boys: 0.017, ns; girls: 0.063, p < .001) could not be fixed
as equal (Δχ2(1) = 16.31, p < .001; and Δχ2(1) = 4.35, p < .05, respectively), indicating that
boys started off at a higher level but girls increased somewhat more steeply across time.
For internalizing symptoms, a multigroup model with intercepts held equal in all classes
(χ2(251) = 527.88; RMSEA = .07; CFI = .93) provided a worse fit to the data (Δχ2(3) =
10.89, p < .05) than the baseline model (χ2(248) = 516.99; RMSEA = .06; CFI = .93); when
subsequently freeing the intercept for the univnvolved class (2.615 as opposed to 1.754 for
the other three classes), the model (χ2(250) = 519.43; RMSEA = .06; CFI = .93) had an
equally good fit (Δχ2(2) = 2.44, p = .30) as the less parsimonious baseline model. The linear
slope could be held equal in all classes (0.191) but the quadratic slope could be held equal
only in the indulgent and uninvolved classes (0.000) and needed to be freely estimated in the
remaining two classes in terms of model fit. This final multigroup model (χ2(254) = 527.44;
RMSEA = .06; CFI = .93) provided an equally good fit (Δχ2(6) = 10.45, p = .11) as the
baseline model. Initially, children of the uninvolved class showed the highest levels of
internalizing symptoms. All classes showed increases during the first few years but, for the
authoritative class, these increases levelled off during childhood and were followed by
decreases through adolescence.
In sum, the four longitudinal parenting classes obtained functioned as important moderators
of child developmental trajectories through elementary and high school. Gender differences
were only found with respect to cigarette use and antisocial behavior within the parenting
classes.
Discussion
Four longitudinal parenting classes (labeled indulgent, uninvolved, authoritarian, and
authoritative, as inspired by Maccoby & Martin, 1983) were defined, displaying differential
stability and change in specific parenting dimensions. With respect to monitoring, the
authoritative class combined high levels with increases during childhood and slight
decreases across adolescence. These findings suggest that authoritative parents somewhat
relinquish their monitoring in response to adolescents’ increasing demands for independent
decision-making. The authoritarian class showed a similar pattern, but with steeper
decreases across adolescence. Possibly, authoritarian parents do not choose to monitor less
but simply have no other choice because their children increasingly spend more
unsupervised time outside the home. Future research may address this differential
hypothesis for authoritative versus authoritarian parents. Indulgent parents showed steep
decreases in monitoring once their children reached adolescence.

With respect to positive parenting, the authoritative class combined high initial levels with
small decreases. The other classes were mainly differentiated in terms of mean levels.
Apparently, most parents tend to develop similarly across time on positive parenting (albeit
on different levels, with authoritative and indulgent parents scoring substantially higher than
authoritarian and uninvolved parents). This developmental trend is possibly due to the
normative search for independence in adolescence, accompanied by increasing conflicts
(McNally et al., 1991; Smetana, Crean, & Campione-Barr, 2005), which limits opportunities
for parents to be increasingly responsive to their children. Finally, for inconsistent
discipline, we again found mean-level differences among the classes, with, as expected,
authoritative parents scoring the lowest. Inconsistent parenting appeared to change less
across time compared to parental support and monitoring (as demonstrated also in the mean-
level changes for the total sample), and may be more related to stable features in parents’
functioning, including parental personality (Holden & Miller, 1999). Indulgent parents were
the only ones to increase on inconsistent parenting across time, which (in combination with
their steep decreases in monitoring in adolescence) testifies to their suboptimal family
management skills, as is also evident for uninvolved parents. Such weak management skills
could lead to coercive interaction cycles (Reid & Patterson, 1989): children raised in such
families increasingly display externalizing behaviors (as demonstrated in the present study)
which might instigate these parents to react aversely and ineffectively, further increasing
children’s externalizing behaviors.
These parenting trajectory classes substantially moderated the developmental trajectories of
children’s psychosocial symptoms and behaviors, both with respect to level and
developmental shape. Children of authoritative parents fared better than their peers on every
behavior assessed. Some of the disadvantages of non-authoritative parenting accumulated
over time (Collins, Maccoby, Steinberg, Hetherington, & Bornstein, 2000; Steinberg, 2001).
With respect to alcohol and cigarette use, children of different households were cast into
different developmental pathways and this developmental gap widened as the children aged.
By Grade 12, children of uninvolved parents drank alcohol almost twice as much and
smoked twice as much as their peers in authoritative (and authoritarian) households.
Similarly, children of indulgent and uninvolved parents increased more steeply in antisocial
behavior. Boys of uninvolved parents seemed extremely vulnerable with respect to
developing antisocial behavior across time. Conversely, the higher scores on monitoring
characteristic of authoritative and authoritarian parenting appeared to protect against various
maladaptive behaviors in the long run. Whereas children of authoritarian and authoritative
parents tended to develop rather similarly with respect to these behaviors, their differential
development on internalizing symptoms pointed to the importance of distinguishing between
both styles. When using a wide temporal window, the advantages of being raised in an
authoritative household became clear. Or conversely, the disadvantages of being raised in an
authoritarian household showed up during adolescence, resulting in a less than optimal
developmental trajectory for internalizing symptoms.
Limitations and Future Directions
First, the OYSUP sample is almost exclusively White. Future research should sample
ethnically diverse populations, as the influence of parenting could vary depending on social
milieu (Darling & Steinberg, 1993). Second, the present study used the framework of
parenting styles in the vein of Maccoby and Martin (1983), as well as others who have
followed them. The parenting questionnaire used was not designed specifically for this
purpose (Shelton et al., 1996). However, the present findings demonstrated that it is
important to chart the developmental trajectories of different parenting dimensions
simultaneously. Third, in the present study, parents or children reported on separate outcome
measures instead of both informants reporting on the same outcomes. Further, although the

use of parent-reported data on parenting as some advantages over the use of observational
data (e.g., Shelton et al., 1996), the use of observations would be helpful in examining more
closely family interaction dynamics. Relatedly, the single-item quality of the child-reported
measurements constitutes a weakness of the present study.
Implications for Future Research, Policy, and Practice
Children of the authoritative parenting class were characterized by the most optimal long-
term development, whereas children of uninvolved parents were characterized by the least
optimal development. Children of indulgent and authoritarian parents were situated in-
between, with children of authoritarian parents faring somewhat better than those of
indulgent parents. As such, prevention and intervention programs could target children (and
especially boys when it comes to antisocial behavior) of uninvolved households as they
seem to be cast into suboptimal developmental pathways characterized by cumulative
changes across time. Previous research indeed demonstrated that family-centered
intervention efforts reduced children’s externalizing behaviors in high-risk families, exactly
through increases in family management skills such as monitoring (Dishion & Stormshak,
2007). Further, future research should investigate how parents and peers conjointly influence
the developing child (Collins et al., 2000). This would also allow for investigating possible
intervening mechanisms, as children raised in different households might differ in
susceptibility to, for instance, anti-social peer pressure which, in turn, may impact the
development of externalizing behaviors.

Note. Parameter estimates with the same superscripts within rows were held equal in the respective classes as these restrictions were not accompanied by a loss in fit and, hence, resulted in more
parsimonious models (as compared to the respective baseline models) in the multigroup testing. Parameters without superscripts were estimated freely as these could not be held equal due to a loss in model
fit in the multigroup testing.
