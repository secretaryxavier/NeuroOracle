A
cute ischemic stroke is the most common form of 
cerebrovascular disease and typically results from 
the sudden occlusion of a cerebral artery.1 Ischemic 
stroke remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
worldwide.2 Early treatment goals are centred around reper-
fusing the affected brain, which traditionally has been 
accomplished by intravenous administration of thrombolytic 
medications within 4.5  hours of stroke onset.3 More 
recently, endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has revolution-
ized the treatment of ischemic stroke. Multiple randomized 
controlled trials have shown that EVT together with intra-
venous thrombolytic therapy was superior to intravenous 
thrombolytic therapy alone in preventing death and disabil-
ity after ischemic stroke.4–10 It has since been considered 
standard of care at the comprehensive stroke centres (CSCs) 
in Alberta, Canada. Endovascular thrombectomy is best per-
formed within 6 hours of stroke onset, as it reperfuses the 
ischemic brain and prevents further progression of cell 
death.11,12 This treatment is resource intensive and is avail-
able only at CSCs. Several studies using the US National 
Inpatient Sample database showed an association between 
geographic markers of socioeconomic status and the odds of 
being treated with EVT.13–16 However, to our knowledge, 
this association has not been investigated in the context of 
Neighbourhood deprivation, distance to nearest 
comprehensive stroke centre and access to endovascular 
thrombectomy for ischemic stroke: a population-based study

Background: Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) has revolutionized ischemic stroke care. We aimed to assess whether neighbour-
hood socioeconomic status is predictive of access to EVT after receipt of alteplase for ischemic stroke among patients living in 
Alberta, Canada, and whether this relation is mediated by the distance a person lives to the nearest comprehensive stroke centre 
(CSC).
Methods: We performed a retrospective study including all people older than 18 years living in Alberta who were admitted to hospital 
with an ischemic stroke and who received intravenous alteplase treatment between Jan. 1, 2017, and Dec. 31, 2019. Data were 
obtained through administrative data sets. The primary outcome was treatment with EVT. We assigned neighbourhood deprivation 
quintile based on the Material and Social Deprivation Index. We used logistic regression modelling to assess for a relation between 
deprivation and treatment with EVT. We adjusted for age, sex, stroke severity and distance to the nearest CSC. We calculated the 
average causal mediation effect of distance to the nearest CSC on the relation between neighbourhood deprivation level and treat-
ment with EVT.
Results: The study cohort consisted of 1335 patients, of whom 181 (13.6%) had missing data and were excluded from the main 
regression analysis. Endovascular thrombectomy was performed or attempted in 314 patients (23.5%). In the primary model, patients 
from the most deprived neighbourhoods were less likely than those from less deprived neighbourhoods to have received EVT (adjusted 
odds ratio 0.43, 95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.77). Neighbourhood deprivation level was not significantly associated with EVT when 
distance to the nearest CSC was included as a covariate. Mediation analysis suggested that 48% of the total effect that neighbourhood 
deprivation level had on the odds of receiving EVT was attributable to the distance a person lived from the nearest CSC.
Interpretation: The results suggest that people from more deprived neighbourhoods in Alberta were less likely to be treated with 
EVT than those from less deprived neighbourhoods. Improving access to EVT for people living in remote locations may improve the 
equitable distribution of this treatment.

Canada’s health care system. Unlike the United States, Can-
ada has a publicly funded health care system that ensures 
Canadians access to medically necessary hospital and phys­
ician services without paying out of pocket, which eliminates 
a ﬁnancial barrier to accessing health care.
The objective of this work was to assess whether neigh-
bourhood socioeconomic status is predictive of access to EVT 
after receipt of alteplase for ischemic stroke among patients 
living in Alberta. A secondary aim was to assess whether any 
discrepancy in the odds of receiving EVT is mediated by the 
distance a person lives from the nearest CSC.
Methods
Setting
This study was performed in Alberta, which has a population 
of more than 4 million people.17 Endovascular thrombectomy 
is performed only at the 2 CSCs: the University of Alberta 
Hospital, in Edmonton, and Foothills Medical Centre, in Cal-
gary. The province has a single public health care provider, 
Alberta Health Services.
Data and population
We performed a retrospective analysis of the Quality 
Improvement & Clinical Research database, a prospective 
data set established in 2015 that is maintained by the Car-
diovascular and Stroke Strategic Clinical Network at 
Alberta Health Services.18 The database includes informa-
tion for all patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis 
or endovascular thrombectomy, or both, for ischemic stroke 
in Alberta. We included all people older than 18 years liv-
ing in Alberta who were admitted to hospital with an isch-
emic stroke and who received intravenous alteplase treat-
ment between Jan. 1, 2017, and Dec. 31, 2019. Patients’ 
clinical and demographic characteristics were extracted 
from the Quality Improvement & Clinical Research data-
base and Alberta Health Services Data and Analytics (for-
merly Data Integration, Measurement and Reporting) 
administrative databases.19 Case linkage was done through 
medical record numbers, which were consistent across both 
data sets. Database extraction and linkage were performed 
by one of the authors (D.B.-I.). Postal codes were obtained 
from the Data and Analytics database.
Independent variable of interest
In Canada, the most widely used measure of neighbourhood 
socioeconomic status is the Material and Social Deprivation 
Index, an area-based metric for assessing material and social 
deprivation.20,21 Scores are based on the smallest geographic 
unit collected in the Canadian census, the dissemination 
area.22 Although the Material and Social Deprivation Index 
was initially created for the province of Quebec alone, it has 
since been expanded to cover the whole of Canada and has 
been shown to have an association with death after stroke.23,24
We linked patient home address postal codes to the federal 
census dissemination areas in Alberta.25 We assigned a 
Material and Social Deprivation Index score to each dissemi-
nation area using an established deprivation index (Pampalon 
index)26 that has been validated for use across Canada.27 For 
both material and social deprivation, scores are grouped into 
quintiles ranging from 1 (least deprived) to 5 (most deprived). 
We combined material and social deprivation quintiles based 
on the method suggested by Gamache and colleagues26 to 
create an overall measure of socioeconomic deprivation for 
use in the statistical analyses (Figure 1).
Outcome of interest
The primary outcome of interest was the odds of being 
treated with EVT after receiving intravenous alteplase treat-
ment for ischemic stroke. All patients in whom EVT was 
attempted were deemed to have been treated with EVT, 
regardless of whether the vessel was opened successfully with 
the intervention.
The total effect of neighbourhood socioeconomic status on 
the odds of receiving EVT can be divided into a direct effect 
(the effect of neighbourhood socioeconomic status on our 
outcome of interest) and an indirect effect (the proportion of 
the direct effect attributable to a third variable, in this case, 
distance to the nearest CSC). The indirect effect is termed the 
average causal mediation effect. We analyzed whether the 
relation between treatment with EVT and neighbourhood 
socioeconomic status was mediated by the distance a person 
lives from a CSC according to the steps outlined by Baron 
and Kenny.28 To isolate the mediated effect of distance on this 
relation, we included an abbreviated model in our mediation 
analysis with distance to the nearest CSC as the only covari-
ate. The mediation model investigated the discrepancy in the 
odds of receiving EVT between the most and least deprived 
neighbourhoods in Alberta.
We examined the home address postal code for all patients 
in the data set to ensure they were residents of Alberta. We 
calculated the distance, in kilometres, from the centre of each 
postal code to the nearest CSC in Alberta (University of 
Alberta Hospital or Foothills Medical Centre) using ArcGIS 
Pro (Esri) for geocoding and the NAD83 / UTM zone 11 map 
projection (Esri). We examined the relation between distance 
to the nearest CSC and neighbourhood deprivation using the 
Kruskal–Wallis test.
Statistical analysis
We used descriptive statistics to examine the baseline charac-
teristics of the study cohort. We assessed continuous variables 
for an association with the outcome of interest using the 
Student t  test and categoric variables using the Pearson 
χ2 test. To assess the relation between our independent vari-
ables of interest and our primary outcome, we performed a 
χ2 test and ﬁt 3 multiple logistic regression models. All covari-
ates for the model were selected a priori based on clinical 
relevance. In the ﬁrst model, we included age, sex and pre-
alteplase National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score as 
covariates. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 
score is a numerical marker of stroke severity, with higher 
numbers indicating a more severe stroke.29 In a secondary 
model, we included distance to the nearest CSC as a covariate.

We also included age and distance to the nearest CSC as 
potential effect modiﬁers using interaction terms and tested 
them for signiﬁcant effect modiﬁcation using the Wald test. 
Last, we performed a formal mediation analysis using the 
mediate function of the R package mediation (R Foundation 
for Statistical Computing).30 We calculated the average causal 
mediation effect of distance to the nearest CSC on the odds of 
being treated with EVT between people from the most 
deprived and least deprived neighbourhoods in Alberta. The 
mediation analysis was based on our logistic regression 
models. The mediation package requires prespeciﬁed investi-
gational and control groups. Because people from the most 
deprived neighbourhoods had the lowest proportion of 
patients treated with EVT, they were considered the investi-
gational group. Those from the least deprived neighbour-
hoods were designated the control group. We used a boot-
strapping method with 500 simulations. We performed all 
modelling using a complete case analysis; however, to ensure 
there was no selection bias in treatment with EVT for people 
for whom deprivation quintile was missing, we performed a 
sensitivity analysis that included people with missing data as a 
separate group.
Statistical signiﬁcance was set at p = 0.05. We performed 
all statistical analyses using R (R Foundation for Statistical 
Computing).
Ethics approval
This study received ethics approval from the University of 
Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board.
Results
A total of 1400 people experienced an ischemic stroke and 
received intravenous alteplase treatment in Alberta between 
Jan. 1, 2017, and Dec. 31, 2019. Of the 1400, 65 were not 
resi­dents of Alberta and were excluded from the analysis, leav-
ing 1335 patients, of whom 181 (13.6%) had missing data and 
were excluded from the main regression analysis. Endovascu-
lar thrombectomy was attempted in 314 (23.5%) of the 
1335 patients; the proportions for quintiles 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 
were 26.8%, 24.7%, 26.3%, 25.0% and 16.2%, respectively. 
The baseline and clinical characteristics of the study cohort 
are presented in Table 1.
Distance to nearest comprehensive stroke centre 
and deprivation level
The median distance to the nearest CSC was signiﬁcantly 
greater for patients from the most deprived neighbourhoods 
than for those from the least deprived neighbourhoods 
(74.1 km [interquartile range 166.0 km] v. 17.4 km [interquar-
tile range 23.4 km]) (p = 0.002) (Figure 2).
Endovascular thrombectomy and deprivation level
Bivariate logistic regression showed a statistically signiﬁcant 
relation between being in the most deprived quintile and 
being treated with EVT (p = 0.04) (Table 2). The unadjusted 
odds ratio (OR) for patients from the most deprived com-
pared to the least deprived areas was 0.53 (95% conﬁdence 
interval [CI] 0.32 to 0.87). We did not observe any evidence

of significant effect modification (p > 0.05). As such, the 
regression models did not contain any interaction terms. In 
the primary logistic regression model, patients from the most 
deprived neighbourhoods were signiﬁcantly less likely to be 
treated with EVT than those from the least deprived neigh-
bourhoods (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.77) (Table 2). The 
predicted proportion of patients who would receive EVT 
decreased with increasing distance to the nearest CSC, 
regardless of neighbourhood deprivation quintile (Figure 3). 
In the secondary model, neighbourhood deprivation quintile 
was not signiﬁcantly associated with the odds of receiving 
EVT, although there was a significant inverse relation 
between the distance to the nearest CSC and the odds of 
receiving EVT (Table 2).
Mediation analysis
The average causal mediation effect of distance to the nearest 
CSC on the odds of being treated with EVT, between 
patients from the most deprived neighbourhoods and those 
from the least deprived neighbourhoods, was –0.06 (95% CI 
–0.08 to –0.03). This represents 48% of the effect living in the 
most deprived neighbourhood compared to the least deprived 
neighbourhood had on being treated with EVT (total effect = 
–0.11, 95% CI –0.20 to –0.03).
Sensitivity analysis
There was no signiﬁcant relation between missing deprivation 
quintile and the odds of receiving EVT (OR 0.79, 95% CI 
0.47 to 1.33).
Interpretation
The results of our unadjusted analysis suggest that people 
who live in the most socioeconomically deprived areas of 
Alberta may be less likely to be treated with EVT after receiv-
ing alteplase for ischemic stroke than people who live in the 
least deprived areas of the province. However, our secondary 
model and mediation analysis showed that the distance a per-
son lived from the nearest CSC accounted for much of this 
discrepancy. These ﬁndings suggest that health care providers 
are not systematically excluding patients from the most 
deprived neighbourhoods from this novel treatment, which is 
encouraging. Nonetheless, disparities may persist. The most 
deprived neighbourhoods tend to be farther away from CSCs 
than areas with lower deprivation levels. As such, it may take 
longer for patients from the most deprived parts of Alberta to 
get to an EVT-capable centre, thereby decreasing the odds 
they will be treated with EVT after an ischemic stroke. Ulti-
mately, these ﬁndings highlight the challenges of ensuring 
equitable distribution of time-sensitive interventions to geo-
graphically isolated populations.
Before the advent of EVT, the best way of reperfusing 
ischemic brain during a stroke was thrombolysis with intra­
venously administered alteplase.3,31 This remained the stan-
dard of care until 2015, when several clinical trials that 
showed EVT in addition to alteplase was superior to alteplase 
alone for treatment of ischemic stroke due to large-vessel 
occlusion in the anterior circulation.4–8 However, there are 
limited data on whether the benefits from this treatment 
advance have been equitably distributed along socioeconomic 
lines. Two US papers published in 2014, one looking at 2006–
2010 and the other looking at only 2008, used data from the

National Inpatient Sample database to assess the relation 
between socio­economic status and treatment with EVT.13,14 
Both studies showed a statistically signiﬁcant difference in the 
odds of being treated with EVT for patients living in areas 
with the lowest median income; however, both papers used 
data collected before EVT was considered the standard of 
care. More recently, de Havenon and colleagues15 and Mehta 
and colleagues16 also used the National Inpatient Sample 
database to investigate the relation between socioeconomic 
status and treatment with EVT; both teams found that 
patients with low socioeconomic status were less likely to be 
treated with EVT than patients with higher socioeconomic 
status. Neither group restricted their cohort to patients who 
received alteplase for their ischemic stroke. Although 
de Havenon and colleagues15 controlled for whether patients 
lived in an urban or rural area, neither group controlled for 
the distance a person lived to the nearest CSC.
To our knowledge, no study has investigated the relation 
between neighbourhood socioeconomic status and receipt of 
EVT after alteplase administration for ischemic stroke in Can-
ada. We included only patients who were treated with 
alteplase, which was the previous standard of care. Nonethe-
less, our results are notable for suggesting that some of the dis-
parity in access to acute stroke intervention between the most 
and least deprived areas in Alberta is explained by the fact that 
socioeconomically deprived people tend to live farther from 
CSCs than people who are less deprived.
The results of our mediation analysis suggest that the dis-
crepancy in access to EVT based on neighbourhood depri-
vation level is mediated by the distance a person lives to the 
nearest CSC. Although provinces in Canada are responsible 
for providing health care to all residents, the reality is more 
complicated. In a recent review of Canada’s health care 
system, Marchildon and colleagues32 argued that, despite 
publicly funded health care, people living in rural and 
remote areas have less access to hospitals and other centres 
where they can access health care than those from urban and 
suburban areas. There is also a lower density of health care 
providers in rural and remote areas. This is of particular rel-
evance for time-sensitive interventions such as EVT for 
ischemic stroke.11,12 A recent US study suggested that people 
living in rural areas are less likely than those from urban 
areas to be brought to an EVT-capable centre after an 
ischemic stroke, and this signiﬁcantly decreases the odds that 
they will receive treatment with EVT, regardless of the facil-
ity’s transfer capability.33 It is not surprising that people who 
live far from CSCs in Alberta are also less likely to receive

EVT than people who live closer to such centres, given that 
EVT is a time-sensitive intervention. We found that patients 
from the most deprived neighbourhoods were signiﬁcantly 
more likely to live farther from the nearest CSC than 
patients from less deprived areas. As such, it appears that the 
relation between access to EVT and living in more deprived 
areas is mediated by the distance to EVT-capable centres. 
This problem is not easy for Canadian policy-makers — who 
are tasked with providing quality health care to a geographi-
cally dispersed population — to solve. However, our ﬁnd-
ings suggest that improving access to EVT for people in 
more remote locations would have the additional beneﬁt of 
ensuring more equitable access to this treatment for those 
living in more deprived areas. Other investigators have 
sought to expand the treatment window for EVT based on 
certain imaging characteristics,9,10 which may improve equity 
in access to this treatment.
Health care practitioners in remote areas may seek avenues 
of expediting transfer of potential EVT recipients. Remote 
robotic EVT is an evolving technology that may offer a means 
of treating patients from rural areas with EVT before trans-
port, thereby mitigating the effect of distance to a CSC on the 
likelihood of receiving EVT.34
Future work should attempt to replicate our ﬁndings with-
out limiting the study cohort to people treated with alteplase. 
Furthermore, researchers should investigate whether people 
from areas with low socioeconomic status experience worse 
outcomes and have longer times to treatment than those from 
areas with high socioeconomic status. We did not assess the 
cost-effectiveness of changes that might result in more equit­
able distribution of EVT based on neighbourhood socio­
economic deprivation and the distance people live from the 
nearest CSC. As such, future researchers may wish to perform 
a distributional cost-effectiveness analysis that accounts for 
improved equity and the ﬁnite resources of Alberta’s health 
care system.
Limitations
Our cohort was restricted to patients who received alteplase as 
treatment for their ischemic stroke, which excluded any per-
son who presented outside the window for intravenous 
thrombolysis. This may have systematically excluded people 
of low socioeconomic status if they were more likely to pres-
ent outside the treatment window for alteplase. However, this 
allowed us to compare for whether any pre-existing disparities 
in access to acute stroke care were widened by the advent of 
EVT. Second, our independent variable of interest was 
neighbourhood-level socioeconomic status, which may not be 
reﬂective of a person’s socioeconomic status. Although neigh-
bourhood socioeconomic status is associated with health out-
comes, it raises the possibility of the ecological fallacy.35,36 
Furthermore, we included distance from a patient’s postal 
code to the nearest CSC in our logistic regression model. 
Given that not all strokes occur at home, this may have intro-
duced a source of error into our analysis. Nonetheless, we felt 
that these were appropriate decisions given the limitations of 
administrative data, as no more detailed data were readily 
available. Last, our data set did not contain a variable for eth-
nicity, which may play a confounding role in the relation 
between neighbourhood socioeconomic status and treatment 
decisions.37 However, previous work using the Pampalon 
index has shown the index to be predictive of adverse health 
outcomes even after race is accounted for.38
Conclusion
We found a signiﬁcant difference in the odds of receiving EVT 
in Alberta after intravenous alteplase treatment for an ischemic 
stroke based on neighbourhood socioeconomic status. Patients 
in neighbourhoods with the lowest socioeconomic status 
tended to live farther from the nearest CSC than patients from 
less deprived neighbourhoods. Our results suggest that a key 
avenue for improving the equitable distribution of EVT is to 
improve access for people who live outside large urban centres. 
Health care organizations may look to expand access to EVT 
where adequate numbers of procedures can be assured to 
maintain quality. Although this would require some resource 
mobilization, it would increase the equality of access to this 
disability-saving and, in some cases, life-saving procedure.
