is required for Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis growth in macrophages

Protein phosphorylation plays a key role in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) physiology and 
pathogenesis. We have previously shown that a secreted protein tyrosine phosphatase, PtpA, is 
essential for Mtb inhibition of host macrophage acidiƤcation and maturation, and is a substrate of 
the protein tyrosine kinase, PtkA, encoded in the same operon. In this study, we constructed a ∆ptkA 
deletion mutant in Mtb and found that the mutant exhibited impaired intracellular survival in the THP-1 
macrophage infection model, correlated with the strain’s inability to inhibit macrophage phagosome 
acidiƤcation. By contrast, the mutant displayed increased resistance to oxidative stress in vitro. 
Proteomic and transcriptional analyses revealed upregulation of ptpA, and increased secretion of TrxB2, 
in the ΔptkA mutant. Kinase and protein-protein interaction studies demonstrated that TrxB2 is a 
substrate of PtkA phosphorylation. Taken together these studies establish a central role for the ptkA-
ptpA operon in Mtb pathogenesis.
Te etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains one of the most devastat-
ing infectious agents in the world. One-third of the world’s population is exposed to Mtb, resulting in nearly two 
million deaths annually1. Te emergence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains and co-infection with HIV 
has exacerbated the global burden of TB2. Terefore, there is an urgent need for the development of novel thera-
peutics against the deadly disease.
Mtb primarily infects alveolar macrophages, the ﬁrst line of defense against microbial invasion in the lung. 
Macrophages engulf the bacteria into phagosomes which acidify and mature by remodeling the membrane and 
luminal contents3. Antimicrobial molecules such as acidic hydrolases are delivered to the compartment, and 
interaction with the endosomal network ultimately leads to phagosome-lysosome fusion and elimination of the 
foreign particle4. However, Mtb blocks phagosome maturation and prevents the phagosome from acquiring anti-
microbial properties, enabling its survival within the hostile environment of the macrophage5–8.
Mtb utilizes multiple mechanisms to protect itself from the host antimicrobial assault. Te Mtb cell wall gly-
colipid ManLAM co-operates with the secreted acid phosphatase SapM to block phagosome fusion with late 
endosomes. Both prevent phagosomal accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P), which mediates 
the recruitment of membrane traﬃcking proteins such as the early endosomal antigen, EEA19,10. Mtb is resistant 
to host-generated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species; ROS and RNS are adsorbed in its thick cell wall and 
inactivated by detoxiﬁcation enzymes or antioxidants, such as catalase (KatG)11, peroxidase and the peroxynitrite 
reductase complex (AhpC, AhpD, DlaT and Lpd)12, the thioredoxin system13, and mycothiol14.
Mtb has evolved systems to sense the stages of engulfment within macrophages and activate bacterial 
systems to block host defense pathways15–17. Mtb possesses a wide repertoire of signal transduction sys-
tems, including eleven “two-component” systems, eleven eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinases 
(PknA-PknL), two protein tyrosine phosphatases (PtpA and PtpB), and the newly identiﬁed protein tyrosine 
kinase, PtkA8,18–22. Tese signaling proteins play key roles in bacterial adaptation and response to host defense 
mechanisms. In particular, PtpA, a secreted protein essential for Mtb pathogenesis, interacts with the host 
vacuolar-H+-ATPase complex to block its traﬃcking to the mycobacterial phagosome, thereby preventing pha-
gosome acidiﬁcation and ultimately phagosome-lysosome fusion15,20. PtkA, encoded within the same operon

as ptpA, phosphorylates PtpA19, thereby enhancing PtpA phosphatase activity23. Tis suggests that PtkA and 
PtpA may act cooperatively to provide a function essential for Mtb pathogenesis.
In this work, we constructed a deletion mutant of ptkA to assess its role in Mtb physiology. Te ΔptkA strain 
was found to have impaired intracellular survival within the THP-1 macrophage infection model, and failed to 
inhibit phagosome acidiﬁcation. However, the ΔptkA mutant strain also displayed enhanced resistance against 
oxidative stress in vitro. We therefore used a global proteomics approach to compare ΔptkA and its parental 
wild type (WT) strain when exposed to oxidative stress. Additionally, given that PtpA is secreted, we compared 
the secretomes of ΔptkA and its parental strain. We discovered that thioredoxin reductase TrxB2, an important 
protein in the defense against oxidative stress, is secreted by Mtb and its secretion is up-regulated in the ΔptkA 
mutant strain. Trough kinase assays and protein-protein interaction studies, we discovered that TrxB2 is a sub-
strate of PtkA phosphorylation.
Results
Construction of a ptkA knockout mutant in Mtb. 
To assess the role of PtkA in Mtb physiology, we 
constructed an Mtb mutant with a deletion of the gene encoding the PtkA tyrosine kinase by specialized phage 
transduction24. Genomic DNA isolated from the parental WT strain and the ∆ptkA mutant strain were subjected 
to Southern hybridization analysis to conﬁrm that the gene encoding PtkA was replaced with the hygromycin 
resistance cassette as outlined in Fig. 1a and b. Whole genome sequencing conﬁrmed successful replacement of 
the ptkA gene as designed without interruption of the rest of the genes within the ptkA operon25.
Intracellular survival in THP-1 macrophages. 
Since ptkA and ptpA are present in the same polycis-
tronic operon, and PtpA is known to be essential for Mtb pathogenesis15,20,26 as well as being the phosphorylation 
substrate of PtkA19,23, we hypothesized that PtkA might also be required for Mtb intracellular growth within 
human macrophages. To test our hypothesis, we investigated the ability of the mutant strain to survive in the 
human THP-1 macrophage infection model. Indeed, the ΔptkA strain was found to be attenuated within the 
macrophage, whereas the parental and the complemented strains were able to establish a stable infection afer 3 
days (Fig. 2a). At 6 days afer infection, the mutant strain showed more than a log reduction in CFU compared to 
the WT strain. While the parental and complemented strains entered growth phase within the macrophage, the 
ΔptkA strain was continuously cleared, establishing the importance of PtkA for Mtb growth within macrophages.
Inhibition of the macrophage’s phagosomal acidiƤcation. 
In the case of the ΔptpA mutant, impaired 
intracellular survival results from its inability to inhibit phagosome acidiﬁcation20. To investigate whether this was 
the case with the ΔptkA mutant, we examined phagosomal pH in THP-1 macrophages infected with the ΔptkA 
mutant and compared it to its parental WT strain. We used ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to analyze 
the pH of Mtb-containing phagosomes. Parental and mutant strains were dually labeled with the pH-sensitive 
pHrodo ﬂuorescent dye and the pH-insensitive Alexa Fluor 488. Te ΔptpA strain, shown earlier to be incapable 
of inhibiting phagosome acidiﬁcation, was used as a control. As seen in Fig. 2b–d and Table 1, overlaid FACS 
histograms showed an increase in the mean pHrodo ﬂuorescence intensity for phagosomes harboring the ΔptkA 
strain (corresponding to pH 5.40), as compared to those containing the WT strain (corresponding to pH 6.64). 
Tis increase is similar to that observed for the ΔptpA strain (corresponding to pH 5.46), indicating that the 
ΔptkA strain failed to block phagosome acidiﬁcation.
Increased cellular expression of ptpA and PtpA. 
As the ΔptkA and ΔptpA strains demonstrated sim-
ilar phenotypes in the macrophage infection, and because ptkA is the ﬁrst gene in the ptpA operon, we checked 
whether ptkA deletion could have resulted in the loss of ptpA expression. Using quantitative real-time PCR 
(qPCR), we found that ptpA transcription was not disrupted but rather upregulated in the ΔptkA mutant com-
pared to WT Mtb (Fig. 3a). Western analysis conﬁrmed increased levels of PtpA protein in the ΔptkA mutant

compared to WT (Fig. 3b, 2nd panel). PtkA and the unrelated protein, DosR, were used as controls to conﬁrm 
knockout of PtkA in the mutant and equal loading, respectively (Fig. 3b, 1st and 4th panels). Our iTRAQ experi-
ment (below) also identiﬁed increased intracellular levels of both PtpA and Rv2235 (encoded in the same operon 
as ptkA and ptpA) in the ΔptkA mutant. Complementation, however, did not restore WT levels of ptpA (Fig. 3a) 
or PtpA (Fig. 3b). Analysis of the genomic sequence of the ΔptkA mutant suggests that upregulation of ptpA 
may be due to the introduction of a putative promoter sequence downstream of the hygromycin cassette25. 
Nevertheless, complementation did restore the macrophage infection phenotypes observed in the ΔptkA mutant 
(Fig. 2). Terefore, while not ideal, the overexpression of ptpA in the mutant was a fortuitous, though accidental 
control, indicating that the similarity between the ΔptkA and ΔptpA strains is not due to loss of ptpA expression 
in the ΔptkA mutant, but that PtkA is independently essential for Mtb pathogenesis.
Resistance to oxidative stress in liquid cultures. 
To further characterize the ΔptkA strain, we exam-
ined whether the deletion of the ptkA gene aﬀected the growth of Mtb in vitro. Te growth of the mutant with its

parental and the complemented strains in various conditions was compared. No diﬀerences in growth rate were 
observed between the ΔptkA mutant and its parental strain when grown as rolling or static cultures in 7H9-ADS 
or Sauton’s medium (Fig. 4a and b). As PtkA was shown to be phosphorylated by Ser/Tr protein kinases specif-
ically under peroxide treatment27, and to mimic in vivo oxidative stress conditions, we tested the growth of the 
ΔptkA mutant exposed to peroxides. Surprisingly, ΔptkA growth, as measured by OD600 and colony forming 
units, was more resistant to sub-lethal and lethal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 4c,d,g and h) and 
cumene hydroperoxide (Fig. 4e,f,i, and j). Sensitivity to these oxidizing agents was suppressed by complementa-
tion of the ΔptkA mutant with the WT gene, thus conﬁrming that the mutated allele made the strain more resist-
ant to oxidative stress in vitro. Tis in vitro phenotype appears to be in stark contrast to the mutant’s impaired 
intracellular survival.
Proteomic analysis of the ΔptkA mutant. 
To gain insight into potential regulation mediated by PtkA, 
we compared the protein expression proﬁles of ΔptkA and WT Mtb with and without H2O2 treatment using the 
quantitative mass spectrometry proteomics approach, iTRAQ. We were able to identify and compare the levels of 
up to 1163 cellular proteins using a cutoﬀ of 95% conﬁdence in the identiﬁcation of peptides. Te ratios of indi-
vidual protein levels ranged from 0.269 to 4.099 for untreated samples, and from 0.235 to 4.878 for H2O2-treated 
samples (Supplementary Data 1). Using an arbitrary cut-oﬀ of 1.5-fold change, 10 proteins were up-regulated 
and 8 proteins were down-regulated in untreated samples, while 11 were up-regulated and 21 down-regulated 
in treated samples. Graphical analysis of a plot of treated vs untreated ΔptkA/WT ratios revealed that the larg-
est subset of diﬀerentially expressed proteins mapped to the lower right quadrant, corresponding to a 1.4-fold 
decrease in ΔptkA /WT ratios upon treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 5A, blue circles). Tis subgroup of 49 proteins

(Table 2). In addition to this subgroup, a lone protein involved in pyrimidine biosynthesis, PyrE, was found 
highly upregulated in the ΔptkA mutant only upon treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 5A). Additionally, as noted above, 
the intracellular levels of PtpA and Rv2235 were highly upregulated in the ΔptkA mutant independent of H2O2 
treatment (Fig. 5A).
As the PtkA substrate, PtpA, is secreted, and Mtb secretes anti-oxidative defense enzymes, including a super-
oxide (SodA) and a catalase (KatG), we compared the culture ﬁltrate proteins (CFPs) of ΔptkA and WT. iTRAQ 
analysis of CFPs revealed 877 proteins identiﬁed with 95% conﬁdence. Of these, 29 proteins were found to be 
increased by at least 2-fold in the ΔptkA mutant, while 12 proteins decreased, with levels ranging from 0.153 to 
10.784 (Supplementary Data 1). CFP levels were plotted against the corresponding cellular protein levels of Mtb 
grown in Sauton’s media and shown in Fig. 5B. Of note, the thioredoxin reductase TrxB2 was found to be 3.2-fold 
higher in protein abundance in the culture ﬁltrate of the ΔptkA strain. Since the thioredoxin system participates 
in the detoxiﬁcation of ROI13 and therefore may account for the enhanced resistance to oxidative stress observed 
in the ΔptkA mutant, we decided to further investigate the link between PtkA and TrxB2.

TrxB2 expression and phosphorylation. 
The increased secretion level of TrxB2 was confirmed by 
Western blot analysis of CFPs (Fig. 3c, upper panel). Te absence of Mtb autolysis during culturing was conﬁrmed 
by Western blot analysis of the harvested CFPs with antibodies against the cytosolic DosR protein (Fig. 3c, lower 
panel). However, both expression of the trxB2 gene (Fig. 3a) as well as the intracellular protein levels of TrxB2 
(Fig. 3b) revealed no diﬀerence in the ΔptkA mutant compared to WT and complement strains.
Given that PtpA is secreted and is a substrate of PtkA19, we tested the possibility that TrxB2, being secreted and 
dysregulated in the ΔptkA mutant, may also serve as a substrate for PtkA. Indeed, in vitro kinase assays demon-
strated that PtkA phosphorylated TrxB2 in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 6a,b). Phosphoamino acid 
analysis of the phosphorylated TrxB2 protein further revealed that PtkA phosphorylated TrxB2 on tyrosine, con-
sistent with PtkA’s tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 6c). We further performed site-directed mutagenesis to examine 
which Tyr residue in TrxB2 was phosphorylated. Mutation of Tyr32 signiﬁcantly reduced phosphorylation of 
TrxB2, indicating that Tyr32 is targeted by PtkA for phorphorylation (Fig. 6d).
To further verify the kinase-substrate interaction in a cellular model, PtkA and TrxB2 were subjected to the 
mycobacterial protein fragment complementation assay28. Co-expression of TrxB2-F3 with PtkA-F1,2 resulted in 
reconstitution of mDHFR activity, as evidenced by growth of M. smegmatis on media supplemented with trimeth-
oprim, conﬁrming PtkA interaction with TrxB2 (Fig. 6e). Te interaction between PtkA and TrxB2 was found to 
be similar to that of PtkA and PtpA, based on comparable M. smegamatis growth in the presence of trimethoprim.
Discussion
Tyr phosphorylation in mycobacteria has long been a subject of interest29. Our results19, along with studies from 
others30,31, have demonstrated Tyr kinase activity in Mtb. However, the physiological function of Tyr phosphoryl-
ation in Mtb has not been explored. We have previously shown that PtkA represents a novel prokaryotic protein 
Tyr kinase19,32. PtkA was also proposed to play a key role in Mtb pathogenesis21,32 based on its substrate, PtpA, 
being essential for preventing phagosome acidiﬁcation and maturation15,20. Here, we examined the role of PtkA 
in Mtb pathophysiology and pathogenesis by generating a mutant Mtb strain with a deletion of the ptkA gene. 
Te ΔptkA mutant was impaired in intracellular survival within the THP-1 macrophage infection model and is 
consistent with the mutant’s failure to inhibit phagosomal acidiﬁcation. Tese results match the phenotype of 
the ΔptpA deletion mutant15,20 suggesting that PtkA inhibition of phagosomal acidiﬁcation may be mediated via 
PtpA function, either through PtkA phosphorylation of PtpA, which enhances PtpA phosphatase activity23, and/
or via PtkA-dependent PtpA secretion. Further experiments are needed to test this hypothesis.
While ptkA was needed for intracellular survival, the lack of ptkA enhanced the mutant stain’s resistance to 
oxidative stress in vitro. Proteomic analyses identiﬁed the thioredoxin reductase, TrxB2, to have increased secre-
tion in the ΔptkA mutant. While the exact mechanism of this upregulation was not identiﬁed and may be a result 
of increased expression of PtpA and/or Rv2235 as complementation of the ptkA mutant did not restore WT levels, 
we found that PtkA is able to bind and phosphorylate TrxB2 on tyrosine. Additionally, we demonstrated that 
TrxB2 is secreted, which has not been reported previously to our knowledge. Secretion of TrxB2 is consistent with 
the ﬁnding that TrxC, the thioredoxin substrate of TrxB2, is secreted33–36, as we also observed (Supplementary 
Data 1).
While it is tempting to speculate that increased secretion of TrxB2 is responsible for the mutant’s increased 
resistance to oxidative stress, the fact that TrxB2 secretion was also upregulated in the complement, while 
complementation restored the WT sensitivity to oxidative stress suggests an alternative mechanism is at play. 
Furthermore, the relatively modest 3.2-fold increased secretion of TrxB2, is unlikely to be able to result in the 
up-to 2-log enhanced growth/survival of the ΔptkA mutant in lethal concentrations of oxidative stress (Fig. 4). 
Other variations in protein levels identiﬁed in the iTRAQ experiment, such as the decrease in ribosomal proteins 
and rRNA methyltransferases observed in the ΔptkA mutant (Table 2), may lead to a slower metabolism and thus

increased resistance to oxidative stress. Alternatively, in S. aureus, the methylation status of rRNA has been shown 
to aﬀect resistance to oxidative stress37. However, we did not establish a direct role for PtkA in this downregula-
tion which may be an indirect downstream eﬀect of the oxidative stress.
A second cluster of enriched proteins that were identiﬁed to be dysregulated in the ΔptkA mutant when 
exposed to H2O2 belong to the ESX type 7 secretion systems (Table 2). Interestingly, each of these proteins are pre-
dicted to be secreted by either the ESX-3 or ESX-5 secretion systems38. Consistent with this ﬁnding, the structural 
components of the ESX secretion systems that were identiﬁed in our iTRAQ analysis showed little to no diﬀerence 
in protein levels between WT and mutant (Supplementary Data 1). Given that the two identiﬁed substrates of 
PtkA, PtpA19 and TrxB2 (this study), are secreted, and that the dysregulated ESX proteins are secretion proteins, 
suggests that PtkA may play a role in secretion.
Te ESX-5 secretion system has been described to be involved in nutrient uptake39, while the ESX-3 system 
is necessary for iron and zinc homeostasis40. Interestingly both the identiﬁed ribosomal proteins and the ESX-3 
proteins are encoded in the zur regulon which responds to zinc levels41. Disruption of metalloregulatory proteins 
can result in a change to intrabacterial redox state42 and may contribute to the mutant’s resistance to oxidative 
stress, as over-exposure to metal ions could render them highly toxic through interference with the functioning 
of macromolecules and the generation of free radicals43.
While the ΔptkA mutant demonstrated enhanced resistance to oxidative stress, this resistance was not suﬃ-
cient to compensate for or overcome the mutant’s inability to block phagosomal acidiﬁcation in the macrophage 
infection model, and the failure to grow and survive within the macrophage. Additionally, Mehra et al.44 discov-
ered that the EsxG-EsxH complex, secreted by the ESX-3 system, interacts and interferes with the endosomal 
sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), demonstrating a direct role for ESX-3 in the arrest of phago-
some maturation. In this regard, the downregulation of EsxH identiﬁed in the ΔptkA mutant could also poten-
tially lead to the failure in blocking phagosome-lysosome fusion during macrophage infection and explain the 
impaired intracellular survival phenotype observed for the ΔptkA strain. Further experiments are needed to test 
this hypothesis.

To conclude, our studies established a central role for PtkA in macrophage infection by Mtb and correlated the 
enzyme activity to phosphorylation and secretion of TrxB2 and PtpA.
Methods
Strains, media and conditions. 
Mtb H37Rv and their derivative strains were grown on Middlebrook 
7H10 agar (BD Diagnostic Systems, Mississauga, ON, Canada) supplemented with 10% (v/v) OADC (oleic acid, 
albumin, dextrose and catalase solution). For liquid cultures, Mtb strains were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth 
(BD Diagnostic Systems) supplemented with 10% (v/v) OADC or ADS (albumin, dextrose and NaCl solution) 
and 0.05% (v/v) Tween-80 (Sigma-Aldrich) or Sauton’s media supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-80 at 37 °C 
standing or rolling in incubator. Escherichia coli strains were cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. Te concen-
trations of antibiotics used were 75 μg/ml hygromycin and 20 μg/ml kanamycin for mycobacterial strains, and 
150 μg/ml hygromycin and 40 μg/ml kanamycin for E. coli.
Construction of ΔptkA deletion mutant. 
Construction of the ΔptkA deletion mutant was per-
formed according to the specialized transduction with conditionally replicating mycobacteriophage method 
described previously24. Brieﬂy, 1000-bp of the upstream and downstream ﬂanking regions of the ptkA gene were 
PCR-ampliﬁed from genomic DNA of Mtb H37Rv. Subsequently, the upstream and downstream ﬂanks were 
digested with the indicated restriction enzymes, and ligated with Van91I-digested p0004-SacB vector containing 
the γδres-sacB-hyg-γδres cassette comprising of the sacB gene and hygromycin resistance gene ﬂanked by res-sites 
of the γδ-resolvase. Te resulting knockout plasmids were then linearized with PacI and cloned and packaged 
into the temperature-sensitive phage phAE159, as previously described24, yielding knockout phages which were 
propagated in M. smegmatis at 30 °C. Te mycobacteriophages harboring the knockout constructs were harvested 
and used for allelic exchange with specialized transduction as reported previously. Mtb H37Rv cultures were 
grown to an OD600 of 0.8–1.0, washed with 7H9-glycerol-ADS and resuspended in buﬀer before mixing with the 
mycobacteriophages at a multiplicity of infection of 10:1 (mycobacteriophage: mycobacteria), and the mixture 
was incubated at 37 °C overnight. Te cells were pelleted and resuspended in 7H9-glycerol-ADS and plated in 
three 7H10-glycerol-OADC plates with 50 μg/mL of hygromycin and incubated at 37 °C to select for gene deletion 
and replacement by the γδres-sacB-hyg-γδres cassette. Putative ΔptkA clones were screened by PCR using two 
pairs of oligonucleotides targeting the hygromycin gene and region ﬂanking the hygromycin cassette. Based on 
the PCR analysis, two isolates were chosen for Southern hybridization analysis. Genomic DNAs isolated from 
the parental WT and the two isolates of the ΔptkA strain were subjected to Digoxigenin (DIG)-based Southern 
hybridization analysis to conﬁrm ptkA deletion.
Complementation of ΔptkA strain. 
For complementation of ΔptkA, the DNA sequence encoding WT 
PtkA under the control of the native promoter was cloned into the pKP186 integrative vector. Te ΔptkA strain 
was co-transformed with the resulting plasmid and pBSint, a non-replicating plasmid that provides integrase in 
trans but is subsequently lost from the cells, thereby reducing the chances of integrase-mediated excision of the 
complementing DNA. Transformants were selected on 7H10 agar with 10% OADC and 50 μg/mL kanamycin.
Hydrogen peroxide sensitivity assay. 
Mtb cultures at OD600 = 0.15 in 7H9 media supplemented with 
0.05% (v/v) Tween-80 and ADS or Sauton’s media supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-80 were exposed to 
a single dose of H2O2 (0 mM–4 mM) in vitro. Bacterial growth (OD600) and colony forming unit (CFU) were 
monitored every 24 hours afer addition of stress. Tree independent experiments were conducted for each H2O2 
concentration.
Infection of THP-1. 
Infection of THP-1 macrophages was performed using human serum-opsonized Mtb 
at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10:1 or 1:1 (Bacteria: Macrophage). For Mtb intracellular survival studies, 
infected macrophages were harvested at deﬁned time points, lysed with 0.025% SDS, serial diluted, and plated on 
7H10 agar medium supplemented with OADC and appropriate antibiotics. Te plates were incubated at 37 °C for 
2 weeks until colonies could be counted.
Measurement of phagosomal pH in THP-1 macrophages infected with Mtb. 
Phagosomal pH 
measurement was performed as described previously20. Brieﬂy, THP-1 macrophages were seeded on 6 well 
plates (1.0 × 106) with 40 ng/ml PMA. Mtb strains were ﬁrst labeled with 20 M pHrodo succinimidyl ester (SE) 
(Invitrogen) at 37 °C for one hour. Te bacteria were washed with 7H9 supplemented with 0.05% Tween-80 three 
times before being labeled with 25 g/mL Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid SE (Invitrogen). Te bacteria were then 
washed and opsonized with human serum. Te THP-1 macrophages were subsequently infected with the labeled 
Mtb at a MOI of 10:1 for 2 hours at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Non-internalized bacteria were washed away, and the 
infection was carried out for another 2 hours at 37 °C with 5% CO2. For pH calibration, the infected cells were 
incubated in 10 mM phosphate-citrate buﬀer with pre-determined pH (5.0–8.0) (Fig. S1A and S1B). Te cells 
were then washed, scraped oﬀ the plate and ﬁxed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde. Te ﬁxed cells were then analyzed 
with FACS on FACSCalibur (BD Bioscience) and the FlowJo 8.7 sofware. Color compensation was performed to 
prevent signal overlapping. Mean ﬂuorescence intensities of pHrodo and Alexa Fluor 488 were used to calculate 
phagosomal pH.
Protein preparation for proteomics analysis. 
Mtb H37Rv and their derivative strains were grown in 
Middlebrook 7H9 broth (BD Diagnostic Systems) supplemented with 10% (v/v) OADC or ADS and 0.05% (v/v) 
Tween-80 (Sigma-Aldrich) to an OD600 = 0.6. Te cultures were washed with 7H9 or Sauton’s media and inocu-
lated into fresh 7H9-ADS or Sauton’s media supplemented with 0.05% (v/v) Tween-80. Sauton’s media was used 
when culture ﬁltrate proteins were analyzed. 2 mM H2O2 was added when appropriate, and the cultures were

grown at 37 °C rolling in incubator until OD600 = 1.0. Te culture ﬁltrate proteins were harvested by centrifuging 
the Mtb cultures to obtain the spent culture supernatant. Te supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0.22 μm syringe 
ﬁlter unit (Corning) before removal from BSL-3 laboratory. Te ﬁltered supernatant was then concentrated with 
a stirred cell concentrator (EMD Millipore) ﬁtted with YM-3 membrane (3 kDa-cutoﬀ). Cytosolic fractions 
were extracted by lysing Mtb through bead-beating. Te lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was ﬁltered 
through a 0.22 μm syringe ﬁlter unit before removal from BSL-3 laboratory.
iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation). 
Protein concentrations were deter-
mined using a bicinchonic acid protein assay (Sigma). Samples (85 µg of each) were precipitated overnight in 
acetone at 4 °C followed by resolubilization in 0.5 M triethylammoniumbicarbonate, 0.2% SDS. Proteins were 
reduced with tris-(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine and alkylated with methyl methanethiosulfonate Proteins were then 
“in-solution” digested with trypsin (Promega) and labeled with the appropriate iTRAQ label. iTRAQ labeled pep-
tides were then combined and separated by strong cation exchange HPLC. HPLC fractions containing peptides 
were then reduced in volume by speed-vac and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Te length of the reverse gradient used 
was 2 hours per HPLC fraction. Samples were analyzed by reversed phase nanoﬂow (300 nL/min) HPLC with 
nano-electrospray ionization using a LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (LTQ-Orbitrap Velos, Termo-Fisher) 
operated in positive ion mode. All data was analyzed using Proteome Discoverer v1.3 (Termo-Fisher) and 
MASCOT v2.3 (Matrix Science). Raw data ﬁles were searched against the Uniprot-SwissProt database with “All 
Species” ﬁlter and Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex species only.
RNA extraction and real-time quantitative PCR. 
WT Mtb and ΔptkA Mtb strains were grown in roll-
ing cultures at 37 °C in Sauton’s medium. Bacteria were harvested at OD~1.0 and RNAs were extracted using 
FastRNA Pro Blue kit (MP Biomedicals). Cells were lysed in the presence of glass beads in a FastPrep ribolyzer 
(MP Biomedicals) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Post lysis, RNA extraction was performed with chlo-
roform, and afer ethanol precipitation, RNA was dissolved in nuclease-free water. Puriﬁed RNA was treated with 
RNase-free Turbo DNase (Ambion) according to the supplier’s instructions in order to digest contaminating DNA 
and the Illustra RNAspin minikit (GE Healthcare) was used for the subsequent cleanup procedures. Removal of 
DNA was conﬁrmed by performing PCR using an aliquot of the DNase-treated RNA as a template. Reverse tran-
scription reactions were carried out in 20-μl volumes containing 2 μg RNA, random primers, and the buﬀer and 
enzyme components of the EasyScript cDNA Synthesis kit (ABM) according to the supplied protocol. Real-time 
PCR analysis was carried out on the Step One Real Time PCR system (Life Technologies). Each qPCR reaction 
contained 2X FastStart SYBR green master mix (Roche), 15ng cDNA and 0.3 μM of each primer. Control reac-
tions without reverse transcriptase were also included with each run to conﬁrm the absence of genomic DNA 
contamination. Expression level was normalized to the constitutively expressed sigA gene.
Western blot analysis. 
Western blot analyses were performed according to standard protocols. Brieﬂy, 
26–30 µg of cellular extracts and CFP of the indicated Mtb strains were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred 
onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). Te blots were blocked with 2% milk proteins in TBS-T and probed 
with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal (YenZym Antibodies, LLC) anti-PtkA (1:50000), anti-PtpA (1:500), 
anti-TrxB2 (1:50000), or anti-DosR (1:2500) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. For detection, Alexa Fluor 680 goat 
anti-rabbit (TermoFisher) antibody was used as the secondary detection reagent (1:10,000), and detection was 
done using an Odyssey Infrared CLx Imager (LI-COR Biosciences). Brightness and contrast were adjusted and 
applied to entire images using Adobe Photoshop CS5.1. Full-length images are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1.
In vitro kinase assay. 
Kinase assays were carried out using [γ-32P]ATP as the phosphate donor accord-
ing to published protocols45 with some modiﬁcations. Te in vitro kinase reactions contained 20 mM Tris-HCl, 
pH = 7.5, 1 mM MnCl2, 0.1 mM MgCl2 and 1 mM DTT. Proteins (1.3–1.4 µM of PtkA and 1.2 µM of TrxB2 for 
the time-dependent assay and 3.4 µM of TrxB2 for the single amino acid point mutation kinase assay) were sepa-
rated by SDS/PAGE (12%) supplemented with 8 M urea, and silver-stained. Te 32P-radioactively labeled protein 
bands were detected using a PhosphorImager SI (Molecular Dynamics). Brightness and contrast were adjusted 
and applied to entire autoradiography images using Adobe Photoshop CS5.1. Full-length images are shown in 
Supplementary Fig. 2. Densitometric analysis of TrxB2 phosphorylation in Fig. 6d using Adobe Photophop CS5.1 
is shown in Supplementary Fig. 3.
Phosphoamino acid analysis. 
Recombinant PtkA was incubated with [γ-32P]ATP in the kinase buﬀer 
described above. Te sample was hydrolyzed with 6 N HCl at 110 °C for 1 hour and separated on a cellulose 
TLC plate by ascending chromatography45. For TrxB2 phosphorylation by PtkA, the reaction was stopped with 
sample buﬀer, loaded into SDS-PAGE (12%) containing 8 M urea, and subjected to electrophoresis. Te gel was 
electroblotted on to an Immobilon PVDF membrane46. Phosphorylated proteins bound to the membrane were 
detected by autoradiography using a PhosphorImager apparatus. Te 32P-labelled protein band corresponding 
to the migration of TrxB2 was excised from the membrane and hydrolyzed following the same procedure as 
described above. Afer hydrolysis, samples were separated on ascending TLC chromatography. Afer migration, 
radioactive amino acids were detected by autoradiography. Brightness and contrast were adjusted and applied 
to entire autoradiography images using Adobe Photoshop CS5.1. Phosphoserine, phosphothreonine and phos-
photyrosine standards (Sigma) were separated on cellulose TLC plate in parallel and visualized by staining with 
ninhydrin.
Mycobacterial protein fragment complementation assay. 
Te mycobacterial protein fragment com-
plementation assay was performed as described28. Te genes of interest were PCR-ampliﬁed and cloned into

pUAB100 (expressing mDHFR fragment F1,2) or pUAB200 (expressing mDHFR fragment F3). M. smegmatis 
was co-transformed with both plasmids, and the co-transformants were selected on 7H11 agar plates with 25 μg/
mL kanamycin and 50 μg/mL hygromycin and tested for growth over 3–4 days on 7H11 kanamycin/hygromycin 
plates supplemented with 20 μg/mL trimethoprim.
