The cell envelope of mycobacteria, which include the causative agents of tuberculosis and leprosy, is crucial
for their success as pathogens. Despite a continued strong emphasis on identifying the multiple chemical
components of this envelope, it has proven difﬁcult to combine its components into a comprehensive structural
model, primarily because the available ultrastructural data rely on conventional electron microscopy embed-
ding and sectioning, which are known to induce artifacts. The existence of an outer membrane bilayer has long
been postulated but has never been directly observed by electron microscopy of ultrathin sections. Here we have
used cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) to perform a detailed ultrastructural analysis
of three species belonging to the Corynebacterineae suborder, namely, Mycobacterium bovis BCG, Mycobacterium
smegmatis, and Corynebacterium glutamicum, in their native state. We provide new information that accurately
describes the different layers of the mycobacterial cell envelope and challenges current models of the organi-
zation of its components. We show a direct visualization of an outer membrane, analogous to that found in
gram-negative bacteria, in the three bacterial species examined. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mycolic
acids, the hallmark of mycobacteria and related genera, are essential for the formation of this outer membrane.
In addition, a granular layer and a low-density zone typifying the periplasmic space of gram-positive bacteria
are apparent in CEMOVIS images of mycobacteria and corynebacteria. Based on our observations, a model of
the organization of the lipids in the outer membrane is proposed. The architecture we describe should serve
as a reference for future studies to relate the structure of the mycobacterial cell envelope to its function.
The suborder of Corynebacterineae is a distinct group of
gram-positive bacteria and comprises mycobacteria and other
genera such as Corynebacterium, Rhodococcus, and Nocardia.
The medical importance of the group is enormous; it includes
the causative agents of human diseases such as tuberculosis
and leprosy, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium
leprae, respectively. The structure of the cell envelope of these
bacteria has been the subject of numerous studies because it is
already clear that the powerful biological activities of known
wall components contribute signiﬁcantly to the disease process.
Indeed, lipids isolated from the cell envelope can elicit re-
sponses by the host immune system very similar to the re-
sponses generated by M. tuberculosis infection (e.g., granuloma
formation) (22).
Schematically, the envelope of this bacterial group is com-
posed of a typical plasma membrane (PM) surrounded by a cell
wall core, which, in turn, is surrounded by an outer layer (OL)
called the capsule in the case of pathogenic mycobacterial
species (Fig. 1). The cell wall core consists of peptidoglycan
covalently bound to arabinogalactan, which itself is covalently
bound to mycolic acids (very-long-chain, from C30 to C90, -al-
kyl, -hydroxy fatty acids) (9). This envelope is unusual in that
it is very rich in lipids, and unlike other gram-positive micro-
organisms, Corynebacterineae possess an outer permeability
barrier. It has been postulated that this barrier is formed by a
lipid bilayer analogous to the outer membrane (OM) of gram-
negative bacteria (33). The arrangement of the lipids in this
hypothetical OM has been long debated (26, 32, 34, 43, 44).
Based on the chemical structures of the main cell envelope
constituents, several models of the cell envelope, in particular,
the hypothetical OM bilayer of mycobacteria, were developed
(26, 32, 33, 43, 44). According to these models, the innermost

leaﬂet consists mainly of the mycolic acids, which are, at least
in part, covalently linked to the cell wall arabinogalactan. The
outermost leaﬂet is proposed to be composed of various gly-
colipids, including trehalose monomycolate and trehalose di-
mycolate; of phospholipids; and of species-speciﬁc lipids such
as glycopeptidolipids (GPL), phthiocerol dimycocerosate, and
sulfolipids (8, 26, 33, 44). The presence of pore-forming pro-
teins in low numbers in mycobacteria relative to Escherichia
coli may explain both the limited permeability of mycobacterial
cell envelopes and the generally rather low susceptibility of
these bacteria to toxic agents (6, 9, 36).
Nevertheless, not only is the precise organization of the OM
bilayer debated, but even its existence can be questioned since
there are no direct observations of this structure. On the one
hand, the bilayer model is supported by data from freeze frac-
ture electron microscopy which have clearly shown the occur-
rence of a major fracture plane in the outer part of the enve-
lope, in addition to the expected plane that typiﬁes the PM (5,
7, 33, 35, 43).
On the other hand, no sign of an OM bilayer was seen in
ultrathin sections of Corynebacterineae (Fig. 1) (9, 11, 43),
questioning its existence. Importantly, all electron microscopy
analyses of ultrathin sections were done with specimens from
which water had been removed, a prerequisite for electron
microscopy observation at room temperature. We call this
technique the conventional preparation method. Even when
dehydration has been performed at low temperature by freeze-
substitution in order to better preserve biological structures,
no OM bilayer was seen in Corynebacterineae (9, 28, 39, 40).
This is possibly due to the fact that, during dehydration, water-
soluble molecules tend to aggregate and lipid molecules may
be prone to extraction or rearrangement by organic solvents
(14).
In an attempt to resolve the question of the existence of an
OM bilayer in Corynebacterineae, we addressed the native
structure of both mycobacteria and the closely related coryne-
bacteria, whose cell envelope resembles that of mycobacteria
after conventional electron microscopy (43). We focused our
study on Mycobacterium smegmatis, Mycobacterium bovis BCG,
and Corynebacterium glutamicum by cryo-electron microscopy
(cryoEM) of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS). In the CEMOVIS
technique, specimens are vitriﬁed by high-pressure freezing
(i.e., cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature without water crys-
tallization). The vitreous specimens are then cryosectioned and
imaged in a cryo-electron microscope in their fully hydrated,
native state. The artifacts of aggregation and lipid extraction
are therefore prevented (1). Importantly, this is the only sec-
tioning technique for electron microscopy involving freezing
where the vitreous state can be unambiguously conﬁrmed, by
electron diffraction. With this approach, we provide detailed
insights into the structure of the mycobacterial cell envelope in
its native state and a direct visualization of the mycobacterial
OM. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mycolates are essen-
tial constituents of this structure through the use of a wild-type
and a mycolate-free strain of C. glutamicum (41).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Culture conditions. M. smegmatis mc2155 (ATCC 700084) and M. smegmatis
tmptB (49) were cultured in LB (Luria-Bertani broth; Difco, Basel, Switzerland)
at 37°C with aeration. M. bovis BCG Pasteur (ATCC 35734) was cultured in
0.05% Tween 80, oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase-enriched (oleic acid dex-
trose complex) Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) at 37°C with aeration. Mycobac-
teria were harvested during the exponential growth phase (optical density at 600
nm of 3 for M. smegmatis and of 0.24 for M. bovis BCG). Wild-type C. glutami-
cum (ATCC 13032) was cultured on 3% agar–brain heart infusion medium
(Difco) at 30°C. C. glutamicum pks13::km (41) was cultured on agar-brain heart
infusion medium supplemented with 25 g/liter kanamycin at 30°C. Corynebac-
terial colonies were harvested after overnight growth. E. coli B/r carrying pUC19
was cultured in 2  YT in the presence of 100 g/ml ampicillin (45). Cells were
harvested during the exponential growth phase (optical density at 600 nm of
0.96). Streptococcus gordonii Challis was cultured and processed for CEMOVIS
as previously described (58). Harvesting was done by centrifugation at 3,200  g
for 5 min.
Vitriﬁcation and cryosectioning. For CEMOVIS, M. smegmatis and M. bovis
BCG were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) supplemented with
20% dextran (20% dextran–PBS) (average molecular mass, 40 kDa; Sigma-
Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). They were then introduced into copper tubes and
vitriﬁed with an EM PACT high-pressure freezer (Leica, Vienna, Austria).
Corynebacterial colonies were scraped and resuspended in 20% dextran–PBS. E.
coli was centrifuged and resuspended in 20% dextran–PBS. Corynebacteria and
E. coli were introduced into membrane carriers (Leica) and vitriﬁed with the
same apparatus. Afterwards, tubes were mounted in the tube holder of an
FC6/UC6 cryo-ultramicrotome (Leica) and trimmed to a pyramidal shape as
previously described (51, 58). Membrane carriers were clamped in the ﬂat spec-
imen holder of the cryo-ultramicrotome. Copper was trimmed away with a
diamond knife (Diatome, Bienne, Switzerland) on part of the specimen holder,
and the specimen was trimmed to a pyramidal shape with the same knife. Forty-
to 50-nm feed cryosections were cut with a 35 or 45° diamond knife (Diatome)
under standard cutting conditions (58). They were collected on carbon-coated
1,000-mesh grids or noncoated lacey carbon grids (Agar Scientiﬁc, Essex, United
Kingdom) and stored in liquid nitrogen or transferred immediately to the mi-
croscope.
For staining experiments, M. smegmatis mc2155 was washed three times in PBS
and ﬁxed for 2 h in 2.5% (wt/vol) glutaraldehyde in cacodylate buffer at room
temperature. Cells were washed three times in cacodylate buffer and postﬁxed in
1% (wt/vol) OsO4 for 2 h at room temperature. They were washed three times
in cacodylate buffer and then processed for high-pressure freezing as described
above.
For cryoEM of whole-mount wild-type C. glutamicum, colonies were scraped
and resuspended in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5. A 4-l sample volume was allowed to
adsorb to a carbon-coated grid for 1 min, blotted with Whatman no. 4 ﬁlter paper
(Merck, Zurich, Switzerland), and vitriﬁed by plunging into liquid ethane at
178°C.
CryoEM. For CEMOVIS, grids were transferred to a cryoholder (Gatan,
Warrendale, PA) kept below 170°C and inserted into CM100, Tecnai 12, and
Tecnai F30 cryo-electron microscopes (FEI, Eindhoven, Netherlands) equipped

cally ﬁxed and dehydrated Corynebacterineae. (A) M. smegmatis

matis is composed of a PM; a thick, electron-transparent layer (Peri ?;
interpreted as the postulated periplasmic space); a thick, internal,
electron-dense layer (EDL; considered a complex of peptidoglycan
and arabinogalactan); a thin, electron-transparent layer (ETL; as-
sumed to be composed of mycolic acids and other lipids); and an
electron-dense OL (a complex protein-carbohydrate matrix with some
lipids) (15, 16). The EDL and the mycolic acids of the ETL form the
cell wall core. The cell envelope of C. glutamicum looks similar, but it
does not possess an obvious low-density hypothetical periplasmic space
and the OL is thicker than in M. smegmatis (43). In both cases, the use
of ruthenium red stain resulted in enhanced staining of the OL. Bars,

with a LaB6 cathode, a tungsten cathode, and a ﬁeld emission gun, respectively.
The accelerating voltages were 100, 120, and 200 kV, respectively. Specimens
were irradiated with a low electron dose. Electron diffraction was used to check
whether water was vitreous or crystalline. Crystalline sections were discarded.
Images were recorded with a TemCam-F224HD charge-coupled device camera
(Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems, Munich, Germany) at magniﬁca-
tions of 22,500, 33,000, and 53,000. No image processing other than that
described in the ﬁgure legends was performed.
Whole-mount plunge-frozen cells were transferred to a Gatan cryoholder and
imaged at a magniﬁcation of 50,000 in a CM200-FEG (FEI) operated at an
accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Images were recorded on Kodak SO-163 plates
and scanned at a pixel size of 0.5 nm. For conventional electron microscopy, C.
glutamicum (CGL2020) and M. smegmatis mc2155 were grown, prepared, and
imaged as previously described (16, 43).
Quantitative measurements. Pixel size was calibrated by using a two-dimen-
sional crystal of catalase (Agar Scientiﬁc). At magniﬁcations of 22,500,
33,000, and 53,000, the pixel sizes are 0.63, 0.50, and 0.31 nm, respectively.
During cryosectioning, material is compressed along the cutting direction. Nev-
ertheless, it has been shown that compression does not affect the dimensions
measured perpendicularly to the cutting direction (13). Dimensions were mea-
sured accordingly on average density proﬁles calculated along rectangular selec-
tions with the software ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). The width of selection
rectangles is speciﬁed in the ﬁgure legends.
The density of OsO4-stained cells was measured with the software EMMENU
(Tietz Video and Image Processing Systems) in raw image ﬁles acquired at 120
kV at a defocus between 1.7 and 2.3 m. The density of the OM was
normalized to the density of the background.
RESULTS
Vitreous sections—general considerations. We investigated
the structure of the cell envelopes of two species of mycobac-
teria with CEMOVIS, namely, M. smegmatis, a fast-growing
nonpathogenic species, and M. bovis BCG, a slow-growing
vaccine strain belonging to the same complex as M. tuberculosis
and showing more than 99.9% genome sequence identity with
this pathogen (19). Henceforth, M. smegmatis refers to strain
mc2155 unless mentioned differently. A low-magniﬁcation mi-
crograph of M. smegmatis is shown in Fig. 2. Its quality is
representative of the majority of the sections that we observed.
It does not contain chatter or crevasses, which are cutting
artifacts that complicate image interpretation because they
produce irregular distortions (inhomogeneities) (2). Knife
marks (arrows) and compression along the cutting direction
cannot not be prevented but are homogeneous and therefore
do not hinder image interpretation.
Structure of the cell envelopes of M. bovis BCG and M.
smegmatis. The cell envelopes of M. smegmatis and M. bovis
BCG are structurally similar in CEMOVIS (Fig. 3A to F; Table
1). They are composed of a PM, a granular layer (GL), an
inner wall zone (IWZ) of low density, a medial wall zone
(MWZ) of intermediate density, and an OM of higher density.
The bilayer aspect of the OM can be best visualized in micro-
graphs recorded with a relatively small defocus value (Fig. 3A
and D) and in the corresponding density proﬁles (Fig. 3C and
F), whereas the organization of the GL, the IWZ, and the
MWZ is best seen in micrographs recorded with a larger de-
focus value (Fig. 3B and E). The GL is found next to the PM,
in the IWZ. The appearance of the mycobacterial GL and IWZ
is similar to that of the GL and the IWZ of typical gram-
positive bacteria (e.g., S. gordonii) visualized by CEMOVIS
(58) (Fig. 3G and H; Table 1). The MWZ of mycobacteria is
topologically identical to the gram-positive peptidoglycan layer
(outer wall zone) but is thinner. On images recorded with a
relatively large defocus, the MWZ seems separated from the
OM by a low-density gap (Fig. 3F). However, on images re-
corded very close to focus, the gap is strongly reduced (Fig. 3C)
or absent (data not shown), whereas the leaﬂets of the OM are
distinct. The gap is thus a phase-contrast artifact that can lead
to a slight underestimation of the MWZ thickness.
There is no structure similar to the mycobacterial OM in
classical gram-positive bacteria (e.g., S. gordonii), but the my-
cobacterial OM is structurally analogous to the OM of gram-
negative bacteria (e.g., E. coli) (Fig. 3I and J). The thickness of
the mycobacterial OM is similar to the published thickness of
the gram-negative OM visualized by CEMOVIS (Table 1)
(29). Even though an OM in mycobacteria has long been sug-
gested and supported by freeze fracture electron microscopy,
here we report a direct observation of such a bilayer in native
mycobacteria. Together, these comparisons indicate the fol-
lowing three points: (i) the IWZ occupies the position shown to
be a periplasmic space in other gram-positive bacteria (30, 31);
(ii) the MWZ is likely formed, at least in part, of peptidogly-
can; and (iii) the OM is made of molecules speciﬁc to myco-
bacteria and not ubiquitous in gram-positive bacteria. Because
these molecules form a bilayer, they are likely to contain a
hydrophobic moiety. OsO4 is considered to label predomi-
nantly lipids (56). We thus ﬁxed M. smegmatis cells with glu-
taraldehyde, postﬁxed them with OsO4, and subsequently pro-
cessed them for CEMOVIS. In a negative control, cells were
processed for CEMOVIS directly after glutaraldehyde ﬁxation.
The density of the OM is, on average, 39% higher in OsO4-
treated cells than in control cells (P  0.01, Fig. 4). These data
suggest that the OM is mainly made of lipids. Besides, the
bilayer aspect of the OM is lost after OsO4 staining in most of
the images, an observation that requires further investigation.
Mycolic acids, which are the hallmark lipids of Corynebacteri-
neae, of which a fraction is covalently bound to peptidoglycan
via arabinogalactan, are likely to be a major constituent of the
OM.
In order to test our hypothesis that the OM of mycobac-
teria is made at least in part of mycolic acids, we wanted to
observe mutant mycobacteria that would be devoid of my-
colic acid. However, this was impossible because mycobac-

teria cannot survive in the absence of this compound (3, 18,
41, 42, 53). For the same reason, treating cells with drugs
that inhibit the synthesis of mycolic acids (e.g., isoniazid)
proved useless. Indeed, at the highest sublethal isoniazid
concentration, the amount of mycolic acid per cell is only
reduced by 20% (4). Furthermore, probes such as gold-
coupled antibodies could not be used because they are too
large to diffuse through the cell envelope. And since speci-

mens must be kept frozen, immunolabeling of cryosections
is impossible.
Nevertheless, we studied M. smegmatis tmptB, a mutant de-
void of GPL and which forms very large cell aggregates (49).
GPL are considered to be an important constituent of the OM
outer leaﬂet in several mycobacterial species (26), and their
disruption may therefore affect the OM. CEMOVIS revealed
the structure of the contact zone between tmptB cells within an
aggregate: all of the layers of the cell envelope are present,
except the OM outer leaﬂet, and cells within the aggregate are
interacting via their OM inner leaﬂet (see Fig. S1A in the
supplemental material). This assertion is conﬁrmed by images
showing that, at the edge of the contact zone, the OM outer
leaﬂet is highly curved and is continuous between the two cells
involved in the contact, whereas this is not the case for the
inner leaﬂet (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material). Con-
tacts between wild-type cells also exist, and their structure is
identical to that of contacts seen between tmptB cells (see Fig.
S1C in the supplemental material). However, the deletion of
GPL generates an increase in the frequency of such contacts
and, accordingly, the surface ratio of the OM outer leaﬂet
versus the inner leaﬂet is reduced, which is in agreement with
the expected localization of GPL in the OM outer leaﬂet and
reinforces the hypothesis that the bilayer that we have ob-
served is indeed the long-searched-for mycobacterial OM. The
lipidic nature of the OM is further supported by the fact that
the OM inner leaﬂet was never observed in direct contact with
the aqueous environment but is always coated with either the
OM outer or inner leaﬂet of another cell in contact.
Structures of the cell envelopes of wild-type and mycolic-
acid-deﬁcient C. glutamicum. Corynebacteria are closely re-
lated to mycobacteria, and they possess a similar cell envelope.
C. glutamicum has become widely used in the study of mycolic
acids because, as opposed to mycobacteria, C. glutamicum can
grow in the absence of mycolic acids (3, 18, 41, 42, 53). In order
to further test our hypothesis that the OM of Corynebacterineae
is made, in part, of mycolic acids, we studied C. glutamicum
ATCC 13032 (henceforth referred to as wild-type C. glutami-
cum), which possesses mycolic acids, and C. glutamicum
pks13::km (henceforth referred to as C. glutamicum pks13),
a viable mutant strain that is deﬁcient in the production of
these fatty acids (41).
Our CEMOVIS micrographs show that the cell envelope of
wild-type C. glutamicum is similar to that of mycobacteria; it
consists of an IWZ, a GL, an MWZ, and an OM. Though
similar, the cell envelopes are not identical; the MWZ of C.
glutamicum is considerably thicker than the MWZ of mycobac-
teria, exhibiting values similar to those of classical gram-posi-
tive bacteria in CEMOVIS micrographs (Fig. 5A and C; Table
1) (58). This suggests that the amount of peptidoglycan/arabi-
nogalactan could be more important in corynebacteria than in
mycobacteria. On the other hand, the corynebacterial OM is
thinner than the mycobacterial OM and the corynebacterial
PM. For this reason, we expect that a higher resolution in
micrographs is needed to visualize its bilayer aspect, which is
more difﬁcult to obtain. In addition, in order to be seen, the
two dense layers of the OM need to be aligned along the
viewing axis through most of the section thickness (see Fig. 2 in
reference 59). However, the corynebacterial OM rarely ap-
pears smooth but shows many defects, which might thus hinder
the bilayer aspect of the corynebacterial OM (Fig. 5A, aster-
isk). As a consequence, this aspect is visible only in local
portions of micrographs recorded close to focus (Fig. 5C, ar-
row).
In order to determine if these defects are a native feature of
the corynebacterial OM or a cutting artifact, we examined
whole-mount plunge-frozen wild-type C. glutamicum cells by
cryoEM (13). The cytoplasm appears completely featureless
due to the large thickness of the sample (data not shown), but
both the PM and the OM can readily be observed. The OM
appears smoother than in CEMOVIS micrographs, indicating
that this structure is particularly prone to cutting artifacts (Fig.
5D). Furthermore, after Gaussian ﬁltering of whole-mount cell
micrographs, a bilayer aspect can be distinguished in many
places of the OM but its dimensions are close to the resolution
limit due to specimen thickness (Fig. 5D and E). Altogether,
our data suggest that the corynebacterial OM is also a bilayer.
Importantly, the cell envelope of mycolate-free C. glutami-
cum pks13 lacks an OM (Fig. 5F to H). The MWZ thickness
does not signiﬁcantly differ between wild-type C. glutamicum
and C. glutamicum pks13. This indicates that mycolic acids
are not present in the MWZ and that the OM found in wild-
type C. glutamicum is formed of mycolic acids and possibly of
other lipids that interact with them. Furthermore, the extra-
cellular medium of C. glutamicum pks13 contains a large
amount of ﬁlaments. These are 3.9 	 0.2 nm thick, which is
thinner than the OM found in wild-type C. glutamicum. Thus,
they possibly represent lipids that normally interact with my-
colic acids to form the outer leaﬂet of the OM. In the absence
of mycolic acid, they would still be exported but would not be
linked to the cell wall anymore and would be released in the
outer medium. This interpretation needs to be tested by fur-
ther analysis of the released material.

DISCUSSION
Insights into the native structure of mycobacterial cell en-
velope and comparison with images of conventional prepara-
tions. A variety of electron microscopy techniques have been
used to decipher the unusual architecture of mycobacteria and
related microorganisms. These include ultrathin sectioning of
both conventionally processed and freeze-substituted samples,
negative staining, and freeze fracture. Although the impression
prevails from all of the methods that the cell envelope is
layered, different techniques give different pictures of the lay-
ering. Consequently, the assignment of the known chemical
components of the wall to ultrastructurally deﬁned layers is not
straightforward (9).
In ultrathin conventional sections, the cell envelope of my-
cobacteria is seen as being composed of an asymmetric PM
with a thin inner leaﬂet and a thick outer leaﬂet (10, 47, 48); a
thick, electron-dense layer (EDL); an electron-transparent
layer (ETL); and an OL of variable density and thickness (Fig.
1). Because of the ETL’s transparency and the disappearance
of this layer after removal of lipids by alkaline hydrolysis (12),
the ETL is assumed to contain lipids, mainly mycolic acids. The
density of the EDL makes it likely to contain the peptidoglycan
to which the arabinogalactan is attached at many sites. In
mycobacteria, but not in corynebacteria, the PM is separated
from the EDL by a space that may correspond to a periplasm
(Fig. 1) (9, 43). Based on electron microscopy data, notably
those from freeze fracture (5, 7, 33, 35, 43), and on the chem-
ical structures of the main cell envelope constituents, a model
of the envelope was developed in 1982 by Minnikin (33), fol-
lowed by several improvements and modiﬁcations (26, 32, 34,
43, 44). Nevertheless, discrepancies remained between the im-
ages provided by various ultrastructural techniques and chem-
ical knowledge.
Application of CEMOVIS to representatives of pathogenic
and slow-growing, as well as saprophytic and rapid-growing,
mycobacterial species, i.e., M. bovis BCG and M. smegmatis,
respectively, resulted in images that differ from those previ-
ously obtained by conventional and freeze-substitution elec-
tron microscopy in the following important points. (i) The PM
has its typical bilayer aspect, with a thickness similar to that
observed in other bacterial cells (Table 1 and Fig. 6) (29–31,
58). The inner leaﬂet has the same density as the outer one, in
contrast to the asymmetrical appearance often reported by thin
conventional sections of mycobacteria, that was speculated to
be due to the glycoconjugates in the outer leaﬂet (47, 48). This
asymmetrical appearance of the membrane seen in conven-
tional sections could be a consequence of the dehydration
process involved in sample preparation, which could cause the
collapse of the GL against the outer leaﬂet of the PM. (ii) A
compartment similar to the periplasmic space of both gram-
positive and gram-negative bacteria (29–31, 58) is apparent in
CEMOVIS images not only in mycobacteria, as it was pre-
dicted from conventional electron microscopy (9), but also in
corynebacteria. This could provide cells with a space where
enzymatic reactions involved in cell envelope maintenance can
take place. As mentioned, the GL lies in the mycobacterial and
corynebacterial IWZ. This layer has been observed in gram-
positive bacteria but not in gram-negative bacteria (58). Thus,
its presence in both mycobacteria and corynebacteria is con-
sistent with the fact that these bacteria belong to the gram-
positive group. Recent cryo-electron tomography-based re-
ports of a similar structure in cell wall-free Mycoplasma

C, and 2.4 pixels for panels F and G). The density proﬁles in panels B and H were obtained from nondenoised images corresponding to panels
A and G, respectively. The density proﬁle in panel E was obtained from Gaussian ﬁltered (radius of 1 pixel) image D. The density proﬁles were
averaged over a width of 74 pixels (B), 65 pixels (E), and 70 pixels (H). The abbreviations are the same as those in Fig. 3. Double arrowhead, ice

pneumoniae suggest that it could be made of membrane-bound
proteins (20, 46). (iii) No ETL that is visible in conventional
thin sections and that has been considered to be made up of
cell wall-linked mycolates is seen in either M. bovis or M.
smegmatis examined by CEMOVIS. The presence of this layer
in conventional preparation of mycolate-free corynebacteria
(i.e., Corynebacterium amycolatum [43]) indicates that the layer
either represents a technical artifact or contains lipids other
than mycolates. (iv) Most importantly, both M. bovis and M.
smegmatis cells treated by CEMOVIS unambiguously show the
presence of an outer bilayer, a key point of validation of the
common basic feature of the current cell envelope models.
The density of the OM is strongly increased after ﬁxation
with OsO4, a chemical that stains mainly lipids (56). In cells
devoid of GPL, which in the OM are considered to be mainly
present in the outer leaﬂet (26), the OM inner leaﬂet has not
been seen uncoated and in direct contact with the aqueous
outer medium. Yet, the reduction in the surface area of the
OM outer leaﬂet is correlated with an increase in the con-
tact surface between the OM inner leaﬂets of two different
cells forming an aggregate. These observations strongly sup-
port the hydrophobic and lipidic nature of the leaﬂets com-
posing the OM.
To ﬁrmly establish the involvement of mycolates in the OM,
we used corynebacteria as a surrogate model for studying es-
sential mycobacterial compounds, such as mycolic acids, which
are dispensable in corynebacteria (3, 18, 41, 42, 53). We com-
pared the architecture of a wild-type strain and a mycolate-free
mutant of C. glutamicum (41). Our data clearly show that
whereas the wild-type strain had a distinct OM, the pks13
knockout mutant is devoid of this structure, making a compel-
ling argument that the OM is a real structure that contains
mycolic acids.
Challenges to the current models of the mycobacterial OM.
The thickness of the OM is 4 to 5 nm in C. glutamicum and 7
to 8 nm in mycobacteria. This observation is consistent with the
presence of mycolyl residues in the structure and the shorter
chain lengths of corynomycolic acids (32 to 36 carbons) com-
pared to those of mycobacteria (70 to 90 carbons). The sepa-
ration of the density peaks of the PM bilayer (3.9 	 0.4 nm in
M. bovis BCG) corresponds to the separation measured by
cryoEM and X-ray scattering in liposomes made of phosphati-
dylcholine with acyl chain lengths of 16 to 18 carbons (25, 52).
This is consistent with the lengths of the main fatty acid con-
stituents of the PM (11). On the other hand, the mycobacterial
OM is only slightly thicker than the PM (Table 1 and Fig. 6),
whereas the main (meromycolic) chain of the mycolic acids is
much longer (49 to 61 carbons in M. bovis BCG [50] and 35 to
58 carbons in M. smegmatis [57]). Similarly, both chains of C.
glutamicum mycolic acids are made of 16 to18 carbons (8), like
the main constituents of the PM, but the corynebacterial OM
is considerably thinner than the PM. It therefore appears that
to accommodate the limited thickness of the OM, the lipids
facing the arabinogalactan-bound mycolic acids must be inter-
calated between mycolic acid chains, resulting in a zipper-like
structure (Fig. 7). These lipids could be represented by extract-
able lipids (i.e., noncovalently bound to arabinogalactan) of a
ubiquitous nature (e.g., trehalose mycolate, phospholipids)
FIG. 6. Schematic representation, at scale, of the cell envelopes of E. coli, M. smegmatis, C. glutamicum, and S. gordonii as seen with CEMOVIS.
The abbreviations are the same as those in Fig. 3. The GL is drawn as bound to the PM. This hypothesis is based on the conclusion of our previous
work with gram-positive bacteria (58). The IWZ is attributed, by analogy to other bacteria, to a periplasmic space. The MWZ represents the
peptidoglycan layer in E. coli and S. gordonii and would correspond to the peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan layer in M. smegmatis and C. glutamicum.
The OL of M. smegmatis and C. glutamicum is not depicted (see Discussion).

trehalose monomycolate. Mycolic acids and trehalose mycolates are
folded (54, 55). An unfolded mycolic acid is shown in panel A. It is too
large to be accommodated in the OM. Porins are not drawn to scale.
Of note, the porin of M. smegmatis MspA is expected to protrude out
of the OM (27). The porin of corynebacteria has been proposed to be
made by a stack of short proteins (6 kDa) (43). GPL are species-
speciﬁc lipids found in M. smegmatis but not in M. bovis BCG (16). It
has been suggested that the OM inner leaﬂet of corynebacteria con-
tains a substantial amount of mycolic acids noncovalently bound to the
peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan (43).

and of species-speciﬁc types (e.g., sulfolipid, phthiocerol dimy-
cocerosate). Such a structure was originally proposed by Min-
nikin (33). The models proposed by Rastogi (44) and Liu et al.
(26), in which the extractable lipids form a totally distinct
monolayer rather than intercalating with the nonextractable
mycolic acids, seems unlikely because they result in an OM
that would be much thicker than what we see by CEMOVIS.
Villeneuve et al. have recently proposed a novel conforma-
tional model of mycolic acids where the meromycolyl chain is
folded upon itself to create a compact structure (54, 55). In this
case, the thickness of a monolayer of mycolic acids corresponds
to the length of mycolic acid short arm, which is unfolded (20
to 26 carbons). Although this model does not contradict our
CEMOVIS data, it is not sufﬁcient to fully explain them. In-
deed, the short arm of M. smegmatis mycolic acids is 22 carbons
long (57), i.e., 20 to 30% longer than phospholipids forming
the PM, whereas the thickness of the PM equals that of the
OM in our data. Likewise, both chains of corynebacterial my-
colic acids should be unfolded, as suggested by the model of
Villeneuve et al.; as mentioned above, these chains have the
same length as the PM phospholipids (16 to 18 carbons),
whereas the OM is thinner than the PM. Thus, even if the
mycobacterial meromycolyl chain is folded and compact, both
the mycobacterial and corynebacterial arabinogalactan-bound
mycolic acids forming the inner leaﬂet of the OM have to be
intercalated to a certain extent with the longest chains of free
lipids (e.g., trehalose mycolate) forming the OM outer leaﬂet
(Fig. 7).
Since we submitted this work for publication, a different
laboratory has published CEMOVIS images and cryo-electron
tomograms of M. smegmatis, M. bovis BCG, and C. glutamicum
(21). Their results are essentially similar to ours, but the mod-
els of the OM of mycobacteria that they propose signiﬁcantly
differ from ours in that the mycolic acids are unfolded. As we
have explained above, we think that the unfolded meromycolic
chain is too long to ﬁt in the OM. Hoffmann and colleagues
have not proposed any model for the OM of corynebacteria.
Future directions and conclusion. In contrast to pictures
from conventional (Fig. 1) and freeze-substitution (39, 40)
techniques, no OL/capsule was seen at the surface of either
mycobacteria or corynebacteria. This situation may be due to
the fact that the components of such a layer would have the
same density as the cryoprotection medium and would there-
fore be undistinguishable from this medium in CEMOVIS
images. On the other hand, in mycobacteria, the capsular con-
stituents are known to be loosely attached to the cell wall and
most of them are found released in the culture ﬂuids of in
vitro-grown bacteria (23, 24, 37, 38), potentially explaining why
they are not visible in our images. When mycobacteria grow
intracellularly, these constituents are conﬁned around the bac-
teria by the phagosomal membrane (9). Techniques were de-
veloped to maintain these constituents around in vitro-grown
cells and visualize them by conventional transmission electron
microscopy (17). Further studies are warranted to address the
issue of the structure of the mycobacterial OL and capsule by
CEMOVIS.
In conclusion, our study brings a new reference structure of
the cell envelope of mycobacteria and corynebacteria. This
should serve as a framework for building new models of the
organization of chemical components in the cell envelope of
mycobacteria. It also provides a basis for analyzing whether the
cell envelope becomes signiﬁcantly modiﬁed when mycobacte-
ria are enclosed within phagosomes in macrophages, a ques-
tion we are currently addressing.
