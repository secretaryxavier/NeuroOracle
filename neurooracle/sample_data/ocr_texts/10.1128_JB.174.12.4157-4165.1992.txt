In this study, the occurrence of repeated DNA sequences in the chromosome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
was investigated systematically. By screening a M. tuberculosis lambda gt-11 gene library with labeled total
chromosomal DNA, five strongly hybridizing recombinants were selected, and these contained DNA sequences
that were present in multiple copies in the chromosome of M. tuberculosis. These recombinants all contained
repeated sequences belonging to a single family of repetitive DNA, which shares homology with a previously
described repeated sequence present in recombinant pPH7301. Sequence analysis of pPH7301 showed the
presence of a 10-bp sequence that was tandemly repeated and invariably separated by 5-bp unique spacer
sequences. Southern blot analysis revealed that the majority of the repeated DNA in M. tuberculosis is
composed of this family of repetitive DNA. Because the 10-bp repeats are slightly heterogeneous in sequence,
we designated this DNA as a major polymorphic tandem repeat, MPTR. The presence of this repeated sequence
in various other mycobacterial species was investigated. Among the MPTR-containing mycobacterial species
the chromosomal location of the repetitive DNA is highly variable. The potential use of this polymorphism in
the epidemiology of mycobacterioses is discussed.
Reiterations of DNA sequences have been found to occur
in the chromosomes of a wide variety of bacteria. Repeated
DNA sequences include genes such as those encoding the
16S and 23S rRNA (5, 18, 36), insertion sequence elements
(20, 25), and short repetitive DNA such as the crossover hot
spot instigator (chi) sequence (32) and repetitive extragenic
palindromic (REP) sequences (35).
Repetitive DNA sequences have also been found in my-
cobacteria. The insertion elements IS900 from Mycobacte-
rium paratuberculosis (4, 12), IS901 from Mycobacterium
avium (19), IS1096 from Mycobacterium smegmatis (2),
IS1081 from Mycobacterium bovis, and the IS3 family of
insertion elements present in the species of the Mycobacte-
rium tuberculosis complex (15, 22, 37) are present in multiple
copies in the mycobacterial chromosome (16, 40). Addition-
ally, unidentified repeated sequences, or repeats which do
not share characteristics with other sequences, have been
found in Mycobacterium leprae (3, 13, 43) and M. tubercu-
losis (6, 14, 15, 27).
The mycobacterial repeated DNA sequences described
above were selected from gene libraries on the basis of their
species specificity or differences in hybridization to particu-
lar DNA probes. However, no systematic study has been
done on the major classes of repetitive DNA in mycobac-
teria.
In this study, we investigated systematically the occur-
rence of repetitive DNA in M. tuberculosis. We show that a
major repetitive DNA in this species belongs to a family
consisting of short tandemly repeated sequences of 10 bp,
separated by 5-bp spacer DNA. Furthermore, we analyzed
the presence of this DNA family in other mycobacterial
species and the potential use of this repetitive DNA for

MATERUILS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditions. The
bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in
Table 1. Plasmid pPH7301 is a pEX2 recombinant contaiqlrng
a 2.4-kb DNA fragment of M. tuberculosis (14). Media,
reagents, and enzymes were used as described by Thole et
al. (38). The culturing of mycobacterial strains and the
isolation of genomic DNA were performed as reported
previously (40).
DNA techniques. The M. tuberculosis lambda gt-11 gene
library from R. A. Young was screened as described by
Young et al. (45). Plaques were transferred to Colony/Plaque
Screen Membranes (Dupont, Boston, Mass.) as described by
Noordhoek et al. (24). Southern blot hybridization proce-
dures (33) were performed as described previously (16).
DNA was radioactively labeled with [ot-32P]dCTP by using
the multiprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham International
plc, Amersham, United Kingdom). DNA was nonradioac-
tively labeled with horseradish peroxidase by using the
enhanced chemiluminescence gene detection system (Amer-
sham). The 181-bp probe TR1 was prepared by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) (14, 28) by using the amplimers
I
(5'CGCCGGTGCCGACGTTGCCC) and F (5'CTCT'TCAA
TGCCGGCAGCTT) and recombinant pPH7301 as target
DNA (see Fig. 3). TR2, which is a trimer of the 10-bp
repeated sequence (5'GCCGGTGTTG), was prepared by
chemical synthesis (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City,
Calif.).
Chromosomal DNA from M. tuberculosis 19 and M. bovis
BCG strain 43 was sheared by passaging the DNA 25 times

through a 26-gauge needle and used as a DNA probe. The
average size of the sheared DNA was 10 kb.
DNA sequencing was performed by using the chain-
termination method (29). The DNA sequencing was initiated
by the pEX vector primers 86.25 (5'GACTCCTGGAGCC
CG) and 17.5.88 (5'AAGCTTGGCTGCAGGTC).
The search for DNA homology (26) within the pPH7301
sequence and homology of pPH7301 with published se-
quences were investigated by using the DNA program
PC/Gene release 6.5 (IntelliGenetics Inc., Mountain View,
Calif.) and the EMBL nucleotide sequence library 26 v.1,
respectively.
Peptide synthesis and ELISA. The peptides rpl, rp2, and
rp3 (see Fig. 4) were prepared by the peptide synthesis
method described by Geysen et al. (11) by using the Epitope
Scanning Kit (Cambridge Research Biochemicals, Cam-
bridge, United Kingdom). The peptides were analyzed by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) by using
monoclonal antibody (MAb) F116-5, which recognizes a 24-
and a 30-kDa protein of M. tuberculosis (41). The synthesis
and ELISA of the peptides were performed as recommended
by the manufacturer.
Nucleotide sequence accession numbers. The sequence data
for the two sequences of pPH7301 are entered in the EMBL,
GenBank, and DDBJ nucleotide sequence data bases under
accession numbers X60430 and X60431.
RESULTS
Systematic investigation of the presence of repetitive DNA in
M. tuberculosis. In order to investigate systematically the
occurrence of repetitive DNA in the chromosome of M.
tuberculosis, fractionated BstEII-digested M. tuberculosis
DNA fragments were hybridized with labeled total chromo-
somal DNA of M. tuberculosis. We assumed that fragments
containing repetitive DNA would hybridize significantly
stronger compared with those fragments containing merely
single copy sequences. As shown in Fig.
la, a limited
number of BstEII fragments hybridized with labeled chro-
mosomal M. tuberculosis DNA, suggesting that these frag-
ments contain DNA which is present in multiple copies in
the M. tuberculosis chromosome. Similar results were ob-
tained with chromosomal DNA from M. bovis BCG (Fig.
lb). In a previous study we showed that pPH7301 contains
repetitive
mycobacterial
DNA,
because
the
insert
of
pPH7301 hybridizes with multiple chromosomal restriction
fragments of M. tuberculosis (14). In order to investigate
whether these strongly hybridizing BstEII fragments contain

the repetitive DNA present in the recombinant pPH7301, we
reprobed the filter carrying the fractionated BstEII frag-
ments with the 2.4-kb EcoRI insert of this plasmid. Surpris-
ingly, most bands hybridizing with the 2.4-kb insert of
pPH7301 were of the same size as the bands which were
strongly hybridizing with
the
total chromosomal DNA
probes (Fig. lc). This result suggests that the repetitive DNA
a
b
c
in recombinant pPH7301 is a major repetitive DNA present
in the chromosome of M. tuberculosis.
To obtain insight in the frequency of occurrence and the
distribution of repetitive DNA in the mycobacterial genome,
a lambda gt-11 M. tuberculosis gene library was screened
with 32P-labeled chromosomal M. tuberculosis DNA as a
probe. About 10% of the mycobacterial DNA-containing
phage strongly hybridized with the labeled M. tuberculosis
DNA. Five strongly hybridizing phage recombinants were
selected, and the DNAs of these clones were used as probes
to hybridize to fractionated BstEII-digested chromosomal
M. tuberculosis DNA. All phage DNA probes hybridized
with multiple BstEII fragments of M. tuberculosis, and the
majority of the hybridizing BstEII fragments corresponded
in size to the fragments which appeared after hybridization
with the insert of pPH7301 (Fig. 2), strengthening the idea
that this insert contains a major repetitive DNA in M.
tuberculosis.
We also investigated the presence of such repetitive DNA
in M. bovis BCG, M. kansasii, and M. fortuitum. The
banding pattern of M. bovis BCG was identical to that of M.
tuberculosis, indicating that M. bovis BCG is virtually iden-
tical to M. tuberculosis with respect to the presence and
location of this major repetitive DNA. M. kansasii DNA
fragments hybridized weakly with the lambda gt-11 inserts,
and fragments of M. fortuitum did not hybridize with these
DNA probes (Fig. 2).
Characterization of the M. tuberculosis DNA insert in
recombinant pPH7301. In order to characterize the repetitive
DNA which is present in pPH7301, we sequenced 526 and
268 bp of the left and right ends, respectively, of the 2.4-kb
DNA insert of this recombinant (Fig. 3). Both sequences
contained multiple repeats of 10 bp, interspaced by 5-bp
nonrepetitive sequences. Any of the 10-bp repeats shared at
least six bases. On the basis of the maximum sequence
homology, we derived the following consensus sequence for
the 10-bp repeat: 5'GCCGGTGTTG. A search in the EMBL
DNA data library revealed a striking homology of this

consensus 1O-bp sequence with M. tuberculosis sequences
located downstream from the 65-kDa heat shock protein
gene (31). This DNA region was found to contain three
clusters of 10-bp repeats, each of which shares at least five
bases with the consensus sequence of the tandem repeat of
pPH7301. As in pPH7301, the 10-bp repeats were separated
by 5-bp spacer DNA. Furthermore, we found that the 10-bp
consensus repeat (5'GCCGGTG1TG) shares significant ho-
mology with the recombination signal chi (5'GG.TfiLTGG)
and
the
REP
sequences
[5'GC (Gff)GiAICG(G/A)

the chromosome of Escherichia coli (32).
The

DNA-containing
recombinant
plasmid
pPH7301 is a derivative of a lambda gt-11 recombinant that
was originally selected because of its reactivity with the
MAb F116-5 (14), Wvhich recognizes a 24- and a 30-kDa
protein ofM. tuberculosis (41). The M. tuberculosis DNA in
pPH7301 located immediately downstream of the cro-lacZ
gene has been used as a target sequence in PCR. About 15%
of the M. tuberculosis strains investigated were negative in
PCR, and we have shown that these strains lacked the
chromosomal DNA fragment corresponding to the cloned
M. tuberculosis DNA fragment immediately downstream of
the cro-lacZ gene and adjacent to the repeated DNA in
pPH7301 (14). Yet these M. tuberculosis strains were shown

the MAb F116-5 (data not shown). These data suggest that
the 24- and 30-kDa proteins are not encoded by the myco-
bacterial DNA downstream of cro-lacZ and that the epitope
recognized by the MAb F116-5 in E. coli carrying pPH7301
was artificially created by the fusion of cro-lacZ with the
mycobacterial DNA insert. To investigate this possibility,
we mapped the epitope by determining the reactivity of
F116-5 with three overlapping synthetic peptides which
correspond to the translated DNA sequence at the junction
of the cro-lacZ gene and the M.
tuberculosis DNA in
pPH7301 (Fig. 4). The results showed that at least three
cro-lacZ-derived amino acids in the epitope are essential for
the recognition by MAb F116-5. We conclude that the fusion
protein expressed by pPH7301 contains an artificially cre-
ated epitope recognized by MAb F116-5 as a result of the
fusion of cro-lacZ and the mycobacterial DNA present in
pPH7301.
Identification of a MPTR from M. tuberculosis. To investi-
gate whether the 10-bp repeat present in pPH7301 was
responsible for the characteristic patterns of hybridizing
repetitive chromosomal DNA, fractionated BstEII-digested
M. tuberculosis DNA fragments were hybridized with a
181-bp pPH7301 fragment, which was obtained by PCR
amplification with the amplimers
I and F (Fig. 3). This
fragment is composed of 12 10-bp repeats separated by 5-bp
spacer sequences. The result shown in Fig. 5 demonstrates
that all bands hybridizing with the 181-bp probe correspond
to those hybridizing with the 2.4-kb insert of pPH7301,
indicating that the 10-bp-repeat-containing DNA is indeed a
major repetitive DNA in M. tuberculosis. This assumption
was confirmed by the hybridization of M. tuberculosis DNA
fragments with synthetic DNA probe TR2, which is com-
posed of a trimer of the consensus 10-bp repeated sequence
(5'GCCGGTGTTG) (Fig. 5c). We conclude that the 10-bp
repetitive DNA element with the consensus sequence 5'GC
CGGTGTTG is a major repetitive DNA in the M. tubercu-
losis chromosome. Because this sequence is polymorphic
and tandemly present in the chromosome ofM. tuberculosis,
we designated it as a major polymorphic tandem repeat,
MPTR.
Occurrence of the MPTR among different mycobacterial
species. In our previous study, we have shown that DNA
homologous to the insert of pPH7301 is present in the M.

FIG. 5. Characterization of the M. tuberculosis repeated DNA sequence present in the recombinant plasmid pPH7301 by Southern blot

364 (lane 4), and M. gordonae strains 358 (lane 5) and 359 (lane 6) were hybridized with the 2.4-kb EcoRI insert of pPH7301 (a), the 181-bp

tuberculosis complex species, M. gordonae, and M. kan-
sasii, and not in the mycobacterial species M. avium, M.
fortuitum, M.
intracellulare, M.
scrofulaceum,
and M.
smegmatis (14). To assess whether the MPTR sequence is
indeed present in M. gordonae and M. kansasii, digested
DNA of these species was hybridized with the MPTR-
containing probes described in the previous section. The
results show that hybridization with the 181-bp probe and
the 30-bp synthetic trimer consensus probe results in the
same
banding
patterns
as
hybridization
with
labeled
pPH7301 DNA (Fig. 5). We conclude that repetitive DNA in
M. gordonae and M. kansasii indeed shares sequence ho-
mology with the MPTR consensus sequence of M. tubercu-
losis.
In order to determine the occurrence of the MPTR among
members of the genus Mycobacterium more extensively, we
tested 23 other mycobacterial species (Table 1). Southern
blot analysis revealed the presence of MPTR-homologous
DNA only in M. asiaticum, M. gastri and M. szulgai,
whereas chromosomal DNA from the other 20 mycobacte-
rial species did not hybridize with the probe (data not
shown). Interestingly, all mycobacterial species containing
MPTR-homologous DNA belong to a subgroup of slowly
growing mycobacteria, which are naturally sensitive to ri-
fampin.
DNA polymorphism of MPTR-containing restriction frag-
ments in various mycobacterial species. In order to investigate
a possible restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
in MPTR-containing chromosomal DNA of the different
mycobacterial species of the M. tuberculosis complex, we
analyzed several strains of each species. Previous findings
have shown little RFLP among pPH7301-containing BstEII
fragments of the M. tuberculosis complex strains (14, 16).
Use of the restriction enzyme BssHII resulted in more RFLP
and, therefore, this enzyme was used to investigate the
RFLP of a number of M. tuberculosis complex strains. The
results show little RFLP among the species M. tuberculosis,
M. africanum, and M. bovis BCG (Fig. 6), although the
DNA fingerprints observed by using the IS986-based DNA
probe (16) were highly polymorphic, indicating a low degree
of similarity among these strains (data not shown). How-
ever, the three M. africanum strains differed from the other
M tuberculosis complex strains in the absence of a 5.5-kb
BssHII fragment. This suggests that this difference might be
used to distinguish M. africanum from the other M. tuber-
culosis complex species.
In addition, we investigated the MPTR-containing myco-
bacterial species which do not belong to the M. tuberculosis
complex. Figure 7a shows the RFLP analysis of various
strains of M. gastri, M. kansasii, M. szulgai and M. gordo-
nae. Among each species different multiple banding patterns
were observed. Each of the two M. gastri strains and the
three M. szulgai strains showed a different hybridization
pattern with the MPTR probe. Furthermore, among 17 M.
kansasii strains 7 different banding patterns were obtained,
whereas 12 of the 14 M. gordonae DNA fingerprints were
different (Fig. 7).
DNA fingerprinting ofM. kansasii and M. gordonae strains.
Because both M. gordonae and M. kansasii showed a high
degree of polymorphism in the MPTR-containing restriction
fragments, the potential value of the MPTR probe for use in
the epidemiology of both mycobacterial species was exam-
ined. We analyzed 12 M. gordonae strains, which were
obtained from regional health laboratories in the period of
January
to September
1990. These
strains revealed
six
different RFLP types (Fig. 8). Interestingly, the different M.

gordonae RFLP types were associated with biochemical
characteristics. The strains with the RFLP type Gl (lanes 3,
6, and 12 of Fig. 8) were isoniazid resistant and urease
negative, whereas the strains with the RFLP types G2 and
G3
(lanes 5,
7 and
10, and
8, 9 and 11 of Figure 8,
respectively) were INH sensitive and urease negative, and
isoniazid sensitive and urease positive, respectively (26a).
In addition to the M. kansasii strains described in the
previous section, we fingerprinted an additional set of 19
strains with 12 different phage types (Fig. 9) (7, 8). Nine
different fingerprint patterns were distinguished among these
strains.
Generally,
strains with a particular phage type
displayed
identical
fingerprints.
Interestingly,
strains of
RFLP type Kl, which was predominantly present among the
M. kansasii strains, belong to six different phage types. This
indicates that strains with RFLP type Kl belong to a
heterogeneous group, which can be subdivided by phage
typing.
DISCUSSION
Previous studies have shown that M. tuberculosis contains
various repetitive DNA sequences, hybridizing with multiple
chromosomal restriction fragments ofM. tuberculosis (6, 14,
27). In addition, M. tuberculosis usually contains various
copies of an IS3-like insertion element (16, 22, 37, 40). This
element is the only well-characterized repetitive sequence in
M. tuberculosis. These repeated DNA sequences were iso-
lated from M. tuberculosis gene libraries because of their
strong signal in hybridization assays.
In this study, we have investigated systematically the
major repetitive DNA families in M. tuberculosis. We ob-
tained various lines of evidence indicating that the repetitive
DNA present in recombinant pPH7301 is a major type of
repetitive DNA in M. tuberculosis. First, the majority of the
M.
tuberculosis fragments that strongly hybridized with

labeled total chromosomal DNA of M. tuberculosis were
found to hybridize also with pPH7301 DNA. Second, about
10% of the lambda gt-11 recombinants of M. tuberculosis
strongly hybridized with chromosomal DNA, indicating the
presence of repetitive DNA in these clones. Five of these
clones were analyzed, and all five appeared to contain
inserts that hybridized with the same M. tuberculosis frag-
ments as pPH7301. Assuming that these five clones contain
inserts from different parts of the chromosome, we conclude
that this repetitive DNA is present at many different loca-
tions on the chromosome of M. tuberculosis. The genomic
size ofM. tuberculosis is 4,000 kb (1). Supposing an average
DNA insert of 5 kb in the M. tuberculosis lambda gt-11 gene
library and a nonbiased representation of the M. tuberculosis
genome among the lambda gt-11 recombinants, one could
expect the presence of approximately 80 different MPTR-
containing regions in the genome of M. tuberculosis.
Recombinant pPH7301 was originally selected from the
M. tuberculosis lambda gt-11 gene library on the basis of the
expression of a 0-galactosidase fusion protein that reacted
with MAb F116-5 (14). This antibody recognizes two poly-
peptides of 24 and 30 kDa in M. tuberculosis (41). In this
study, we showed by epitope mapping that the epitope
expressed by pPH7301 was artificially created because of the
fusion of cro-lacZ with a M. tuberculosis DNA fragment,
and presumably, this recombinant does not encode for the
24- or the 30-kDa polypeptide. Similarly, Thole and col-
leagues have described the selection of a lambda gt-11
recombinant reactive with a MAb recognizing the M. leprae
36-kDa antigen. Detailed analysis of this recombinant also
showed that the antibody reacted with an artificially created
epitope at the junction of cro-lacZ and a M. leprae DNA
fragment, which shared homology with a natural epitope of
the 36-kDa M. leprae antigen (39).
Sequence analysis of the M. tuberculosis DNA insert in
pPH7301 revealed the presence of two clusters of short,
phagetype

tandemly repeated sequences. These short repeats are 10 bp
in length and they share at least a 6-bp homology. The 10-bp
repeats were invariably found to be separated by 5-bp spacer
DNA sequences which do not share mutual homology.
Hybridization of chromosomal DNA with a labeled synthetic
trimer of the 10-bp repeated sequence showed that the
majority of the repeated DNA in M. tuberculosis is com-
posed of such sequences. Because these repeats are slightly
heterogeneous in sequence, we designated this DNA as a
MPTR.
Comparison of the consensus MPTR sequence, 5'GCCG
GTG1TG, with the EMBL sequence data library revealed
the presence of multiple MPTRs in a previously cloned M.
tuberculosis fragment which is located in an open reading
frame of 1,551 bp downstream from the 65-kDa heat shock
protein gene (31). Again the 10-bp repeat was invariably
spaced by stretches of 5 bp. The repeats are located within
the 1,551-bp open reading frame and result in a translated
sequence containing the repeat X-Gly-Asp-Y-Gly. Shinnick
concluded that these repeats possibly represent immuno-
dominant epitopes, which may play a role in the immune
response to mycobacteria (31). Since this repetitive peptide
motif is inherent to the MPTR structure and probably is
present at many locations in the chromosome of M. tuber-
culosis, it is feasible that this DNA does not code for a
functional protein and plays no direct role in the immune
response to mycobacteria. Therefore, further investigation
on the relevance of this putative protein in immunogenicity
is necessary.
The MPTR consensus sequence also showed significant
homology with the DNA sequence chi, a prokaryotic signal
for homologous recombination present in bacteriophage

lambda and E. coli (32). Although chi is repetitively present
in the E. coli chromosome, this sequence is not known to be
present in tandem arrays (21). Interestingly, minisatellite
DNA sequences that occur in tandem arrays also share
similarity with chi (17), suggesting that the MPTR arrays
may be minisatellitelike sequences present in the M. tuber-
culosis chromosome. Although speculative, the similarity of
the MPTR sequence with chi might implicate a function as a
signal for recombination. Additionally, we observed se-
quence homology of the MPTR consensus with the REP
sequences of E. coli. REP sequences are responsible for
differential stability of different segments of mRNA within
an operon as a consequence of the palindromic secondary
structures formed in mRNA (23, 35). Recently, the protein
binding capacity of REP sequences has been investigated.
The histonelike protein HU and the enzyme gyrase are
capable to bind REP in vitro (44). The repetitive nature and
the partial homology with these sequences suggest that the
MPTR could be a protein binding site in the chromosome of
M. tuberculosis and possibly involved in regulatory func-
tions such as regulation of gene expression and structural
organization of the bacterial chromosome (35, 44).
This study confirmed our previous observations that the
MPTR
is present
in
all species of the M.
tuberculosis
complex and that the different isolates of these species
usually show little polymorphism in the MPTR-containing
restriction fragments (14). By using the restriction enzyme
BssHII, a 5.5-kb fragment was found to be present only in
strains of M. tuberculosis, M. bovis, and M. bovis BCG,
whereas the M. africanum strains lacked such a fragment.
This suggests that MPTR DNA might be a useful, additional
tool to differentiate M. afticanum from other M. tuberculosis
complex species, which
is very
difficult by phenotypic
analysis.
Analysis of the presence of MPTR-homologous DNA
among various mycobacterial species other than M. tuber-
culosis revealed the occurrence of homologous repetitive
DNA in M. gordonae, M. kansasii, M. asiaticum, M. gastri,
and M. szulgai. The presence of MPTR-homologous DNA
among these mycobacterial species suggests an evolutionary
relationship among these mycobacterial
species. This
is
consistent with the phylogenetic relationship of these spe-
cies based on the homology of the 16S rRNA sequences as
described by Stahl and Urbance (34). Surprisingly, although
the M. avium complex bacteria belong to this group of
taxonomically closely related mycobacteria (on the basis of
16S rRNA homology), they do not contain MPTR-homolo-
gous DNA.
In contrast to the banding patterns of MPTR-containing
restriction fragments in M. tuberculosis complex, strains of
M. gordonae and M.
kansasii were found to be highly
polymorphic. Therefore, DNA fingerprinting with MPTR
DNA as a probe seems a useful tool to differentiate various
isolates of these species. Although several reports suggest
the clinical relevance of M. gordonae (9, 10), the pathoge-
nicity of this organism remains obscure (42). In contrast, it is
established that M. kansasii can be highly pathogenic in men
and
is
isolated from patients with and without clinical
symptoms (30). Therefore, the DNA fingerprint technique
might be useful in studying the epidemiology of this species.
Phage typing has been used to subtype M. kansasii strains
(7, 8), and comparison of this method with DNA fingerprint-
ing showed that strains with a given phage type can often be
differentiated because of their RFLPs. We conclude that
DNA fingerprinting can potentially be of great use in the
epidemiology of M. gordonae and M. kansasii.
