Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) has been linked to cognitive symptoms of
schizophrenia, which has been documented in previous reviews by several authors.
However, a trend has recently emerged in this ﬁeld moving from studying schizophrenia
as a disease to studying psychosis as a group. This review article focuses on recent
BDNF studies in relation to cognition in human subjects during different stages of the
psychotic process, including subjects at high risk of developing psychosis, patients at
their ﬁrst episode of psychosis, and patients with chronic schizophrenia. We aim to
provide an update of BDNF as a biomarker of cognitive function on human subjects with
schizophrenia or earlier stages of psychosis, covering new trends, controversies, current
research gaps, and suggest potential future developments in the ﬁeld. We found that
most of current research regarding BDNF and cognitive symptoms in psychosis is done
around schizophrenia as a disease. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the study of the
relationship between BDNF and cognitive symptoms to psychotic illnesses of different
stages and origins.

INTRODUCTION
Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is the most widely distributed neurotrophin in the
brain and it has been associated with several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and
other psychotic disorders. The relationship between BDNF and cognitive symptoms in patients
with schizophrenia has been described in previous reviews by several authors (1–5), including one
from our group (6).
The search for molecular biomarkers of cognition has been an important ﬁeld of research in
patients with schizophrenia, in which BDNF has been identiﬁed as one of the main ones, along
with others such as inﬂammatory markers (2). The molecular pathways involved in schizophrenia
form complex and interconnected networks, where BDNF is one of the points where diﬀerent
risk factors converge (7). It should be noted that BDNF has been investigated as a diagnostic

or prognostic biomarker in various psychiatric pathologies,
including schizophrenia, but also depression, bipolar disorder, as
well as anxiety disorders. It has been related in these pathologies
with diﬀerent symptomatic domains, including the cognitive, but
also the emotional and social domains, so it would not be a
pathognomonic or speciﬁc marker of any particular disorder or
symptomatic group (8).
In the literature there are studies on BDNF both in animal
models and in human beings, including healthy subjects and
patients with any of the mentioned diagnoses. Methods to
approach the study of BDNF in patients include measuring
the level of this protein in plasma or blood serum (9) or
studying variations at the genetic level. Some single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNP), such the Val66Met polymorphism,
have been associated both with decreased neurocognitive
function in healthy adults and with clinical aspects of various
psychiatric disorders. Research on this polymorphism has
increased signiﬁcantly in the last decade, and several studies
have related it to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia,
psychotic symptomatology, cognition, eﬃcacy and side-eﬀects
of antipsychotic drugs (3, 10). Considering that recently some
research projects are no longer studying categorial diagnoses
such as schizophrenia, but syndromes such as psychosis (11), it
is important to update the review of the relationship between
BDNF and cognition in psychotic patients.
In this narrative review we aim to provide an update of
BDNF as a biomarker of cognition on human subjects during
diﬀerent stages of the psychotic process, covering new trends,
controversies, current research gaps, and suggest potential future
developments in the ﬁeld.
METHODS
We performed a search in the Medline/PubMed database with
the terms BDNF, schizophrenia and cognitive/cognition. We
then repeated the search replacing the word schizophrenia with
psychosis. A total of 280 articles were found in the ﬁrst case
(schizophrenia), while 87 in the second (psychosis). With the
aim of updating our previous review published in 2013 without
repeating what had been already reported, we selected articles
that were published during the last seven years (2013–2020,
including those available only as Epub in 2020). Therefore,
we had two lists of 237 and 64 articles that were selected for
further review, although many of the “psychosis” articles were
already included in the “schizophrenia” articles list. Among all
of these, we selected articles on BDNF and cognitive function
in human subjects with psychosis/schizophrenia that contained
information of BDNF gene (such as Val66Met polymorphism)
or BDNF peripheral levels (plasma or serum). No standardized
approach was used since our aim was to produce a narrative
review. We only included articles that were available in English.
Animal studies were excluded in order to keep the focus and
length of this mini review article within limits.
In order to organize our ﬁndings, recent BDNF studies in
human subjects were classiﬁed into one of three diﬀerent stages
of the psychotic process: subjects at high risk of developing
psychosis, patients at their ﬁrst episode of psychosis, and
patients with chronic schizophrenia. These are the following
subsections that readers will ﬁnd in this article. Since the
latter has more information available, the chronic schizophrenia
subsection has been further divided into pharmacological and
non-pharmacological interventions.
IN SUBJECTS AT HIGH RISK OF
DEVELOPING PSYCHOSIS
We found three recent studies that investigated the relationship
between peripheral blood levels of BDNF and cognition in
subjects at risk of developing psychosis. One of these groups (12)
carried out a cross-sectional study in patients who were in one
of three possible stages of the disease, including “at-risk mental
state” (ARMS). They found higher BDNF levels in patients with
chronic schizophrenia, intermediate levels in patients with a ﬁrst
psychotic episode, and lower levels in ARMS. These ﬁndings
suggest a possible drop in BDNF levels prior to the onset of
psychosis. In this study, plasma BDNF levels were related to some
cognitive functions in all groups such as the ability to plan.
Sanada et al. (13) studied another population of subjects
considered at risk of developing psychosis, according to the
criteria of “ultra-high risk” (UHR), and found lower BDNF levels
in this UHR group in comparison to a group of healthy control
subjects. They found no relationship between plasma BDNF
levels and the cognitive domains studied, neither in UHR nor in
the group of healthy subjects. After a period of follow-up, they
observed that BDNF levels in UHR subjects persisted at similar
levels for at least 6 months (13).
Consistently, He et al. (14) reported lower levels of plasma
BDNF in a group of “clinical high-risk” (CHR) subjects, in this
case in comparison to patients with ﬁrst episode psychosis. In
this study, the CHR subjects had lower levels of both mature
BDNF (mBDNF) and precursor BDNF (proBDNF), as well as
lower levels of receptors in BDNF pathways: TrkB and p75NTR.
They also found a weak negative relationship between TrkB levels
and scores in the Stroop Color-Word Test.
It should be mentioned that in subjects who have not
developed a psychotic episode, but who present schizotypal
personality traits, it has been observed that the Val66Met
polymorphism of BDNF can aﬀect learning ability. In the study
by Skilleter et al. (15), participants with the BDNF Met allele and
with higher schizotypal traits showed poorer learning ability.
IN PATIENTS WITH FIRST EPISODE
PSYCHOSIS
Recently, publications on the relationship of BDNF and cognition
in patients with ﬁrst episode psychosis (FEP) have focused on
drug-naïve patients. Xiao et al. (16) studied a group of 58
patients without exposure to antipsychotics and a control group,
ﬁnding that the patients had poorer cognitive performance in
almost all the neurocognitive tests they used. However, BDNF
levels were inversely correlated with some tests (TMT part B),
and positively with others (VTF-action). It is worth mentioning
that these ﬁndings stood in the same direction when studying
the correlations of these cognitive tests with the levels of

another neurotrophin (“Glial cell line - derived neurotrophic
factor,” GDNF).
Man et al. (17) recruited a group of 80 patients with FEP
and no exposure to antipsychotic treatment. They reported lower
BDNF levels in patients compared to control group subjects, as
well as a lower neurocognitive performance in patients in almost
all the cognitive domains studied (except the index of visuospatial
ability). They found no relationship between BDNF levels and
the results of cognitive evaluations. However, they reported
that the negative subscale of the PANSS (Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale) was negatively correlated with the indices of
immediate memory and language. In accordance with this, the
Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF has also been related to the
clinical characteristics of the patients (predominance of positive
or negative symptoms) in a genetic study in treatment-naïve
patients (18).
Recently, Wu et al. (19) investigated the eﬀect of risperidone
monotherapy on cognitive impairment in drug-naïve ﬁrst-
episode of psychosis patients (DNFE) and whether BDNF levels
were correlated to improvement of cognition. They found that
lower BDNF levels were correlated with delayed memory in
DNFE patients with high baseline BDNF levels. After 12 weeks
of treatment, risperidone signiﬁcantly improved immediate
memory, delayed memory and RBANS total scores and BDNF
levels were slightly increased. In patients with low baseline
BDNF, BDNF levels were signiﬁcantly increased after risperidone
treatment, while in patients with high baseline BDNF, BDNF
levels were signiﬁcantly decreased. In addition, baseline BDNF
levels were associated with improvement of delayed memory
and were a prognostic factor for the improvement of delayed
memory and RBANS total score in patients with high baseline
BDNF levels.
Xiu et al. (20) suggested that interrelationships between BDNF
and antioxidant mechanisms might underlie the pathological
mechanisms of cognitive impairments and symptomatology in
DNFE patients with schizophrenia. In their study, DNFE patients
had reduced levels of BDNF compared with healthy controls,
and BDNF levels were positively correlated with copper/zinc-
containing superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in patients.
Moreover, an interactive eﬀect of BDNF levels and manganese-
SOD activity was associated with attentional index score in
the patients. In a diﬀerent study, Qu et al. (21) found that
the manganese-SOD was signiﬁcantly correlated with attention,
language and RBANS total scores, but only in male patients.
Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the interaction
between BDNF and manganese-SOD was associated with RBANS
language index score in male patients. Previously, Wei et al. (22)
showed that an interaction between BDNF and oxidative damage
is involved in the disruption of executive function in patients with
chronic schizophrenia.
Other studies in patients with FEP that have failed to ﬁnd an
association between BDNF and cognitive symptoms, have instead
found an association between BDNF and negative symptoms.
This is the case of the study by Mezquida et al. (23), which found a
relationship between the Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF and
the severity of negative symptoms. Additionally, low BDNF has
been related to depressive symptoms in schizophrenia (24).
Some studies on FEP patients that also looked for and found
no relationship with cognitive symptoms, found a relationship
with a history of abuse in childhood. Theleritis et al. (25)
found a signiﬁcant eﬀect of a history of separation, physical
abuse, and sexual abuse on BDNF levels, with lower levels
in those who experienced the traumatic event compared to
those who did not. These ﬁndings suggest a possible role for
BDNF in the onset of psychosis in individuals exposed to early
trauma, which proposes it as a potential biomarker of the
deleterious eﬀects of childhood trauma on brain plasticity (25).
Additive eﬀects between childhood trauma and BDNF Val66Met
polymorphism Met carriers have been found on volume loss
of the hippocampal subregions cornu ammonis (CA)4/dentate
gyrus and CA2/3 in schizophrenia patients (26). This might be
related to the methylation of BDNF gene in association with
childhood maltreatment reported in schizophrenia patients by
Barker et al. (27).
Other authors, such as Yang et al. (28), have recruited both
FEP patients and chronic schizophrenia patients in their study.
They found signiﬁcant correlations between BDNF levels and
partial cognitive dimensions such as visual learning, memory and
processing speed.
IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC
SCHIZOPHRENIA
In patients with chronic schizophrenia, cognitive deﬁcits have
been related to various factors, including the severity of psychotic
symptoms, age, medication, as well as BDNF levels. Atake et al.
(29) studied the associations between these variables in a group
of patients, observing that the levels of BDNF in serum were
correlated with working memory, attention, processing speed,
motor function, and executive function. A recent meta-analysis
of BDNF levels and cognitive impairment in schizophrenia (30),
that included 21 studies that accounted for a total 2,449 patients
with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, found that BDNF levels
were modestly but signiﬁcantly related to cognitive functioning.
Considering cognitive domains, BDNF levels were signiﬁcantly
associated with verbal memory, working memory, processing
speed and verbal ﬂuency performances.
Ahmed et al. (31) had previously performed two separate
meta-analysis, considering both BDNF gene and levels. In the
ﬁrst one they studied the association between the Val66Met
polymorphism and neurocognition in people with schizophrenia,
and found non-signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the genotype
groups on most neurocognitive domains. In the second one
they studied the association between cognition and peripheral
expression of BDNF, and found minimal yet signiﬁcant
correlations for the reasoning and problem-solving domains.
A key neural circuit for cognitive control, such as the
connectivity between the anterior cingular cortex (ACC) and
prefrontal regions (PFC), has been found to be inﬂuenced
by the Val66Met polymorphism (32), suggesting a possible
mechanism connecting cognitive symptoms to genetic and
environmental risk factors of schizophrenia. Regarding the study
of relationships between genetic polymorphisms of the BDNF

Nieto et al.
BDNF and Cognition in Psychosis
gene and cognitive alterations in patients with schizophrenia,
it should be noted that this has been done not only with the
Val66Met polymorphism (also known as rs6265 or G196A),
but also with other polymorphisms (with positive results for
rs12273539 and rs10835210). The latter showed a signiﬁcant
eﬀect speciﬁcally at the language level (33).
Male patients with schizophrenia, compared to female
patients, have shown worse results on some tests of immediate
and delayed memory. Accordingly, these male patients have
shown lower levels of BDNF than these female patients. A
positive relationship of BDNF with immediate memory and
with the total score of the RBANS cognitive battery has been
observed in female patients, but not in men (34). It should
be noted that, in the same study, in the healthy control group
no diﬀerences were observed between men and women in
the cognitive outcomes, nor in BDNF levels, neither in the
BDNF/cognition relationship. Studies that have delved into the
relationship between the Val66Met polymorphism of BDNF and
cognition separating groups of men and women have also found
gender-speciﬁc associations. In female patients with the Val
allele, shorter reaction times and fewer correct responses were
observed both in the continuous performance test (CPT) and
in the trail making test (TMT parts A and B). However, these
associations between Val allele and cognition were not evident
in male patients (35).
Patients with an earlier age of onset have shown more negative
symptoms and cognitive deﬁcits, as well as lower levels of
serum BDNF. In these patients, negative symptoms partially
mediated the relationship between age of onset and cognitive
deﬁcits, which was moderated by serum BDNF and Val66Met
polymorphism, since the mediating eﬀect of negative symptoms
exhibited a Met allele dose-dependent tendency (36).
In a study carried out in patients with paranoid subtype
schizophrenia, it was observed that the majority of these
patients showed some degree of cognitive impairment, but with
considerable variability between diﬀerent individuals. Among
these patients, those with lower concentrations of BDNF had
lower processing speed (37). Tang et al. (38) studied a group
of patients with deﬁcit schizophrenia and found that BDNF
levels were lower in those patients in comparison to non-deﬁcit
schizophrenia, although not signiﬁcantly.
In patients with chronic schizophrenia who have presented
tardive dyskinesia (TD) during their evolution, lower levels
of BDNF have been observed than in patients without this
complication. Likewise, in patients with TD, worse results have
been found in various cognitive evaluations, including immediate
memory. Interestingly, BDNF levels correlate negatively with
immediate memory in patients with TD, but positively in patients
without this complication, which may imply diﬀerent underlying
neurobiological mechanisms (39).
Li et al. (40) studied the relationship between serum BDNF
levels and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients
comorbid with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They found
that schizophrenia patients with T2DM had signiﬁcantly higher
serum BDNF levels than schizophrenia patients without T2DM.
Also, schizophrenia patients with T2DM scored higher in
delayed memory than schizophrenia patients without T2DM.
The authors suggested that the increase of BDNF levels and
better cognitive performance, particularly delayed memory, may
be related to the pathophysiological process of T2DM in chronic
schizophrenia patients.
In Relation to Pharmacological Treatment
In patients diagnosed with schizophrenia in monotherapy
with an atypical antipsychotic, positive correlations have been
observed between BDNF levels in serum and scores for verbal
memory, attention, and processing speed (41). The same group,
in a separate publication, addresses patients with schizophrenia
speciﬁcally on aripiprazole treatment, ﬁnding an association
between BDNF levels and the cognitive domains of memory and
verbal learning, verbal ﬂuency, and executive function (42).
Regarding the treatment of patients with schizophrenia who
suﬀer an acute relapse, Zhang et al. (43) prospectively studied
the evolution of a group of patients treated with olanzapine.
During the decompensation of their disease, these patients had
worse cognitive results than a control group, as well as lower
BDNF levels. After a 12-week treatment period, the patients
improved in terms of positive and negative symptoms (according
to PANSS), improved some cognitive parameters (immediate
memory, attention, and total score of the RBANS cognitive
battery), and had an increase in levels plasma levels of BDNF.
Correlation analyzes showed that this increase in BDNF levels
was correlated with the change in the cognitive score described.
Koola et al. (44) proposed that the galantamine-memantine
combination may concurrently improve BDNF, oxidative stress,
antioxidant, and anti-inﬂammatory biomarkers. Considering the
interaction between BDNF and oxidative stress in schizophrenia,
and the association of oxidative stress with positive, negative
and cognitive symptoms, they suggested that antipsychotic-
galantamine-memantine combination may provide a novel
strategy in schizophrenia to treat positive, negative and
cognitive symptoms.
In recent decades there has been growing concern about the
metabolic eﬀects of atypical antipsychotics, which may have an
impact on cognitive dysfunction. It has been observed that those
patients with chronic schizophrenia on long-term treatment with
olanzapine and who suﬀer metabolic syndrome have lower scores
in both immediate and delayed memory, attention, and total
score in the RBANS battery, as well as lower levels of BDNF (45).
More recently, Tang et al. (46) hypothesized that omega-
3 fatty acids may be of value in enhancing BDNF levels and
improving cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia
with metabolic syndrome (MetS). They recruited 80 patients
with both schizophrenia and MetS who received long-term
olanzapine monotherapy, and found a signiﬁcant correlation
between omega-3 fatty acid treatment and enhanced delayed
memory factor in the RBANS assessment when the patients
completed this study. They found that along with cognitive
improvement, omega-3 fatty acids enhanced BDNF levels
in these patients. Guo et al. (47) showed that omega-3
fatty acids improve cognitive impairments through Ser133
phosphorylation of CREB, upregulating BDNF/TrkB signal in
patients with schizophrenia.

BDNF and Cognition in Psychosis
In Relation to Non-pharmacological
Treatments
Several studies have investigated the relationship between non-
pharmacological interventions and peripheral BDNF levels in
patients with schizophrenia. A recent meta-analysis, which
included both initiatives based on cognitive training and others
based on physical exercise, found that BDNF levels were
increased in patients participating in these types of non-
pharmacological interventions (48).
Regarding the eﬀect of cognitive rehabilitation, Fisher et
al. (49) showed that participants in computerized auditory
training had signiﬁcant improvements in global cognition,
processing speed, learning, and verbal memory. These patients
had lower than normal BDNF levels before starting training,
that increased signiﬁcantly during training to reach normal
levels post-intervention (compared to a control group). Penadés
et al. (50) also showed that patients with schizophrenia
who participated in a neurocognitive rehabilitation study had
signiﬁcant improvements in cognition and quality of life, but did
not detect signiﬁcant changes in BDNF levels in the whole group.
They related this ﬁnding to genetic variants of the Val66Met
polymorphism of BDNF, observing that the Val/Val patients
had signiﬁcant increases in BDNF levels in relation to this
intervention. Serum BDNF has been suggested as a predictor of
response to neuroplasticity-based cognitive training in a recent
review by Biagianti et al. (51).
Studies of galvanic skin response biofeedback training in
schizophrenia patients have also found a statistically signiﬁcant
increase in BDNF serum levels after a 3-month follow-up period
(52). A study protocol has been reported for measuring BDNF
levels in schizophrenia patients undergoing yoga therapy, but
results have not yet been published (53).
Regarding the eﬀects of physical exercise, several studies have
shown both an improvement in the performance of various
cognitive tests and signiﬁcant increases in BDNF levels. Many
of these studies have found a positive correlation between this
increase in BDNF and cognitive improvement, suggesting a
molecular mechanism for the clinical eﬀect. However, some
studies have not observed this relationship, so it might be
still premature to draw deﬁnitive conclusions about this issue
(54, 55). While aerobic exercise related cognitive beneﬁts have
been linked to BDNF upregulation, this putative mechanism
needs conﬁrmation (56). Holmen et al. (57) found an association
between cardiorespiratory ﬁtness and cognition in schizophrenia
patients, but they did not ﬁnd evidence of BDNF mediating this
association. The study with the largest sample to date (58) found
that BDNF mRNA was positively associated with both physical
activity and cognitive functioning. A smaller but more recent
study by Massa et al. (59) found that an increase in BDNF levels
after 12 weeks of aerobic training was associated with a signiﬁcant
increase in reasoning and problem solving.
Some authors have suggested to combine the eﬀects of
physical exercise and cognitive training to obtain better results
(60, 61), based on the promise that each of these strategies
has individually represented for the improvement of cognitive
deﬁcits in patients with schizophrenia. Starting aerobic exercise
in close temporal proximity with cognitive remediation strategies
may allow the brain to better achieve a state prone to
neuroplasticity, facilitating the improvement of neurocognitive
functions. Li et al. (62) suggested coupling physical exercise with
dietary glucose supplement for treating cognitive impairment in
schizophrenia. There is not enough clinical evidence yet, only
pilot studies, but future studies are expected to incorporate these
promising strategies. As Jahshan et al. (63) have explained, given
that cognitive remediation may depend on intact neuroplasticity
to produce cognitive gains, it is reasonable to combine it with
strategies that harness patients’ neuroplastic potential.
DISCUSSION
The role of BDNF as a biomarker of diﬀerent symptomatic
domains in several psychiatric pathologies has been studied from
various points of view. Its relationship with cognitive dysfunction
in patients with diﬀerent stages of psychosis, including but not
limited to chronic schizophrenia, accumulates growing evidence.
This review article has focused on recent studies of the relation
between cognition and both BDNF gene polymorphisms and
BDNF peripheral levels, in human subjects during diﬀerent
stages of the psychotic process, including subjects at high
risk of developing psychosis, patients in their ﬁrst episode of
psychosis, and patients with chronic schizophrenia. Our ﬁndings
are summarized in Table 1.
The identiﬁcation of biomarkers that are clinically useful to
psychiatric disorders is one of the most challenging tasks in
psychiatric research and of major concern in modern medicine
(64). Since cognition is one of the most important predictors
of community functioning in schizophrenia (65), the search
for biomarkers that can predict or relate to cognitive function
in patients with psychosis is a clinically signiﬁcant ﬁeld of
research. Peripheral BDNF levels may be particularly useful
as a biomarker of cognition in schizophrenia because levels
in plasma or serum can easily be measured from a blood
sample, and may change during diﬀerent stages of the illness,
or in response to pharmacological and non-pharmacological
interventions. According to Pan et al. (66), intact BDNF in the
peripheral circulation can cross the blood-brain barrier by a high-
capacity, saturable transport system. Pillai et al. (67) reported a
signiﬁcant positive correlation between plasma and cerebrospinal
ﬂuid (CSF) BDNF levels in FEP subjects. They concluded that
parallel changes in BDNF levels in plasma and CSF indicate that
plasma BDNF levels reﬂect the brain changes in BDNF levels
in schizophrenia. All of this suggests that changes in peripheral
BDNF relate to changes in CNS functions in schizophrenia,
having an impact on cognition as shown in this review.

a
better
understanding of both side eﬀects and response to antipsychotics
(68). The BDNF Val66Met variants could be a promising
target for choosing antipsychotic medication options or for
developing next generation antipsychotic drugs. However,
further studies will be required in this area to conﬁrm the eﬀect
of this polymorphism in patients’ response to antipsychotic
drugs, including patients from diﬀerent ethnic populations

BDNF and Cognition in Psychosis
(10). According to this review, BDNF Val66Met could be
further studied as a predictor of clinical improvement of
cognitive symptoms in response to antipsychotics or to a
combination of antipsychotics with other pharmacological and
non-pharmacological treatments.
Despite awareness of the need for early interventions, fewer
studies on BDNF and cognition are found in patients with a
ﬁrst psychotic episode than in patients with established chronic
schizophrenia. It should be noted that publications on BDNF
and cognition in subjects considered at high risk of developing
psychosis have begun to appear, but these studies are still scarce
and include a relatively small number of subjects. Considering
that ﬁnding a reliable biomarker for the early detection of
schizophrenia has been a topic of interest over the last decade
(69), this seems to be a promising potential subject matter for
future research.
On the other hand, the novel tendency represented by the
RDoC model to be able to study biomarkers in patients with
psychosis as a group, instead of using the traditional diagnostic
categories of the DSM or the ICD (11), does not seem to
have permeated the ﬁeld of study of BDNF and cognitive
symptoms. Still, most of the research regarding BDNF and
cognitive symptoms in psychosis is carried out in relation to
schizophrenia as a disease, so implementing studies devoid of
the bias of traditional diagnostic categories represents a future
challenge for this line of research.
It is worth mentioning that the groups of patients studied
have been expanded, including patients with no exposure
to antipsychotic treatment, patients classiﬁed according to
subgroups (e.g., paranoid schizophrenia), or patients grouped
according to side eﬀects of medications (e.g., patients with
tardive dyskinesias). Regarding cognitive tests, only a few studies
use consensus initiative batteries currently validated such as
MATRICS (70) or CNTRICS (71) which represents a limitation
to compare diﬀerent studies. An important part of the articles
described in this review have studied not only the association
between BDNF and cognitive symptoms, but also that with other
symptomatic domains, highlighting the ﬁnding of its association
with negative and depressive symptoms.
Our review has several limitations to consider, including
searching only in the Medline/PubMed database and including
only articles in English language. However, most high impact
research is published in this format. Additional limitations
are that we wrote a narrative review instead of a systematic
review, and that we focused only on recent articles (2013 and
onwards). Finally, not including studies in animal models limits
the possibility to enhance discussion with translational research.
Despite being beyond the focus of our review, studies in animal
models of schizophrenia and pre-clinical studies with post-
mortem brain tissue in humans are an active ﬁeld of BDNF
research that can be found in other review articles (72, 73).
It seems necessary to extend the study of the relationship
between BDNF and cognitive symptoms to psychotic conditions
of diﬀerent stages and origins. Longitudinal studies and longer
follow-up periods will be useful to better understand BDNF
variations during the evolution of the psychotic process.
BDNF may be a useful biomarker in psychosis for early
diagnosis, although the question about whether it can be
helpful to predict conversion to schizophrenia in CHR subjects
remains open. In patients with FEP or chronic schizophrenia,
future pharmacological and non-pharmacological studies should
consider what we know about BDNF, particularly as a biomarker
of cognition, in order to guide potential therapeutic strategies for
the improvement of cognitive symptoms.
