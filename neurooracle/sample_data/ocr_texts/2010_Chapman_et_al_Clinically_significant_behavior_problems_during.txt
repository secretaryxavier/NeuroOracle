Abstract
The present study looked at the emergence of clinically significant problems in behavior,
executive function skills (EF), and social competence during the initial 18 months following TBI
in young children relative to a cohort of children with orthopedic injuries (OI) and the
environmental factors that predict difficulties postinjury. Children, ages 3-7 years, hospitalized for
severe TBI moderate TBI, or OI were seen shortly after their injury (M = 40 days) and again 6
months, 12 months, and 18 months postinjury. Behavioral parent self-reports, demographic data,
family functioning reports, and home environment reports were collected at injury baseline and
each time point post injury. Results suggest that, compared to the OI group, the severe TBI
developed significantly more externalizing behavior problems and EF problems following injury
that persisted through the 18-month follow-up. Minimal social competence difficulties appeared at
the 18-month follow-up, suggesting a possible pattern of emerging deficits rather than a recovery
over time. Predictors of the emergence of clinically significant problems included permissive
parenting, family dysfunction, and low SES. The findings are similar to those found in school-
aged children.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of acquired disability in children in the
United States. As many as 435,000 children between the ages of 0 and 14 are treated in the
emergency department each year with TBI. An additional 37,000 are hospitalized for a TBI
and 2,685 die annually (Langlois, Rutland-Brown, & Thomas, 2006). In addition to
cognitive and behavioral problems during the acute phase of TBI, persistent patterns of
behavioral problems can be observed many months or even years postinjury (Anderson,
Morse, Catroppa, Haritou, & Rosenfeld, 2004; Fay et al., 2009; Max et al., 2005; Schwartz
et al., 2003; Yeates et al., 2005). Although a wealth of information exists regarding the
effect of TBI on school-aged children, the relationship between early childhood TBI and
subsequent behavioral problems is less well-established.
Evidence suggests that school-aged children suffering from TBI have increased behavioral,
executive functioning (EF; i.e. planning, problem solving, organization, working memory),
and social problems. Secondary onset attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (SADHD) is a
significant behavior problem affecting children with TBI, leading to the development of
inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, often occurring with comorbid externalizing
behavior problems (Max et al., 2005b). Researchers have found that within 1 year of injury,
a large percentage of children suffering from severe TBI developed increased behavior
problems, compromised self-regulatory behaviors, and/or clinically significant levels of
executive dysfunction (Fletcher, Ewing-Cobbs, Miner, Levin, & Eisenberg, 1990;
Ganesalingam et al., 2006; Sesma et al., 2008; Schwartz et al., 2003). Deficits in a wide
range of domains have been found in severe TBI in early childhood, such as attentional
problems and social skill difficulties (Anderson and colleagues, 2004; Catroppa, Anderson,
Morse, Haritou, & Rosenfeld, 2007; Fletcher, Ewing-Cobbs, Miner, Levin, & Eisenberg,
1990; Landry, Swank, Stuebing, Prasad, & Ewing-Cobbs, 2004), but these results have been
less well-established and relatively few studies have focused on behavioral outcomes of
early childhood TBI.
Evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that internalizing symptoms tend to increase
over time post injury, with less marked changes following moderate TBI (Anderson,
Catroppa, Dudgeon, Morse, & Rosenfeld, 2006). Similarly, children with severe TBI have
persisting deficits relative to children with less severe TBI or control groups without TBI in
social problem-solving skills, parent ratings of executive function, and adaptive behavior
(Anderson, Catroppa, Dudgeon, Morse, & Rosenfeld, 2006; Janusz, Kirkwood, Yeates, &
Taylor, 2002; Landry et al., 2004). Past studies have found that these behavioral outcomes
are related to both TBI severity and to environmental factors, such as family functioning,
home environment, and psychosocial adversity (Anderson et al., 2006; Max et al., 2005a;
Max et al., 2005b; Wade et al., 1996; Nadebaum, Anderson, & Catroppa, 2007; Sesman et
al., 2008). Although persistent cognitive and learning problems having been documented
following early TBI, behavioral difficulties are a more significant source of family distress

and burden (Anderson et al., 2004; Arroyos-Jurado, Paulsen, Merrell, Lindgren, & Max,
2000; Max et al., 2005a; Max et al., 2005b; Yeates et al., 2005).
Studies examining clinically significant problems over time provide valuable information
about the effects of TBI on children's everyday functioning. Because most existing studies
have examined children injured at school age, investigations of outcomes following TBI in
young children are especially critical. While pediatric injury has been linked to higher
incidence of internalizing and externalizing symptoms in school-aged children (Anderson,
Catroppa, Dudgeon, Morse, & Rosenfeld, 2006; Schwartz et al., 2003; Yeates et al., 2003),
there is evidence that secondary-ADHD is a significant problem that should also be
investigated in a younger sample of children (Max et al., 2005; Max et al., 2005b).
Similarly, although there has been less of a focus on social competence and executive
functions in young children, TBI has been shown to adversely affect social functioning,
social problem-solving, and executive functioning in school-aged children (Anderson,
Catroppa, Dudgeon, Morse, & Rosenfeld, 2006; Janusz, Kirkwood, Yeates, & Taylor, 2002;
Landry et al., 2004). For this reason, we thought to examine levels of internalizing,
externalizing, ADHD-like symptoms, executive function, and social competence in a sample
of younger children. Examination of environmental factors in relation to these outcomes is
also needed to understand how these factors influence behavioral recovery and to identify
potential targets for intervention. To further these aims, the present study examined rates of
postinjury behavior problems reported by parents on standardized measures of behavior
problems, executive function, and social competence in a cohort of 3- to 6-year-old children
with TBI relative to a cohort of children with orthopedic injuries (OI). Specific aims were
to: 1) examine rates of new behavior problems across the initial 18 months post injury as a
function of injury type (TBI vs. OI) and severity; and 2) identify non-injury factors
associated with these outcomes by investigating associations of preinjury child functioning
and characteristics of the family environment on emerging behavior disorders. We chose
self-report measures that would individually assess the different aspects of behavior
problems, executive dysfunction, and social competence difficulties that have been found in
school-aged children in previous research. Based on aforementioned research, we
hypothesized that children with severe TBI (sevTBI) would have higher rates of
internalizing, externalizing, and ADHD-like behavior problems as well as executive
dysfunction and social competence difficulties than children with OI. We anticipated that
children with moderate TBI (modTBI) would also have higher rates of these outcomes
compared to the OI group, though we expected these differences to be less pronounced that
those between the sevTBI and OI groups. We further hypothesized that rates of persisting
behavior problems would be higher in children with premorbid behavior problems and in
children from less advantaged family environments, as defined by greater family
dysfunction, lack of physical resources (i.e. age-appropriate toys, money), and permissive or
authoritarian parenting style. We also explored the possibility that the effects of TBI on
behavioral outcomes would be moderated by these non-injury factors, with more
pronounced effects of TBI in children with preinjury behavior problems and less advantaged
family environments.

Methods
Sample
The sample consisted of 198 participants recruited from a prospective, longitudinal
investigation of recovery from early childhood TBI. Individuals were recruited from three
children's hospitals and one general hospital in Ohio. All participants underwent assessments
during the post-acute period (no longer than 3 months post injury) which included
neuropsychological examination and parent-based ratings of preinjury child behavior and
functioning, preinjury family environment, current caregiver functioning, and injury-related
burdens.
Inclusionary criteria included TBI between 36 and 83 months of age at the time of injury, no
evidence of child abuse as cause of the injury, no history of documented neurological
problems or developmental delays pre-injury, and English as the primary language in the
home. The sample was divided into three diagnostic groups: severe TBI (sevTBI), moderate
TBI (modTBI), and OI. Children in both TBI groups were hospitalized for at least one night.
Additional eligibility criteria included an alteration of neurological functioning as measured
by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of < 13 and/or evidence of neurological insult as seen on
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT). Children in the
sevTBI group had had a GCS score of ≤ 8 as the lowest post-resuscitation score, whereas
those in the modTBI group had either a GCS score of 9-12 or a GCS score of 13-15
accompanied by evidence of neurological insult on imaging. The OI group included children
who sustained a bone fracture (other than to the skull), had no alterations in consciousness
or other symptoms of head trauma, and who were hospitalized overnight due to the injury.
Recruitment of a comparison group of children with OI controlled for the experience of
hospitalization for a traumatic injury as well as for preinjury behavioral and family
characteristics that may contribute to the risk for injury. Fifteen children with mild TBI
(GCS score of 13 or 14 without evidence of imaging abnormalities) were excluded from the
current analyses in order to focus on more severe injuries.
From a total sample of 84 children with TBI and 114 with OI, 18 dropped out of the study
after the baseline visit and 11 (3 modTBI, 2 sevTBI, 6 OI) had been formally evaluated for
behavior problems (primarily ADHD) prior to injury and were thus excluded from the
analyses. The final sample consisted of 169 children, including 21 with sevTBI (M age =
4.93; SD = .96), 55 with modTBI (M age = 4.94; SD = 1.19), and 90 with OI (M age = 5.01;
SD = 1.08). The demographic characteristics of the sample are summarized in Table 1. No
significant differences were found between study participants included in data analyses and
those not included because they had a history of pre-injury behavior problems in terms of
group membership (sevTBI, modTBI, OI) or demographic characteristics. Among the
individuals included in the study, the TBI group was hospitalized significantly longer than
the OI group. The groups also differed significantly on average IQ scores as assessed
postinjury, and overall injury severity.

Procedures
Informed consent was obtained from the parent or legal guardian of each child once the
child was stabilized in the hospital. Medical charts were reviewed for relevant injury and
imaging information. Baseline visits were conducted as soon as possible following medical
stabilization, at which time parents/guardians were interviewed to obtain background,
demographic, and injury information. At each subsequent follow assessment (6, 12, and 18
months post injury), parents completed questionnaires assessing familial characteristics and
dysfunction, parental distress as a result of the injury, and ratings of child behavior,
executive function (EF), and social competence. Although the present study focuses on
parent-based measures of behavior, neuropsychological tests were also administered to the
children at the baseline visit and at each follow-up (Taylor et al., 2008).
Self-Report Measures
Child Behavior/Performance Measures—The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL,
Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001) is a widely used parent rating
of child behavior problems. For purposes of this study, T-scores from the CBCL
Internalizing Problem Scale, Externalizing Problem Scale, and ADHD Problems (DSM-
oriented) Subscale were used in data analysis to focus on those behaviors that are most
problematic within family and school settings. As in previous studies (Schwartz et al.,
2003), we used the clinical cutoff score of T=63 as an index of clinically significant
behavior problems. This T score corresponds to ratings obtained by less than 10% of the
normative sample. Parents with children younger than the age of 6 received the CBCL 1 ½ -
5 version and those with children 6 or older received the CBCL 6 - 18.
Parents also completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF), with
the preschool version (Gioia, Espy, & Isquith, 2000) employed for children 2 to nearly 6
years of age and the school-age version (Gioia, Isquith, Guy, & Kenworthy, 2000) for
children 5 to 18 years of age. For the purposes of this study, parents with children younger
than 6 received the preschool version and those with children 6 or older received the school-
age version. The BRIEF is a parent rating of children's executive function that demonstrates
high levels of internal consistency and stability, and acceptable levels of interrrater
reliability and test-retest reliability. The total score from this scale, or General Executive
Composite (GEC), was used in this study as a broad-based measure of executive function. A
clinical cutoff of T=63 was also used for the BRIEF-GEC, a score that corresponds to
ratings given by less than 10% of the normative sample.
The Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales Second edition (PKBS-2, Merrell, 2002)
and the Home and Community Social and Behavior Scales (HCSBS, Merrell, 2002) are
measures of social competence and antisocial behaviors in preschool (ages 3 – 6 years) and
school-aged children (ages 5-18 years), respectively. For the purposes of this study, parents
of children younger than 6 received the preschool version and those with children 6 or older
received the school-aged version. The PKBS-2 has strong internal consistency reliability,
moderate to high test-retest reliability, and adequate interrater reliability (Merrell, 2002).
The HCSBS also demonstrates strong internal consistency and high interrater reliability
(Merrell, 2002). For this study, the composite of the social scales of the PKBS-2, that
Chapman et al.

included social cooperation, social interaction, and social independence subscales, was used;
for the HCSBS, the social competence total was employed. To enable comparisons across
measures, the corresponding summary scales from each measure were transformed to
sample z scores (i.e., those from the PKBS-2 for children 3-4 years and those from the
HCSBS for children 5 years and older). Evidence in support of the assumption that the two
sets of z scores provided equivalent measures was provided by the substantial correlations of
these scores across time. Z-scores less than or equal to -1.33 were considered clinically
elevated.
Family Functioning Measures—The 12-item General Functioning subscale of the
McMaster Family Assessment Device (FAD-GF, Byles, Byrne, Boyle, & Oxford, 1988;
Miller, Bishop, Epstein, & Keitner, 1985) was used to assess family functioning. The FAD-
GF scores range from 1.0 (healthy) to 4.0 (unhealthy). The measure has adequate reliability
and is related to outcomes of TBI (Taylor, Yeates, Wade, Drotar, & Klein, 1999). To further
assess the family environment, we also administered the Life Stressors and Social Resources
Inventory – Adult Form (LISRES-A, Moos & Moos, 1994). The LISRES is widely used in
stress and support research and has established reliability and both concurrent and predictive
validity (Moos & Moos, 1994; Taylor et al., 2002). In the current study, we considered only
parental interpersonal stressors, defined as the average of the T scores for each of the
relationship stressors domains (spouse, extended, family, friends, co-workers). Finally, to
assess influences of parenting styles on behavioral outcomes, we administered the 62-item
Parenting Practices Questionnaire (PPQ; Robinson, Mandleco, Olsen, & Hart, 1995), a
retrospective, Likert scale assessing the extent to which parents characterize themselves
along the dimensions of authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive parenting prior to the
injury as assessed at the baseline visit. Correlations of the three subscales of the PPQ with
Baumrind's parenting typology provide evidence for construct validity (Robinson, Hart,
Mandleco, Olsen, Russell, Aloa et al., 1996). Research on this typology indicates that both
authoritarian and permissive parenting styles are associated with more child behavior
problems than authoritative parenting styles (Querido, Warner, & Eyberg, 2002; Bayer,
Sanson, & Hemphill, 2006; Deater-Decker & Dodge, 1997).
Home Environment—The Home Observation for Measures of the Environment (HOME,
Bradley & Caldwell, 1984; Caldwell & Bradley, 1984) was administered at children's homes
to assess the extent to which the home environment was conducive to positive interactions
with children and supportive of their development. The HOME consists of information
obtained via parent interview and direct observations of parent-child interactions and play or
learning materials in the home. The HOME has satisfactory levels of interrater reliability
and validity in predicting children's cognitive and social/emotional development (Bradley &
Caldwell, 1984; Caldwell & Bradley, 1984). The total score from the HOME was used in
analysis as an index of the degree of stimulation provided to the child in the home
environment.
Socioeconomic Status (SES)
SES was defined in terms of a composite of maternal education and median income for the
census tract in which the family resided. The composite was computed by averaging the
Chapman et al.

sample z scores of the two variables. This composite score has been shown to function well
as a proxy measure of SES in previous TBI studies (Taylor, Yeates, Wade, Drotar, Stancin,
& Minich, 2002).
Data Analysis
General estimating equations (GEE) logistic regression analysis was used to examine
differences between injury groups (sevTBI, modTBI, and OI) in rates of behavior problems
and deficits in executive function and social competence at each follow-up assessment. Each
individual received a dichotomous score indicating whether he or she had clinically elevated
ratings for each dependent variable at each time point. Continuous ratings of preinjury
functioning for each of the outcomes, obtained at the baseline assessment, were included as
covariates in the analysis to control for premorbid behavioral symptoms and thereby
enabling us to examine postinjury change. Analysis of the data revealed trends for racial and
SES differences between the groups, so they were added into the models as covariates to
statistically control for the association of these factors with the dependent measures. Our
goal was to treat race and SES as covariates while examining the main and moderating
influences of proximal social environmental characteristics such as parenting and home
environment. Alpha rates were set at .05 overall, but were Bonferroni adjusted for the CBCL
to .017 to control for multiple comparisons using subscales from the same measure,
Preliminary analysis revealed higher rates of preinjury problems in the sevTBI group than in
the OI group on one measure (i.e., PKBS/HCSBS), even after excluding children with
premorbid behavior problems. However, the baseline assessment took place as long as 3
months after injury, so it is possible that some baseline assessments of preinjury status were
biased by the children's postinjury behavior or the groups actually differed premorbidly. To
test the hypothesis that children with higher preinjury rates of symptoms were more likely to
develop clinically significant problems postinjury, we examined interactions involving each
premorbid measure raw score by injury group using GEE logistic regression analysis.
After examining group differences in rates (or odds) of behavior problems, environmental
factors were included in mixed models logistic regression analyses to determine if these
factors contributed to outcomes independent of injury group or if they moderated injury
effects. To understand the relationship between injury, environmental factors, and
significant behavior problems postinjury, mixed model logistic regression analyses were
conducted with family functioning, stresses and resources, home environment and parenting
practices as potential moderators, that is, including their interactions with TBI, and linear
and quadratic terms for time. Starting with a full model including all of the aforementioned
terms, the final, most parsimonious model was selected using Akaike's information criterion
(AIC). AIC sums the negative log (Likelihood) and twice the total number of parameters in
the model, k (AIC = -log(L) + 2k), so that models with smaller AIC are considered more
parsimonious. AIC has been shown to provide robust selection of parsimonious models,
given a set of candidate models and is preferred over null-hypothesis testing approaches
(e.g., F-tests) when attempting to evaluate many competing models (Burnham & Anderson,
2002; Burnham & Anderson, 2004). AIC is less conservative than the Bayesian Information
Criterion and allowed for us to select a single model that retained the most terms. The most

parsimonious model was then fit with Bayesian methods to get estimates of effects and
Bayesian credible intervals on those effect sizes (Gelman et al. 2004). We used
uninformative priors, where initial parameter estimates (priors) were drawn from normal
distributions with means of zero and variances of 1000. A 95% Bayesian credible interval is
the interval in which we are 95% sure the true estimate lies.
Results
Correlation analyses were conducted to determine the intercorrelations of the five behavior,
executive function, and social competence ratings (CBCL: Internalizing, CBCL: ADHD,
CBCL: Externalizing, BRIEF: GEC, and PKBS/HCSBS). All five measures were
significantly correlated at the p<.01 level. The intercorrelations between the CBCL scales
ranged from .54 to .74. Correlations between the CBCL scales and the BRIEF GEC scales
ranged from .64 to .78. Correlations between the CBCL scales and BRIEF GEC with the
PKBS/HCSBS scores ranged from -.42 to -.55.
SevTBI was a significant predictor of clinically significant elevations on the CBCL:
Externalizing (p<.0001) and ADHD scales (p = .002), BRIEF: GEC scale (p = .01), and
PKBS/HCSBS (p = .01, see Table 2). No significant interactions were detected between
injury group and time at testing on any behavioral measures, suggesting a relatively stable
level of impairment across time (see Table 3 for N and percentages of kids elevated at each
time point). Sixty-two percent of the sevTBI group, 42% of the modTBI group, and 29% of
the OI group experienced clinically significant elevations on one or more of the measures at
some point postinjury. The sevTBI group had a higher proportion of children consistently
elevated (i.e., above the cut-off at all 3 postinjury assessments; see Figure 1 for consistent
patterns of impairment within each group for each parent-report measure). The same GEE
analyses were conducted with this sample, but this time including the children who were
initially excluded due to previous behavior problem diagnoses to see if model results
changed. There were no changes in the GEE logistic regression models; sevTBI remained
the only significant predictor of clinically significant elevations.
Interaction terms were added to the models to examine the influence of preinjury
functioning on emerging behavior disorders. The CBCL: ADHD subscale was the only
measure for which the interaction between premorbid scores and injury group was
significant. The interaction suggests that children with lower premorbid CBCL: ADHD
subscale scores had a higher odds ratio of being clinically elevated postinjury in the sevTBI
group (odds ratio = 6.3, CI = 0.80 - 3.64; see Figure 2 for graphical representation of odds
ratios and Table 4 for values of each group). In an effort to better understand the relationship
between premorbid scores and injury group in relation to emerging ADHD symptoms, pre-
injury CBCL: ADHD scores were entered as a continuous variable into the model. When
this was done, the interaction between premorbid CBCL: ADHD score and injury group was
no longer significant. Examination of scores at an individual level revealed that eight
individuals in the sevTBI group had scores clustering around 50 at baseline, but became
elevated at one or more time points postinjury.

To identify environmental influences on the development of clinically significant problems,
mixed model logistic regression analyses were conducted with family functioning, stresses
and resources, home environment, and parenting practices included as potential moderators.
The resulting models showed strong evidence that increased permissive parenting, increased
family dysfunction as measured by the FAD, and lower socioeconomic status all increased
the probability of developing clinically significant behavior problems postinjury in the
sample as a whole (see Table 5 for Bayesian analysis parameters). None of the interactions
between the injury group contrasts and social environmental characteristics was significant
suggesting that these variables of family dysfunction, permissive parenting, and home
environment did not moderator the relationship between injury severity and emerging
behavior problems.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to document postinjury rates of clinically significant behavior
problems, EF difficulties, and deficient social competence in children who sustained a TBI
between the ages of 3 and 7 years of age, relative to children who sustained orthopedic
injuries (OI) at the same age. Results support the hypothesis that children suffering from a
severe TBI have significantly higher rates of new onset behavioral impairments when
compared to children with OI comparison even up to 18 months postinjury. However,
consistent with prior studies, there were no significant differences in new behavior problems
between children with moderate TBI and those with OI (Fletcher, Ewing-Cobbs, Miner,
Levin, & Eisenberg, 1999). Externalizing problems as measured by the CBCL ADHD and
Externalizing scales were reported as being significantly elevated in children with severe
TBI across the measured time points, suggesting a long-term effect of severe TBI on
externalizing behavior that is consistent with previous research (Max et al., 2005; Schwartz
et al., 2003; Yeates et al., 2003), as long as 30 months postinjury (Anderson, Catroppa,
Dudgeon, Morse, & Rosenfeld, 2006).
A unique aspect of this study is that the children injured at a young age were found to have
an increased frequency of externalizing behavior problems across the follow-up visits. In
fact, a significantly higher proportion of the sevTBI group were elevated on one or more of
the measures at each point postinjury compared to the modTBI or OI groups. Although the
sevTBI group had increased levels of preinjury behavior problems, this group exhibited
increasing rates of behavior problems over time, even after controlling for baseline/pre-
injury symptom levels in the models. The clinical elevations remained stable across time in
the sevTBI group, suggesting the postinjury impairments were chronic in nature and should
not be treated as a transitory effect of the TBI. In contrast, the modTBI and OI groups had a
significantly higher proportion of individuals who were never elevated on any measure
postinjury, suggesting relatively few clinically significant changes after injury. The level of
preinjury elevations in the sevTBI group is in contrast to previous studies that failed to find
premorbid differences in the proportion of children with clinical elevations (Fletcher et al.,
1990; Donders, 1992). The uniqueness of the current sevTBI group suggests that the
findings be interpreted with caution. The possibility that increasing time between the injury
and the baseline visit may have biased parents’ ratings of pre-injury functioning was tested
by examining the correlations between baseline (pre-injury) scores on each self-report

measure and the time between injury and the baseline visit separately for each group. All p
values were greater than or equal to .44, suggesting that pre-injury ratings were not biased
by the length of time between the injury and initial assessment. Although it is still possible
that parents of children with severe TBI have biased recall of their child's premorbid status,
it is also possible that the severe TBI group differs from the other groups with respect to
premorbid characteristics and status. Families of children with TBI in this study were likely
to be of lower SES and single-parent households. The quality of parental supervision and
other environmental and neighborhood characteristics may have contributed to the child's
injury in a way that wasn't seen in the OI group. Additionally, pre-existing behavior
problems may have also increased the likelihood of sustaining a severe TBI. Because
enrolled children did not differ from potential eligible children in terms of SES and race,
there is reason to believe that this sample is representative. Thus, although the reasons for
higher rates of pre-injury problems in children with severe TBI are unclear, the results
suggest that these children are at risk for substantially elevated rates of post-injury problems,
even after taking pre-morbid status into account.
The finding that lower premorbid CBCL: ADHD scores were associated with greater odds
of clinically elevated postinjury scores in the sevTBI group when the outcomes were
measured as dichotomous variables (clinically elevated or not) is the opposite of what was
found by Max and colleagues (Max et al., 2005; (2) Max et al., 2005) although must be
interpreted with caution given the small sample size that actually changed from not elevated
pre-injury to clinically elevated postinjury. The non-significant group by time interactions
that were found when the scores were entered as a continuous variable suggests that the
association between lower premorbid ADHD scores and an increased likelihood of post-
injury elevations may be in part an artifact of the small sample size and restricted range of
pre-injury scores. Examination of individual scores of the sevTBI group revealed that a large
portion of the children who were elevated postinjury on the CBCL: ADHD scale had a
baseline score that clustered around 50 while only three had elevated scores at baseline. This
restriction in range may account for the initial finding that lower premorbid CBCL: ADHD
scores were more likely to result in clinically significant elevations post injury than higher
premorbid scores. Therefore, it is important for these results to be replicated with a larger
sample of children with severe TBI.
Consistent with previous research, EF skills as measured by the BRIEF were impaired more
often in the sevTBI group than the OI group across the entire 18 months post injury. As
children grow older and demands for higher cognitive functions, such as regulation of
behaviors, in day to day functioning increase, the importance of executive function becomes
more salient. School-age children are required to monitor their behaviors and proper
emotional responses to situations to a greater extent than preschool aged children. Failure to
develop executive function skills can lead to increased difficulty in social functioning and
academic functioning. Whether these difficulties are a result of executive dysfunction alone
or a combination of executive dysfunction and attention problems is difficult to discern, but
regardless it will be important to monitor the relationship of these deficits to every day
functioning as academic and social demands increase with age.

In accordance with previous research, severe TBI also had some adverse effects on social
competency, although small, even at a young age (Anderson et al., 2006; Janusz et al.,
2002). Notably, a significant deficit relative to ratings of pre-injury functioning appeared to
become apparent only around 18 months post-injury in one child, suggesting very tentative
evidence of a pattern of emerging deficits rather than recovery over time, although larger
samples will be necessary to confirm this possibility. Extended longitudinal follow-up is
necessary to determine whether these skills will go on to develop adequately as the child
ages or whether the child will develop a pronounced deficit. Given the early age at brain
injury, the extent of social problems may not be apparent until social expectations increase
and the child is placed into situations that require well-developed social skills. Since social
competency following traumatic brain injury has not been studied to the same extent as
cognitive functioning, there is a need for increased knowledge in this area (Yeates et al.,
2007). Future research should follow a cohort of children longitudinally throughout the
elementary and middle school years as social demands increase to determine the long-term
impact of early TBI on social development, especially given the chronic nature of clinically
elevated behavior problems postinjury in the sevTBI group.
In using mixed model regression analyses to look at predictors of clinical problems, SES,
family functioning, and permissive parenting style were identified as significant contributors
to the likelihood of developing behavior or executive functioning problems. This is
consistent with previous research that found psychosocial adversity, poorer family
functioning, and maladaptive parenting styles were significant predictors of behavior and
executive functioning difficulties over a prolonged period of time following TBI
(Nadebaum, Anderson, & Catroppa, 2007; Taylor et al., 2001; Anderson et al., 2007).
Permissive parenting styles lack consistency, clear boundaries, and structure that may result
in the exacerbation of postinjury difficulties. Similarly, family dysfunction may entail a lack
of structure and consistency but may also result in less than clear expectations for behavior
and functioning. Inconsistent discipline, unclear expectations, and limited structure in a
child's life may serve as targets for potential interventions designed to teach parents and
families how to create an optimal environment to reduce the chance of developing more
problems postinjury (Wade, Carey, & Wolfe, 2006; Wade, Oberjohn, Burkhardt, &
Greenberg, in press).
The fact that postinjury behavior problems were much more likely to be found in children
with TBI who had less than optimal environmental factors begs the question whether the
problems are a result of the environment or whether the family environment deteriorates
because of the behavior problems and stress of the TBI. Stancin and colleagues (2008) found
that family and caregiver functioning was adversely affected following early traumatic brain
injury. Chronic life stresses and interpersonal resources were important determinants of
future burden and distress, as were coping strategies involving denial. Injury severity alone
may not be sufficient to identify families at risk for increased burdens, and other family and
personal factors probably should be assessed (Stancin, Wade, Walz, Yeates, & Taylor,
2008). Taylor and colleagues (2001) indicated that a bidirectional relationship may exist
between postinjury behavior problems and poor family functioning. Another possibility is
that parents of children from impoverished environments may have been unable to access

the resources needed in order to intervene and stop the persistent behavior and executive
functioning problems.
Future research should look at the effectiveness of interventions in curbing the behavior
problems of TBI in children with early traumatic brain injuries. Promising research (Wade,
Carey, & Wolfe, 2006) suggests that interventions focused on problem-solving in the family
setting may lead to improved behavioral functioning in children who sustained a TBI as
compared to families who did not undergo the intervention. Interventions focusing on
parenting skills may also contribute to improved behavioral functioning following early TBI
(Wade, Oberjohn, Burkhardt, & Greenberg, in press).
Limitations
Several limitations should be noted. Although a large percentage of the sevTBI group were
reported to display problematic behaviors and executive functioning difficulties, the
relatively small size of the sevTBI group limits the generalizability of the results to the
population at large. Attrition reduced statistical power, potentially limiting our ability to
detect differences between the moderate TBI and OI groups. Another limitation of the
current study was the presence of elevated behavior and executive functioning scores for
sevTBI at the baseline measurement. Although the baseline assessment took place within 3
months of the injury, we cannot know for certain whether the scores reported by parents
were unbiased ratings of preinjury functioning. For example, the stress of the injury to the
child or changes in the child's behavior may have influenced parental reports. To control for
the effects of preinjury problems on postinjury functioning, we excluded children who been
evaluated for or diagnosed with a behavior problem prior to their injury from further
analyses. Additionally, all statistical analyses were conducted controlling for preinjury
scores on the dependent variable of interest. Future research should more clearly identify
individuals with behavior problems through careful review of school documentation and
medical charts. Also, a shorter time between injury and baseline evaluation would help
reduce the chance of falsely elevated baseline scores, although medical complications may
prohibit an earlier evaluation.
Another limitation to the current study was the use of different test versions for different age
ranges. This is a problem faced by researchers who use measures normed for subsets of
child age ranges. On tests such as the PKBS and HCSBS, as well as the BRIEF and CBCL,
many children were too old for preschool version of the test and were therefore administered
the school-aged version. As a result, direct comparison between the scores of the different
versions was limited. However, review of children whose age changed throughout testing
resulting in administration of different test versions failed to reveal significant changes in
clinical caseness across the groups. To address this limitation, future studies could use
structured interviews to identify clinically significant symptoms. This would reduce the
reliance upon parent report measures, potentially yielding additional information regarding
diagnostic profiles following TBI, while enabling investigators to use the same interview
across the age range.
Results of this study indicate that children who suffer from TBI at a young age show similar
acute and longer-term behavioral consequences of their injuries as children who experience

a TBI at an older age. This study adds to the limited literature on the effects of TBI in young
children by demonstrating the prolonged trajectory of behavior and executive functioning
difficulties experienced by young children and the role the environment plays in the
development and maintenance of the problems. Most importantly, the results illustrate the
need to follow these children as they continue in the school setting to understand the long-
term effects of these behavioral, executive functioning, and social competence difficulties.
As the demands required of the children increase, deficits may become more evident in
social and educational settings.

The proportion of each group rated as consistently clinically elevated at every time point
postinjury separated by parent-report measure. The proportion of sevTBI elevations differed
significantly from the proportion of OI elevations on every parent-report measure. This was
also true when comparing the sevTBI elevation proportions to the modTBI elevation
proportions with the exception of the CBCL: ADHD subscale.
