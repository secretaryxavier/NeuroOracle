Method—Raters coded videotaped interactions during free play and structured tasks for parental 
warmth/responsiveness and negativity and child warmth, behavior regulation, and cooperation. 
Raters also counted parental directives, critical/restricting statements, and scaffolds.
Results—Parents of children with TBI exhibited less warm responsiveness and made more 
directive statements during a structured task than parents in the OI group. Children with TBI 
displayed less behavior regulation than children with OI. Parental warm responsiveness was more 
strongly related to child cooperativeness in the OI group than in the TBI group. Child behavior 
also mediated group differences in parental responsiveness and directiveness. TBI accounted for 
as much variance in parental behaviors as or more than did sociodemographic factors.
Conclusion—TBI-related changes in child behavior may negatively influence parent–child 
interactions and disrupt the reciprocity between parent and child.

Research has clearly documented the central role during early childhood that parenting 
behaviors play in a child’s social, emotional, and cognitive development (Bornstein & 
Tamis-LeMonda, 1989; Landry, Smith, Swank, Assel, & Vellet, 2001; Weizman & Snow, 
2001). These findings suggest that warm and responsive parenting, together with verbal 
stimulation and cognitive support, contributes to optimal cognitive and behavioral 
development in typically developing children. However, less is known about how medical 
conditions that affect the health and functioning of the child, such as traumatic brain injury 
(TBI), influence the quality and nature of the parent–child relationship. Some studies 
suggest that parents of young children with health problems display more negativity (Pipp-
Siegal & Biringen, 1998) and directiveness (Landry, Chapieski, Richardson, Palmer, & Hall, 
1990) than parents of typically developing children in their interactions. However, research 
with other populations and somewhat older samples (e.g., preadolescents with spina bifida) 
found no differences in parent–child interactions as a function of the child’s diagnosis 
(Seefeldt et al., 1997). Findings differ as a function of the methodology (e.g., parent report 
vs. observation) and population of interest, making it difficult to draw inferences regarding 
how specific health conditions affect the parent–child relationship.
Research regarding children with mental retardation (MR) has provided some of the best and 
most extensive evidence regarding the potential effects of child cognitive status on parent–
child interactions. This body of literature also underscores the potential complexity of these 
relationships. Findings suggest that parents of children with MR display greater levels of 
behavioral direction coupled with fewer positive behavioral exchanges than parents of 
typically developing children (Floyd, Harter, & Costigan, 2004; Floyd & Phillipe, 1993; 
Floyd & Zmich, 1991; Tannock, 1988). Although some studies have noted higher levels of 
negativity among parents of children with MR (Floyd & Zmich, 1991), others have found no 
differences (Floyd et al., 2004). Directiveness and commands may in fact serve positive 
functions in this population (Floyd & Costigan, 1997), enabling parents to engage children 
in activities (Tannock, 1988) and manage problem behaviors noncoercively (Floyd & 
Phillipe, 1993). However, other factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES; Floyd &

Saitzyk, 1992) and child behavior problems (Floyd et al., 2004), may serve as stronger 
determinants of parent–child interactions than the nature of the child’s condition. Thus, it is 
important to understand the genesis and function of specific parenting behaviors in children 
with health conditions or disabilities.
Existing research suggests that changes in parenting behaviors and parent–child interactions 
may be brought about by parental distress resulting from the child’s condition (Quittner, 
Opipari, Regoli, & Jacobsen, 1992), by parental perceptions of the child (Holmbeck et al., 
2002; Stern, Karraker, Sopko, & Norman, 2000), or as a result of the child’s behavior, 
specifically, his or her need for structure and cognitive support (Keogh, Garnier, 
Bernheimer, & Gallimore, 2000; Landry et al., 1990). The literature on bonding and 
attachment suggests that maternal depression disrupts the natural reciprocity between parent 
and child (Tronick & Weinberg, 1997). However, another body of research suggests that 
differences in the child’s behavior and needs arising from his or her cognitive or medical 
status may alter the nature of parent–child interactions irrespective of the parent’s level of 
distress (Floyd & Costigan, 1997). In fact, several studies have found parent–child 
interactions to be more related to child characteristics than parent characteristics. In a study 
of young children with developmental delays, Keogh et al. (2000) found that the frequency 
and intensity of accommodations to the child’s disability were related to the characteristics 
of the child, such as the need for frequent monitoring, rather than SES or maternal 
education. Similarly, Landry et al.(1990) found that mothers of very-low-birth-weight 
toddlers were more likely to direct their children, whereas mothers of full-term children 
were more likely to use suggestions, even after controlling for child IQ and maternal 
education. Among preadolescents with spina bifida, parental overprotection was in part 
mediated by the child’s cognitive status, suggesting that observed differences in parental 
behavior were partially determined by the child’s behavior (Holmbeck et al., 2002). 
However, because children in these studies had been diagnosed several years previously, 
their findings do not shed light on the effect of abrupt changes in the child’s condition due to 
acute illness or injury on parenting behaviors.
Parenting behaviors may also change as a result of beliefs about the diagnosis rather than 
changes in the child’s behavior (Stern & Hildenbrandt, 1984). For example, experimental 
investigations regarding perceptions of premature infants demonstrated that awareness of a 
diagnosis (i.e., prematurity) caused individuals, including parents of babies born 
prematurely, to perceive and interact with the child in a less positive fashion (Stern et al., 
2000). In these studies, the same child was labeled as either full term or premature, thereby 
enabling the investigators to separate the label or diagnosis from the child’s characteristics. 
Although mothers of premature infants engaged in prematurity stereotyping with infants 
other than their own, they did so to a lesser extent than parents of full-term infants, 
suggesting that experience with the condition may reduce, but not eliminate, such 
stereotyping.
Parent–child interactions following childhood TBI have not been explicitly examined; 
however, anecdotal reports suggest that parents’ behavior toward their child may change, 
marked by increasing overprotectiveness and less consistent disciplinary practices 
(DePompei & Zarski, 1989). Studies of other populations reviewed previously suggest that

TBI in young children has the potential to alter parent–child interactions through several 
distinct pathways. First, parental burden and distress arising from the injury may cause the 
parent to be less warm and responsive to his or her child (Tronick & Weinberg, 1997). 
Several previous studies have demonstrated that TBI in school-age children contributes to 
adverse caregiver and family outcomes for many years following the injury, including 
elevated psychological symptoms and distress (Rivara et al., 1992; Wade, Taylor, Drotar, 
Stancin, & Yeates, 1998; Zarski, DePompei, & Zook, 1988). Although study design 
limitations preclude the possibility of totally distinguishing preexisting issues from injury-
related concerns, these findings suggest that TBI in children is associated with parent and 
family distress that could affect parental warmth and responsiveness. Second, changes in 
child behavior caused by TBI may contribute to changes in parent–child interactions (see 
Floyd et al., 2004). Pediatric TBI can result in deficits in cognitive skills, behavior, and 
social competence (Taylor et al., 2002), and existing data suggest that TBI in a young child 
results in potentially more severe sequelae than is the case for older children (Anderson, 
Catroppa, Rosenfeld, Haritou, & Morse, 2000; Anderson et al., 1997). Thus, parents of 
young children with TBI may alter their behavior toward their child following the injury to 
provide greater cognitive support (scaffolding) and direction. Increased parental stress 
coupled with child behavior difficulties resulting from TBI (such as impaired initiation and 
self-control) may lead caregivers to exhibit less warmth while providing greater direction 
and control than they did prior to the injury. Finally, negative perceptions regarding the 
diagnosis of TBI may exacerbate parental concerns and, concomitantly, their overprotection 
and control. As a consequence, the child may have less opportunity to function 
independently and to develop or relearn skills (Landry, Smith, Miller-Loncar, & Swank, 
1997).
In this investigation, we sought to understand the effects of pediatric TBI on parent–child 
interactions by addressing the following objectives: (a) to examine differences in parent–
child interactions following TBI relative to orthopedic injuries (OI) not involving the central 
nervous system (CNS), (b) to examine the contributions of parental depressive symptoms 
and child behavior to parental interactions after controlling for potential sociodemographic 
influences, and (c) to determine whether the relationship between parent and child behaviors 
varied as a function of the child’s injury (TBI vs. OI). On the basis of previous research 
indicating that TBI adversely affects child behavior (Taylor et al., 2002), we hypothesized 
that children with TBI would be rated as less cooperative and less behaviorally regulated 
than children with OI, with the degree of dysregulation proportional to the severity of the 
injury. We also hypothesized that parents of children with TBI would be rated as less warm 
and responsive and more directive and critical than parents of children with OI. To better 
understand the relationship of TBI to changes in parental behavior (Objective b), we 
examined the contribution of parental distress, child behavior (e.g., behavior regulation), and 
injury severity to parent behavior after controlling for race and SES. We hypothesized that 
both parental distress and child behavior would mediate the relationship between TBI and 
parenting behavior (Holmbeck, 1997). Because TBI has the potential to profoundly alter a 
child’s cognition and behavior and exacerbate parental distress, we further hypothesized that 
the relationship between child behavior and parental responsiveness would be more 
disrupted after TBI than after OI; in other words, we explored whether injury type would

moderate the relationship between child and parent behavior (Objective c). To our 
knowledge, this is one of the first investigations to examine changes in parent–child 
interactions arising from TBI through the use of observational methods.
Method
The study used a concurrent cohort research design to assess young children with TBI and 
young children with OI and their families during the initial weeks following injury. 
Including children with OI as a comparison group allowed us to examine the consequences 
of brain injury relative to the functioning of a group of children who were likely to be 
similar in preinjury behavior and associated risk factors. Specifically, impulsive child 
behavior and social environmental characteristics such as the degree of parental supervision 
and monitoring have been shown to contribute to the risk for injury (both TBI and OI) and 
may also relate to preinjury parent–child interactions (Goldstrohm & Arffa, 2005). 
Additionally, the use of an OI cohort equated the groups with respect to the family stressor 
of having a child hospitalized. The study was approved by the institutional review boards at 
each of the participating medical centers, and informed consent was obtained from 
participating caregivers.
Recruitment Criteria
Consecutive admissions of children with TBI or with OI not involving the CNS were 
screened at three tertiary care children’s hospitals and a general hospital (all with Level 1 
trauma centers). Eligibility requirements for both groups included age between 36 and 84 
months at the time of injury and English as the primary spoken language in the home. 
Eligibility for the TBI group also included a TBI requiring overnight admission to the 
hospital with a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 or less or a higher score 
accompanied by evidence of abnormalities on imaging (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] 
or computed tomography [CT] scan). GCS scores are generated by summing ratings of eye 
opening, best verbal response, and best motor response at the time of evaluation by medical 
staff (Teasdale & Jennett, 1974). Children who sustained nonblunt head trauma (e.g., 
projectile wounds, strokes, drowning) were excluded. Inclusion in the orthopedic group 
required a documented bone fracture (other than the skull) requiring an overnight hospital 
stay and the absence of any evidence of loss of consciousness or other findings suggestive of 
brain injury (e.g., symptoms of concussion). Exclusion criteria for both groups included 
previous history of brain injury, preexisting neurological disorder or medical problem 
affecting the CNS, diagnosis of MR or developmental disability, documentation in the 
medical chart or in the parent interview of child abuse as the cause of injury, and history of 
severe psychiatric disorder requiring hospitalization.
Sample Characteristics
A total of 206 children and their caregivers (87 parent–child dyads with TBI and 119 with 
OI) completed informed consent and were enrolled in the study. Baseline data were 
collected on 204 children and caregivers (87 parent–child dyads with TBI and 117 with OI). 
The sample included 54% of potentially eligible children with TBI and 35% of eligible 
children with OI. Comparison of enrolled children with those in the trauma registry at

participating hospitals meeting age and injury severity criteria indicated that our sample was 
representative of all eligible children in terms of race and family income (based on median 
income from the 2005 census for the child’s address obtained from the Web site at http://
www.ffiec.gov/Geocode/default.aspx). All but 6 children (95%) completed the videotaped 
interaction tasks at the baseline assessment. Of these 6, 3 were unable to be assessed because 
of the severity of their injuries, and 3 declined to be videotaped. An additional 4 children 
had unusable videotapes and were thus excluded from the analyses. Those who failed to 
complete the task or who did not have usable data did not differ from those completing the 
task with respect to type of injury, injury severity, parental marital status, race/ethnicity, or 
child gender. However, the 3 children with severe TBI who were unable to participate had 
significantly longer hospital stays (M = 36.67 days, SD = 48.29) than the 20 children with 
severe TBI who completed the video interaction task (M = 6.70 days, SD = 7.24), suggesting 
that the severe TBI group was not representative of the entire spectrum of severity of TBI in 
those enrolled. The primary caregiver was the child’s mother in all but eight families (96%). 
In these families, fathers (three), grandmothers (four), or permanent legal guardians (one) 
served as the primary caregiver and completed the parent–child interaction task.
Table 1 presents the injury severity and demographic characteristics of the children who 
completed the interaction task at baseline. Consistent with previous investigations (Fletcher, 
Ewing-Cobbs, Miner, Levin, & Eisenberg, 1990), severe TBI was defined as one resulting in 
a GCS score of 8 or less at any point since injury, and moderate TBI was defined as a GCS 
score of 9–12. Injuries receiving a GCS score of 13–15 accompanied by evidence of brain 
insult on neuroimaging (CT or MRI) were labeled as complicated mild TBI. We refer to the 
latter group as complicated mild because positive neuroimaging results signify a more 
significant brain injury than is typical for persons sustaining mild TBI (Malec et al., 2007). 
Children with TBI were more seriously injured and hospitalized longer than children with 
OI. Children in the complicated mild TBI group had a significantly higher mean Injury 
Severity Score (ISS; Baker, O’Neill, Haddon, & Long, 1974) than those in the OI and 
moderate TBI groups, indicating that the children in the complicated mild TBI group had 
more frequent lesions on neuroimaging. The higher ISS for the complicated mild TBI group 
thus reflects higher component ratings for both the head region and other body regions. 
Children with severe TBI were hospitalized longer than the other groups.
The TBI and OI groups did not differ from each other with respect to preinjury delays in 
growth and development (9% TBI and 10% OI), learning difficulties (3% TBI and 3% OI), 
emotion or behavior problems (7% TBI and 7% OI), or previous developmental evaluation 
(16% TBI and 18% OI). These data suggest that the TBI and OI groups did not differ with 
respect to preinjury developmental or behavioral problems. The groups did, however, differ 
in the proportion of non-Caucasian parents. There were also trends for differences in family 
income and parental education. Thus, to control for the possible influence of 
sociodemographic factors on observed parent and child behaviors, median census tract 
income and parent race were included as covariates in the analyses of group differences.

Procedure
The present study is based on data collected at the initial (baseline) assessment, which was a 
mean of 39.99 days post injury (SD = 19.38). The time between injury and assessment was 
longer for the TBI group than for the OI group: M = 49.90 days (35.35) for the TBI group, 
and M = 35.40 days (14.89) for the OI group, t(218) = 110.12, p < .000. This difference was 
likely related to longer hospital stays and difficulties recruiting and testing the children 
acutely following TBI. The videotaped observation of parent–child interactions was 
completed midway through a comprehensive neuropsychological and behavioral evaluation 
of the child.
Measures
Ratings of parent and child behavior—Because parent–child interactions vary 
depending on the context, similar to previous investigations (e.g., Barkley, 1991), we 
videotaped interactions in two contexts: (a) unstructured free play and (b) a structured 
teaching task. During the 10-min free play interaction, the parent was instructed to spend 
time with his or her child as if they were at home. The room was equipped with 
developmentally appropriate toys as well as magazines for the parents to read. During the 
10-min teaching task, the parent and child were asked to complete a series of puzzles 
together. Parents were instructed to find a puzzle that they thought would be somewhat 
difficult for their child to ensure the need for assistance. The play and teaching task portions 
were each divided into two 5-min segments for rating purposes and transcribed to facilitate 
coding of caregiver and child verbalizations.
To rate parent and child behaviors, we employed the coding system used by Landry and 
colleagues (1990, 1997) in their studies of outcomes in low-birth-weight children. This 
system incorporates ratings of parent and child behaviors that reflect more enduring 
dispositions or interactive styles (Bakeman & Brown, 1980) and frequency counts of 
parental behaviors that support, direct, or restrict the child’s behavior. Considerable support 
exists regarding the predictive validity of these ratings for subsequent child cognitive and 
social development (Landry et al., 1997, 2001; Landry, Miller-Loncar, Smith, & Swank, 
2002).
Parent behavior during both the free play and the teaching task was coded along the 
dimensions of warmth, contingent responsiveness, and negativity. Each dimension was rated 
along a 5-point scale, with higher scores indicating more positive behavior (i.e., high 
warmth, minimal negativity). Parental warmth was rated on the basis of the presence and 
intensity of verbal and nonverbal warmth, affection, and positive regard toward the child as 
characterized by physical engagement and proximity, encouragement and praise, positive 
conversation, enthusiasm, physical affection, acceptance, and a sense of joy and pleasure in 
interacting with the child. Contingent responsiveness reflected the parent’s sensitivity and 
responsiveness to the child’s behavior and was rated on the basis of the presence and 
frequency with which the parent responded to the child’s initiation, allowed the child to 
direct activities, displayed sensitivity to the child’s cues and affective signals, and 
modulated speech, affect, and the pace of activities to fit with those of the child. Negativity 
was rated on the basis of the presence of a harsh or angry tone of voice, sarcasm and

demeaning comments, physical control such as slaps or pinches, and physical expressions of 
impatience (eye rolling, sighing).
Raters also counted the frequency of three distinct parental behaviors that have been shown 
to influence subsequent child development: restrictions, directives, and scaffolding 
behaviors (Assel, Landry, Swank, Smith, & Steelman, 2003; Landry et al., 2002). 
Restrictions were defined as verbal or nonverbal parental behaviors that limited, restricted, 
or disciplined the child’s behavior in some way. Directives were defined as verbal or 
nonverbal strategies that provided structure while limiting the child’s choices (e.g., ”Put the 
blue block there”). Scaffolding behaviors provided verbal or semantic links between objects, 
persons, activities, or functions, thereby facilitating the child’s understanding and problem 
solving (see Landry et al., 2002, for a more complete definition of scaffolds).
During the free play interaction, coders rated the child’s warmth/engagement toward the 
parent on the basis of the amount of talking, eye contact, smiling/positive affect, and verbal 
and nonverbal efforts to engage the parent. During the teaching task, coders rated the child’s 
cooperation and behavioral regulation. As with the caregiver ratings, child ratings were 
based on a 5-point scale, with higher ratings reflecting more socially appropriate behavior 
(more cooperation, better behavior regulation).
Each 5-min segment was coded independently. Subsequently, ratings for the two play 
segments were averaged, and ratings for the two teaching segments were averaged, thereby 
increasing the stability of our measures. Although raters were not informed of the group 
status of parent–child dyads, some children in both groups had casts indicative of OI, and 
some children with severe TBI had visible speech or motor impairments associated with 
their injuries. Therefore, it was not possible to completely conceal the nature of the injury 
from the raters.
Raters were trained on one or two codes at a time over a period of several months. 
Reliability on a given code was determined by the rater’s ability to independently rate five 
tapes with an overall reliability/agreement above 85%. Ongoing reliability for each rater was 
assessed at monthly supervision meetings. To assess interrater reliability, 15% of the tapes 
were rated by the entire rating team. Each rater’s reliability with the group ratings was 
assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Reliability was required to remain 
at or above 85% or retraining was implemented. All ICCs were .80 or greater (range .80–.
99), indicating a high level of interrater reliability.
We examined intercorrelations among the rating scales to determine if the ratings were 
capturing distinct behaviors (see Table 2). Scales with correlations exceeding .75 were 
averaged to form composites. On the basis of this criterion, warmth and contingent 
responsiveness were averaged into a single scale of warm responsiveness reflecting positive 
parenting behavior during the play and teaching segments (see also Landry, Smith, & 
Swank, 2006). Parent negativity was not highly correlated with positive parenting behaviors 
and was thus retained as a separate scale. Child warmth was correlated with behavior 
regulation and cooperation .22 and .18, respectively. Child behavior regulation and 
cooperation were correlated .67, and therefore, each was examined as an independent rating.

Parental depressive symptoms—Parental depressive symptoms were assessed using 
the depression scale of Brief Symptom Inventory, a 53-item questionnaire tapping a wide 
range of psychological symptoms. Reliability and validity have been well established 
(Derogatis & Spencer, 1982). Previous research with depressed caregivers indicated that 
parental depression is associated with lower levels of warmth and greater negativity (Dyer-
Harnish, Dodge, & Valente, 1995; Elgar, McGrath, Waschbusch, Stewart, & Curtis, 2004; 
Haskett & Willoughby, 2006). The groups did not differ significantly with respect to levels 
of depressive symptoms at baseline (severe TBI = 53.37; all other groups had T scores of 
49–50). The groups also did not differ on the proportion of individuals meeting clinical 
caseness indicating clinically significant levels of depressive symptoms (severe TBI = 
24.0%; moderate TBI = 10.0%; complicated mild TBI = 9.0%; OI = 9.3%).
Analyses
Repeated measures general linear model analyses were conducted to examine group 
differences in ratings and frequency counts of parental behaviors. In these analyses, the 
situation (play vs. teaching task) served as the repeated measures factor. Parent race and 
median census tract income served as covariates to control for group differences in these 
characteristics (i.e., race, income). Partial eta squared provided an estimate of effect sizes.
We conducted multiple regression analyses to examine the contribution of maternal 
depressive symptoms and child behavior (regulation and cooperation) to parental behaviors. 
The TBI injury group was divided into three subgroups depending on the severity of injury. 
We included ratings of parent–child relationships from the teaching task because we 
anticipated more pronounced differences in child behavior between the injury groups in this 
structured context. Parental behaviors of interest included warm responsiveness, 
directiveness, and scaffolds. Because the frequency counts of directives and scaffolds were 
not normally distributed, we used log transformations as the dependent variables in the 
regression analyses. Separate regressions were conducted, with child cooperation and child 
behavior as predictors because of the relatively high correlation between the two.
For the predictor variable child behavior regulation, the full model included the interaction 
between child behavior and injury group; the three variables of interest: parental depression, 
child behavior and injury group; and two covariates: income and race. If the interaction was 
not significant, it was removed from the model. The three predictor variables and the two 
covariates were maintained in the model whether they were significant or not.
Effect sizes were calculated for each of the predictor variables and the two covariates using 
Cohen’s f2 (Cohen, 1992). Additional analyses were conducted to determine whether child’s 
behavior mediated the effect of injury group on parental response. Separate regression 
analyses were conducted for each TBI group and OI group combination to verify that the 
following conditions of mediation were met: (a) Parental behavior was significantly 
associated with injury group, (b) parental behavior was significantly associated with the 
child’s behavior, (c) the child’s behavior was significantly associated with injury group, and 
(d) parental behavior was significantly associated with injury group after controlling for 
child behavior. If all four steps were met, then child behavior was considered a mediator if 
the change in the coefficient for injury group between Steps a and d was 10% or greater.

Analysis for the predictor variable child cooperation was conducted in the same manner as 
described for child behavior. SAS software Version 9.1 was used. The PROC GLM 
procedure was used for all of the regressions analyses. The PROC UNIVARIATE procedure 
was used to examine the distributions of the response variables and the residuals. All tests 
were two-way tests, and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Group Differences in Parent–Child Interactions
Results reported in Table 3 revealed that parents of children with TBI exhibited less warm 
responsiveness than parents of children with OI. Specifically, parents of children with 
complicated mild TBI were rated as less warmly responsive than parents of children with OI 
during both the free play and teaching tasks; parents of children with moderate TBI were 
rated as less responsive than those of children with OI only during the teaching task. During 
the teaching task, parents in the severe and complicated mild TBI groups made more 
directive statements than did parents in the OI group, Group × Situation interaction, F(3, 
181) = 2.78, p = .04. Parents in the severe TBI group also made more scaffolding statements 
during the teaching task than did parents of children with OI. The groups did not differ on 
ratings of negativity or on the number of restrictions. Regardless of the severity or nature of 
the injury, parents made restrictive statements more frequently, F(3, 181) = 23.80, p = .000, 
and were rated as more negative, F(3, 181) = 7.57, p = .007, during the teaching task than 
during the free play.
Also consistent with hypotheses, observers rated children with severe and complicated mild 
TBI as significantly less well regulated than children with OI (see Table 4). However, the 
groups did not differ on ratings of warmth or cooperation.
Mediators and Moderators of Parental Behavior
We conducted multivariate analyses to test two distinct hypotheses. First, we sought to 
examine whether parental depression and child behavior mediated the association between 
TBI and parental behaviors toward the child. We examined warm responsiveness, directives, 
and scaffolds during the teaching task as outcomes in this context because preliminary 
general linear model analyses provided evidence of group differences on these behaviors 
(see Table 3). A 10% reduction in the significance of group differences after entering the 
putative mediator in the model would provide evidence of mediation. Second, we sought to 
test whether the association between the child’s behavior and the parent’s response (i.e., 
warm responsiveness) varied as a function of the nature and severity of the child’s injury 
(moderation model). We entered interaction terms involving group and child behavior 
(regulation, moderation) as predictors of parent behaviors. Significant interaction terms 
would indicate that injury type moderated the relationship between child and parent 
behaviors. Table 5 presents the findings of these analyses.

income, the child’s behavior regulation accounted for significant variance in parental warm 
responsiveness; however, parental depressive symptoms did not. Behavior regulation

mediated the association between the type of injury and parental responsiveness when the 
complicated mild TBI and OI groups were being compared. The effect sizes for the child’s 
behavior regulation and injury group were comparable (Cohen’s f2 = .10), whereas income 
and race accounted for less variance (f2 = .04). We did not find evidence that the nature and 
severity of the injury moderated the relationship between the child’s behavior regulation and 
the parent’s warm responsiveness (p = .1322).
When considering the ratings of the child’s cooperation as the index of child behavior in the 
model, we found a significant interaction between ratings of cooperation and injury group. 
In these interactions, the child’s cooperation was significantly correlated with the parent’s 
responsiveness in the OI group, accounting for 23% of the variance after controlling for 
sociodemographic factors and depression. However, child cooperation was not related to 
parental warm responsiveness in any of the TBI groups. These findings suggest that TBI 
may disrupt the natural reciprocity that is found between parent and child behaviors.
Models of parental directiveness—After controlling for parental race and income, the 
child’s behavior regulation accounted for significant variance in parental directiveness; 
however, parental depressive symptoms did not. Injury group was no longer a significant 
predictor with child behavior regulation in the model. The interaction of behavior regulation 
and group was not significant (p = .3543), indicating that the type of injury did not moderate 
the association between child behavior regulation and parental directiveness. However, 
behavior regulation mediated the association between the type of injury and parental 
directiveness when the complicated mild TBI and OI groups were being compared. We 
found similar results when ratings of the child’s cooperation were considered. Specifically, 
group was no longer a significant predictor of parental directiveness with child cooperation 
in the model. There was also no evidence of moderation (p = .98).
Models of parental scaffolding—Neither parental depressive symptoms nor child 
behavior regulation was significantly associated with parental scaffolds after controlling for 
income and race. Thus, child behavior regulation did not mediate the relationship between 
injury type and parental scaffolds or cognitive supports. Both parental income and injury 
group had comparable effect sizes (Cohen’s f2s = .05 and .06, respectively). The interaction 
of behavior regulation and group was not significant (p = .25), indicating that the type of 
injury did not moderate the association between child behavior regulation and parental 
scaffolds. We found a similar pattern of findings with child cooperation in the model, with 
no support for the mediation or moderation hypotheses.
Discussion
The present article provides preliminary support for the three major hypotheses of this study. 
Comparisons of parent–child dyads following TBI with parent–child dyads following OI 
constitute the first observational evidence that parent–child interactions may be affected in 
the initial months following TBI. Although some group differences (e.g., lower levels of 
warm responsiveness) suggest adverse changes in parent–child interactions, others (e.g., 
more frequent parental scaffolds following severe TBI) indicate positive adaptation to the 
child’s injury. As anticipated, children with severe and complicated mild TBI were rated as

displaying less self-regulation during structured activities. We found evidence that these 
differences in the child’s behavioral regulation partially mediate observed differences in 
parental responsiveness and directiveness. Moreover, the relationship between the child’s 
level of cooperation and parent responsiveness varied as a function of the nature of the 
injury, such that parent warm responsiveness was less contingent upon the child’s behavior 
following TBI than following OI. Further longitudinal investigation is needed to clarify the 
persistence and magnitude of the observed differences in parent–child interactions. 
However, these findings provide tentative evidence that TBI may disrupt parent–child 
relationships, contributing to a lack of reciprocity or synchrony between parent and child 
behavior. The importance of each of these findings is discussed below.
The finding that parents of children with moderate and complicated mild TBI exhibited less 
warm responsiveness has potentially important implications for children’s recovery and 
subsequent development. Although modest in magnitude, the nature/severity of the child’s 
injury accounted for more variance (12%) in parental responsiveness during the structured 
task than race and family income combined (7%). An extensive and growing developmental 
literature underscores the importance of parental warm responsiveness for the subsequent 
growth of social competence and cognitive and language abilities in the child (Landry et al., 
2001; Weizman & Snow, 2001). In fact, successful early intervention programs appear to 
influence child cognitive and language development through increases in parental 
responsiveness to the child (Mahoney, Boyce, Fewell, Spiker, & Wheeden, 1998; Mahoney, 
Wheeden, & Perales, 2004). Although early warm responsiveness has been shown to be 
particularly important, recent research suggests that children who receive consistently warm 
responsive parenting over time exhibit better cognitive development than those who never 
receive warm responsive parenting or who only receive it during early development (Smith, 
Landry, & Swank, 2006). Thus, future research is needed to determine whether these 
differences in parental responsiveness persist and if they contribute to subsequent 
decrements in both cognitive and social-emotional development.
Interestingly, the greatest differences in warm responsiveness were found between the OI 
and the complicated mild and moderate TBI groups, rather than between the OI and severe 
TBI groups. This finding is in part accounted for by the fact that the complicated mild TBI 
group had greater injury acuity, as measured by the ISS, than any of the other groups. 
Additionally, the three most severely injured children were unable to complete baseline 
assessments, thereby reducing the sample size and partially masking the effects of severe 
TBI on parent–child interactions. However, these findings also underscore the need to 
understand the impact of TBI among children with presumably less severe injuries.
Group differences were also greater in the context of the structured teaching task, suggesting 
that the influences of TBI on parent–child interactions may be situationally specific, with 
negligible effects in unstructured settings. Similarly, observational studies have found that 
children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder differed from controls more in 
structured, rather than free play, situations (Danforth, Barkley, & Stokes, 1991; Johnston & 
Mash, 2001), in part because parents made greater demands for compliance and had fewer 
opportunities for positive parenting in this context (Chronis et al., 2007).

Our findings suggest that parents do not become more critical toward their children during 
the initial weeks following TBI, contradicting some previous studies of children with other 
conditions (Floyd & Zmich, 1991; Pipp-Siegal & Biringen, 1998). Additionally, although 
parents of children with TBI were more likely to tell their child what to do, they were not 
more likely to restrict their behavior. Given that parents of children with severe TBI were 
also more likely to make statements or verbal scaffolds to facilitate the child’s cognitive 
performance, our findings support the possibility that parents are trying to respond 
effectively to their child. This possibility is considered more fully in the discussion of the 
evidence of mediation.
Contrary to expectations, parental depressive symptoms were not related to warm 
responsiveness after controlling for census-based income and race. Because depressive 
symptoms were correlated with income and race, controlling for these factors before 
examining the effects of depression may have obscured the influence of parental 
psychological adjustment on responsiveness. The fact that only modest zero-order 
correlations were found between depressive symptoms and warm responsiveness (see Table 
2) provides limited support for this possibility. Additionally, the groups did not differ in 
mean levels of depressive symptoms or in the proportion of parents with clinically 
significant depressive symptoms (Stancin, Wade, Walz, Yeates, & Taylor, in press). In a 
recent study, Haskett and Willoughby (2006) reported similar findings regarding the 
relationship between maternal depression and parenting behaviors. In their study, depression 
was only a significant predictor when the level of depression was clinically significant. In 
the current study, only 11% of parents reported clinically significant symptoms, making it 
unlikely that significant depression would explain differences in responsiveness in the 
current cohort. Thus, the relationship between parental depression and warm responsiveness 
may be more complex than initially thought.
A second possible mechanism of effect involves influences of the child’s temperament and 
ability to self-regulate on parental sensitivity and responsiveness (Vaughn & Bost, 1999). 
Because TBI adversely alters child behavior and self-regulation, we anticipated that child 
behavior would influence parental warm responsiveness, with less child regulation and 
cooperation resulting in less parental warm responsiveness. This expectation was partially 
supported. The child’s behavior regulation partially mediated the association between the 
injury group and parental warm responsiveness, suggesting that parents of children with TBI 
are responding differently to their children in part because of differences in their child’s 
ability to self-regulate. Child behaviors also mediated the association between injury group 
and parental directiveness, providing further evidence that observed differences in parenting 
are driven, in part, by differences in the child’s behavior. However, the fact that group 
remained a significant predictor of parental responsiveness with child behavior regulation in 
the model indicates that changes in the child’s behavior do not fully explain observed group 
differences in parental warm responsiveness.
We also found, in the case of the child’s level of cooperation, that the nature and severity of 
the injury moderated the association between the child’s behavior and the parent’s warm 
responsiveness. Specifically, no relationship was found between child cooperation and 
parental warm responsiveness in the TBI group, suggesting a disruption in the feedback loop

between parent and child. These findings suggest that child behavior influences parent warm 
responsiveness to some extent following TBI but that TBI may also alter the reciprocity 
between parent and child.
Although reasons for this disruption are unclear, parents may spend more time structuring 
and directing the child’s behavior following TBI even when the child is relatively well 
regulated, allowing for fewer opportunities to be warmly responsive to the child’s needs and 
wants. Our finding that parents in the TBI group made more statements that directed the 
child’s behavior during the teaching task is consistent with this possibility. Furthermore, in a 
recent review of the impact of developmental disabilities on parent–child interaction and 
attachment, Howe (2006) concluded that disabilities that affect communication or create 
difficulties in interpreting the child’s needs and behavior are likely to result in less 
responsive caregiving. Thus, the reciprocity between parent and child may become disrupted 
following TBI by an increased need for maternal direction of the child’s behavior 
accompanied by difficulties in reading the child’s signals. Anecdotally, many parents report 
that it feels as though they have a new child after a major brain injury. Therefore, the parent 
may have greater difficulty interpreting the child’s cues and responding appropriately. The 
finding that parents of children with severe TBI made more verbal statements (scaffolds) to 
facilitate the child’s problem solving than did those in the OI group suggests that parents 
may be trying to be responsive to their child’s changing needs. In other words, TBI may 
have precipitated changes in the nature of the parent–child reciprocity rather than less 
responsive parenting (Floyd & Costigan, 1997).
Because we did not examine parental stereotypes or overprotection, our findings do not 
preclude the possibility that changing parental perceptions of the child, unrelated to the 
child’s actual behavior, influenced the parent’s actions toward the child (Holmbeck et al., 
2002; Stern et al., 2000). Parental stereotypes regarding TBI could account for the reduced 
reciprocity between child and parent in the TBI group. However, if parents of children with 
TBI are behaving differently toward their child because of assumptions or stereotypes 
regarding the effects of brain injury, these differences should diminish over time as the 
parent develops a clearer understanding of how TBI has affected his or her own child (Stern 
et al., 2000). Thus, research is needed to understand how group differences in parenting 
behaviors change over time.
We included race and income in the models to control for their influences prior to examining 
group effects and potential mediators. Notably, race and income were associated with some 
of the parenting behaviors, accounting for significant variance in parental responsiveness 
and negativity but not in directives and restrictions. These findings are consistent with 
previous investigations indicating that social and demographic characteristics influence 
parental response to TBI (see Yeates et al., 2002). Although more extensive consideration of 
racial and SES influences on parenting is beyond the scope of the current article, we should 
note the importance of considering demographic, cultural, and injury-related characteristics 
that influence parental beliefs and behavior when working with families following TBI.
Several limitations should be noted. First, the coding system used a combination of global 
ratings and behavioral counts. An interval coding system that could capture the parent’s

response to specific acts of child compliance or noncompliance may have provided greater 
sensitivity to changes in parent–child interaction arising from TBI. Second, the families of 
children with TBI and the families of children with OI differed on several background 
characteristics, including median family income and parent race, which were related to 
parent–child interactions. Although we failed to detect any recruitment bias and controlled 
for background factors in the analysis, group differences in demographic characteristics may 
have contributed to observed differences in parent–child behaviors. Third, parent–child 
interactions may have differed by group prior to the injury, though the groups did not differ 
on retrospective reports of preinjury family functioning or preinjury child behavior (Stancin 
et al., in press). Finally, the lack of parent report regarding present child behavior constitutes 
a limitation; however, we will be able to examine postinjury child behavior in relation to 
parent–child interactions as part of subsequent follow-up assessments of the sample.
These findings have potentially important implications for understanding recovery following 
TBI in young children and for developing interventions to improve outcomes. Previous 
research suggests that parental warmth and responsiveness facilitate cognitive growth and 
development, whereas parental direction and control hamper it, with the parent’s contingent 
responsiveness to the child providing feedback that is essential for social and emotional 
development (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978; Landry et al., 2001; Smith et al., 
2006). Furthermore, children with neurological risk factors, such as TBI, may benefit more 
from warm responsive parenting (Landry, Garner, Swank, & Baldwin, 1996). Thus, the 
relationship between warm responsive parenting and recovery from TBI needs to be 
examined over time. Specifically, does the apparent decrement in parent–child reciprocity 
persist over time, and does it contribute to less recovery and poorer subsequent development 
in language, cognitive abilities, and social competence? Alternatively, does parental warm 
responsiveness moderate social and cognitive outcomes over time, with consistently high 
levels of warm responsiveness predicting a better recovery trajectory in the TBI group? By 
following these children over time, we will be able to determine the role of warmly 
responsive parenting across short- and long-term recovery following TBI. Recent studies 
with parents of children with very low birth weight have shown that these parenting 
behaviors can be increased through intervention, resulting in improved cognitive 
development (Smith, Landry, & Swank, 2005). These findings raise the possibility that 
parenting interventions could be adapted to improve developmental outcomes following 
pediatric TBI.

Note. Parental race and census tract income served as covariates in each of the analyses. Parent play indicates that these ratings were from the free play segment. Parent teaching task indicates that these 
ratings were from the teaching task segment. Warm responsive and negativity ratings were on a 5-point scale (range 1–5), with higher scores corresponding to more positive behavior (e.g., greater 
responsiveness, less negativity). Scaffolds, directives, and restrictions were counts of the frequency of those behaviors summed across the two 5-min play and teaching task segments. Dashes indicate that 
effect sizes were not reported for nonsignificant group comparisons. TBI = traumatic brain injury; OI = orthopedic injuries.
aComplicated mild TBI > OI; p < .05.
bModerate TBI > OI; p < .05.

Note. Parental race and census tract income served as covariates in each of the analyses. Child warmth, cooperation, and behavior regulation ratings were on a 5-point scale (range 1–5), with higher scores 
corresponding to more positive behavior (e.g., greater warmth, higher levels of cooperation). Dashes indicate that effect sizes were not reported for nonsignificant group comparisons. TBI = traumatic brain 
injury; OI = orthopedic injuries.
aThe severe TBI group was significantly different from the OI group (p < .05).
bThe complicated mild TBI group was significantly different from the OI group (p < .05).
