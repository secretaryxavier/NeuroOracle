Psychiatric disorders are remarkable health problems that cause a 
massive social and economic burden, and the issue of their long-term 
and effective treatment is subjected to discussion. The effect of physical 
activity and exercise is under investigation in the treatment of the major 
depressive disorder (MDD) and schizophrenia which are accompanied by 
cognitive dysfunctions. Scientists focus on the positive effects of exercise 
on learning, memory and attention parameters while investigating the 
regulatory role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). In this 
review, the effect of aerobic exercise on peripheral BDNF levels in MDD 
and schizophrenia is examined by including human studies in which 
acute and chronic aerobic exercise are applied. The results showed that 
aerobic exercise caused different responses on BDNF levels, and some 
of the studies were accompanied by the improvement in cognitive 
functions in BDNF changes. In order to comprehend the effect of aerobic 
exercise in MDD and schizophrenia, it is understood that applying 
studies on larger and paired participant groups with different exercise 
frequencies and tensions in necessary.

Epidemiological studies indicate that physical activity and exercise can 
prevent and delay the initiation and development of psychiatric disorders 
and have therapeutic effects when used as supportive therapy. Numerous 
animal models and human studies have shown that exercise promotes 
psychological health and well-being, increases cognitive performance 
and functional recovery, and provides a series of structural changes in the 
brain (1, 2). Due to its roles in learning and memory, this research focuses 
on the hippocampus and also emphasizes the mechanisms of plasticity 
triggered by exercise in the prefrontal cortex where executive functions 
are embedded (3). It is considered that the mediators in the relationship 
between exercise and the brain may be myokines secreted by muscles 
that act as a secretory organ in the periphery, as well as a series of growth 
factors. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a member of the family 
of neurotrophic factors involved in neuronal transport, modulation, and 
plasticity, has become the focus of research seeking an understanding of 
the relationship between exercise and the brain. 
BDNF
BDNF, secreted from both the central nervous system and peripheral 
tissues, is a protein of the neurotrophin family, including the nerve growth 
factor, neurotrophin-3 and neurotrophin-4/5. This structure, which is 
synthesized in the form of pre-pro-BDNF in the endoplasmic reticulum 
and which moves to the trans-golgi network through the Golgi body, is 
secreted as mature BDNF or pro-BDNF and is stored in platelets at a high 
level (4). BDNF, with the sources of neurons, microglia and astrocytes in 
the brain, are also secreted from vascular endothelium, lymphocytes and 
smooth/striated muscles. Tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB), one of 
the BDNF receptors, binds to the mature BDNF while p75 (low-afﬁnity 
nerve growth factor receptor) binds to pro-BDNF.
BDNF was ﬁrst isolated from the tissue of pig brains in 1982 and detected 
in human blood in 1995. It has been reported to cross the blood-brain 
barrier and the serum and plasma levels of BDNF have been associated 
with age, gender, and body mass index (5). BDNF is a protein that affects 
neuronal survival, neurogenesis and neuroplasticity in the central nervous 
system and play a role in cell differentiation, axon and dendrite growth, 
synapse formation and synaptic plasticity, and its expression and release 
are related to neuronal activity. BDNF is critical for synaptic formation 
in dopaminergic, glutamatergic and serotonergic neuronal conduction 
and cognitive processes. The main effect of BDNF is on synaptic 
function and neuronal morphology in a region-speciﬁc manner (6). It is 
responsible for short-term memory and long-term memory potentiation 
and performs tasks related to remembering, cognition, emotional state, 
spatial direction, and learning (7). BDNF messenger RNA (mRNA) has 
been widely observed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. BDNF-
containing vesicles are found in both the axonal terminals and dendrites, 
and BDNF is also secreted from astrocytes (8). BDNF secretion may be 
via Ca2+ inﬂux from the postsynaptic or presynaptic area Ca2+ inﬂux or 
Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (9). Studies reporting the cognitive 
beneﬁts of exercise suggest that BDNF is involved in this mechanism (10, 
11). Animal studies showed that BDNF and tropomyosin receptor kinase 
B (TrkB) receptor activation was increased in various brain regions during 
and after exercise, while human studies detected peripheral BDNF in the 
serum and plasma and found a relationship between the cerebral and

peripheral BDNF levels, which varied according to the type, duration and 
frequency of exercise in different studies (12–14).
Exercise, BDNF and Cognition 
Meta-analytical reviews indicate that acute and chronic aerobic exercise 
has a developmental effect on cognition with the most dramatic effect seen 
on its executive functions (15). In this area, where the mechanism of action 
is not fully elucidated, BDNF is suggested to have a potential mechanism. 
The BDNF response to aerobic exercise has been investigated in the 
literature in relation to different acute and chronic exercise programs at 
different doses. In addition to aerobic exercise-induced BDNF responses, 
these studies have also examined cognitive performance ﬁndings. The 
method generally used in the studies examining the effects of aerobic 
exercise on BDNF and cognition is the measurement of the BDNF level 
before and after exercise and the application of cognitive tests. The effect 
of BDNF on cognition has been explored mainly through memory tasks. 
The deﬁnition of the hippocampus as the main site for BDNF expression 
in the brain (16) its effect on memory tasks makes this choice meaningful. 
Although human studies offer limited opportunities to monitor BDNF 
levels in the brain, it has been found that the peripheral BDNF levels, 
hippocampal volume, and spatial memory results are correlated (17).
Effect of Exercise on BDNF and Cognitive Function in Healthy 
Individuals 
Meta-analytical reviews examining the effect of acute exercise on 
peripheral BDNF (18) reported contradictory results, but predominantly 
indicated an increase in BDNF and agreed that this increase was 
transient. On the other hand, due to the different methods used in these 
studies, it is established that the responses detected were not completely 
consistent. After 30 minutes of acute exercise, an increase was observed 
in the cognitive functions and BDNF levels of healthy subjects evaluated 
by the Face Recognition Test and the Stroop Test, but the relationship 
between the two parameters was not evaluated (19). 
In a review suggesting a positive relationship between exercise severity 
and peripheral BDNF levels, it was reported that high-intensity acute 
exercise provided the greatest increase in BDNF in healthy subjects. On 
the other hand, the BDNF level returned to baseline between 10 and 60 
minutes (18). After 20 minutes of intense exercise, healthy individuals 
showed improvement in cognitive ﬁndings and BDNF levels assessed by 
the visual spatial perception test, and a signiﬁcant relationship was found 
between motor memory and BDNF data (20).
In a study evaluating cognitive performance by the reaction time in the 
Visual Spatial Attention Test and EEG after 30 minutes of moderate acute 
exercise in non-trained individuals, the BDNF levels increased and the 
reaction time decreased in exercise groups. The neuroelectric signals, 
which were interpreted as increased attention in EEG (P3 amplitude) and 
readiness to respond to stimulus (CNV amplitude), were only increased 
in trained individuals. A signiﬁcant relationship between BDNF and 
cognitive performance levels was not found. The researchers interpreted 
their results as cardiovascular ﬁtness being involved in the mechanism of 
action of exercise on cognition (21).
A study conducted with healthy subjects that performed severe acute 
aerobic exercise evaluated the BDNF level, inhibitory control using the 
Stroop Test, and cognitive ﬂexibility using Part B of the Trail-Making Test, 
and reported increased cognitive success ﬁndings and BDNF levels. A 
signiﬁcant relationship was found between the increased BDNF level 
and cognitive ﬂexibility success ﬁndings. The authors suggested that 
improvement in cognitive performance related to the prefrontal area in 
response to acute exercise could be attributed to an increase in the BDNF 
level (10).
In another study conducted in healthy individuals, the BDNF level and 
executive functions were evaluated using the Wisconsin Card Sorting 
Test before and after high-intensity intermittent exercise, and while the 
plasma BDNF level did not change, the serum BDNF level increased. 
According to the results of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the number 
of categories completed and the number of correct responses increased, 
and the number of total and recurrent errors decreased. The authors 
did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant relationship between BDNF concentration 
and the results of executive functions related to the prefrontal cortex; 
however, they commented that cognitive performance responded more 
to the increased intensity of exercise (22). It was also reported that 
the increase in BDNF after acute aerobic exercise was associated with 
exercise duration. The increase in BDNF was signiﬁcantly higher than in 
exercise lasting longer than 30 minutes compared to exercise for less than 
30 minutes. This can be interpreted as different exercise times affecting 
brain functions differently. In a study on acute exercise and its effect on 
cognitive functions, it was shown that cognitive beneﬁt emerged only 
through exercise lasting longer than 20 minutes (23). Other studies 
suggested that the duration and intensity of exercise produced the best 
result related to moderate exercise, and therefore the effect of regular 
exercise on BDNF and cognition was more dramatic (18, 24). Regular 
exercise increases the BDNF level in the hippocampus and improves 
learning and memory processes.
Chronic exercise in children and young adults improved working 
memory, selective attention, and inhibitory control ﬁndings (25). In a 
six-month aerobic exercise study conducted with elderly men, the gray 
matter volume increased and the peripheral BDNF increased in the 
prefrontal and cingulate cortex areas associated with increased physical 
activity (26).	
Effect of Exercise on BDNF and Cognitive Function in Major 
Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Schizophrenia
MDD, which is one of the leading causes of global disease burden, 
manifests with cognitive and somatic symptoms. In recent years, BDNF 
has been used as a biomarker in psychiatric disorders, such as MDD, 
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and the BDNF level has been shown 
to be lower in patient groups than in healthy individuals (27–29). It 
was suggested that the BDNF level is lower in MDD cases, and a higher 
level BDNF is associated with less depressive symptoms and improved 
cognitive functions compared to the healthy population (30, 31). In 
case studies, granular neuron loss, reduced hippocampal volume, and 
regressed peripheral level of BDNF and BDNF mRNA expression in 
lymphocytes were reported (32), and suicidal behavior was associated 
with a low peripheral/cerebral BDNF level (in the hippocampus and 
prefrontal cortex) (33). It was found that the peripheral level of BDNF 
could be used to predict the response to antidepressant treatment in 
MDD, and there was an increase in this level in response to drug therapy; 
however, the results regarding the relationship between improvement in 
mood and BDNF increase were contradictory (34).
It is not yet clear whether the clinical manifestation of the BDNF variant 
Val66Met is a risk factor for MDD. However, in a review, it was proposed that 
this variant reduced the response to drug treatment (35). Schizophrenia, 
on the other hand, is a severe mental disorder characterized by psychosis 
and generally presents with cognitive dysfunctions related to problem 
solving, memory, and executive functions (36). Animal models have 
drawn attention to the role of BDNF in the development and activation 
of psychosis-related neurotransmitters. It is stated that the changes in 
the BDNF level may contribute to neuroplasticity disorder during brain 
development and synaptic connection disorders, and the morphological, 
neurochemical and cell architecture anomalies observed in the brain in 
schizophrenia (37). It is well known that in schizophrenia, neurocognitive 
losses are observed in memory, attention, processing speed, and executive

functions. A meta-analytical review of 16 studies reported that patients 
with schizophrenia had signiﬁcantly lower peripheral BDNF (27), with 
memory disturbances and smaller hippocampal volume ﬁndings being 
associated with a reduced BDNF level (38). In untreated psychosis, the 
serum BDNF level was shown to be low and correlated with the duration 
of psychosis, and drug-induced psychosis models indicated a relationship 
between a reduced BDNF mRNA concentration and psychotic symptoms 
(39). The visual spatial memory performance and attention were found to 
be poor in schizophrenia patients with the BDNF Val66Met variant, and 
a low BDNF level was observed to be correlated with reduced cognitive 
functions (40).
MATERIAL AND METHODS
For this review, human studies published in English were cross-searched 
on the PubMed and Web of Science search engines using the keywords 
BDNF-exercise-cognition-major depressive disorder/schizophrenia and 
BDNF-exercise-major depressive disorder/schizophrenia and those that 
only included aerobic exercise were selected. Two studies examined the 
effect of aerobic exercise on cognition and BDNF in schizophrenia, three 
examined the effect of aerobic exercise on cognition and BDNF in MDD, 
and seven studies examined the effect of aerobic exercise on BDNF in 
MDD. Three of the studies used acute and nine used chronic aerobic 
exercise as a method. The total number of participants in 12 studies was 
385. In MDD and schizophrenia, the responses of peripheral BDNF to 
exercise, the relationship between exercise and cognitive performance 
ﬁndings, and the underlying mechanism of these responses were 
discussed, and how BDNF and cognitive functions changed with aerobic 
exercise was examined.
RESULTS
The ﬁndings suggest that aerobic exercise increases the peripheral 
BDNF level. No signiﬁcant increase in BDNF was observed in three of 
the MDD studies, whereas a signiﬁcant increase in BDNF was noted 
in all the remaining studies. While four studies examining BDNF and 
cognitive performance ﬁndings together showed a signiﬁcant increase 
in both parameters, the improvement in cognitive performance was not 
accompanied by an increase in BDNF in one of the studies.
DISCUSSION
Effects of Exercise in MDD 
It is reported that 5% of the global population has been diagnosed with 
MDD and 1% with schizophrenia, and 20-30% of all of these patients are 
resistant to treatment (41– 43). It is known that in MDD, the workload 
capacity of individuals is reduced by 80 to 90% compared to their healthy 
counterparts, and physical activity is decreased in schizophrenia and is 
accompanied by cognitive disorders (44, 45). 
Studies have shown that neuronal activity affects the synthesis, secretion 
and signaling of neurotrophin, which has an impact on the postsynaptic 
response, synaptic morphology, presynaptic transmitter secretion, and 
membrane excitability. 
In nine of the 12 studies we reviewed, an increase in BDNF was reported 
in the period following aerobic exercise (46–54). These data seem to 
agree with the premise that exercise contributes to the promotion and 
maintenance of neuron functions through a mechanism mediated 
by neurotrophins. It has been suggested that one of the mechanisms

responsible for increased BDNF may be the increase in the cerebral 
blood ﬂow. Another proposition is that exercise-related increase in the 
insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and norepinephrine levels may increase 
the expression of BDNF mRNA. It has also been argued that decreased 
blood volume due to water loss may increase the BDNF concentration.
BDNF plays several important roles in synaptic plasticity and affects 
different aspects of synaptic transmission. In the central nervous 
system, BDNF can increase the number of excitatory and inhibitory 
synapses by regulating axonal morphology or directly improving 
synapse formation (6). Furthermore, it enhances the maturation and 
stabilization of neurotransmitter secretion at the cellular and molecular 
level, which increases the number of functional synapses. It regulates 
the increase in proteins involved in neurogenesis, learning and memory, 
and neuronal survival, including those regulating the protein quality 
control, mitochondrial biogenesis, and the resistance of cells to oxidative, 
metabolic and proteotoxic stress. In the literature, it has been reported 
that BDNF secreted from the cerebral endothelium following acute 
aerobic exercise was responsible for the effect of exercise on cognition 
(55). This function of BDNF appears to be consistent with the memory 
responses obtained from studies that included the ﬁndings of cognitive 
function in this review. 
The mechanism of action of BDNF on neuroplasticity is claimed to be 
through increasing the calcium mRNA, cAMP response binding protein 
(CREB), and synapse I level (56). Exercise can produce persistent increases 
in phosphorylated CREB and BDNF levels that continue throughout the 
exercise period. An exercise-induced increase in BDNF levels increases 
the expression of key presynaptic molecules associated with synaptic 
transmission, such as synapse I and synaptophysin with a vesicular 
function at the presynaptic nerve terminals. Especially in glutamatergic 
synapses, BDNF plays a key role in initiating signal transduction with 
the TrkB and p75 receptors in regulating activity-dependent synaptic 
structure and function. Mature BDNF primarily stimulates the TrkB 
receptor, while proBDNF targets the p75 receptor. Mature BDNF binds to 
the extracellular domain of receptor TrkB and activates phosphorylated 
TrkB, phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK), phospholipase-Cγ (PLCγ) and guanosine triphosphate 
(GTPase) pathways. The PI3K pathway showing an antiapoptotic effect 
modulates the synaptic plasticity of N-methyl-D-aspartate   (NMDA) 
receptors and increases dendritic growth and branching  (Figure 1) (57).
The PLCγ pathway is responsible for increased CaMKII and CREB activation 
through the secretion of intracellular Ca2+. The MAPK signal is required 
for the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and CREB. 
This pathway is important for the synthesis of the cytoskeleton protein, 
as well as dendritic growth and branching in hippocampal neurons. The 
activation of the GTPase pathway stimulates the synthesis of actin and 
microtubules, resulting in the growth of neuronal ﬁbers (58). The BDNF 
responses seen in the reviewed studies on chronic aerobic exercise may 
be related to increased CREB phosphorylation of the repetitive stimulus, 
leading to prolonged structural and functional changes in synapses. It is 
reported that the CREB function in activity-dependent long-term neuronal 
plasticity is a necessary molecule for long-term memory formation. It has 
been reported that by increasing the presence and activity of CaMKII 
and BDNF levels and reducing calcineurin phosphatase levels, exercise 
boosts the synthesis of important signaling molecules that are critical for 
learning and memory (59). 
In their study with MDD cases, Gourgouvellis et al. observed an 
increase in the BDNF level and visual learning, memory and recognition 
memory performance following cognitive behavioral therapy and 
aerobic exercise (48). In accordance with these results, in the literature, 
increased BDNF and CREB mRNA levels were associated with exercise 
in mice, and the highest BDNF expression was associated with the 
highest CREB expression and spatial memory ability (60). In another 
study, it was found that exercise increased the active CREB form, 
and the learning ability of mice was also signiﬁcantly increased after 
exercise, and the highest elevation in the BDNF level belonged to those 
that learned fastest (61). 
The acute aerobic exercise studies included in this review (53, 54) also 
reported elevated BDNF levels. Considering the studies that did not 
report an increase in BDNF in response to chronic aerobic exercise, it 
can be regarded that transient BDNF elevations are responsible for the 
chronic beneﬁts of exercise in MDD. It could be the case that exercise has 
a curative effect through transient elevations in BDNF without long-term 
changes in basal BDNF, which leads to long-term neurophysiological 
changes. The clinical effectiveness of exercise in curing MDD may also 
result from its favorable effects on monoaminergic function, neurogenesis, 
and immunity. Exercise causes changes in markers associated with the 
monoamine metabolism, including monoamine, monoamine receptors, 
and carriers, and among these changes are the activation of serotonergic 
neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) by low-intensity exercise. It 
has been suggested that the effect of exercise on serotonergic activity 
can explain its curative effect on depressive symptoms. The central 
serotonergic system is built into the DRN and has projections over 
large areas of the brain. It is considered that exercise demonstrates 
its antidepressant effect through the serotonergic neurons in DRN. 
Accordingly, increased serotonin synthesis, metabolism, and secretion 
are observed during and after exercise. It has been shown that exercise 
has the effects of inducing hippocampal BDNF expression by increasing 
the NE/5-HT levels of antidepressants. This has led to the hypothesis 
that increased BDNF mRNA expression associated with exercise 
may be initiated by monoaminergic activation. Studies indicate that 
noradrenaline-mediated signaling may be particularly important in the 
modulation of the BDNF gene expression through exercise. These results 
conﬁrm that noradrenaline stimulation is an important initial event in 
cellular mechanisms, leading to improved BDNF transcription following 
physical exercise. Together with antidepressants, exercise is thought to 
have a similar effect on the induction of noradrenaline activation and 
increase in BDNF via β-adrenergic receptors (Figure 2) (62).
Evidence from human and animal studies has shown that monoaminergic 
hypofunction is a curable component of depression (63). Therefore, 
antidepressant drugs have been developed to increase serotonergic (5-

However, three of the reviewed studies showed that aerobic exercise did 
not cause an increase in BDNF in cases with MDD (69–71). Consistent 
with these results, a meta-analysis in the literature reported that chronic 
aerobic exercise did not affect the BDNF level in MDD and suggested that 
the predominance of female patients in the sample included in the study 
might have led to this ﬁnding (72). The authors reported that the cerebral 
blood ﬂow, blood volume, and other circulating neurotransmitters 
might be the cause of the exercise-triggered changes in neuronal 
life, synaptogenesis, and neural circuitry. In another chronic aerobic 
exercise study conducted with healthy individuals by the same group of 
researchers, the ﬁndings indicated a rapid increase in the BDNF level in 
men following exercise, but no changes were observed in women (73).
Effects of Exercise in Schizophrenia
BDNF, which increases the expression of dopamine receptors in the 
brain by mimicking the effect of antipsychotic drugs, is reported to 
regress manic mood (74, 75). Similarly, schizophrenia studies have 
shown that exercise improves cognitive abilities and physical health (2, 
76) and that low-level BDNF is associated with negative symptoms and 
may contribute to the psychopathology of the disease (77). 
Since BDNF is widely distributed throughout the central nervous system 
and plays a role in various psychiatric disorders, impairment in BDNF 
signaling is not speciﬁc to schizophrenia. However, considering the 
effect of BDNF on the plasticity and neuronal viability of dopaminergic, 
serotonergic, and cholinergic neurons, and the importance of all these 
pathways in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, it can be concluded 
that BDNF can be a useful biological marker for the clinical status and/
or prognosis of people with this disease. 
In the schizophrenia studies included in this review (46, 47), the increase 
in the peripheral BDNF level and the improved cognitive performance 
ﬁndings in response to exercise support the idea that exercise can 
enhance neurotrophic and neuroprotective mechanisms, and thus 
leading to an improvement in the symptoms of schizophrenia. One of 
the possible ways in which aerobic exercise improves the symptoms 
of schizophrenia is that it enhances drug efﬁcacy by affecting the 
pharmacokinetics of antipsychotics, for example, by changing drug 
distribution and reducing drug excretion (78). 
BDNF is a neurotrophin that is not only related to neuronal protection 
and development but also effective in synaptic regulation, learning, and 
memory. Since BDNF plays an important role in regulating synaptic 
plasticity, schizophrenia deﬁcits can be understood in the context of 
learning and the molecular and cellular mechanisms of memory. 
Concerning 
the 
pathogenesis 
of 
schizophrenia, 
particularly 
neurodevelopmental and neurotoxicity-related factors, neurotrophins, 
such as BDNF can provide an explanatory framework at molecular 
and cellular levels. The synaptic changes that occur due to problems in 
BDNF expression can alter neurotransmitter pathways that are classically 
involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia; e.g., dopaminergic 
and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) systems (79, 80). Abnormal 
BDNF and TrkB mRNA expression in the hippocampus of individuals 
with schizophrenia and mood disorders showed that the main features 
of hippocampal signal transmission and plasticity can be affected in 
these major mental disorders (81). 
In patients with schizophrenia, a deﬁciency in BDNF signaling 
mediated by receptor TrkB can result in decreased GABA synthesis in 
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This may lead to a change in the 
perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal neurons by decreasing the gamma 
neuron activity at synchronized frequencies required for working 
memory. Consistent with the literature, Nuechterlain et al. (47) showed 
Figure 2. Relationship between BDNF and glutamate receptors.
HT) or noradrenergic (NE) neurotransmission to eliminate the effects of 
depression. 
Seven studies (48–54) in this review reported that aerobic exercise in 
MDD increased BDNF, and two demonstrated that elevated BDNF was 
accompanied by improved cognitive functions (48, 49). In the literature, 
the reduced levels of neurotrophic factors and neurogenesis have been 
suggested to contribute to the neurotrophic hypothesis of depression 
(64). It is recommended that antidepressants increase BDNF expression, 
and in turn, BDNF increases the effect of antidepressants using a similar 
neurochemical pathway (65). Considering that neurotrophic factors, 
especially BDNF, can contribute to the treatment of depression, exercise 
can be used as a therapeutic tool. 
It is reported that skeletal muscle secretes cytokine in response to exercise 
and increases interleukin (IL)-6, which then crosses the blood-brain 
barrier and triggers BDNF secretion from platelets. BDNF expression in 
the central nervous system has been found to be strongly associated with 
the IL-6 level and platelet count (66). During acute exercise, the increase 
in IL-6 produced by the working muscles inhibits tumor necrosis factor α 
(TNF-α) and IL-1β expression. Therefore, it is possible that the therapeutic 
effect of exercise on depressive symptoms may prevent proinﬂammatory 
etiology through changes in immune functions. 
The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 
(PGC)-1α also appears to play a role in facilitating the effects of exercise 
on brain health and is part of the mechanism by which exercise induces 
hippocampal BDNF expression. Exercise ﬁrst induces the expression of 
the estrogen-related receptor (ERR) α gene in the brain, then stimulates 
PGC-1α expression. The increased activity of the ERRα/PGC-1α complex 
through exercise induces the expression of the BDNF gene (67). One of 
the reviewed studies, exercise was reported to have a protective effect 
against depression by altering the metabolism of the kynurenine (68). 
The activation of PGC-1α increases the skeletal muscle expression of 
the aminotransferases of kynurenine, protecting the brain from stress-
related changes through the conversion of kynurenine to kynurenic acid, 
a metabolite that cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, and reducing 
plasma kynurenine. These studies indicate that PGC-1α in the muscle and 
brain can mediate the effects of exercise on cognitive functions.

that aerobic exercise increased the peripheral BDNF level in patients 
with schizophrenia and improved working memory ﬁndings. 
In negative symptoms of schizophrenia, the mechanism of glutamate 
dysfunction was implicated, and increased glutamate function was 
shown to have the potential to reduce such symptoms (82). BDNF can 
directly alter glutamate signaling by altering the expression of glutamate 
receptor subunits and Ca2+ regulatory proteins. It can also have an impact 
on glutamate signaling by inducing antioxidant enzyme production, 
energy regulating proteins, and the members of the antiapoptotic Bcl2 
family. Glutamate stimulates BDNF production, which, in turn, affects 
neuronal glutamate sensitivity, Ca2+ homeostasis, and plasticity (83). In the 
early studies examining the relationship between glutamatergic system 
and BDNF, mature BDNF was reported to induce the rapid effects of 
glutamate secretion and the short- and long-term effects of post-synaptic 
responses to neurotransmitters. A study focusing on the acute effect of 
BDNF on the hippocampus neurons of rats found that glutamatergic 
synaptic transmission was increased in 30% of the cells, but this increase 
was not seen when receptor TrkB was inhibited (84). This data suggests 
that presynaptic modiﬁcation is effective in increasing glutamatergic 
synaptic transmission, and BDNF is involved in this modulation. Although 
the studies included in this review did not examine the state of negative 
symptoms in schizophrenia, the improvement in cognitive functions 
was accompanied by elevated BDNF. This improved clinical state can be 
explained by aerobic exercise increasing the use of glutamate by the brain.
A decreased serum BDNF level has been shown to correlate with 
processing speed, attention, executive functions, and poor performance 
in working memory, and the relationship between serum BDNF and 
cognitive test performance has been emphasized. In the schizophrenia 
studies included in this review, the increase in the BDNF level through 
exercise accompanied by improvement in cognitive functions seems to 
be consistent with the literature (85, 86). Exercise may be involved in this 
process through exercise-induced neuronal activity, and it can change 
cognitive performance ﬁndings. Similarly, considering that physical 
health deterioration associated with the lack of physical activity in 
schizophrenia reduces the average life expectancy by 10 to 15 years due 
to suicide, it is possible to comment that exercise also has an effect on life 
expectancy (87).
Reviewing the Findings on MDD and Schizophrenia Together
Exercise appears to be involved in the development of synaptic plasticity 
in the adult hippocampus through a BDNF-mediated mechanism. The 
major area of ​BDNF expression in the brain is the hippocampus. The 
ﬁndings of the MDD and schizophrenia studies included in this review 
being more signiﬁcant for memory performance (47–49, 69) can be 
interpreted in this context, and the relatively less effect of BDNF on the 
other cognitive tasks can also be attributed to this. On the other hand, it 
is known that the BDNF level increases with antidepressant treatment. 
In one of the studies included in this review that detected an increase in 
BDNF (52), 80% of the participants used one or more antidepressants. 
However, in another study in which the participants used antidepressants 
(71) no increase was detected in BDNF. Therefore, in similar studies, the 
effect of drug interaction should also be taken into consideration. The 
contradictory results in the literature may be due to the effect of gender 
on BDNF responses. It has been reported that gender has an effect on the 
relationship between the BDNF level and general cognitive functions in 
schizophrenia, and this relationship is only observed in women (88). In this 
review, homogeneous groups were not included in the studies examined, 
and the effect of BDNF and cognitive functions were observed in mixed 
groups. In aerobic exercise studies, the duration and intensity of exercise 
can also have an impact on the results. In one study that did not report 
an increase in BDNF, exercise duration was limited to three weeks, and 
no data was provided on exercise intensity. Among the chronic aerobic 
exercise studies included in this review, the longest exercise intervention 
lasted 12 weeks. Longer regular exercise programs can produce different 
ﬁndings. It should also be kept in mind that increased BDNF responses 
after exercise may be related to the basal BDNF level of the individual. 
In future studies, considering the number and function of platelets 
known to store BDNF can offer new insights. It has been reported that 
the responses of BDNF to exercise in healthy individuals are affected 
by a number of different variables, such as age, gender, exercise type, 
exercise duration, and body mass index (89, 90). Therefore, examining 
the effect of exercise in psychiatric disorders indicates the need for 
more homogeneous study groups. In brief, the psychological effect of 
exercise on cognition is associated with increased autonomic response, 
physical well-being, and increased quality of life, whereas the mechanism 
of action of BDNF in this review is evaluated under the framework of a 
biological basis.
The proposition that BDNF may facilitate improvement in cognitive 
functions in disorders that involve structural changes to the brain requires 
further investigation. The limited number of studies we reviewed and the 
absence of a signiﬁcant change in the BDNF level in three of the studies 
(69–71) make it difﬁcult to make a comprehensive generalization on the 
subject. 
CONCLUSION
Although there are studies showing that exercise is protective for 
brain health, affects cognition and mood, and regresses symptoms 
in psychiatric disorders, the number of studies discussing cognitive 
performance and BDNF responses in depression and schizophrenia 
is limited. Despite all these limitations and contradictory results, there 
are more studies showing that exercise provides an increase in the 
BDNF level. Studies examining the cognitive performance ﬁndings have 
obtained data revealing the enhancing effect of exercise, especially on 
memory responses. Although it does not diminish the importance of 
traditional therapies, exercise can be considered as a low-cost supportive 
treatment for MDD and schizophrenia. The dynamic nature of the brain 
can allow for a positive effect of exercise as an external factor on these 
disease processes, and support individuals’ functionality in everyday 
life by increasing their ability to adapt. The promotion of behavioral 
approaches, such as exercise can contribute to the improvement of the

general health state by increasing the general well-being of the person, as 
well as regressing chronic and treatment-resistant psychiatric disorders. 
By learning more at the molecular level about the pathways underlying 
synaptic plasticity, we can go one step further in ﬁnding protective and 
curative ways to ensure brain health, which may also include increasing 
BDNF. Further studies planned with larger and homogeneous participant 
groups and different intensity and intensity of exercise will lead the way 
to providing an understanding of the effect of exercise on the prevention 
and treatment of psychiatric disorders.
