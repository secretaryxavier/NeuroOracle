Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis still remains a major public health crisis
globally. With the emergence of newer active tuberculosis disease, the
requirement of prolonged treatment time and adherence to therapy till its
completion necessitates the search of newer therapeutics, targeting human
host factors. The current work utilized statistical meta-analysis of human gene
transcriptomes of active pulmonary tuberculosis disease obtained from six
public datasets. The meta-analysis resulted in the identiﬁcation of 2038
signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the active tuberculosis
disease. The gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed that these genes were major
contributors in immune responses. The pathway enrichment analyses
identiﬁed from various human canonical pathways are related to other
infectious diseases. In addition, the comparison of the DEGs with the
tuberculosis genome wide association study (GWAS) datasets revealed the
presence of few genetic variants in their proximity. The analysis of protein
interaction networks (human and Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and host
directed drug-target interaction network led to new candidate drug targets
for drug repurposing studies. The current work sheds light on host genes and
pathways enriched in active tuberculosis disease and suggest potential drug
repurposing targets for host-directed therapies.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease which remained throughout human history.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the main causative agent of TB. Around 10% of
individuals develop TB when exposed to Mtb and 5% of the infected individuals develop TB
within 1-2 years while the remaining 5% develop the disease at any other time (Frieden

et al., 2003). Active TB has higher burden of TB when compared
to latent TB (Lee, 2016). Individuals with compromised immune
systems, such as people with HIV, diabetes or people with
constant tobacco use are at high risk of falling ill.
TB is the 13th leading cause of death globally in 2020. Around
86% of new cases reported around the world in 2020 were
contributed majorly by China, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh and South Africa with India
leading the list (WHO, 2021). Over the period of time Mtb has
adopted newer subversion strategies to successfully evade the host
immune system enabling it to reside in the host resulting in latent
or active disease manifestation (Behar et al., 2010; Ernst, 2018).
The infection results in a complex dynamics between the host
and pathogen triggering various immune signalling cascades and
cross-talks between molecular components (Casadevall and
Pirofski, 2000). Several contributing factors associated with the
disease were identiﬁed through genetic and biochemical
experimental studies. The recent surge of omics data has further
aided in understanding offactors inﬂuencing predisposition of the
disease and markers associated with the disease severity.
With increased availability of gene expression data, studies based
on TB blood transcriptomics offers a robust approach to study the
immunology of TB. The comparative studied of healthy and TB
cohorts shed light on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and also
allow observations of such DEG upon vaccine/drug treatment.
Further the DEG analysis also aids in understanding of regulatory
mechanisms contributing to the functional consequences.
In the current study, a statistical meta-analysis was carried
out using whole blood expression proﬁles from infected TB
patients to identify key human transcriptomics signatures
characteristic of the disease. The study also utilized host
genetic disease association and drug-repurposing analyses to
further to prioritize the results. In addition, the gene ontology
and pathway-based annotations identiﬁed genes and pathways
signiﬁcantly altered in the diseased condition.
Materials and methods
Dataset selection and processing
The whole-blood microarray gene expression proﬁles of
patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and healthy
cohorts were retrieved from NCBI GEO (Barrett et al., 2013).
The datasets were further ﬁltered based on the following
conditions: (i) The expression proﬁles were from human
patients affected by tuberculosis undergoing no prior
treatment, (ii) Only samples from active tuberculosis patients
and control groups were considered, (iii) The datasets should
include both healthy controls and patient group, (iv) The patient
or the control group should not be infected with any other
secondary diseases, (v) The patient and control group should
include more than 5 samples each.
The background corrected ﬁles were processed using limma
package in R (Ritchie et al., 2015). The data were quantile
normalized, log transformed and missing values were removed.
The probe identiﬁers were converted to Entrez gene IDs. If
multiple probes are mapped to a single gene, then the average
expression value of the probes were used for the gene. Post
normalization, individual datasets were subjected to Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). PCA was carried out to observe a
distinct separation between the active and control samples.
Statistical meta-analysis and validation
Statistical meta-analysis was carried out using NetworkAnalyst
(Zhou et al., 2019). NetworkAnalyst interprets gene expression data
including meta-analysis, tissue speciﬁc PPI networks, gene
regulatory networks, gene co-expression networks along with
networks for toxicogenomics and pharmacogenomics studies. The
pre-processed expression values were used as input for the web tool.
Differential expression analysis for each dataset was performed
using limma with false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05. The
batch effects were adjusted using ComBat method. The corrected
datasets were merged and statistical meta-analysis was carried out
using INMEX. The combined effect size method for meta-analysis
was used to generate the results. The random effect model which
encloses cross-study heterogeneity was used for meta-analysis.
Differentially expressed genes (DEG) were obtained using FDR
cutoff of 0.01 in the meta-analysis. The DEGs with absolute
combined effect size > 1.5 were chosen for genetic variant
analyses and drug interaction analyses.
Validation of meta-analysis
The strength of the results obtained from meta-analysis was further
validated by comparing the genes expressed in latent and control
samples from the same datasets. Partial Least Square Discriminant
Analysis (PLS-DA) was applied to the DEGs. Signiﬁcant model was
selected by 7-fold cross validation. The model performance was
evaluated using the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
(ROC) curve (AUC). All the above validation process was carried out
using mixOmics package in R (Rohart et al., 2017).
Gene and pathway enrichment
Gene and pathway enrichment analysis was carried out
using DAVID web server to identify signiﬁcantly enriched
Gene ontology (GO) biological processes (BPs) and KEGG
pathways, which were ranked based on the hypergeometric
test with FDR cutoff of 0.05 (Sherman et al., 2022). DAVID
web server offers functional annotation and enrichment analyses
of gene lists provided by the user.

Protein-protein interaction network
construction
A comprehensive human protein-protein interaction
network (hPPI) was constructed. High conﬁdence,
experimentally veriﬁed interactions extracted from STRING
database was used for the construction (Szklarczyk et al.,
2021). The STRING database integrates known and predicted
associations between proteins encompassing physical
interactions and functional associations. Similarly, the
pathogen proteins interacting with host DEG were mined
from various literature sources (Rapanoel et al., 2013; Penn
et al., 2018; Augenstreich and Briken, 2020; Verma et al., 2022).
These data were used to construct human protein – Mtb protein
interaction network (hmPPI).
The highly interconnected components of the hPPI and
hmPPI were identiﬁed using the Cytoscape plugin CytoHubba.
CytoHubba is a user-friendly interface to explore important
nodes in biological networks using various topological metrics.
The hub genes of the networks were identiﬁed using the
topological metrics degree and Maximal Clique Centrality
(MCC) (Chin et al., 2014).
Drug-target interaction
The drug compounds interacting with DEG were retrieved from
DrugBank Version 5 (Wishart et al., 2018). DrugBank is a
comprehensive database which holds information about drugs,
their mechanisms, interactions and targets. Drugs with
experimental or clinical evidence for direct interactions with the
protein were selected. Drugs with pharmacological actions as the
same direction of the DEG and drugs with unknown
pharmacological actions were excluded. Only DEGs with a
combined effect size greater than 1.5 were considered for the analysis.
Genetic variant analysis
The genetic differences between tuberculosis-affected and
healthy individuals can give a mechanistic insight about the
disease and functional implication of the affected gene. The
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) proximal to the DEG
were obtained from GRASP database (P-value < 5e-8) (Leslie
et al., 2014). GRASP database encloses deeply extracted and
annotated database of genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
results enclosing more than 6.2 million SNP-phenotype
association. Similarly, the regulatory SNP were retrieved from
Slidebase database using the enhancer regions of the DEG
(Ienasescu et al., 2016). SlideBase offers a new way of selecting
genes, promoters, enhancers and microRNAs that are
preferentially expressed/used in a speciﬁed set of cells/tissues.
The genomic regions in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the
SNP were collected from SNAP (Johnson et al., 2008). The
association between a gene and its corresponding SNP was
prioritized based on the overlap between the genomic location
of the DEG or its enhancer and LD region of a SNP. The query
tool SNAP enables the identiﬁcation of single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and annotate nearby SNPs in linkage
disequilibrium (proxies) based on HapMap project results.
Results
The work plan and approaches implemented in the current
study is illustrated in Figure 1.
Identiﬁcation and validation of DEG from
meta-analysis
The database querying and ﬁltering identiﬁed around 149
GEO microarray datasets for TB-related host response at the
time of study (June 2022). Further, ﬁltering based on the study
inclusion criteria, a total of six datasets enclosing control and
active TB samples were selected for next set analyses (Table 1).
The results of PCA indicated that the samples were clustered based
on the observations of the study. However, after batch correction the
samples were clustered based on the disease condition as active TB and
control. We also observed a few samples outside the clusters before and
after the batch correction procedure (Figure 2).
When the datasets DEG were compared, we identiﬁed genes
regulated in the same direction. The meta-analysis identiﬁed a total
of 2038 DEG of which 861 genes were up-regulated and 1177 genes
were down-regulated (S. Table 1). Further analysis identiﬁed a total
of 113 genes (up-regulated – 24 and down-regulated- 89) with
absolute combined effect size as a reference for the log2 fold change
(logFC) greater than 1.5 (Table 2). S1PR1 ranks ﬁrst among the up-
regulated genes. S1PR1 expression is associated with lymphocyte
recirculation. Similarly, FCGR1B is the top-ranking gene which is
down-regulated in the active TB. To assess the results obtained from
the meta-analysis, we validated the 113 genes with logFC > 1.5 in
three datasets GSE19444 (Illumina), GSE54992 (Afﬁmetrix) and
GSE62525 (Phalanx) from different platforms. The PLS-DA models
showed good sensitivity (above 85%) and speciﬁcity (above 83%) in
all three datasets. The control, active and latent TB samples formed
three different clusters marking clear differentiation (Figure 3). The
ROC plot for the models suggest that the PLS-DA model can
distinguish active tuberculosis samples from both latent and control
groups with high true positive and low false positive rate (Figure 4).
These measures show that DEG can act as biomarkers for the
detection of active TB cases.

Identiﬁcation of signiﬁcantly enriched
gene ontologies
The functional GO was carried out for the up and down
regulated DEG identiﬁed by the meta-analysis (Table 3). The GO
analysis identiﬁed that up-regulated DEG signiﬁcantly involved
in cellular components (CCs) were nucleoplasm, nucleus and
cytosol. For GO BP analysis, the DEG showed involvement in
mRNA splicing, via spliceosome, cytoplasmic translation and
rRNA processing. Similarly for GO molecular function (MF)
analyses, the DEGs were majorly enriched in RNA binding,
protein binding and ATP binding. The GO CC analysis of down-
regulated DEGs showed involvement in extracellular exosome,
cytosol and lysosome. The GO BP analysis identiﬁed
involvement in defense response to virus, innate immune
response and response to virus. The GO MF analysis showed
enriched functions such as protein binding, protease binding
and MHC class I protein binding.
Identiﬁcation of signiﬁcantly enriched
pathways
The pathway enrichment analysis implemented using
DAVID identiﬁed various dysregulated pathways mediated by
the DEGs (Table 4). The up-regulated DEGs showed enrichment
of pathways involved in Spliceosome, Ribosome and
Nucleocytoplasmic transport. We also observed pathways
overlapping with other infectious diseases such as Herpes
simplex virus 1 infection and Coronavirus disease - COVID-19.
The down-regulated DEGs showed involvement in NOD-
like receptor signaling pathway, Lysosome and other infectious

disease pathways such as Inﬂuenza A, Salmonella infection,
Hepatitis C and Epstein-Barr virus infection. We also observed
the presence of Tuberculosis pathway in the list. The presence of
tuberculosis pathway in our analysis indicated that the genes
identiﬁed in the meta-analysis demonstrate their signiﬁcant
association with the disease.
Protein–protein interaction network
construction
Identifying the physical interactions between the proteins
will provide clues to combat infection. The mapping of 2038
DEGs along with their partners resulted in a network enclosing
325 nodes and 1460 edges (Figure 5). The average number of
neighbours in the hPPI was 15. Around 323 genes showed direct
interactions with their partners. The top ten hub genes which
showed overlaps in degree and MCC measures are RPL10A,
RPS4X, RPS16, RPS23, RPS3, RPS13, RPL7A, RPL4, RPS5 and
RPS6. All the identiﬁed hub genes were ribosomal proteins
involved in RNA binding.
The hmPPI interaction network enclosed 99 nodes and
established 66 connections with an average of 1 connection
between the neighbours (Figure 6). Due to the availability of
limited Mtb-host protein-protein interactions we did not
observe any hub genes based on the topological metrics.
Drug – target interaction

against TB. A total of 22 drugs targeting 8 DEGs were obtained
after the screening process (Table 5). Among them each
compound showed association with at least one target gene
with few exceptions such as ABCB1 which showed interaction
with 14 drugs. Human immunoglobulin G (DB00028) acting on
C5 and FCGR1B were also observed. FYN kinase targeted by the
Fostamatinib was one among the up-regulated genes.
Genetic variant analysis
The detection of drug targets which has human genetic support
by its involvement in the disease pathology may aid in success of the
treatment against the disease by preventing late stage clinical
failures. The evidence of involvement in the disease by the 2038
DEGs was retrieved from genome-wide association study (GWAS)
datasets. A total of 483 TB-related SNPs were obtained from
GRASP database. An overlap between the LD region with a SNP
and the DEG location or the enhancer region suggest strong
association between the SNP and that particular gene. A total of
33 genes showed association with TB-related SNPs (Table 6).
Discussion
Meta-analysis of active tuberculosis
samples
The meta-analysis of transcriptomes in this study identiﬁed
S1PR1 as an up-regulated gene with highest fold change. S1PR1,
by the detection of its ligand S1P in the blood and lymph, is
crucial for naive lymphocytes to access the circulatory system.
S1P-S1PR1 signaling is crucial for regulating immune cell
development and function. S1P-S1PR1 signaling is needed for
mature thymocytes to leave the thymus and for T/B cells to leave
secondary lymphoid organs and enter the blood or lymph in
both homeostatic and pathological situations (Sinha et al., 2009;
Zachariah and Cyster, 2010; Allende et al., 2010; Zhang et al.,
2012). S1PR1 analog therapy raises IL-6 and lowers IL-10, but it
can’t stop the mycobacterial infection inside the cell (Arish and
Naz, 2022). Consequently, the diminished expression of S1PR1
causes retention of naïve T cells in lymphoid tissues (Skon et al.,

2013). Similarly, FCGR1B is the top ranking gene with highest
fold change and is down-regulated in the active TB condition.
The FCGR1B gene is a member of immunoglobulin G, which
binds directly with pathogens and neutralizes them. Changes in
the Fc gamma receptors affect the response of a host to infection
(Song et al., 2017). The FCGR1B gene aids in the host’s immune
response during a mycobacterial infection. According to
Maertzdorf’s research, people with TB and LTBI had more
DEGs than uninfected individuals (Maertzdorf et al., 2011). In
a different study, Satproedprai et al. found that the
overexpression of FCGR1B in response to bacterial infection
caused a humoral immune response and contributed to the
development of lung inﬂammation (Satproedprai et al., 2015).
Our results showed downregulation of FCGR1B, probably as a
result of active TB.
The enrichment of spliceosomes and lysosomes in GO,
indicates its crucial role in active TB infection. The functions of
spliceosomes are also regulated differently in infected
macrophages. The lysosomes protect against Mtb by
controlling how Mtb moves through the lysosomes and
stopping it from spreading in cells. Pre-mRNA splicing plays
a crucial role in regulating gene expression and protein
diversity. The Serine/Arginine rich (SR) proteins are the
major components contributing to the selective splicing
mechanism. The disruption in the RNA splicing mechanism
can lead to crosstalk in the intricate network interactions. The
Mtb infection alters the patterns of alternate splicing within the
macrophages by affecting the expression of SR proteins (Zhang
et al., 2018).
The evolution of Mtb infection has proven its ability to
successfully gain access to host cellular components needed for
its survival before the initiation of innate antimicrobial response.
The process is accomplished by altering various immune
response elements such as interferon (IFN)-induced
transmembrane (IFITM) gene family members. The IFITM
members receive signals for their activation through type I and
II IFN stimulation to preclude the establishment of productive
infection. Ranjbar et al. show that IFITM proteins inhibit Mtb
intracellular growth, indicating that they may contribute to host
defense against intracellular bacterial infection (Ranjbar et al.,
2015). The IFITMs act on host membrane ﬂuidity at the sites of
viral entry by preventing the formation of viral fusion pore. In
addition, they increase the trafﬁcking of trapped viruses to the
lysosome for its degradation. However, Mtb alters this
phagocytic mechanism by switching off the acidiﬁcation of the
phagosomes mediated by the IFTIM family members. One such
example is the vacuolar ATPase, a mediator of endosomal
acidiﬁcation which is excluded from Mtb-containing
phagosome by Mtb’s bacterial tyrosine phosphatase (Ranjbar
et al., 2015).

In addition, pathways related to immune mediated cascades
such as T cell receptor signaling pathway, Th17 cell
differentiation and NF-kappa B signaling pathway were also
observed (Urdahl et al., 2011). The order of appearance of T cell
receptor signaling pathway down the list indicate that the onset
of genes contributing to this pathways are delayed. Nuclear
factor-kappa B (NFkB) pathway mediates pro-inﬂammatory
responses which are required by the host to control of many
microbial pathogens. The activation of NFkB has proven to
increase the viability of intracellular Mtb in human macrophages
by preventing apoptosis and autophagy (Bai et al., 2013). The
lysosomal and pathogenic pathways indicate the dominance of
these pathways used by the pathogens to avoid lysosomal
targeting. They function by actively manipulating the host
vesicular trafﬁcking and reside in a vacuoles altered from the
default lysosomal trafﬁcking (Sachdeva and Sundaramurthy,
2020). The overlap of infectious disease pathways signals the
usage of similar players for evading the infection and using host
counterparts to reproduce.

The PPI networks reveal the involvement of major players
contributing to the infection. The hPPI network identiﬁed ten
hub genes which play crucial role in the infection. All these
identiﬁed hub genes were ribosomal proteins involved in RNA
binding. These RNA-binding proteins play critical roles in co-
and post-translational regulation. Due to the distinct
differences in ribosome structure between Mtb and the host,
the ribosome is a multiprotein complex, and the protein-
protein interactions of its subunits may be an appealing
target for novel antibiotics (Lin et al., 2012). Earlier report
based on microarray expression analysis such as Wang et al.,
also reported up-regulation of 22 unique ribosomal proteins in
tuberculosis infection (Wang et al., 2003). In the current work
we identiﬁed the involvement of 10 (RPL10A, RPS4X, RPS16,
RPS23, RPS3, RPS13, RPL7A, RPL4, RPS5 and RPS6) unique
ribosomal proteins in the active disease stage with high degree
of connectedness. However, the signiﬁcance of these genes is
unclear and requires future studies. The hmPPI network
showed MAT2A of the host protein interacted with ten Mtb
proteins. MAT2A catalyse the conversion of L-methionine to
S-adenosyl-L-methionine in cysteine and methionine
metabolism. The Mtb protein partners also perform similar
function, for example MetK which is a methionine
adenosyltransferanse (Wang et al., 2003).

The meta-analysis identiﬁed the involvement of various
kinases in active TB. The drug bank list also narrowed down
few drugs acting on kinases. Various classes of tyrosine kinase
inhibitors exhibit distinct mechanism of action to inhibit
phagocytosis of tubercle bacilli in dose and time-dependent
manner. Early studies have proven that tyrosine kinase
inhibitors including Dasatinib, Bosutinib, Imatinib, Nilotinib,
Ponatinib, Nintedanib, Fostamatinib and Tirbanibulin reduce
the growth of intracellular Mtb. The ligation of complement
receptors by Mtb plays a major role in stimulation of tyrosine
phosphorylation (Schlesinger and DesJardin, 2022). Focusing on
drugs targeting these proteins can act as a starting point for the
development of host mediated drug repurposing studies. The
genetic-variant analysis recognized genes contributing to drug
resistance such as ABCB1 (Pontual et al., 2017) and susceptibility
to latent tuberculosis such as SP110 and OAS1 (Chang et al., 2018;
Leisching et al., 2019). Analyzing the genetic variants of the
tuberculosis patients before starting any treatment regimens is
highly suggested to prevent late stage failures.
Conclusion
The current study focuses on meta-analysis and highlights
host genes and pathways crucial for tuberculosis disease. The
DEGs identiﬁed in the current work shed light on promising
drug targets for host-directed repurposing therapies. The work
also suggests considering the genetic variants associated with the
TB-related genes to enhance the success rate of therapies in
individuals affected with tuberculosis. Future studies assessing
the behavior of the identiﬁed DEGs during and after the
treatment can ascertain their involvement in the disease
pathogenesis and progression.
