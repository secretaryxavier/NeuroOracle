I.  Procedures for the synthesis of PGL epitopes 
 
I. 1. General procedures. 
Trichloracetimidates from orthoesters: preparation of 3, 4 and 5. The orthoester was 
dissolved in a tetrahydrofuran (THF)/water mixture (4/1 (v/v)), final concentration around 0.16 
M) and (±)camphorsulfonic acid (0.05 equiv.) was added. The reaction was left at room 
temperature for 1.5 h and quenched with a 5% (w/v) NaHCO3 solution. Most of the THF was 
evaporated and the mixture was extracted two times with dichloromethane (DCM). Drying the 
organic phase and evaporation of the solvent gave the crude hemiacetal which was used 
directly. The hemiacetal was taken up in DCM (0.2 M) and treated at 0°C with 1,8
diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec7ene (0.3 equiv.) and trichloroacetonitrile (4.0 equiv.) for 2 h. The 
yellow reaction mixture was diluted with saturated aqueous ammonium chloride solution. 
DCM 
extraction 
and 
chromatography 
(petroleum 
ether/ethyl 
acetate) 
gave 
the 
trichloacetimidate. 
 
Glycosylation of cresol: preparation of 14, 17 and 24. A mixture of a trichloracetimidate 
(1.0 equiv.) and cresol (1.3 to 1.5 equiv.) was stirred in (DCM, final concentration., 0.1–
0.15 M) at room temperature for 30 min in presence or powdered 3 Å molecular sieves. The 
reaction was then brought to –30°C and trimethylsilyl trifluoromethane sulfonate (TMSOTf, 
0.1 equiv., as a 1 M solution in DCM) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was allowed 
to warm to –15°C over 1 h and quenched with few drops of triethylamine. The reaction 
mixture was filtered on Celite® and the filtrate was washed twice with 2 N aqueous sodium 
hydroxide. The organic phase was dried with magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to 
dryness. Chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate) afforded the cresyl glycoside as 
the pure αanomer. 
 
Other glycosylations with imidates: preparation of 19, 23 and 28. A mixture of the 
alcohol (1.0 equiv.) and trichloracetimidate (1.3–1.5 equiv., 0.1–0.15 M) was stirred in DCM 
at room temperature for 30 min in presence or powdered 3 Å molecular sieves. The reaction 
was then brought to –30°C and TMSOTf (0.1 equiv., as a 1 M solution in DCM) was added 
dropwise. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to –10°C over 2 h and quenched with 
few drops of triethylamine. The reaction mixture was filtered on Celite® and the filtrate was 
evaporated to dryness. Chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate) afforded the 
glycoside as the pure αanomer. 
 
Glycosylation of 29 with thioglycoside 7. A mixture of disaccharide 29 (1.0 equiv.) and 
thioglycoside 7 (1.5 equiv., 0.015 M) was stirred in DCM at room temperature for 30 min in

3 
 
presence or powdered 3 Å molecular sieves. The reaction was then brought to –20°C and 
were sequencially added Niodo succinimide (1.95 equiv.), and TMSOTf (0.15 equiv., as a 1 
M solution in DCM). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 0°C over 2 h and 
quenched with few drops of triethylamine. The reaction mixture was filtered on Celite® and 
the filtrate was evaporated to dryness. Chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate) 
afforded trisaccharide 30. 
 
Deacetylation: preparation of 15, 18, 20, OS PGL1, 25 and OS PGLtb. The ester was 
dissolved in a dilute solution of sodium methanolate in methanol (final concentration of 
substrate 0.05–0.07 M, adding some THF was sometimes needed to allow full solubility) and 
the reaction was left to proceed at room temperature until completion (TLC). The reaction 
was quenchend with a piece of dry ice and the methanol was evaporated. The residue was 
taken up in DCM, filtrated on Celite® and the filtrate was evaporated. The crude product was 
usually found pure enough but can be purfied by chromatography (toluene/ethyl acetate). 

Methylation: preparation of 15, 21 and 26. The alcohol was dissolved in THF (0.05 M) 
and sequencially treated at 0°C with sodium hydride (2.0 equiv. of a 60% (w/v) suspension in 
mineral oil) and iodomethane (3.0 equiv.). The reaction was allowed to warm to room 
temperature and allowed to proceed until completion. The reaction was quenched with a few 
drops of ethanol at 0°C and the THF was evaporated. The residue was taken up in DCM and 
washed with aqueous saturated NaHCO3 and brine. The organic phase was dried with 
magnesium sulfate, filtered and evaporated to dryness. Chromatography (petroleum 
ether/ethyl acetate) afforded the methyl ether. 
 
Debenzylation: preparation of OS PGLbov, OS PGLulc, OS PGL1, 27 and 29. The 
benzyl ether was dissolved in a mixture of ethyl acetate and methanol. The catalyst was 
added (1020% (w/w) Pd/C or Pd(OH)2/C) and the reaction mixture was put under an 
atmosphere of hydrogen. After completion of the reaction, the catalyst was filtered on Celite® 
and the filtrate evaporated. The crude product was usually obtained very pure but can be 
purfied by chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate or DCM/methanol 95/5 (v/v) for OS 
PGL1). 
 
Desilylation: preparation of 22 and OS PGLtb. The silyl ether was dissolved in THF (0.5 
M) and treated with a 1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium fluoride in THF (2.8 equiv. per silyl 
group).  The reaction was left overnight at room temperature. The solvent was evaporated 
and chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate) gave the product.

I. 2. Preparation of individual compounds. 
Preparation of stannylene 2. Orthoester 1 was dissolved in toluene (0.21 M) and dibutyltin 
oxide (1.05 equiv.) was added. The reaction was brought to reflux with a DeanStark 
apparatus. After 3 h, the reaction was over (TLC, DCM/methanol 20/1 (v/v)) and the mixture 
was allowed to cool to room temperature before evaporation of the toluene. No purification of 
the stannylene was attempted and the product was always used crude. It was stable for long 
periods of time in the dry form at –20°C. 
 
Preparation of orthoester 9. 2 was dissolved in DMF (1.5 M solution) and treated with 
NBu4Br (1.0 equiv.), benzyl bromide (2.0 equiv.) and a small amount of powdered 4 Å 
molecular sieves. The mixture was brought to 40°C and left at this temperature for 36 h. After 
cooling, most of the DMF was evaporated under reduced pressure and the residue was 
filtered on silica (ethyl acetate as eluant). The filtrate was evaporated and the crude product 
was dissolved in DMF (0.5 M), treated with imidazole (9.0 equiv.) and 
butyldimethylchlorosilane (2.0 equiv.) and left at room temperature. After completion of the 
reaction (2 days), the mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate and hydrolyzed with a saturated 
aqueous ammonium chloride solution. The aqueous phase was extrated two times with ethyl 
acetate and the organic phase was washed with water and brine. Chromatography 
(petroleum ether/ethyl acetate/0.5% triethylamine, 80/20 to 65/35 (v/v/v)) gave compound 9. 
 
Preparation of orthoester 10. 2 was dissolved in DMF (1.5 M solution) and treated with 
NBu4Br (1.0 equiv.) and iodomethane (3.0 equiv.) in a glass stoperred flask. The mixture 
was brought to 40°C and left at this temperature overnight. After cooling, the mixture was 
filtered on silica (THF with 2% (v/v) of NEt3 as eluant) and the filtrate was evaporated in the 
cold.  
 
Preparation of orthoester 11. The above solution of 10 in DMF was treated at 0°C with 
sodium hydride (2.0 equiv., as a 60% (w/w) dispersion in mineral oil, washed three times with 
petroleum ether) for 30 min. Benzyl bromide (1.5 equiv.) was added and the reaction was 
allowed to proceed overtnight at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 
methanol, diluted with water and extracted three times with DCM. The combined organic 
phases were washed with water, brine, dried over MsSO4 and the solvent was evaporated. 
Chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 7/3 (v/v)) gave 11. 
 
Preparation of orthoester 12. The above solution of 10 in DMF was treated overnight with 
imidazole (4.0 equiv.) and butyldimethylchlorosilane (2.0 equiv.) at room temperature for 
12 h. The mixture was hydrolyzed and extracted with DCM. The organic phase was washed

5 
 
with water and brine, dried over MsSO4 and the solvent was evaporated. Chromatography 
(petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 2/1 (v/v)) gave 12.

IV. NMR analysis of PGL purified from rBCG  ML0126 
 
All the proton resonances typifying a phenolphthiocerol structure linked to a monosaccharide 
were observed in the 1D 1HNMR spectrum of the native compound: substituted phenolic 
group (g, h at 6.97 and 7.10 ppm), methine protons of the esterified βglycol (a, 4.84 ppm), 
multimethylbranched fatty acids (e, 0.8–1 ppm; f, 1.14 ppm, d, 2.52 ppm), methoxyl group 
on the phthiocerol (b, 3.33 ppm and c, 2.85 ppm). The presence of a single deshielded 
anomeric proton confirmed the occurrence of a monosaccharide in the putative PGLulc (i, 
5.53 ppm). In addition, only one signal attributable to proton resonance of methoxyl group 
linked to the sugar part (j, 3.55 ppm) was observed in the spectrum of native glycolipid. This 
was supported by the occurrence, upon peracetylation, of two distinct methyl groups of 
acetyl substituents (*, 2.10 and 2.17 ppm) indicating the presence of two nonsubstituted 
hydroxyl groups in the native compound. Moreover, the peracetylation resulted in a shift 
of the resonance of protons linked to the carbons bearing the acetoxy group downfield by 
about 1–1.4 ppm; it was thus possible to distinguish free from substituted hydroxyl groups. 
Assignments of resonances are summarized in the table on the basis of chemical shift 
correlations deduced from the 2DCOSY spectra of native and peracetylated PGL. The 
resonances of the protons 2 and 4 of the rhamnosyl residue were shifted after per
acetylation indicating that the hydroxyl groups in position 2 and 4 were free in the glycolipid.

V. Methods 
 
Antibodies and reagents. Mouse monoclonal antibodies (Ab) against CD11b (2LPM19c 
and VIM12), normal mouse IgG1 and rabbit polyclonal Ab against Lyn and Syk were 
purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Specific antiPGL1 Ab was provided by the BEI 
Resources, NIAID, NIH. Various secondary Ab, Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)coupled goat 
antimouse (BioRad), HPRcoupled goat antirabbit (SigmaAldrich) and Rhodamine Red
conjugated goat antirabbit (Invitrogen), were used. 
Recombinant human CR3 and TLR2 were purchased from R&D Systems, and purified, 
native   PGL1 was obtained through BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH. Control 
scrambled and predesigned ONTARGETplus SMARTpool siRNAs targeting human Lyn 
and Syk were purchased from GE Dharmacon. The rest of reagents were purchased from 
SigmaAldrich, except specifically mentioned. 
 
Synthesis of PGL epitopes. All reactions were run in anhydrous glassware under an argon 
atmosphere. Reagents were used as received. Anhydrous dichloromethane, methanol and 
toluene were obtained from a Pure Solv MD5 apparatus (Innovative Tehnology Inc.). Dry 
THF was distilled from benzophenonesodium just before use. Chromatographic separations 
were run on a PuriFlash 430 automatic chromatographer (Interchim) using prepacked 
cartridges of 30 m spherical silica.  NMR spectra were recorded at the Laboratoire de 
Chimie de Coordination (Toulouse, France) on Bruker AV 300, AV 400 and Av III 400 
spectrometers, working respectively at 300 MHz and 400 MHz for 1H, 75 MHz and 100 MHz 
for 13C. Chemical shifts are expressed in part per million (ppm) from tetramethylsilane (s: 
singlet; d: doublet, t: triplet, q: quadruplet, m: multiplet; br: broad). Optical rotations were 
measured at 25°C on a PerkinElmer 41 polarimeter. High resolution mass data were 
obtained from the Service Commun de Spectrométrie de Masse of the University Paul 
Sabatier (Toulouse, France) using electrospray or chemical ionization (CH4) techniques. 
 
Construction of plasmids and recombinant   BCG strains. Construction of 
 BCG  (PMM130) and plasmid pWM122, was previously described (). 
Briefly, plasmid pWM122 was constructed by insertion of two PCR fragments, containing 
genes 	
	 and 
, between the  !I and "I sites of plasmid 
pMV361g, a derivative of pMV361 containing the mycobacterial promoter #$%(). 
Plasmid pWM123 was constructed by insertion of two PCR fragments in SpeI site of plasmid 
pMV361g.The first PCR fragment, containing genes 			 (&'!() and 		(#), was 
obtained using primers gmdA (5’ TTATACATATGAAGCGAGCGCTCATCAC3’) and epiB 
(5’AATATACTAGTCATTGCCGAACCGTTCCC3’), and the second fragment, containing

41 
 
gene , was amplified using primers Rv2958C (5’CGCAACTAGTGGTCGGTGTGA
3’) and Rv2958D (5’ATAACTAGTTAGCAGACGAGCCGCAGC3’). 
A PCR fragment, containing genes ML0126, ML0127 and ML0128, was obtained with 
primers 
ML0126 
(5’ATACATATGAGAGCAGCCGAAGCTTC3’) 
and 
ML0128 
(5’
ATAACTAGTGACACTCAATCCGGTCACC3’), using plasmid pBNF03 as template DNA, 
and cloned in pGEM52 to generate plasmid pWM111. Subsequently, a  !I)I 
(previously bluntended), containing gene 	, was released and between the  !I"I 
(previously bluntended) sites of vector pMV361g to obtain plasmid pWM247. 
The plasmids described above were transferred in   BCG (pWM123) or PMM130 
(pWM122 and pWM247) by electrotransformation and transformants were selected on 7H11 
agar plates (Difco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) OADC (0.005% (v/v) oleic acid, 0.5% (w/v) 
bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA), 0.2% (w/v) dextrose, 0.0003% (w/v) beef catalase) 
(Difco) and 40 g ml1 kanamycin. 
The various   BCG strains were rendered fluorescent by the transfer of plasmid 
pWM124, a derivative of the mycobacterial plasmid pMIP12H allowing expression of &* 
gene from $% promoter (). 
 
Biochemical analysis of  BCG recombinant strains. PGL produced by the newly 
constructed rBCGPGLulc were extracted and purified from 100 ml culture as described 
previously (+ ). NMR spectroscopy experiments were carried out at 298°K on a Bruker 
AVANCE spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz with a 5mm triple resonance TCI 1H 13C 15N 
pulsed field zgradient cryoprobe. Samples were dissolved in 99.9% CDCl3. 1H NMR studies 
on the native and the peracetylated glycolipid were performed using onedimensional and 
twodimensional chemical shift correlation spectroscopy (COSY). Chemical shifts are 
expressed in ppm using chloroform signal as an internal reference (7.26 ppm). 
 
Purification of DIM and PGLs. , was used as source for DIM isolation and species
specific PGLs were obtained from WT BCG and the various PGLexpressing rBCGs. Total 
mycobacterial lipids were extracted from 100 ml stationary cultures as previously described 
(). Briefly, bacteria were left in CH3OH/CHCl3 2:1 (v/v) for 48 h and, then, in CH3OH/CHCl3 
1:1 (v/v) for 24 h. The organic phases were recovered and pooled, washed with water and 
dried. Subsequently, total lipids were recovered in CHCl3 and chromatographic separations 
of PGLs and DIM were run on a PuriFlash 430 automatic chromatographer (Interchim) using 
prepacked cartridges of 30 m spherical silica and an elution gradient of increasing 
chloroform/methanol 9/1 (050% (v/v)) in chloroform, or manually using SepPak Silica 
Classic Cartridges (55105 m particle size; Waters) an elution gradient of increasing 
diethylether (010% (v/v)) in petroleum ether, respectively. Fractions containing the isolated

42 
 
compounds were pooled and dried. Before use, solutions of the lipids at the desired 
concentrations were prepared: PGLs were diluted in ethanol; DIM were first recovered in a 
small volume of chloroform, before being added to the aqueous solution and, then, sonicated 
until complete suspension. 
 
Mycobacterial strains and growth conditions.   BCG and its recombinant 
derivative strains expressing the various speciesspecific PGLs, and carrying a 
mycobacterial replicative plasmid coding for GFP, were used in this study. Mycobacteria 
were grown at 37°C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) ADC 
(0.5% (w/v) BSA, 0.2% (w/v) dextrose, 0.0003% (w/v) beef catalase) (Difco) and 0.05% (v/v) 
Tween80. When required, kanamycin and hygromycin were added to the medium to a final 
concentration of 40 g ml1 and 50 g ml1 respectively. 
 
hMDM culture and infection. Human blood, from fullyanonymous nontuberculous donors, 
was purchased from the Etablissement Français du Sang of Toulouse. Peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMC) and hMDM were prepared as previously described (). Briefly, 
monocytes were isolated from PBMCs by adhesion and allowed to differentiate for 7 days in 
RPMI 1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine (Gibco) and 7% (v/v) heat
inactivated human AB serum at 37°C in 5% CO2. hMDM were washed twice with serumfree 
RPMI medium before use.  
Mycobacterial infection was performed as previously described (). Shortly, Exponentially
growing, GFPexpressing mycobacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and subsequently 
dispersed in serumfree RPMI 1640 medium using glass beads. The number of bacteria per 
ml in the suspension was then estimated by measurement of the optical density at 600 nm. 
hMDM were then infected for 2 h at the indicated MOI in serumfree RPMI at 37°C in 5% 
CO2. Extracellular bacteria were then removed by three successive washes with fresh 
medium. 
 
Phagocytosis experiments. Phagocytosis was assessed as previously described (). 
Briefly, hMDM cultured on sterile glass coverslips in 24well culture plates (5×105 cells per 
well) were infected at a MOI of 10. When indicated, hMDM were incubated before infection 
for 30 min with antiCD11b Ab at 10 g ml1 or an irrelevant isotypematched antibody, used 
as control. After infection, hMDM were fixed with 4% (w/v) PFA and extracellular 
mycobacteria were labelled with rabbit antimycobacteria Ab, which was detected by a 
Rhodamine Redconjugated goat antirabbit secondary Ab. The percentage of cells having 
ingested at least one bacterium was determined by fluorescence microscopy using a Leica

43 
 
DMRB epifluorescence microscope. For each set of conditions, duplicate experiments were 
performed, and at least 200 cells were counted per slide. 
 
hMDM siRNA transfection. hMDM were transfected with 100 nM scrambled siRNA control 
or siRNAs targeting Lyn or Syk using HiPerFect transfection reagent (Qiagen), as described 
previously (	). Briefly, siRNAs were mixed with HiPerFect transfection reagent and serum
free RPMI medium and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The lipidsiRNA 
complexes (125 l) were added dropwise onto the medium (250 l) of day 5 hMDM and 
incubated for 6 h at 37ºC and 5% CO2. After transfection, 500 l of RPMI containing 7% (w/v) 
autologous serum was added and cells were incubated at 37ºC and 5% CO2 for additional 
72 h before infection. Efficiency of gene knockdown was assessed by western blot analysis 
using specific Ab. 
 
Quantification of NFκκκκB activity and TNFαααα secretion. The level of NFκB activation was 
studied using THP1 DualTM and HEKBlueTM hTLR2 reporter cell lines (InvivoGen). These 
cell lines are stably transfected with a reporter plasmid expressing a secreted embryonic 
alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene under the control of a NFκBdependent promoter. In all 
cases, cells were used in 96well plates according to manufacturer instructions. THP1 cells 
were first differentiated into macrophages through treatment with 5 ng ml1 PMA (Phorbol 12
myristate 13acetate) for 24 h, then washed and rested for two days to ensure that they 
came back to a resting phenotype. Cells were treated with 10 ng ml1 Pam3CSK4 
(InvivoGen) and, simultaneously, with the purified and synthetic compounds to test at the 
specified concentrations. Unstimulated cells together with the solvent use to dissolve the 
compounds to test were used as negative controls, whereas Pam3CSk4stimulated cells 
without the compounds were used as positive controls. After a 16 h incubation, QUANTI
BlueTM detection medium (InvivoGen) was used following manufacturer specifications and 
SEAP activity, corresponding to NFκB activation, was determined by reading the 
absorbance at 630 nm. For infection experiments, THP1 dual cells were infected at MOI 1 
for 16 h and NFκB activity was subsequently detected as described. 
To assess TNFα secretion levels, hMDM were infected as described above and, after 2 h of 
contact, supernatants were harvested and filtered. TNFα secretion was quantified in 
supernatants using BD OptEIATM human TNF ELISA Set (BD), according to the 
recommendations of the manufacturer.
