Abstract
Time since traumatic brain injury (TBI) and developmental stage at injury may affect the trajectory of outcomes asso-
ciated with adjustment and school success. We prospectively enrolled a cohort of 519 children with either TBI or
orthopedic injury (OI) age 2.5–15 years to examine children’s psychosocial and executive function outcomes at 3- and 12-
months post-injury. Outcome measures included the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), Strengths and Difﬁculties
Questionnaire (SDQ), and Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) ratings. Controlling for pre-injury
ratings and using the OI group as the reference, children with TBI, regardless of age or injury severity, had affective,
anxiety, and attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) problems on the CBCL. Symptom trajectories differed both
by injury severity and age at injury. Children with mild and complicated mild TBI had a decreasing anxiety trajectory,
whereas children with severe TBI had increasing symptoms. Children 6–11 years of age had high ADHD and affective
scores; however, the youngest children had increasing symptoms over time. On the SDQ, peer relationships and prosocial
behaviors were not signiﬁcantly affected by TBI but were associated with family environment. Children with severe TBI
had the worst executive function scores; however, mild and complicated mild/moderate TBI groups had clinically
important working memory deﬁcits. Hispanic ethnicity and strong social capital were positively associated with multiple
outcomes. Children’s recovery trajectories differed by injury severity, time since injury, and developmental stage when
injured. Schools need to reassess children’s skills over time as new problems in behavior and learning may emerge.

Introduction
T
raumatic brain injury (TBI) in children occurs in a setting
of rapid developmental, physical, cognitive, emotional, and
social growth. Children recovering from TBI must not only recover
to their former level of functioning, but also must learn new skills to
keep developmentally on track.1 Social expectations for behavior
regulation and emotional control rapidly increase as children age.
TBI may disrupt core abilities that support social, emotional, and
cognitive performance required to make and retain friends and
function at home and in school.2 Longitudinal follow-up of children
is important, as prior studies have shown that children may initially
appear to be on track with their peers after TBI, but subsequently
fall behind in some areas as demands for new skills increase.3,4
Although children’s recovery after TBI is affected by injury se-
verity and the child’s personal reserve, recovery takes place within
the larger environment of family, school, and community as reﬂected
in the International Classiﬁcation of Functioning, Disability and
Health’s (ICFDH) model of disability.5 The family environment
including family structure, functioning, and ﬁnancial and social re-
sources may moderate developmental outcomes allowing some
children to maximize their gains after injury.6,7
This prospective cohort study was assembled to longitudinally
examine children’s development after injury. We examined the
impact of TBI severity, age at injury, and time since injury on
psychosocial and executive functions during the ﬁrst year after TBI
relative to an orthopedic injury (OI) comparison group. Consistent
with the ICFDH model, we expected that family environment
would signiﬁcantly inﬂuence these outcomes.
Methods
Patient population
Patients were children injured between 2.5 and 15 years of age,
recruited from two level 1 pediatric trauma centers, Primary
Children’s Hospital (PCH) in Salt Lake City, UT, and University of
1Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah.
2Department of Pediatric Surgery, University of Texas Medical School at Houston, Houston, Texas.
3Department of Pediatrics and Children’s Learning Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, Texas.

Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth). PCH is the
sole level 1 pediatric trauma center in the Intermountain West and
serves a ﬁve-state area. UTHealth serves the Houston metropolitan
region and surrounding area. Children sustaining either TBI or OI
were recruited from both the Emergency Department (ED) and
inpatient units of both hospitals. Children were recruited from
January 20, 2013, through September 30, 2015, in two ways:
families either were approached in person in the ED or hospital
(PCH and UTHealth) or contacted by telephone after review of ED
logs (UTHealth). Children were recruited sequentially according to
child age, injury type, and TBI severity to ensure adequate repre-
sentation in all age and injury group strata. Child age groups (2.5 to
5 years; 6 to 11 years; 12 to <16 years) were chosen to reﬂect pre-
school, school-age, and adolescent developmental stages. Children
with severe developmental delay or severe psychiatric disorders,
deﬁned as requiring a self-contained educational program, were
excluded because of the difﬁculty in measuring effect of injury.
Institutional review board approval was obtained from both the
University of Utah and UTHealth.
Deﬁnitions
Traumatic brain injury group.
TBI was deﬁned according to
the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) 2002 report as an injury to
the head with observed or reported decreased level of conscious-
ness, amnesia, and/or neuropsychological abnormality or diag-
nosed intracranial lesion.8 TBI severity was measured by the ED
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS).9 TBI severity was divided into three
categories: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild TBI was deﬁned ac-
cording to CDC and World Health Organization (WHO) deﬁnitions
as a GCS score of 13 or higher upon presentation to healthcare with
a GCS score of 15 at discharge or after 24 h if hospitalized, and one
or more focal signs including a period of transient confusion, loss of
consciousness for 30 min or less, post-traumatic amnesia for less
than 24 h, and/or transient neurological abnormalities.10,11 Chil-
dren with mild TBI were subclassiﬁed as complicated mild or mild
based on the presence or absence of an intracranial hemorrhage
diagnosed on computed tomography (CT) scan. Moderate TBI was
categorized as an ED GCS score of 9–12. Severe TBI was cate-
gorized as an ED GCS score of 3–8.
Orthopedic injury comparison group.
Children with an
upper or lower extremity long bone fracture and no head injury
were recruited contemporaneously with the TBI group. OI com-
parisons were used to isolate the effect of TBI from the effect of
being injured, and to account for pre-injury differences among
injured versus uninjured children. Injury severity was measured
with the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS).12 Forty children with OI
were recruited for each age group.
Data sources
As soon as possible after injury, parents or guardians (who we
will refer to as parents) were asked to complete a survey that in-
cluded family demographic information such as family composi-
tion, self-identiﬁed race and ethnicity, family income category,
parental education and employment, and health insurance status.
Parents completed pre-injury measures of child outcomes, family
functioning, and social support. Follow-up assessments were col-
lected at 3 and 12 months. For English-speaking families, pre-
injury and follow-up assessments were completed in person, online,
or by telephone. Spanish-speaking families were interviewed in
person or by telephone by bilingual study coordinators.
Medical records were abstracted for clinical and injury mecha-
nism data by trained study coordinators using a standardized data
abstraction form. Trauma registrars at each institution assigned the
AIS scores. CT scans were performed for clinical indication only
and were read by pediatric neuroradiologists at each site. CT re-
ports were used to subclassify the mild TBI children.
Measures
Outcomes.
We chose three well-validated parent report
measures recommended by the National Institute of Neurologic
Disorders and Stroke common data elements for TBI to examine
psychosocial and executive function outcomes.13
Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire (SDQ).14
The
SDQ is a 25-item behavioral screening questionnaire for children
age 4–17 years. The SDQ has ﬁve subscales: emotional symptoms,
conduct problems, hyperactivity, peer problems, and prosocial
behavior. Items for each scale are summed to generate a score of
0–10. The ﬁrst four subscales are added to calculate a total difﬁ-
culties score (0–40) with higher numbers representing more prob-
lems. For the prosocial scale, higher numbers represent better
outcomes. Test-retest reliability (r = 0.76) and internal consistency
(Cronbach’s a = 0.80) are adequate.15

Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL).16
The CBCL is a parent
report questionnaire assessing internalizing and externalizing be-
haviors. We used the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)
oriented ADHD, affective disorder, and anxiety disorder scales
from both the 1.5–5 year and 6–18 year forms. Each subscale
provides a T-score normed for age and sex. The CBCL has excel-
lent test-retest reliability (r = 0.7–0.8) and internal consistency
(a = 0.90–0.94) at one year.
Behavior
Rating
Inventory
of
Executive
Function
(BRIEF).17
The BRIEF, a parent rating of everyday executive
skills involved in behavioral regulation and metacognition, has
high test-retest reliability (0.82–0.88). We assessed the inhibit, emo-
tional control, working memory, and plan/organize scales and
the metacognition index. The BRIEF pre-school version (BRIEF-P)
for children 1.5–5 years provides the same scales as well as inhibitory
self-control and the emergent metacognitive index. T-scores are
based on normative data for age and sex.
Family environment covariates.
Pre-injury family function
was assessed using the McMaster Family Assessment Device
(FAD)–General Functioning Scale.18 The FAD includes 12 items
scored 1–4 with higher scores representing worse functioning. The
Social Capital Index measures a person’s connection to their
community including perceptions of personal, family, neighbor-
hood, and spiritual community support.19 The index provides a total
score with higher scores representing more support. Families self-
reported their income category by family size, from which their
poverty level was calculated using federal norms.
Statistical analysis
All children with evaluable outcomes pre-injury and at either
the 3- or 12-month time-point were included in the analysis. Due
to small numbers of children with moderate TBI, the moderate
and complicated mild groups were combined for modeling based
on prior studies showing similar outcomes.20 Generalized linear
mixed models, with an unstructured covariance matrix and using
the Kenward-Roger approach for testing signiﬁcance of ﬁxed
effects, were ﬁt for each outcome using SAS PROC MIXED.
Potentially clinically important covariates selected a priori were
initially evaluated in a model controlling for pre-injury score,
injury group, time, and injury group-by-time interaction. To de-
velop the ﬁnal reported models, a ‘‘full model’’ including all
candidate covariates with p < 0.15 in initial screening and these
same four factors was iteratively reduced by removal of covariates/
factors (excluding pre-injury score and main effects of injury and
time) with p > 0.1.
Results
Study population
Consent was provided to participate in the study for 639 children
injured between 2.5 and 15 years of age. Of those, 584 (91%)
completed the pre-injury assessment and 519 (81%) also completed
either a 3- or 12-month assessment; the latter group comprises the
cohort. Of these 519 children, 438 (84%) completed both follow-up
assessments, whereas 46 (9%) completed only the 3-month and 35
(7%) completed only the 12-month assessment (Fig. 1).
The cohort consisted of 144 (28%) children with mild TBI, 130
(25%) with complicated mild TBI (25%), 26 (5%) with moderate
TBI, and 86 (17%) with severe TBI. There were 133 (26%) children
with OI: 92 (69%) arm; 39 (29%) leg; and 2 (2%) both. Table 1
provides the cohort’s demographic and injury variables.
Whereas the Utah site enrolled more participating children
(58%), enrollment sites did not differ by injury type or severity.
Most families completed assessments via the web (73%) and in the
English language (88%). Injury groups had similar distributions of
child sex, race/ethnicity, preferred language, and insurance status.
Respondent education differed by injury severity, with lower ed-
ucational achievement seen in the moderate and severe TBI groups.
Pre-injury ratings of family environment covariates were similar
between injury groups.
Falls were the most frequent injury mechanism (n = 241, 46%)
and the primary mechanism of injury for the orthopedic group
(74%), mild TBI (42%), and complicated mild TBI (51%) groups.
Motorized vehicle crashes as passenger or pedestrian/cyclist
(n = 138, 27%) were the second most frequent injury mechanism
and were responsible for over half of the moderate and severe TBI.
Compared with children with mild or complicated mild TBI,
children with moderate or severe TBI were more likely to have an
injury of AIS ‡2 to a body region other than the head.
Pre-injury ratings on the BRIEF, BRIEF-P, SDQ, and CBCL
scales did not differ by injury group except for BRIEF working
memory, which was higher in the mild TBI group. Mean scores
were in the typical range in all areas (Table 2).
Psychosocial outcomes
Strengths and Difﬁculties Questionnaire.
SDQ model re-
sults are displayed in Table 3. After adjustment for baseline func-
tioning, children with severe injuries had higher predicted scores
indicating more problems on the total difﬁculties scale. Speciﬁcally,
children with severe TBI had a 2.4-point higher total difﬁculties

score than children with OI, on average. For emotional symptoms
and conduct problems, the effect of injury severity varied by age
group (Fig. 2); ratings were elevated for pre-school and school-aged
children with complicated mild/moderate and severe TBI relative to
adolescents. School-aged children had higher hyperactivity scores. A
severity by time interaction indicated that initially elevated hyper-
activity scores decreased from 3 to 12 months in the severe and
complicated mild/moderate TBI groups (Fig. 3A). Neither severity
nor age were important in the scales measuring peer and prosocial
interactions. Family environment was important in all SDQ models.
High social capital, higher income, and better family functioning
contributed to positive outcomes. Demographic variables had spe-
ciﬁc associations with SDQ scores: Hispanic ethnicity was associated
with fewer emotional symptoms and total difﬁculties, Spanish lan-
guage preference predicted fewer conduct and peer problems, and
lower respondent education predicted positive prosocial outcomes.
Child Behavior Checklist.
Injury type and severity, age, and
child sex were important predictors of the three CBCL subscales
(Table 4). Children of all TBI severities had higher scores on the
affective, anxiety, and ADHD subscales compared with OI chil-
dren. On the affective subscale, there was an interaction between
age and injury severity with school-age children with complicated
mild/moderate and severe TBI reporting more problems than other
groups (Fig. 2).
Injury severity interacted with time of assessment as shown in
Figure 3A. Children with mild TBI had similar scores on the anx-
iety scale as children with severe injury 3 months post-injury, but
symptom trajectories differed: children with mild and complicated
mild/moderate injury had decreasing symptoms over time, whereas
children with severe injury had increasing symptoms.
Children’s symptom trajectories also differed dependent on age
at injury. School-age children had the highest ADHD and affective
symptoms scores, but pre-schoolers showed increases in symptoms
over time in (Fig. 3B). Girls had signiﬁcantly higher scores on all
CBCL outcomes indicating more problems. Children with Hispanic
ethnicity had fewer problems compared with white, non-Hispanic
children on the affective disorder subscale. A positive family en-
vironment contributed to better outcomes on all CBCL scales.
Executive Function: BRIEF and BRIEF-P.
Children with
TBI performed more poorly on the BRIEF subscales compared
with children with OI (Table 5). Higher TBI severity was typically
associated with higher (worse) scores; however, children with mild
or complicated mild/moderateTBI also had clinically important
higher scores on working memory relative to children with OI.

Pre-school children performed better on working memory relative
to adolescents. Emotional control subscale scores were elevated for
middle school children with complicated/mild to severe TBI and in
younger children with mild TBI (Fig. 2). On the BRIEF-P, ad-
ministered to 2 to 4 year olds, children with TBI had higher scores
for both inhibitory self-control ( p = 0.01) and metacognition
( p = 0.03) compared with OI across all injury severities. On both
BRIEF-P scales, children with mild TBI had clinically elevated
scores similar to children with severe TBI. Social capital was a
signiﬁcant predictor of executive function ratings.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to directly compare
longitudinal psychosocial and executive function outcomes in a
large sample of children with TBI or OI injured during pre-
school, middle childhood, and adolescent stages of develop-
ment. This large prospective cohort demonstrates that children
have diverse psychosocial and executive function difﬁculties
following TBI compared with children with OI, and that these
difﬁculties persist for at least 12 months. Peer relationships and
prosocial behaviors were not signiﬁcantly affected by TBI and
were related to positive family functioning and social capital. As
posited by the ICDFH, outcomes varied depending on the child’s
injury type and severity, personal characteristics, and family
environment.
Similar to prior studies, younger age at injury was a risk factor
for adverse outcomes in speciﬁc psychosocial and executive
function domains. Pre-schoolers and school-age children were
vulnerable to adverse effects of TBI in terms of reduced emotional
control, elevated emotional and affective symptoms, and conduct
problems. Consistent with study by Karver and colleagues, pre-
schoolers showed increasing ADHD and affective problems during
the ﬁrst year after injury.21 This ﬁnding is particularly relevant
given the importance of attention and emotional control for later
self-regulation of behavior and academic success after TBI.22,23
Executive function and psychosocial difﬁculties likely contribute
to the lower functional academic skills in younger children and

emergence of increased academic difﬁculty years after complicated
mild/moderate TBI.24
Time since injury also inﬂuenced the trajectory of several out-
comes across the ﬁrst year after TBI. For example, children with
severe TBI had improvements in their hyperactivity ratings but
increasing anxiety scores from the 3- to 12-month time-points.
Children with less severe TBI showed decreasing anxiety over
time. Executive function ratings, however, remained relatively
stable across the ﬁrst year after TBI in school-age children and
adolescents similar to other studies showing limited change in
executive functions during the ﬁrst 2 years after TBI.7,25 Our
ﬁndings that executive functions in pre-schoolers changed over
time, shown by increasing difﬁculty in BRIEF-P indices, suggest
that children have different symptom trajectories depending on
their developmental stage when injured, the outcome under in-
vestigation, as well as their injury severity.2,3,26
Characteristics of the child and family affected multiple out-
comes. Adjusted for pre-injury scores, girls performed worse
than boys on all CBCL behavioral scales. Although sex differ-
ences in the development of psychiatric symptoms after TBI
have been suggested in the past, the ability to detect differences
was limited by sample size.27 These data suggest that girls may
need more psychological support than boys following TBI. The
sex ﬁndings on the CBCL are not reﬂected on the SDQ emo-
tional or attention scales. The CBCL uses both age and sex in the
scoring, whereas the SDQ reports raw scores, which may ob-
scure sex differences. Hispanic ethnicity and/or Spanish-
language preference was a protective factor associated with
fewer emotional symptoms and peer problems as well as better
conduct. Hispanic families may have cultural features that
promote resilience to chronic illness even in the face of socio-
economic challenges.28
Consistent with the literature, family environment was important
to all outcomes.6,19,25 Families with higher social and ﬁnancial re-
sources may have more capacity to make and keep medical ap-
pointments after TBI and may experience less stress. However, more
nuanced differences between high and low resource families may
exist. Parent psychological functioning and communication skills are
known to affect externalizing behaviors among adolescents post-
TBI.29 The home environment and parenting style have long-term
impacts on functional outcomes of children recovering from TBI.30
The current results reﬂect that high social capital in addition to more
traditional measures of family environment is important to outcomes.
Social capital may provide an additional target for intervention to
improve health outcomes for children with TBI.
This study’s results should be interpreted in view of its limitations.
We used parent-reported outcomes: parents may inaccurately report
their child’s symptoms, especially in the adolescent population. We
used well-validated measures of executive function and psychosocial
outcomes; however, these may differ from in-person assessments. We
chose to include Spanish-language speakers to increase the study’s
generalizability; however, these parents were interviewed by telephone
and not offered the option of web assessments. Prior studies have found
web and phone assessments of children with TBI are similar.31
Conclusion
Children with TBI have differing trajectories of recovery and
development of new problems dependent on their injury severity
and developmental stage at injury. Pediatricians and schools need
to re-evaluate children’s skills over time as new problems in be-
havior and learning may emerge. Ongoing surveillance is espe-
cially important for children injured at a young age. Younger age at
injury was associated with poorer outcomes in several areas
