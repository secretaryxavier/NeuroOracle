Abstract
In a previous study we have demonstrated, using a novel diffusion MRI analysis called free-water
imaging, that the early stages of schizophrenia are more likely associated with a
neuroinflammatory response and less so with a white matter deterioration or a demyelination
process. What is not known is how neuroinflammation and white matter deterioration change
along the progression of the disorder. In this study we apply the free-water measures on a
population of 29 chronic schizophrenia subjects and compare with 25 matching controls. Our aim
was to compare the extent of free-water imaging abnormalities in chronic subjects with the ones
previously obtained for subjects at their first psychotic episode. We find that chronic subjects
showed a limited extent of abnormal increase in the volume of the extracellular space, indicative
of a less extensive neuroinflammatory response relative to patients at the onset of schizophrenia.
At the same time, the chronic schizophrenia subjects had greater extent of reduced fractional
anisotropy compared to the previous study, suggesting increased white matter deterioration along
the progression of the disease. Our findings substantiate the role of neuroinflammation in the
earlier stages of the disorder, and the effect of neurodegeneration that is worsening in the chronic
phase.

1. Introduction
The development of diffusion MRI, and its most common analysis method, diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) (Basser et al., 1994), have made it possible to study imaging correlates of
white matter pathologies in schizophrenia. Many DTI studies have found decreased
fractional anisotropy (FA), and some have found increased mean diffusivity (MD) in
different populations of schizophrenia subjects (see Fitzsimmons et al. (2013) for a recent
review.) Despite non-specificity of the FA and MD measures, the DTI findings are often
considered evidence of a white matter pathology that is likely related to demyelination
(Kubicki et al., 2007). Myelin related deficiencies were also inferred from histopathological
studies (Uranova et al., 2011), and genetics studies (Davis et al., 2003). An alternative
interpretation of the DTI results associates the abnormalities with a neuroinflammatory
response, further supported by increased cytokine levels, microglial activation measured
with PET, genetic association, and upregulation of inflammatory pathways (see Najjar and
Pearlman (in print), for a recent review of neuroinflammation related findings in
schizophrenia.)
There is a reciprocal causative relation between neuroinflammation and degeneration, with
prolonged inflammatory response that can lead to deterioration, and, on the other hand,
inflammation that may be triggered by cellular deterioration (Streit, 2006). Distinguishing
between neuroinflammation and deterioration is therefore important to understand the
etiology of schizophrenia, and to better target potential treatments. Recently, free-water
imaging (Pasternak et al., 2009) was proposed as an analysis method of diffusion MRI that
can differentiate the contribution of water molecules diffusing freely in the extracellular
space from the contribution of water molecules that diffuse close to tissue membranes.
Therefore free-water imaging can help to differentiate between neuroinflammation that is
expected to affect the water content in the extracellular space, and white matter deterioration
that is expected to affect the tissue itself.
In our previous free-water imaging study, patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were
scanned following their first psychotic episode (FE) (Pasternak et al., 2012). It was found
that a regular DTI analysis comparing the FE group with matched controls shows a
widespread global decrease in FA and overlapping increase in MD. However, applying the
free-water imaging analysis revealed that the majority of differences between these groups
could be explained as an increase in the extracellular space, and that anisotropy differences
in the tissue were only limited to focal areas in the frontal lobe. This disambiguation of the
source of differences between the groups led to a conclusion that the early stages of
schizophrenia are more likely associated with a neuroinflammatory response and less so
with a white matter deterioration or a demyelination process.
What is not known is how neuroinflammation and white matter deterioration change along
the progression of the disorder. If schizophrenia has a neurodegenerative component, an

increased extent of deterioration is expected as the disease progresses. Furthermore, it is not
known whether neuroinflammation also plays a role in the chronic stages of schizophrenia.
To address these questions, in this study we apply the free-water imaging method on a
cohort of chronic schizophrenia (CHR) patients, and compare the extents of deterioration
and neuroinflammation with the ones previously obtained for FE patients.
2. Methods
2.1 Subjects
The subjects were 29 patients diagnosed with CHR and 25 controls matched for age, gender,
handedness, PSES and premorbid IQ. Patients with CHR were recruited from in-patient, day
treatment, out-patient, and foster care programs. DSM-IV diagnoses were based on SCID-P
interviews, and information from patient medical records. The CHR subjects were included
if they were at least 1 year following diagnosis, however the average duration of illness for
this cohort was 15 years (see table 1). The Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms
(SAPS) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) were used to
evaluate positive and negative symptoms in schizophrenia (Andreasen, 1983, 1984). The
severity of clinical symptoms was also assessed using the positive and negative symptom
scale (PANSS) (Kay et al., 1987). In our cohort there was an average score of 10.8 for
SANS, 10.2 for SAPS and 22.9 for positive PANSS, 21.7 for negative PANSS and 42.4 for
general PANSS. Comparison subjects (group-matched to patients on age, sex, handedness
(Edinburgh Handedness Inventory), and parental social economic-status (PSES)) were
recruited through advertisements in local newspapers, and tested with SCID-NP interviews.
All subjects were included in the study if they met the following criteria: ages between 18
and 55, no history of neurological illness, no alcohol or drug dependence in the last 5 years
and no abuse in the past year, right handedness and an ability and desire to cooperate with
the procedures. Normal comparison subjects were also screened to exclude first-degree
relatives with an Axis I disorder. For demographic details of both patients and controls see
Table 1. The study was approved by the local IRB committees. All subjects signed informed
consent forms prior to study participation.
2.2 MRI Acquisition
All subjects were scanned on a single 3 Tesla General Electric Signa system (GE Medical
Systems). This cohort was scanned using the same scanner and protocol as we previously
used to scan the FE patients (Pasternak et al., 2012). However, the scans of the current
cohort were acquired following a software upgrade, which may have slightly shifted the
measurement. Therefore, in this paper we refrain from quantitatively comparing the results
previously obtained for the FE subjects with those reported here for the CHR subjects, and
instead compare the spatial extent of findings across studies. The complete MRI acquisition
is reported in a previous publication (Pasternak et al., 2012). In short, the acquisition
included a high-resolution 1.7x1.7x1.7 mm? diffusion MRI sequence, with 51 gradient
directions with b=900 s/mm2, and eight additional b=0 images, in addition to several other
anatomical acquisitions.

2.3 Free-Water Imaging
The analysis pipeline replicated the analysis reported in (Pasternak et al., 2012), including
motion and eddy currents artifact corrections and masking of the diffusion MRI. The free-
water imaging maps were obtained by fitting the aligned diffusion MRI data with the free-
water model (Pasternak et al., 2009). The model includes two compartments, a free-water
compartment and a tissue compartment. The free-water compartment accounts for water
molecules that diffuse freely (only likely to be found in the extracellular space), and is
described by a single parameter, which is the fractional volume of free-water (FW). The
second compartment accounts for water molecules that are in proximity to tissue
membranes, which is also the signal that is left following the elimination of freely diffusing
water molecules. The tissue compartment is modeled using a diffusion tensor and the tensors
are converted to scalar measures by calculating their eigenvalue decomposition. The free-
water model can be estimated from a conventional diffusion MRI acquisition, in which case
additional mathematical restrictions of continuity are enforced to allow the estimation of the
two compartments. The model, as well as the continuity restriction, forms a cost function,
and the fitting is done using an iterative process that simultaneously minimizes this function
for all of the free parameters, namely the FW parameter and the diffusion tensor
representing the tissue compartment. As a result, voxel-wise maps of FA corrected for free-
water (FA7) are obtained, in addition to the voxel-wise FW map. This FAy parameter is
equivalent to the regular FA parameter, yet since the signal from the extracellular space is
attenuated, FAy is more sensitive and specific to geometrical changes that occur in the tissue
(Metzler-Baddeley et al., 2012).
2.4 Statistical analysis
To compare between groups we first applied the tract based spatial statistics (TBSS) method
(Smith et al., 2006), which uses FA images from all subjects to coregister onto a common
space (MND), and to generate a common white matter skeleton. The different scalar
measures (FW and FA,y) were then projected onto the skeleton. Group comparisons were
carried using a permutation-based test (Randomise, FSL), with a threshold free cluster
enhancement, fully accounting for family-wise errors (Smith and Nichols, 2009). The
permutation tests included age, gender and motion as covariates. The resulted voxel-wise
significance maps were visualized using the FSL software package in 2D (TBSS-fill and
FSLview).
Further analysis was performed in selected regions of interest (ROD, which were defined on
the white matter skeleton. Diffusivity values were averaged across all voxels in the ROI. In
addition, the correlation coefficients of the average values and the total SANS or SAPS
scores were calculated using Pearson correlation. In a secondary analysis we looked at each
SANS or SAPS socre separately, and compared the averaged diffusivity values between
symptomtatic (score >0) and non-symptomatic (score=0) patients using a t-test.
3. Results
Comparing the FW measure between the schizophrenia patients and controls showed
localized increased FW (Fig. 1). Voxels with significantly increased FW (p<0.05 in blue)

were found on 2.7% of the white matter skeleton (green) in the left hemisphere, and none on
the right side. This is a much smaller extent compared to the widespread FW increase of
41% in the left hemisphere and 38% in the right hemisphere white matter of FE patients
(Pasternak et al., 2012). The brain areas showing significantly increased FW in the CHR
patients were in the left frontal, parietal and temporal white matter, identified by an atlas
(Mori et al., 2005 The Netherlands (2005)) as the anterior, superior and posterior corona
radiata, as well as parts of the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum (forceps minor and
major). The average FW in the significant voxels was 0.18 for the control group and 0.22 for
the CHR group. These average values over the CHR group did not correlate with any of the
summarized clinical measures. A secondary analysis revealed that subjects with the
following positive symptoms had significantly higher FW than asymptomatic subjects:
Olfactory hallucinations, circumstantiality, pressure of speech, clanging and inappropriate
affect.
Comparing the FAy measure between the groups showed decreased FA, (Fig 2; p<0.05 in
red) for the patient group on 2.1% of the white matter skeleton in the right hemisphere, and
4.3% of the skeleton in the left hemisphere. This is an increase in extent compared to 1.65%
and 1.25% of voxels with decreased FA,7 on the right and left hemisphere skeletons,
respectively, reported for FE (Pasternak et al., 2012). The areas where decreased FAy were
found for the CHR patients largely overlapped with areas showing increased FW on the left
hemisphere, but were also found on the corona radiata on the right hemisphere. In addition
there were areas with decreased FA 7 in parts of the thalamic radiation and SLF in both
sides, the left external capsule and left middle cerebellar peduncle.
Figure 3 compares the extent of decreased FA, for the CHR subjects (peach) with the extent
of decreased FAy previously reported for FE patients (cyan), and areas in the brain where
the two reports overlapped (red). There was a small overlap of 5.3% (7.5% on the right and
2.3% on the left hemispheres) between the two results, i.e., only 5.3% of the voxels that had
significantly decreased FA,y for the FE patients also had significantly decreased FA, for the
CHR patients. To further compare the results between the two reports we defined two
regions of interest: ROI-CHR was composed of all voxels that showed decreased FA, in the
CHR patients (red and peach in figure 3); ROI-FE was composed of all voxels that showed
decreased FA, in the previous report of first episode patients (red and cyan in figure 3).
The average FAy over ROI-CHR was 0.578 for the controls and 0.534 for the CHR patients.
Plotting the values of each subject against age (Fig. 4) shows that group differences were
driven by the older subjects. Furthermore, in ROI-CHR there was a negative correlation
between FAy and age for the CHR subjects (R=—0.38; p=0.0409), but not for the controls
(R=—0.06; p=0.7580). The average FAy in ROI-CHR was negatively correlated (R=—0.47;
p=0.014) with negative symptoms as measured by SANS (Fig. 5), and had a trend level
negative correlation (R=—0.34; p=0.086) with the general psychopathology PANS scale. A
secondary analysis did not reveal any significant group differences between symptomatic
and asymptomatic subjects for any of the SANS or SAPS scores.
Figure 6 presents the FA; values measured in ROI-FE (Pasternak et al., 2012). Here, for the
CHR subjects, within this ROI, the decrease in FAy was no longer significant compared

with controls (p =0.102; t(49) = —1.66). The mean FAy across the control subjects was
0.3931, and for the CHR patients 0.3835. Within ROI-FE the CHR patients had a negative
correlation between FAy and age (R= —0.42; p=0.022). The correlation coefficient for the
controls and age within this ROI was not statistically significant (R= —0.28; p=0.18).
4. Discussion
Our results demonstrate that free-water imaging identifies abnormalities in the chronic stage
of schizophrenia. There were limited areas in the brain that showed increased free-water,
and larger areas in the brain that showed decreased FAy. Taken together with previous
results obtained for subjects in the early stages of the disease, our findings suggest that white
matter deterioration may play a larger role than neuroinflammation in the chronic stages of
schizophrenia.
For typical DTI settings, such as those used here, freely diffusing water molecules require
spaces larger than a few tens of microns, which are not likely to be found within brain cells,
since those typically have smaller sizes (Kandel et al., 2013). Therefore the FW contrast
provides a voxel-wise measure of extracellular fractional volume that is expected to be
increased in neuroinflammation due to modulation of the blood brain barrier permeability
(Whitney et al., 2009). We report here that the extent of abnormally increased FW was much
lower in CHR patients, compared with FE patients in our previous report (Pasternak et al.,
2012), suggesting that neuroinflammation diminishes in extent at the chronic phases of
schizophrenia. This is aligned with findings from other studies, where neuroinflammation
was mainly found close to the onset of the disorder (Najjar and Pearlman, in print), or during
psychotic episodes (Steiner et al., 2008). Nevertheless, signs of neuroinflammation were
also found in post-mortem studies of chronic patients (Fillman et al., 2013). It is interesting
to note that peripheral inflammation was also found in the early stages of schizophrenia,
which may suggest a chronic inflammatory disorder affecting not just the brain (Dickerson
et al., 2012). In our results, we do not find a correlation between FW and summary scores of
positive and negative symptoms, but we do find increased FW in patients with specific
positive symptoms.
Neuroinflammation is a reversible process; being a response triggered by the innate immune
system, neuroinflammation is an important part in the brain's defense mechanism as well as
in the healing process of injuries or insults, and is usually resolved autonomously (Streit,
2006). In schizophrenia, one of the recent hypotheses assumes that neuroinflammation is
triggered, but is not terminated, much like an immune response in autoimmune diseases
(Najjar et al., 2013; Streit, 2006). As a result, toxins that are released during the
neuroinflammatory process cause collateral damage to the surrounding tissue (Whitney et
al., 2009), which could lead to cellular deterioration. On the other hand, it has also been
found that many of the psychiatric drugs have strong anti-inflammatory properties (Sommer
et al., 2012), which could diminish neuroinflammation in subjects who respond well to
drugs. In our cohort, all of the CHR subjects were medicated, and not currently experiencing
a psychotic episode. Therefore medication could be one possible explanation for the
reduction in the extent of increased FW from the first episode stage to the chronic stage.

There was a greater extent of decreased FAy reported here for CHR patients, compared with
the extent previously reported for FE patients (Pasternak et al., 2012). Further, the location
of abnormal FA, has spread from initially being only in the frontal lobe for FE, to the
frontal, temporal and occipital lobes bilaterally in the CHR subjects. These findings are in
line with an expected neurodegenerative pattern in which more brain areas are affected as
the disease progresses (Keshavan, 1999; Lieberman, 1999). There were more FA, findings,
as well as FW findings, on the left and frontal areas of the brain. Since the FE results were
more symmetric, we can assume that more deterioration develops in the left hemisphere in
later stages of schizophrenia. This is consistent with findings in many other studies, showing
more tendencies for left and frontal abnormalities in CHR (Ellison-Wright and Bullmore,
2009; Fitzsimmons et al., 2013). Further supporting a neurodegenerative pattern is the fact
that the decreased FAy was correlated both with age and with negative symptoms,
associating the extent of FAy decreases with the period of illness and its severity (Voineskos
et al., 2013). FAy, however, did not show group differences for any specific negative
symptoms.
Only 5.3% of the voxels that had decreased FAy in FE patients (ROI-FE) also had decreased
FA, in CHR patients (ROI-CHR). The overlapping area included relatively small regions in
the frontal lobe that showed similar FAy differences for both the FE and CHR populations.
The FAy values observed in ROI-FE for the CHR population appear to gradually decrease
with age and are lower than those reported in the FE population. These FAy values were
also lower comparing with the FA; values in ROI-CHR on the same CHR population.
Taken together, this suggests that ROI-FE may point to areas where the degeneration
process starts early in schizophrenia. On the other hand, the ROICHR areas included much
larger brain areas, which may be involved in the later stages of the disease. However, it
could also be that differences in locations are population specific, since clinical
symptomatology varies between individuals in schizophrenia, as do white matter differences
(Melonakos et al., 2011). Furthermore, since age, duration of illness, and duration of
medication are highly correlated in CHR subjects, it is not possible to definitively state the
cause of decreased FAy, as well as the relation between neuroinflammation and white matter
deterioration. It would therefore be important to replicate our findings in a longitudinal
design, where the same population is compared in various stages of the disease, rather than a
cross-sectional design such as the one used here.
We note that in the previous study increased FW was also found in gray matter (Pasternak et
al., 2012). Volumetric gray matter changes (Honea et al., 2005), as well as functional MRI
abnormalities (Gur and Gur, 2010) are often reported in CHR subjects. However, studying
the gray matter using free-water imaging in the CHR population is more challenging since
the increased FW found in gray matter (data not shown) is highly affected by gray matter
atrophy. Future work separating the effect of atrophy from the FW measure may be useful
for gray matter studies in chronic schizophrenia. In addition, a more direct validation of the
association of the free-water measure with neuroinflammation is needed. Our findings also
promote the need to search for free-water imaging abnormalities in prodromal stages of
schizophrenia, in order to better understand the roles of neuroinflammation and white matter
deterioration in the etiology of schizophrenia.

Group differences in FW. Statistically significant (p<0.05) Increased FW in chronic
schizophrenia patients compared with controls is shown in blue over the white matter
skeleton (green). FW was increased on 2.7% of the left hemisphere skeleton. Presented are
axial slices equally spaced between z=58mm to z=-37mm on the MNI template.

Comparison of decreased FAy in chronic schizophrenia subjects with decreased FA7 in first-
episode schizophrenia subjects. Voxels previously reported to have lower FA, in first
episode are presented in cyan, whereas voxels reported here with lower FAy values in
chronic schizophrenia subjects are presented in peach. The overlap (i.e., areas where FA;
was significantly decreased in both populations) is colored in red.

schizophrenia (CHR) patients, but not for the controls. The largest group differences can be
seen for the older subjects.
