Signiﬁcance
Mercury (Hg) causes deleterious 
e΍ects on wildlife and human 
health. Even though we know that 
Hg is heterogeneously distributed, 
its spatial distribution at a very 
large scale in the marine biota 
remains poorly documented. 
Seabirds are commonly used to 
study the health of marine 
environments. In this study, we 
used seabirds as bioindicators of 
Hg presence through the North-­
Atlantic Arctic. Our maps highlight 
a gradient in Hg concentrations, 
with concentrations increasing 
from the Barents Sea to the East 
coast of Canada. This work is of 
tremendous importance for Arctic 
communities who rely on the 
marine environment but also for 
international initiatives such as the 
Minamata Convention that 
actively work for decreasing Hg 
emissions worldwide.

Mercury (Hg) is a heterogeneously distributed toxicant aﬀecting wildlife and human 
health. Yet, the spatial distribution of Hg remains poorly documented, especially in food 
webs, even though this knowledge is essential to assess large-­scale risk of toxicity for the 
biota and human populations. Here, we used seabirds to assess, at an unprecedented 
population and geographic magnitude and high resolution, the spatial distribution of 
Hg in North Atlantic marine food webs. To this end, we combined tracking data of 837 
seabirds from seven diﬀerent species and 27 breeding colonies located across the North 
Atlantic and Atlantic Arctic together with Hg analyses in feathers representing indi-
vidual seabird contamination based on their winter distribution. Our results highlight 
an east-­west gradient in Hg concentrations with hot spots around southern Greenland 
and the east coast of Canada and a cold spot in the Barents and Kara Seas. We hypoth-
esize that those gradients are inﬂuenced by eastern (Norwegian Atlantic Current and 
West Spitsbergen Current) and western (East Greenland Current) oceanic currents and 
melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet. By tracking spatial Hg contamination in marine 
ecosystems and through the identiﬁcation of areas at risk of Hg toxicity, this study 
provides essential knowledge for international decisions about where the regulation of 
pollutants should be prioritized.
mercury | ecotoxicology | spatial distribution
Mercury (Hg), under its most toxic form (methyl-­mercury, MeHg), is a toxicant that 
bioaccumulates and biomagniﬁes (1), aﬀects wildlife and human health, and is globally 
distributed in both marine and terrestrial environments (2). Te spatial distribution of 
Hg in marine systems is largely heterogeneous due to a wide range of abiotic transportation 
processes and contrasting local environmental conditions and biogeochemistry (3–5). 
Recent investigations provided new insights on the oceanic and atmospheric distribution 
of Hg (6–9). Coastal areas’ Hg concentrations are mostly inﬂuenced by rivers (10), whereas 
oﬀshore, they are mostly aﬀected by oceanic and atmospheric depositions (11). However, 
our knowledge about Hg spatial distribution in food webs remains limited (but see refs. 
12–14), often with a coarse resolution or restricted to coastal regions (2, 12, 15–17). Such 
knowledge and the subsequent identiﬁcation of Hg hot and cold spots (i.e., areas with 
the highest and lowest concentrations, respectively) is nonetheless essential to assess 
large-­scale exposure of species and support their management and to protect communities, 
like the Arctic Indigenous peoples, who rely on top predators for subsistence. Te mapping 
of the spatial distribution of Hg will also improve the understanding of Hg cycling and 
its transfer into food webs, as well as provide essential knowledge for international eﬀorts 
aiming to reduce Hg in the environment. For instance, the Minamata Convention on 
Mercury aims to “protect human health and the environment from anthropogenic emis-
sions and releases of mercury and mercury compounds” (18). But to assess the eﬀectiveness 
of the Minamata Convention and potential changes in Hg release, we ﬁrst need to track 
spatial variation of Hg in biota and identify where the hot and cold spots are to identify 
risks and manage major sources of Hg emissions. In this context, top predators like seabirds 
are powerful biomonitors of spatial variation of Hg levels (19–21). Seabirds have a wide 
distribution, occupying all marine regions of the globe (22). Tey use a variety of marine 
habitats (e.g., coastal and oceanic, pelagic and benthic) and can be tracked in space and 
time using miniaturized electronic devices (23–27). Te geolocation technology allows 
us to relate Hg concentrations in speciﬁc individuals to their at-­sea distribution and thus 
provide detailed information about environmental Hg for areas that are otherwise diﬃcult 
to access (15, 23). In this study, we simultaneously tracked the spatial winter distribution 
of 837 seabirds belonging to seven species breeding at 27 colonies across the North Atlantic

Arctic (i.e., Eastern Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Scotland, Faroe 
Islands, Norway, Western Russian Arctic) and their individual 
winter contamination with Hg measured in feathers. Our aim was 
to provide new insights into Hg spatial distribution and hot and 
cold spots within marine food webs at the North Atlantic scale. 
As coastal and oﬀshore areas do not have the same sources of Hg, 
we used a multispecies approach which includes a wide range of 
life history traits (foraging ecology and trophic position) known 
to aﬀect seabird Hg uptake, thus providing the most comprehen-
sive spatial distribution of Hg.
Seabirds as Indicators of Mercury Distribution 
in North Atlantic Food Webs
Mercury concentrations varied along both longitudes and lati-
tudes (Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Table S1 and Fig. S1B), with a 
general positive east-­west gradient across the North Atlantic. 
Results from our ocean-­scale data extend previous investigations 
for the North Atlantic and sub-­Arctic which suggested higher 
coastal Hg concentrations oﬀ eastern Canada compared to 
European coasts (19, 20, 28). Beyond this general pattern, our 
approach provides in situ evidence that Hg distribution in biota 
was largely heterogeneous at ﬁne scale and across the entire 
oceanic North Atlantic (Fig. 1B). Previous work mapped MeHg 
in phytoplankton worldwide, but this was a modeling work 
based on abiotic observations and transfer of MeHg at the base 
of the food chain only (29). In the present study, the highest 
concentrations occurred in Hg hot spots located along the east-
ern Canadian coasts as well as oﬀ the southern and southeastern 
coasts of Greenland. Mercury concentrations, in feathers rep-
resenting contamination at these hot spots, were found to be 
up to three times as high as in the Barents and Kara Seas (min-
imum–maximum estimated values 1.55 to 4.05 µg g−1 dry 
weight). Additionally, cold spots where Hg concentrations 
measured in feathers were the lowest were found in waters west 
of Iceland, around Jan Mayen, on the north Norwegian coast, 
and in the White Sea.
Identifying the large-­scale distribution of Hg in marine ecosys-
tems is possible through large at-­sea sampling campaigns. Such pro-
grams (e.g., GEOTRACES) exist and have proven their importance 
for the understanding of contaminant ecodynamics (5, 30, 31). 
Nonetheless, they are particularly costly and logistically diﬃcult 
to implement and maintain over time. Terefore, complementary 
approaches such as the use of bioindicators that provide informa-
tion about the contamination status of an environment are essen-
tial. To eﬃciently inform about Hg contamination in the marine 
environment, the chosen bioindicator species are usually top 
predators (i.e., highest concentration of Hg due to biomagniﬁca-
tion process), long-­lived (i.e., highest concentration of Hg due to 
bioaccumulation process), and widely distributed (i.e., cover dif-
ferent and large environments) (22, 26, 27). With this study, we 
demonstrate how the use of Hg measurements in seabird feathers 
combined with biologging (tracking data) can be used to identify 
Hg hot spots and cold spots at a large spatial scale (see refs. 15 
and 16 for previous species-­ and population-­speciﬁc investiga-
tions). Over the last two decades, the improvement of tracking 
technologies (e.g., smaller and lighter devices, battery autonomy) 
has allowed scientists to follow seabird movements and distribu-
tion outside the breeding period [e.g., the SEATRACK database, 
https://seapop.no/en/seatrack/, and associated publications (23, 
24, 26), BirdLife Seabird Tracking Database https://www.sea-
birdtracking.org, and associated publication (27, 32) http://www.
seabirdtracking.org]. Te collection of feather samples from bioin-
dicators, like seabirds that integrate Hg contamination over a 
period (e.g., seasonal or yearly contamination (28)), allows for 
concurrent measurements of Hg concentrations (see network 
ARCTOX https://arctox.cnrs.fr/en/home/, refs. 4 and 23) at a 
very large scale and high resolutions that cannot easily be done by 
research vessels that can only make ad hoc measurements. With 
their global distribution, seabirds are thus excellent candidates for 
a global investigation of Hg distribution in marine ecosystems. In 
addition, these in situ approaches and their outputs are essential 
to complement and feed modeling approaches (29). We nonethe-
less stress that almost all seabird species are feeding within the 
epipelagic zone (<200 m depth) and thus can only be used to 
quantify the spatial distribution of Hg in this water layer. Previous 
investigations showed the heterogeneous distribution of Hg along 
the water column and dependence on its stratiﬁcation (33, 34). 
Other bioindicators, such as marine mammals or predatory ﬁshes, 
that can also be tracked to follow environmental conditions in 
space and time (33) could be considered as good bioindicators for 
deeper stratiﬁcation layers. For instance, large-­scale variations in 
Hg concentrations were shown in the Tropical Paciﬁc using skip-
jack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) (12). Similarly, seabirds have pre-
viously been used to highlight diﬀerences in Hg exposure between 
diﬀerent regions at the species and population level and thus sug-
gested spatial diﬀerences in environmental contamination (e.g., 
refs. 16 and 35 in the North Paciﬁc, ref. 15 in the North Atlantic). 
However, those studies were species speciﬁc and therefore covered 
only a limited compartment of the environment (e.g., speciﬁc 
habitat and diet). Multispecies analysis, in contrast, allows us to 
cover diﬀerent ecologies, spanning multiple habitats and diets.
Spatial Origin of Mercury in the Marine 
Environment and Seabird Conservation
Te underlying drivers of the spatial variability seen in the present 
study are not well understood, but two hypotheses can be made. 
First, the presence of Hg in oceanic currents could explain the 
east–west diﬀerence. In the North Atlantic, ascendant oceanic 
currents circulating along the Norwegian and Spitsbergen coasts 
transport 43 ± 9 Mg y−1 (i.e., gross ﬂux) of Hg to the Arctic, where 
it accumulates with a residence time of 50 to 100 y (36). Similarly, 
54 ± 13 Mg y−1 of Hg is exported south by descendant oceanic 
currents from the Arctic to southern Greenland passing along the 
East coast of Greenland before ﬂowing up its west coast (37). Tis 
high export of Hg from the Arctic could explain the increased 
concentrations of Hg measured in the eastern and southern parts 
of Greenland. Second, the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet 
could release Hg from geological sources, resulting in high con-
centrations of Hg along the south coasts of Greenland (38, 39). 
Mercury is also deposited on ice sheets and snow through the 
Arctic because of atmospheric deposition (40) and then released 
into the marine environment during periods of melting (36, 41). 
Tese multiple sources of Hg in North Atlantic and Arctic marine 
systems strengthen the need to use multiple seabird species that 
rely on oceanic and/or coastal, pelagic and/or benthic environ-
ments to derive a more comprehensive understanding about Hg 
distribution in biota. Finally, because Hg contamination mostly 
originates from diet and consumed prey, bird species, which have 
diﬀerent trophic ecology, were included as a random factor in the 
statistical and spatial analyses so that it would not bias Hg spatial 
distribution (Methods). Doing so, seabirds were speciﬁcally used 
as bioindicators of Hg contamination. Characterizing hot spots 
of Hg in marine ecosystems is essential to highlight areas where 
the marine biota may be at risk of toxicity. By combining existing 
tracking data from multiple seabird species in the North Atlantic, 
major hot spots of biodiversity have been identiﬁed in the middle

of the North Atlantic and by the Great Bank and northward into 
the Labrador Sea (27, 42). In our present study, model outputs 
show that these western areas had some of the highest predictions 
for Hg contamination which implies a higher toxicity risk com-
pared to the biota wintering in the eastern part of the North 
Atlantic. Acknowledging the existence of high risk of Hg contam-
ination within these hot spots strengthens the need for protecting 
these areas. Based on these hot spots of biodiversity, the OSPAR 
commission has recently established a marine protected area in 
the middle of the North Atlantic (27). However, because of the

high transportability of Hg at a large spatial scale, it is interna-
tional regulations like the Minamata Convention, that entered 
into force in 2017 and have been ratiﬁed by over 145 parties to 
date, that can act to strengthen the decrease of Hg emissions. Te 
evaluation of the eﬃciency of associated mitigation measures 
requires monitoring of Hg both in the environment and in food 
webs. By providing information at large spatial and temporal 
scales, and with a high resolution (15, 16), our data thus ﬁll an 
important knowledge gap and complement existing studies regard-
ing Hg distribution in water masses (29, 37), in biota (11), and 
international programs such as the Global Mercury Assessment 
led by UN Environment (2).
Societal and Stakeholder Implications
Arctic human communities mostly rely on traditional food 
resources, usually top predators, exposing them to high Hg 
concentrations. Consequently, the Arctic Indigenous Peoples 
possess some of the highest human concentrations of Hg world-
wide (36, 43). Various deleterious eﬀects have been found with 
for instance neurological deﬁcits in children or cardiovascular 
disease in adults (44). Te Hg concentrations measured in the 
Greenlandic and Canadian Inuit populations are among the 
highest measured in the Arctic and are in accordance with our 
results (44). Terefore, as our study gives new insight about the 
spatial distribution of Hg through the North Atlantic, we urge 
1) the international community to take new actions to protect 
both the environment and human health from Hg toxicity as 
presented within the Minamata Convention and 2) interna-
tional programs to coordinate a global action toward an 
improved knowledge of Hg monitoring in marine ecosystems. 
Te assessment of the biota in the open sea is a complicated 
endeavor, as species migrate and are not easily accessible. 
However, this study and our technical approach of tracking and 
sampling feathers of seabirds have proved its eﬃciency to assess 
Hg contamination where seabirds are at sea. Our work demon-
strates how wildlife can be used as cost-­eﬃcient bioindicators 
to gather important information about Hg distribution at a 
large scale. Such information is essential for the international 
community to take new and rapid action regarding the contam-
ination by Hg of the environment and the subsequent risk for 
wildlife, human health, and the environment.
Methods
Species, Study Sites, and Sample Collection. From June–July 2014 to 
June–July 2017, chick-­rearing Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica, n = 42), 
black-­legged kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla, n = 119), Brünnich’s guillemots 
(thick-­billed murres; Uria lomvia, n = 239), common guillemots (common 
murres; Uria aalge, n = 131), little auks (dovekies; Alle alle, n = 64), north-
ern fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis, n = 124), and incubating common eiders 
(Somateria mollissima, n = 118) were outfitted with light-­level geolocators 
(GLS—Global Location Sensor) at 27 breeding colonies, for 1 to 4 y during the 
breeding season. These colonies were distributed across the northern part 
of the North Atlantic (SI Appendix, Table S1), encompassing Eastern Canada, 
Greenland, Iceland, Scotland, Faroe Islands, Norway, and Western Russian 
Arctic (Fig. 1A). The outfitted seabirds were of undetermined sex for all species 
but common eiders, for which only females were studied. GLSs were retrieved 
in each subsequent breeding season (one to four retrievals per individual 
in the period 2015 to 2018) (SI Appendix, Table S2). At each GLS retrieval, 
three feathers per individual (from head, back, or belly) were collected for 
subsequent Hg analyses (15, 23, 28, 45). Collected feathers were selected 
to represent Hg contamination during the nonbreeding period (i.e., from 
approx. October to February, see “Hg analyses” below), a period comparable 
to that actually spent at the wintering grounds (i.e., from approx. November 
to January, see “Spatial analyses” below) and successfully used in previous 
research (15, 23). Nonbreeding periods include migration. We assumed that 
Hg accumulated at stopovers and acquired along migration routes (a few 
days within the October-­February period, ref. 24) could be neglected in com-
parison to Hg accumulated over the about 5 mo spent at wintering grounds. 
Feather collection and GLS deployments/retrieval were mostly done as part of 
the ARCTOX network (https://arctox.cnrs.fr/en/home/) and SEATRACK (https://
seapop.no/en/seatrack/) project which aim to track Hg contamination across 
Arctic marine food webs and model the nonbreeding distribution of seabirds 
breeding throughout the North Atlantic, respectively. Mercury concentrations 
in coastal areas are mostly influenced by river (10), whereas offshore areas 
are mostly affected by oceanic and atmospheric depositions (11). Therefore, 
we used species that use either coastal (i.e., common eiders) or offshore envi-
ronment (i.e., Atlantic puffins, black-­legged kittiwakes, Brünnich’s guillemots, 
common guillemots, little auks, northern fulmars). Additionally, we used spe-
cies that feed at the surface (black-­legged kittiwakes, northern fulmars) or on 
benthic preys (common eiders), or feed on epipelagic prey down to 50 to 150 
m depth, depending on the birds’ body size (in increasing order: little auks, 
Atlantic puffins, Brünnich’s guillemots, and common guillemots).
Spatial Analyses. GLS light-­level data were converted into a positional data-
set by identifying the timing of twilights, using a threshold method (45), 
from which two daily latitudes and longitudes were estimated from apparent 
day and night lengths and from time of midnight and noon, respectively 
(see ref. 46 for details). The accuracy of locations estimated from light-­level 
data is usually considered low, and it is recommended to use such data to 
study movements >200 km (46, 47). Low accuracy is mainly due to errors 
in latitude and less so in longitudes, when light conditions are affected by 
factors such as weather, habitat, topography, behavior, and artificial light. 
Further, constant daylight and polar night prevent estimation of location. 
When using a light threshold corresponding to sun elevation angles around 
−3° to −4°, this occurs above 63°N and 70°N at summer and winter solstice, 
respectively. In addition, latitudes are increasingly unreliable closer to spring 
or autumn equinox, when the day length is similar at all latitudes on the 
planet. We therefore discarded latitude during a three week period on each 
side of the apparent equinox (8 September to 20 October and 20 February 
to 3 April) for all species.
To mitigate these multiple issues, we first applied several filters to improve 
the timing of twilights, to remove the most erroneous locations, as described 
in ref. 48. Then, we applied an informed random movement algorithm [IRMA 
(49)] to fill the data gaps (including during the equinoxes) by modeling a 
maximum of two random locations per day. This method follows an approach 
originally proposed by Technitis et al. (50) and takes into account complemen-
tary information on light levels, land masks to replace the missing locations 
with the most plausible estimates, thereby reducing the sampling bias in our 
dataset to the minimum possible (49). More specifically, in winter, the model 
uses information about land and sea-­ice masks (constraining random posi-
tions to areas with <80% sea-­ice concentration), whether the logger recorded 
a continuous night (constraining the seabird to north of the limit of the polar 
night area), and species-­specific movement rates (constrain each additional 
location to remain within a certain distance to adjacent locations). IRMA is 
parametrized for offshore, pelagic species only and is not suitable for common 
eiders that are benthic species relying on coastal environments. Hence, IRMA 
could not be used for this particular species, for which the positional gaps 
were not corrected.
To link Hg contamination to areas with the most extensive feeding through 
the winter season, we excluded the post-­ and prebreeding periods. Thus, we 
considered the winter period to be the same within species as the timing of sea-
birds’ nonbreeding period is small (24, 51–53) and should not affect Hg spatial 
distribution. Therefore, we deﬁned the winter period as the period November to 
January for Atlantic pufﬁns (see ref. 24), black-­legged kittiwakes (54), Brünnich’s 
and common guillemots (52, 55, 56), common eiders (57) and little auks (53). 
As northern fulmars have been returning to their colonies as early as January in 
the literature (58), which was also observed in our dataset (SI Appendix, Fig. S1), 
the nonbreeding period was deﬁned from November to December for this 
species (SEATRACK, Unpublished). Although individual seabirds show a rather 
restricted distribution during winter at the scale of the North Atlantic, they can

show small-­scale changes in their spatial distribution (24). To take this small-­scale 
winter spatial distribution into account, a medoid winter location (i.e., the location 
with the shortest and -­ nearest neighbor distance–to all the other locations of a 
given track) was calculated per week, for each individual and for their entire winter 
period (mean values of positions per species and sampling sites are presented 
in SI Appendix, Table S1).
Mercury Analyses. Feathers were used as indicators of individual Hg contam-
ination during winter, when seabirds are at sea (28). Briefly, during their molt, 
seabirds excrete ~70 to 90% of accumulated Hg into their feathers (59–61). 
Hence, Hg in feathers inform about the Hg accumulated by an individual 
between two molting sequences. Alcids and Larids undergo a total molt after 
the breeding season (i.e., right before, during or right after the postbreeding 
migration, September to October) resulting in the winter plumage, and a 
partial molt (i.e., cheek, neck, throat for Alcids, back and head for Larids) at 
the end of the nonbreeding period (i.e., right before or during the prenuptial 
migration, March to April) resulting in the nuptial plumage (62, 63). Female 
common eiders undergo a partial molt (i.e., body contour feathers) after 
the breeding season, and a complete molt at the end of the nonbreeding 
period (64, 65). Hence, head, back, and belly feathers provide information 
about Hg contamination specifically during the nonbreeding period in alcids, 
black-­legged kittiwakes, and common eiders, respectively. Northern fulmars 
undergo one total molt per year after the breeding season (body feathers 
molted between September and March, ref. 66). Recent studies indicated that 
Hg concentrations in body feathers of northern fulmars reflect interindividual 
variations in Hg contamination during the winter period (66). Consequently, 
and in order to investigate Hg contamination during the nonbreeding period, 
we collected in the following breeding season head feathers from Atlantic puf-
fins, Brünnich’s guillemots, common guillemots and little auks, back feathers 
from black-­legged kittiwakes, and belly feathers from common eiders and 
northern fulmars. Feathers were stored in plastic bags at ambient temperature 
until Hg analyses.
Prior to Hg analyses, feathers were cleaned to remove external contamina-
tion. To do so, they were plunged into a 2:1 chloroform:methanol solution for 
3 min in an ultrasonic bath, rinsed twice in a methanol solution, and dried at 
45 °C for 48 h. Mercury analyses were performed on a ~0.20 to 1.00 mg sub-
sample of a pool of three homogenized feathers (i.e., to avoid heterogeneity 
between feathers), using an Advanced Mercury Analyzer spectrophotometer 
(Altec AMA 254–detection limit of 0.05 ng). The analysis of each sample was 
repeated (two to three times) until the relative SD for two subsamples was 
<10%. The mean concentration for these two subsamples was then used for 
statistical analyses. Prior to Hg analyses, blanks were run, and to ensure the 
accuracy of measurements, certified reference materials were used every fif-
teen samples (lobster hepatopancreas TORT-­3; NRC, Canada; reference values 
were of 0.29 ± 0.02 µg g−1 dry weight (dw) SD, mean measured ± SD = 0.30

dw SD, recovery = 97.3 ± 1.0%). Mercury concentrations are expressed in µg 
g−1 dry weight (dw). Total Hg concentrations are used as proxies of MeHg as 
more than 80% of the Hg excreted into feathers is under its organic and toxic 
MeHg form (67, 68).
Statistical Analyses. Mercury spatial distribution in the North Atlantic was 
predicted by regression-­kriging (RK) (using package “gstat” ref. 69). Within the 
different regression-­kriging methods, we used the ordinary-­kriging (hereafter 
OK) (70). This technique is based on a spatial interpolation on a surface that uses 
the closest cell to calculate its prediction in each cell and allows to use regres-
sion models. More speciﬁcally, as we want to use seabirds as bioindicators (i.e., 
homogenize the different ecologies), this method allowed us to use mixed models 
to add species as random effects. The regression-­kriging technique consists of 
two steps. The ﬁrst step uses linear regression to model the spatial trends in the 
dataset and the second step interpolate the residuals from the linear regression 
using kriging. The ﬁnal spatial predictions on the surface are the sum of the 
predictions from the two steps.
Step 1. Applying a regression (linear mixed model–LMM) and predict Hg con-
centrations at the medoid winter locations. Our full model was Hg ~1 + fixed 
effects (longitude + latitude) + random effects (species:sampling sites). All 
seabird species were included in the model, and “species” was included as a 
random effect. This allows us to take into account their different ecologies in 
the model (e.g., habitat, prey) and therefore use seabirds as bioindicators only. 
Indeed, during the nonbreeding period, seabirds rely on different habitats 
where Hg concentrations are under different influences (10, 40) and prey. 
Food is the main pathway for Hg accumulation in seabirds (71). Therefore, 
and due to biomagnification processes (72), contrasting diet, trophic status, 
and habitats (both between populations and species) might affect measured 
Hg concentrations and need to be taken into account in the model. However, 
the use of seabirds with different ecologies as bioindicators could have some 
limitations. Our models captured the dataset heterogeneity as shown for 
instance by the ICC (see below). A common method in ecology to take into 
account different ecologies consists of using carbon and nitrogen stable iso-
topes. However, this method could not be applied here as stable isotopes 
do not cover the same period as Hg contamination in feathers (73). Indeed, 
while Hg concentrations in feathers represent an intermolt period, the stable 
isotope values only represent the period of the feather growth. Additionally, 
as our study is based on a multicolony analysis, colonies (“sampling sites”) 
were included as a random effect to take into account the different breeding 
distributions and the different nonbreeding strategies (e.g., length of migra-
tion–SI Appendix, Fig. S2). As several species can breed at a sampling site, we 
have nested the variable species into the variable sampling site. The intraclass 
correlation coefficient (ICC) indicates that 64 to 69% of the variances in Hg 
concentrations comes from the variables species and sampling site. For each 
winter, individuals had one Hg concentrations for one to 14 winter location 
(Spatial Analyses) and 212 individuals (15 Atlantic puffins, eight black-­legged 
kittiwakes, 72 Brünnich’s guillemots, 25 common eiders, 39 common guil-
lemots, seven little auks, and 46 northern fulmars) have been sampled for 2 
to 4 y (SI Appendix, Table S1). To take into account the individual variability 
and nonindependence of this variable, we used a bootstrap approach (i.e., 
random extraction—see details below in step 2), which allowed us to exclude 
“individual” from the LMM. This random extraction of the data was necessary 
as individuals were attributed to several (weekly) nonbreeding medoid points 
(Spatial Analyses) making this variable nonindependent.
Step 2. We summed the predictions from the LMM and OK. More speciﬁcally, we 
used the residuals of the LMMs to run the interpolation with the OK on a 1° × 1° 
grid covering the entire North Atlantic (Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Fig. S3) (74). The 
use of the residuals of the LMM to run the kriging analyses is the most common 
method of regression kriging, and allows us to include the spatial variability of 
our dataset that is not captured by the LMM (70). The use of regression kriging 
requires that one or more covariates (here longitude and latitude of the medoid 
winter locations) are signiﬁcantly correlated with the dependent variable (i.e., Hg 
concentrations) to ensure the strength between the response and predictive vari-
ables, which was the case [correlation coefﬁcient (2.5 to 97.5 quantiles): −0.47 to 
−0.43, P-­value (2.5 to 97.5 quantiles): 4.9e-­48 to 1.3e-­39; correlation coefﬁcient 
(2.5 to 97.5 quantiles): −0.38 to −0.35, P-­value (2.5 to 97.5 quantiles): 4.9e-­31 
to 3.2e-­21; respectively].
In order to take the lack of independence in our data into account (i.e., 
repeated individual positions), we used a bootstrap approach (i.e., random 
extraction) (Fig. 2). To do so, we randomly extracted one medoid position per 
individual to create a subset of independent data. We repeated this procedure 
1,000 times to create a total of 1,000 subsets. On each subset, we ran the two 
steps of the regression kriging method and calculated the predicted values from 
both the LMM and the OK. After that, we were able to sum both predictions from 
the LMM and OK to get improved predictions (75).
The ﬁnal output is a map of the mean predictions from each subset (Fig. 1B 
and SI Appendix, Fig. S3). A map of the variance calculated for all the predic-
tions is also provided in appendix (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). It presents the variance 
between our 1,000 subsamples. To determine the minimally sufﬁcient number 
of subsets to account for the heterogeneity of our dataset, and this validate our 
approach using 1,000 subsets, we calculated the variance between each ﬁnal 
map each time we added an iteration until we reached a stable variance (Fig. 2 
and SI Appendix, Fig. S4).
Mercury concentrations (the LMM response variable) were log transformed 
to meet the parametric assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity of the 
residual distributions. Statistical analyses were performed with R version 3.4.3
