ABSTRACT Pathogenic and nonpathogenic species of bacteria and fungi release membrane vesicles (MV), containing proteins,
polysaccharides, and lipids, into the extracellular milieu. Previously, we demonstrated that several mycobacterial species, in-
cluding bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, release MV containing lipids and proteins that sub-
vert host immune response in a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent manner (R. Prados-Rosales et al., J. Clin. Invest. 121:
1471–1483, 2011, doi:10.1172/JCI44261). In this work, we analyzed the vaccine potential of MV in a mouse model and compared
the effects of immunization with MV to those of standard BCG vaccination. Immunization with MV from BCG or M. tuberculo-
sis elicited a mixed humoral and cellular response directed to both membrane and cell wall components, such as lipoproteins.
However, only vaccination with M. tuberculosis MV was able to protect as well as live BCG immunization. M. tuberculosis MV
boosted BCG vaccine efﬁcacy. In summary, MV are highly immunogenic without adjuvants and elicit immune responses compa-
rable to those achieved with BCG in protection against M. tuberculosis.
IMPORTANCE This work offers a new vaccine approach against tuberculosis using mycobacterial MV. Mycobacterium MV are a
naturally released product combining immunogenic antigens in the context of a lipid structure. The fact that MV do not need
adjuvants and elicit protection comparable to that elicited by the BCG vaccine encourages vaccine approaches that combine pro-
tein antigens and lipids. Consequently, mycobacterium MV establish a new type of vaccine formulation.

acterial pathogens use different secretion systems to release
their products into the extracellular environment, tissues, or
bloodstream of the host organism (1). Some bacteria and fungi
use membrane vesicles (MV) to release a complex group of pro-
teins, polysaccharides, and lipids into the extracellular milieu (1–
5). Both pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria species secrete
MV, providing another means by which they interact with pro-
karyotic and eukaryotic cells in their environment (1). Typically,
MV from pathogenic bacteria contain virulence factors, including
toxins, adhesins, and/or immunomodulatory compounds. The
packaging of virulence factors in vesicles allows microorganisms
to deliver host cell-damaging materials in a concentrated manner.
Our group has demonstrated the production of MV in Gram-
positive bacteria (6), including Streptococcus pneumoniae (7), Ba-
cillus subtilis (8), and several mycobacterial species, such as the
medically important bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) and Myco-
bacterium tuberculosis (5). Moreover, we showed that mycobacte-
rial MV transport lipids and proteins known to be involved in the
subversion of the immune response of the host. Remarkably, MV
from pathogenic mycobacteria concentrate lipoproteins, includ-
ing the well-studied 19-kDa LprG and LprA proteins. These com-
ponents signal via Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), directly affecting
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presen-
tation in macrophages and dendritic cells and modulating the
interaction with the host (5).
Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health problem. In
2010, there were 8.8 million incident cases of TB, 1.1 million TB-
associated deaths among HIV-uninfected people, and an addi-
tional 0.35 million among HIV-infected people (9). Efforts to con-
trol the disease include the development of point-of-care tests,
new TB drugs, the use of the BCG vaccine, and the development of
new vaccines. Most of the new TB vaccine candidates that have
entered clinical trials fall into one of the following groups: (i) live
attenuated vaccines to replace BCG; (ii) subunit vaccines to be

given after initial BCG vaccination (10); and (iii) single immuno-
dominant antigens, usually secreted, such as ESAT-6, Cfp10, and
Ag85b, along with other adjuvants (10).
Despite the connection between bacterial vesicles and viru-
lence, MV also serve as potential vaccines, since they elicit im-
mune responses that protect against mucosal and systemic bacte-
rial infections, including those caused by Neisseria meningitidis
(11), Bordetella pertussis (12), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi-
murium (13), Vibrio cholerae (14), and Bacillus anthracis (6). Ar-
tiﬁcially produced membrane vesicles from the Gram-negative
bacterium N. meningitidis constitute the basis of a newly licensed
vaccine (VA-MENGOC-BC) (15). Recently, the immune re-
sponse to artiﬁcial MV (liposomes) from Mycobacterium smegma-
tis showed cross-reactivity against M. tuberculosis antigens in mice
(16). These ﬁndings suggest the possibility of using MV from
M. tuberculosis or other pathogenic mycobacteria as protective
vaccines. In this study, we explored whether vaccination with MV
induced protective immune responses against experimental mu-
rine pulmonary M. tuberculosis infection. The results demon-
strated that mycobacterial vesicles elicited protection against an
M. tuberculosis aerosol infection in mice and established the po-
tential of MV as components of a new type of vaccine against TB.
RESULTS
Lipoproteins determine the immunogenicity of mycobacterial
MV. To characterize the immune response to MV in mice,
C57BL/6 mice were immunized twice with 2.5 g of MV from
either BCG or H37Rv (based on total weight) subcutaneously
(SC) with no adjuvant. The serum antibody response was mea-
sured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a
whole-cell M. tuberculosis lysate 42 days after the initial immuni-
zation (Fig. 1A). In each experiment, mice that had been injected
SC with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and mice that had re-
ceived BCG were used as controls. No detectable M. tuberculosis-
speciﬁc IgM or IgG antibodies were found in the control groups.
The antibody response to the MV differed depending on the
source of the immunogen. The response to BCG MV included
moderate levels of IgM and IgG2b and lower levels IgG2c. In con-
trast, H37Rv MV immunization triggered a higher antibody re-
sponse dominated by IgG1 and IgG2b isotypes (Fig. 1A). Since
mycobacterial MV are enriched in lipoproteins and surface-
associated proteins (5), we hypothesized that antibodies in sera
from BCG or H37Rv MV-immunized mice should preferentially
recognize the surface-associated compartments of M. tuberculosis.
To test this, we performed ELISA against different mycobacterial
subcellular fractions, including membrane, cell wall, cytosol, and
culture ﬁltrate proteins (Fig. 1A). BCG MV sera showed an en-
hanced reactivity against a cell wall fraction, including a mixed
IgG2b/c response. When ELISA of a membrane fraction was per-
formed, H37Rv MV immune sera showed the highest antibody
levels with a predominant IgG1/2b response. Of note, no antibod-
ies against the cytosolic fraction were detected. The magnitude of
the response to culture ﬁltrate proteins was reduced compared to
that of the response to cell wall or membrane stimulations, and
only BCG MV immune sera contained speciﬁc IgG2b/c antibodies
reacting against this fraction (Fig. 1A). We also found signiﬁcant
differences in the strength of the antigen-antibody (total IgG) in-
teraction between BCG and H37Rv MV sera against a whole-cell
lysate (Fig. 1B). These results show that BCG MV and H37Rv MV
induced different antibody responses in terms of isotype, inten-
sity, and avidity and that much of the antibody response was di-
rected to the mycobacterial surface compartments, including the
cell membrane and cell wall.
To determine the identity of the M. tuberculosis proteins rec-
ognized by MV sera, we used nucleic acid programmable protein
assays (NAPPA) (Table 1; also, see Fig. S1A and B in the supple-
mental material). In this technique, mycobacterial proteins are
transcribed and translated by a cell-free system and immobilized
in situ by means of epitope tags fused to the proteins enabling
studies on a proteome scale (17). Using an antibody to the
C-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag, which conﬁrms
full-length translation, we detected protein signals for 99% of the
printed genes (see Fig. S1A). Further, the arrays were probed with
sera from live vaccine BCG-, H37Rv MV-, and PBS-immunized
mice and developed with a ﬂuorescence secondary mouse anti-
body (due to limited amount of arrays, BCG MV antiserum was
excluded from the analysis). Arrays were further scanned and nor-
malized by ﬁrst removing the background signal (ﬁrst quartile of
negative-control spots) and then using median scaling to adjust
for array-wide differences in signal intensity. The reactive spots
obtained with the BCG or H37Rv MV immunizations were se-
lected when they presented a normalized value higher than 1 and
at least a 2-fold change relative to PBS (Table 1). In Fig. S1B we
show a representative section of the two arrays, containing some
of the most reactive proteins. A total of 36 M. tuberculosis proteins
were recognized by BCG and/or H37Rv MV immune sera. Among
the proteins identifed, 25 were MV speciﬁc, 6 were BCG speciﬁc,
and 5 were common to sera from both immunizations (Table 1).
Of note, the signal intensities were much higher after vesicle im-
munization than BCG immunization. The four most reactive pro-
teins included the lipoproteins LpqH, Lppx, and PstS1, indicating
that lipoproteins elicit the most of the antibody response to MV.
Immunoblots on lysates from a BCG mutant with a knockout of
lpqH (19 kDa) showed that the 19-kDa reactive band was LpqH,
according to its lack of reactivity in sera from MV-vaccinated mice
(see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). The protein VapC6 was
also detected with a strong signal, indicating that vesicles also gen-
erated antibodies against mycobacterial toxins. Of note, no anti-
bodies to lipoproteins were detected in sera from mice that re-
ceived the standard vaccination with live BCG. These results
indicate that BCG and vesicle immunizations in mice elicit quan-
titatively and qualitatively different antibody responses. Overall,
these results indicate that despite the protein heterogeneity in ves-
icle composition, only a minor fraction of these proteins deter-
mined the immunogenicity of vesicles in terms of antibodies.
Mycobacterial MV induce a high Th1 response. We then
studied the cellular response to MV immunization, since a T
helper type 1 (Th1) cell response is crucial in protective immunity
to many intracellular pathogens, including M. tuberculosis (18). As
described above, mice were immunized with two doses of 2.5 g
of BCG or H37Rv MV SC, and the splenic responses of spleens
stimulated with M. tuberculosis lysate or the subcellular fraction
were studied ex vivo by measuring gamma interferon (IFN-)-
and interleukin 2 (IL-2)-positive cells by enzyme-linked immu-
nospot (ELISPOT) assays 3 weeks after the last immunization
(Fig. 2). Immunization with H37Rv MV triggered the highest
IFN- splenic responses upon stimulation with M. tuberculosis
lysate, with responses being 2-fold higher than those elicited by
BCG MV and almost 1.5-fold those observed with BCG immuni-
zation (Fig. 2A). Of note, signiﬁcantly higher responses were ob-

served in MV-immunized mice when subcellular fractions were
used for stimulation, including cell wall or membrane, indicating
that much of the splenic response was exclusively directed to bac-
terial cell surface compartments. Supporting this idea was the ob-
servation of a reduced response in MV-immunized spleens upon
stimulation with culture ﬁltrate proteins compared with live BCG.
The speciﬁcity of the immunization regimens was tested by re-
stimulation of splenocytes with an M. tuberculosis-speciﬁc peptide
(TB10.4), producing a recall in the responses of M. tuberculosis
MV-immunized spleens only (Fig. 2A). We also measured IL-2
splenic responses upon stimulation with the same preparations
(Fig. 2B). In this case, the higher overall responses after stimula-
tion with M. tuberculosis lysate, cell wall, or membrane were ob-
served in live-BCG-immunized spleens, followed by those immu-
nized with H37Rv MV and BCG MV (Fig. 2B). As observed with
IFN- splenic responses, a markedly higher response was ob-
served in MV-immunized spleens upon stimulation with cell
surface-associated fractions. In addition, signiﬁcantly higher re-
sponses were observed in live-BCG-immunized splenocytes upon
stimulation with culture ﬁltrate proteins. Immunization with live
BCG also induced higher IL-2 splenic responses upon stimulation
with cytosol, contrary to what was observed in MV-immunized
splenocytes. The speciﬁcity of the stimulation with the M. tuber-
culosis-related TB10.4 peptide was also conﬁrmed (Fig. 2B). The
experiment was repeated using isolated T cells from the same set of
immunized mice (Fig. 2C). This time isolated T cells were mixed
with splenocytes from naive mice and stimulated with either
M. tuberculosis lysate or a cell wall fraction enriched in lipopro-

teins. Both BCG-immunized and H37Rv MV-immunized mice
showed the highest number of IFN--producing T cells in whole-
cell-lysate (WCL)-stimulated wells. Stimulation with the lipopro-
tein fraction showed an increase in the response in H37Rv MV-
immunized mice, followed by BCG MV- and BCG-immunized
mice (Fig. 2C).
These results suggest that immunization with MV elicited a
splenic response that was almost exclusively directed to cell sur-
face compartments.
Next, we examined the multifunctionality of the T cell re-
sponse in MV-immunized mice by intracellular cytokine staining.
Mice were immunized as described above, and cytokine produc-
tion by splenic CD4 and CD8 T cells was analyzed at day 42
after restimulation with an M. tuberculosis lysate and a lipoprotein
fraction as described above (Fig. 3). Upon restimulation in vitro
with an M. tuberculosis lysate, we observed a substantial increase in
single-, double-, and triple-cytokine-producing CD4 T cells in
H37Rv MV-immunized mice relative to those immunized with
BCG and BCG MV (Fig. 3A). Notably, H37Rv MV-immunized
mice showed signiﬁcantly greater frequencies of IL-17-producing
CD4 T cells, followed by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-)
producers (Fig. 3A). Of note, an almost unique CD4 T cell pop-
ulation producing TNF and IL-2 was associated with this immu-
nization. The frequency of triple producers was low but still sig-
niﬁcantly higher in H37Rv MV-immunized mice than in the other
groups. When the same splenocytes were stimulated with a lipo-
protein fraction, the magnitude and complexity of the response
were reduced, and most of the CD4 T cell subpopulations pro-
ducing IL-17 and TNF- were associated with immunizations
with H37Rv MV (Fig. 3A). Analysis of CD8 T cells showed a
similar response for BCG and H37Rv MV when splenocytes were
stimulated with an M. tuberculosis lysate. Immunization with
H37Rv MV showed only a signiﬁcant increase in the IFN- pro-
ducing CD8 T cells (Fig. 3B). Stimulation with a lipoprotein
fraction did not reduce the magnitude of the response but the
complexity. A comparable population of IL-2-positive CD8 T
cells was observed in all the groups. Immunization with H37Rv
MV elicited an almost exclusively TNF--positive CD8 T cell
population. It is noteworthy that only immunization with BCG
and H37Rv MV induced the population producing the three cy-
tokines. As in splenocytes stimulated with M. tuberculosis lysate,
the majority of the response was restricted to single-cytokine pro-
ducers (Fig. 3B).
These results strongly suggest that immunization of mice with
H37Rv MV elicited a Th1 response stronger than and superior to
that resulting from BCG MV or BCG immunization, including
lipoprotein-speciﬁc polyfunctional T cell populations.
Mycobacterium-derived MV protect against M. tuberculosis
infection. We tested whether immunization with mycobacterial
MV was protective in mice against an M. tuberculosis challenge.
Immunized mice were infected with approximately with 100 CFU
via aerosol, 3 weeks after the last immunization. Eight weeks after
infection, lung and spleen bacterial burdens were determined.
Mice immunized with PBS or two million bacilli of BCG Pasteur
were used as negative and positive controls, respectively (Fig. 4;
also, see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material). The experiment
was done three times. Two experiments showed a protective effect
for H37Rv MV, comparable to that obtained with the control
BCG, with a signiﬁcant reduction of lung CFU relative to levels in
PBS-treated mice (Fig. 4A). Of note, immunization with BCG MV
was not protective in all experiments. In one experiment, we
found almost no reduction in lung CFU in H37Rv MV-
immunized mice, comparable to results with unvaccinated mice
(PBS) (Fig. 4A). The same trend was observed when CFU were
counted in spleens (see Fig. S3). Importantly, in experiments
where H37Rv MV resulted in a reduced number of CFU in the
spleen, similar to BCG, some mice had numbers of spleen CFU
below the limit of detection (see Fig. S3). This result indicates the
potential capacity of H37Rv MV to control bacterial replication
and dissemination, similar to that of BCG.
Histological analysis of lung sections indicated that the per-
centage of disease tissue was similar between MV- and BCG-
immunized mice relative to PBS. However, both H37Rv MV- and
BCG-immunized mice showed a signiﬁcantly lower percentage of
diseased tissue than BCG MV-immunized mice (Fig. 4C). The
same held true for the number of foci of inﬁltrates (Fig. 4D). These
results demonstrate that immunization with H37Rv MV without
adjuvant protected as efﬁciently as the current live BCG vaccine.
Boosting BCG vaccine with mycobacterial vesicles enhances
humoral and cellular immune responses. Finally, we tested
whether mycobacterial MV had the capacity to improve the per-
formance of the control vaccine BCG. Three weeks after BCG

immunization, mice were given boosters of H37Rv MV and M. tu-
berculosis-speciﬁc antibodies, and splenic responses were analyzed
3 weeks after the boosters. When inverse titers were tested against
a WCL of M. tuberculosis, a low antibody response, including IgM,
was detected in serum of BCG-vaccinated mice (Fig. 5A). When
animals were given boosters of H37Rv MV, IgG1, IgG2b, and
IgG2c M. tuberculosis-speciﬁc antibodies were detected, with
IgG2b being the prevalent subclass. Of note, immunization with
H37Rv MV elicited a similar antibody proﬁle with lower levels,
indicating that the proﬁle observed in the mice given boosters was
almost entirely associated with H37Rv MV immunization. Higher
levels of antibodies were detected when ELISA was performed
against an M. tuberculosis cell wall subcellular fraction enriched in
lipoproteins, with major levels for the IgG1 subclass (Fig. 5A).
This result showed that boosting BCG vaccination with H37Rv
MV elicited a more diverse antibody response than standard BCG
immunization.
MV boosting increased 2-fold the number of M. tuberculosis-
speciﬁc splenic cells producing IFN-, after restimulation with a
WCL, compared to that in BCG-vaccinated mice (Fig. 5B). The
same held true when the same splenocytes were stimulated with
M. tuberculosis subcellular fractions, including cell wall, cytosol,
and membrane (Fig. 5B). Again, the splenic response observed in
H37Rv MV-immunized mice was comparable to that of boosted

upon M. tuberculosis lipoprotein stimulation in mice receiving
boosters than in BCG-vaccinated mice (Fig. 5B). These data
strongly suggest that boosting the BCG response with vesicles en-
hanced the quantity and the quality of the immune response.

MV booster had signiﬁcantly lower bacterial counts than the
BCG-vaccinated and MV-vaccinated mice (Fig. 5C). Giving BCG-
immunized mice the mycobacterial MV booster did not seem to
improve the control of the bacterial dissemination, as all the
groups except the PBS-treated mice manifested the capacity to
reduce the number of CFU in spleen (Fig. 5C). Histopathological
analysis of lung sections showed no difference in the percentage of
disease tissue between mice receiving boosters and BCG-
immunized mice (data not shown). These results show that giving
H37Rv MV boosters to BCG-vaccinated mice can improve hu-
moral and splenic responses and the capacity to reduce the viable
bacteria in the lung.
DISCUSSION
Our group recently reported that mycobacterial strains, including
M. tuberculosis and BCG, produce MV which are released into the
extracellular space (5) and which are involved in iron acquisition
(19). Remarkably, only vesicles from the virulent strains are en-
riched in lipoproteins, which are well known to be TLR2 agonists
involved in modulation of host immune response (20). Lipid
analysis indicated a prevalence of polar lipids, consistent with an
origin from the cellular membrane. Intratracheal administration
of MV to mice followed by aerosol challenge resulted in an in-
crease in the bacterial burden in the lungs (5), suggesting a Koch-
like phenomenon where an immune response to the MV in the
lung worsened the outcome of infection. However, for other bac-
terial pathogens, such as B. anthracis (6), N. meningitidis (21),
Escherichia coli (1), S. pneumoniae (7), and Pseudomonas aerugi-
nosa (1), systemic immunization with MV induces protective im-
munity (13, 22–27). Presumably, the immune response to bacte-
rial MV-based vaccines neutralizes bacterial toxins and/or is
directed to the bacterial surface and membrane antigens, promot-
ing bacterial opsonization and/or complement-mediated killing.
In addition, bacterial clearance upon MV immunization could be
mediated by Th1 and Th17 cell responses (28). These results, com-
bined with the successful clinical use of an MV-based vaccine
against meningococcus (22), suggest that MV have potential for
vaccine development.
In this study, we examined the feasibility of using naturally
produced MV from two M. tuberculosis strains, BCG and H37Rv,
as experimental vaccines against TB in a mouse model. Initially,
we observed no effect on the capacity of BCG MV to reduce lung
and spleen CFU relative to H37Rv MV- and BCG-immunized
mice. However, BCG MV immunization was associated with a
reduced percentage of disease lung tissue. Several aspects of the
immune response after immunization may explain the differential
protection efﬁcacy of BCG MV and H37Rv MV. The ﬁrst is the
speciﬁcity and avidity of the antibody response directed to surface
M. tuberculosis compartments. Although antibody responses have
historically been ignored in studies of TB immunity, there is now
strong evidence that some immunoglobulins contribute to host
defense (29). Despite the fact that MV are composed of a complex
mixture of lipids and 60 to 80 proteins (5), only a few of these
proteins elicited strong antibody responses. In agreement with the
enrichment of lipoproteins in mycobacterial MV, the antigens
found to be immunogenic determinants were in fact three lipo-
proteins (LpqH, LppX, and PstS1) and one chaperonin, GroEL1.
In a recent pilot study, we identiﬁed an antibody reactivity pattern
to MV-associated proteins in TB patients as a potential biomarker.
Patients with disseminated TB lacked antibodies to MV proteins
of ~36, 25, and 23 kDa (30), some of which match the mass of the
immunogenic lipoproteins identiﬁed in this study. These data
suggest correspondence between our ﬁndings in the mouse model
and the antibodies in clinical samples to MV-associated lipopro-
teins in humans, an association that warrants further investiga-
tion. Furthermore, analysis of humoral and cellular responses to
subcellular fractions of mycobacteria in mice immunized with
MV, including a cell wall fraction enriched in lipoproteins, sup-
ports the notion that MV induce immunity mainly against
mycobacterial-surface-related compartments. M. tuberculosis
may use lipoproteins as a decoy mechanism to escape from mac-
rophage responses by inhibiting antigen processing and presenta-
tion, inducing cytokines that modulate inﬂammation (20, 31, 32).
The second potential reason for the different efﬁcacies of the two
immunizations is higher levels of splenic multifunctional M. tu-
berculosis-speciﬁc CD4 T cells. Despite the important role of
multifunctional T cells in multiple infectious disease models (33–
35), there is not a consensus on the role of these cells during
M. tuberculosis infection (36–39). The third is a signiﬁcantly
higher frequency of CD4 T cells producing IL-17. This result is
consistent with previous studies in which mice with higher fre-
quencies of IL-17A-producing CD4 T cells following vaccination
were better protected from an aerogenic challenge with M. tuber-
culosis (40). Thus, in agreement with protective mechanisms
found in other bacterial-MV-based vaccines and the available
knowledge of host defenses against mycobacteria, we believe that
speciﬁc antibodies and T cell responses elicited by MV vaccination
may inactivate or neutralize the immunomodulatory properties of
lipoproteins to provide a net protective effect. However, the pre-
cise mechanism by which mycobacterial MV induce protective
immune responses against mycobacterial infection remains elu-
sive, and passive-transfer and T cell-adoptive transfer experiments
will be needed to ascertain their contribution to protection.
Mycobacterial-lipoprotein-based vaccines have been shown to
produce opposite effects after vaccination. Presumably, the way
these lipoproteins are incorporated into these preparations could
affect the outcome of the immunization. Of note, vaccination with
recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing the 19-kDa and 38-kDa
lipoproteins produced a signiﬁcant reduction in CFU in lung of
infected mice at levels comparable to those achieved with BCG
(41). Some mycobacterial lipoproteins, including LpqH, were re-
cently shown to activate and modulate CD4 T cell effector func-
tions in a TLR2-dependent manner, independently of antigen-
presenting cells, suggesting that M. tuberculosis lipoproteins can
regulate adaptive immunity not only by inducing cytokine secre-
tion and costimulatory molecules but also through direct regula-
tion of T lymphocytes (42). This observation suggests that myco-
bacterial MV could potentially serve as an adjuvant, since these
molecules directly enhance CD4 T cell memory responses. Re-
cently, some mycobacterial lipids associated with MV, such as
PIM2 and PIM6, were used as adjuvants, showing their capacity to
modulate the immune response and increase the efﬁcacy of a pro-
tective vaccine against M. bovis infection (43). In this context, we
also show that subsequent immunization of BCG-vaccinated mice
with M. tuberculosis MV improved the level of protection by sig-
niﬁcantly reducing the number of viable bacteria in lungs com-
pared to those in BCG-vaccinated mice.
We previously proposed that mycobacterial MV may represent
the connecting vehicle between phagosomes and the host vesicu-
lar system (5). In this context, it is worth noting that mycobacte-

rial MV and exosomes of M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages
share 50% of their protein content (44). Moreover, apoptotic ves-
icles from M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages stimulate CD8
T cells in vivo and protected mice similarly to mycobacterial MV
(45).
Our observations strongly suggest that MV preparations have
considerable promise as vaccine components. Naturally obtained
mycobacterial MV offer many advantages over conventional vac-
cines. They can be obtained easily, they deliver many antigens,
including all major virulence factors, and unlike live bacteria, they
lack the ability to replicate and cause infection or change over time
by microevolution of cultures. In this regard, BCG vaccine strains
have been shown to diverge signiﬁcantly from original stocks (46).
Furthermore, MV have the signiﬁcant advantage that they require
no adjuvants. Coadministration of MV with live BCG, or boosting
of prior BCG vaccination with MV, enhances the protective efﬁ-
cacy against M. tuberculosis. However, we believe that vesicle re-
lease is a tightly regulated process, which may be affected by dif-
ferent variables. The fact that only two of three protection studies
showed an effect of M. tuberculosis MV indicates that using natu-
rally derived MV from cultures could present reproducibility is-
sues. In this regard, we have observed variability in the antigen
recognized by human serum samples of different M. tuberculosis
MV batches (our unpublished data). Consequently, producing
MV from mycobacteria could involve a major challenge in stan-
dardizing preparations and artiﬁcial liposomes containing immu-
nogenic antigens could provide a more consistent approach for
reliably eliciting protective responses. Indeed, this concept has
been already applied to other MV (47). In summary, mycobacte-
rial MV provided protection that was comparable to that obtained
with BCG in mice and required no adjuvants, suggesting a new
avenue for development of vaccines against TB.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mycobacterial culture. Mycobacteria (Mycobacterium bovis bacillus
Calmette-Guerin [BCG, Pasteur strain] and M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv)
were grown in a minimal medium (MM) consisting of KH2PO4 (1 g/liter),
Na2HPO4 (2.5 g/liter), asparagine (0.5 g/liter), ferric ammonium citrate
(50 mg/liter), MgSO4·7H2O (0.5 g/liter), CaCl2 (0.5 mg/liter), and ZnSO4
(0.1 mg/liter), with or without 0.05% (vol/vol) Tyloxapol, containing
0.1% (vol/vol) glycerol, pH 7.0 (As mycobacterial membrane vesicles are
isolated from culture supernatant, we use a deﬁned medium [minimal
medium] to avoid the presence of undesired contaminants in our prepa-
rations.) The M. bovis BCG strain lacking the 19-kDa protein (lpqH) was
a gift from D. Young. The lpqH strain was grown in the presence of
50 g/ml of hygromycin. Cultures were grown for up to 10 days in 850-
cm2 roller bottles (Corning) at 37°C. In challenge experiments, Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (M7H9) sup-
plemented with 10% (vol/vol) OADC (oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-
catalase) enrichment (Becton, Dickinson Microbiology Systems, Sparks,
MD) and 0.5% (vol/vol) glycerol, with or without 0.05% (vol/vol) Tylox-
apol (Sigma).
Subcellular fractionation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. M. tuber-
culosis H37Rv whole-cell lysate and subcellular fractions were obtained as
described previously (48). Brieﬂy, 10-day-old cultures of M. tuberculosis
H37Rv were harvested by low-speed centrifugation in lysis buffer (0.05 M
potassium phosphate, 0.022% [vol/vol] -mercaptoethanol [pH 6.5],
supplemented with protease inhibitors, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂu-
oride [PMSF], and 1 mM EDTA), and the cell suspension was treated with
a French press. The lysed bacterial suspension was centrifuged at 27,000 
g, yielding a pellet corresponding to the cell wall fraction. The supernatant
was treated with RNase for 1 h at 4°C and then ultracentrifuged at 100,000
 g. This produced a pellet (membrane fraction) and a supernatant, cor-
responding to the cytosolic fraction. To obtain the cell wall fraction en-
riched in lipoproteins, the mycobacterial cell wall preparation was ex-
tracted with Triton X-100 as described previously (20). The presence of
lipoproteins in this fraction was assessed by mass spectrometry.
Vesicle isolation and puriﬁcation. Vesicles were isolated as described
previously (5). Brieﬂy, cells were pelleted (3,450  g for 15 min at 4°C)
from 1,000-ml cultures and the supernatants were ﬁltered through a 0.45-
m-pore-size polyvinylidene diﬂuoride ﬁlter (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
The supernatant volumes were then concentrated ~20-fold using an Ami-
con (Millipore) ultraﬁltration system with a 100-kDa exclusion ﬁlter. The
concentrate was then sequentially centrifuged at 4,000 and 15,000  g
(15 min, 4°C) to remove cell debris and aggregates, and the remaining
supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000  g for 1 h at 4°C to sediment
the vesicular fraction into a pellet. The supernatant was then discarded,
and the pellet was suspended in 1 ml of 10 mM HEPES, 0.15 M NaCl and
mixed with 2 ml of Optiprep solution (Sigma) in 10 mM HEPES and
0.15 M NaCl (yielding a ﬁnal Optiprep concentration of 35% [wt/vol]).
The crude vesicle sample was then overlaid with a series of Optiprep
gradient layers ranging from 30 to 5% (wt/vol). The gradients were cen-
trifuged (100,000  g, 16 h), and 1-ml fractions were removed from the
top. The fractions were then dialyzed separately in PBS overnight and
again recovered by sedimentation at 100,000  g for 1 h. Finally, the
vesicles were suspended in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-free PBS. Dry-
weight measurements were used to determine the yield of MV prepara-
tions.
Immunizations and M. tuberculosis challenge. Six- to eight-week-
old female wild-type (C57BL/6) mice were purchased from the National
Cancer Institute (NCI, Frederick, MD). All mice were maintained under
speciﬁc-pathogen-free conditions and were transferred to biosafety level 3
conditions for infection with M. tuberculosis H37Rv. All procedures in-
volving animals were in compliance with protocols approved by the Al-
bert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Animal Use and Biosafety
Committees. BCG cultures were grown to mid-log phase, washed, sus-
pended in PBS plus 0.05% Tyloxapol (PBS-T), and sonicated before in-
fection. Mice were immunized with BCG subcutaneously (SC) at the
scruff of the neck with 2  106 CFU in 200 l for 6 weeks. Mice were also
immunized with approximately 2.5 g (total mass) of MV SC in a ﬁnal
volume of 200 l of PBS and then boosted 3 weeks later. A group of
BCG-immunized mice was boosted SC with a single dose of H37Rv MV
3 weeks later. Three weeks after the last immunization mice were infected
via aerosol with M. tuberculosis H37Rv. For aerosol challenge with M. tu-
berculosis, a low-density freezer stock of H37Rv was grown in 7H9 liquid
medium to an A600 of 0.4 to 0.8. A total of 2  106 CFU ml1 of bacteria
in PBS-T plus 0.04% (vol/vol) Antifoam Y-30 (Sigma) was placed in a
nebulizer attached to an airborne infection system (University of Wiscon-
sin Mechanical Engineering Workshop). Mice were exposed to aerosol for
40 min, during which approximately 100 bacteria were deposited in the
lungs of each animal. Tissue bacterial loads in tissues for aerosol infections
were determined by plating organ homogenates onto 7H11 agar-OADC
plates. Colonies were counted after 21 days of incubation at 37°C.
ELISA. Blood was obtained 6 weeks after the initial immunization
from the retro-orbital plexus. Serum was obtained by centrifugation at
10,000  g for 20 min and stored at 20°C until use. Serum reactivity was
measured by ELISA against a whole-cell lysate preparation of M. tubercu-
losis H37Rv or cellular fractions from the same strain. ELISA plates (96
wells) were coated with 20 g ml1 M. tuberculosis lysate or subcellular
fractions in PBS and incubated at 37°C for 1 h and then blocked in PBS
plus 3% BSA for 1 h at 37° C or overnight at 4° C. Wells were washed three
times in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) and then incubated with seri-
ally diluted (2-fold) mouse serum in PBS plus 1% BSA for 1 h at 37°C.
After three washes with PBST, wells were incubated with either alkaline
phosphatase (AP)-conjugated goat antibody to mouse immunoglobulin
G (IgG; heavy plus light chain) or AP-conjugated goat antibody to mouse
immunoglobulin M (1:1,000; M chain speciﬁc and cross adsorbed with

mouse IgG1, IgG2b, IgG2c, IgG3, and IgA) (Southern Biotechnologies)
for 1 h at 37°C. The secondary antibody was goat anti-mouse IgG-AP,
which reacts with the heavy and light chains of mouse IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b,
and IgG3 and minimally with the light chains of mouse IgM and IgA.
For IgG isotype analysis, IgG1, IgG2c, IgG2b, and IgG3 AP-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:1,000) were used (Southern Biotechnologies).
Color was developed with p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich). The
antibody titer was deﬁned as the higher dilution of serum resulting in
absorbance at 405 nm that was at least 2 times greater than the back-
ground, which correspond to PBS (sham immunized mice).
The avidity index was determined by diluting immune sera to a con-
centration that corresponded to an optical density (OD) of 0.5 in an
endpoint ELISA. Antibodies were allowed to react overnight on plates
coated with M. tuberculosis total cell lysate. Plates were washed, and vari-
ous concentrations of ammonium thiocyanate (63 mM to 4 M) were
added to the wells. After 20 min of incubation, plates were washed, and the
remaining antibody was detected as described above. The avidity index is
the concentration of ammonium thiocyanate required to reduce the OD
by 50% compared to that in wells with no chaotrope.
Immunoblotting. To conﬁrm the presence of antibodies speciﬁc to
the 19-kDa protein in the serum, serum reactivity was measured against a
whole-cell lysate preparation of a lpqH (19-kDa lipoprotein) mutant
strain of BCG by immunoblotting. Electrophoresis was done with a 12%
resolving gel at 100 V. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes,
which were then blocked overnight in a buffer containing 5% milk in PBS
with 0.1% Tween 20. Individual channels on a blotting frame were incu-
bated with diluted serum (1:400) in PBS plus 5% milk for 1 h at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C. Channels were washed three times with
blocking buffer and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-
conjugated goat antibody to mouse immunoglobulin G (Fc) (Thermo
Scientiﬁc) for 1 h at room temperature (this secondary antibody reacts
with the heavy chains of mouse IgG but not with the light chains of most
mouse immunoglobulins and not against mouse IgM or nonimmuno-
globulin serum proteins). Membranes were developed using luminol
(Pierce).
Serumantibodydetectionusingnucleicacidprogrammableprotein
assays (NAPPA). All 4,217 sequence-veriﬁed genes of M. tuberculosis in a
mammalian expression vector, pANT7_GST, were obtained from
DNASU (http://dnasu.org/DNASU/), including 3,816 clones from strain
H37Rv and 401 clones from strain CDC1551. The highly puriﬁed plasmid
DNAs were prepared and printed onto two amine-coated glass slides in
single spots using Genetix QArray2 with 300-m solid tungsten pins
(Molecular Devices, LLC, Sunnyvale, CA). All prepared arrays were stored
in a vacuum container at room temperature, as previously reported (49,
50).
The printed DNA was transcribed and translated using a human cell-
free expression system (Thermo, Fisher Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL). All pro-
teins were captured in situ by a polyclonal anti-GST antibody, which was
conﬁrmed by using mouse anti-GST monoclonal antibody (1:200 dilu-
tion)
(Sigma-Aldrich,
St.
Louis,
MO),
followed
by
horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:500 dilution) (Jack-
son ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, PA), as previously described
(49).
All serum screenings were executed automatically in HS 4800 Pro and
400 Pro hybridization stations (Männedorf, Switzerland) with a preset
serum screening program. Brieﬂy, the arrays were incubated with a 1:50
dilution of mouse serum in 5% milk in PBST at 4°C overnight, and mouse
antibody was detected by using Alexa555 goat-anti-mouse IgG (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Labs, West Grove, PA). The slides were scanned using a
Tecan (Männedorf, Switzerland) power scanner, and the images were
quantiﬁed with an Array-Pro analyzer, version 6.3 (Media Cybernetics,
Bethesda, MD). Prior to statistical analysis, all ﬂuorescent microarray
images were examined to remove false-positive signals caused by the spot
shape, dust, and nonspeciﬁc binding. Arrays were further scanned and
normalized by ﬁrst removing the background signal (ﬁrst quartile of
negative-control spots) and then using median scaling to adjust for array-
wide differences in signal intensity. The reactive spots obtained under
BCG-P or H37Rv MV conditions were selected when they presented a
normalized value higher than a 2-fold change relative to the value ob-
tained with PBS.
ELISPOT assay. Splenocytes or isolated T cells were cultured in RPMI
in ELISPOT plates (1  106/well; Millipore, Danvers, MA) coated with
IFN- capture antibody (clone R4.6A2; BD Biosciences) or IL-2 capture
antibody (clone JES6-1A12: BioLegend). The samples were stimulated
with 20 g ml1 of M. tuberculosis whole-cell lysate or subcellular frac-
tions or speciﬁcally with a lipoprotein-enriched cell wall fraction, and
plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. After removal of cells, the plates
were washed with PBS followed by PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST).
Biotinylated anti-IFN- detection antibody (clone 4S.B3; BD Biosci-
ences) and biotinylated anti-IL-2 detection antibody (clone JES6-5H4;
BioLegend) were added for 2 h at 37°C, followed by washing with PBST.
Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the
plates for 1 h (37°C), followed by washing and addition of 5-bromo-4-
chloro-3-indolylphosphate–nitroblue tetrazolium (BCIP-NBT) substrate
(Sigma-Aldrich). The reaction was stopped by washing the wells with
water, and spots were counted using an ELISPOT plate reader (Autoim-
mun Diagnostika, Strasberg, Germany).
Intracellular cytokine analysis. Analysis of cytokine-producing
CD4 and CD8 T cells was performed 3 weeks after the last immuniza-
tion. Splenic-cell suspensions were isolated and placed in 96-well plates in
RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Brieﬂy, splenocytes were
isolated from ﬁnely minced spleens, and cell suspensions were passed
through a 70-m cell strainer, washed, and suspended in fresh medium.
The samples were stimulated with 10 g ml1 of M. tuberculosis whole-
cell lysate (WCL) or cell wall fraction or speciﬁcally with a lipoprotein-
enriched cell wall fraction. Unstimulated wells served as negative controls
in naive mice and surrogates for mycobacterial infections in the immu-
nized and infected mice. Samples were combined with 1 g ml1 soluble
antibody to mouse CD28 (clone 37.51). After 2 h at 37°C, 10 g ml1 of
brefeldin A (Sigma) was added to all samples, followed by incubation for
4 h. Cells were stained with blue LIVE/DEAD viability dye (Invitrogen)
followed by antibody to FcRII/III (clone 2.4G2; American Type Culture
Collection), with ﬂuorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies for
surface staining: antibody to CD3 (clone 145-2C11; eBioscience), anti-
body to CD8 (clone 53-6.7; BD Bioscience), antibody to CD4 (clone
GK1.5; BD Bioscience), and antibody to CD45R (B220) (clone RA3-6B2;
BD Bioscience). Cells were ﬁxed with 2% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde,
washed with permeabilization buffer (PBS with 1 mM Ca2, 1 mM Mg2,
1 mM HEPES [N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N=-2-ethanesulfonic acid],
2% [vol/vol] FCS, and 0.1% [wt/vol] saponin) and then blocked in per-
meabilization buffer plus 5% (vol/vol) normal mouse serum (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Intracellular cytokines were detected
with ﬂuorochrome-conjugated antibodies to IL-2 (clone JES6-5H4; eBio-
science), IFN- (clone XMG1.2), TNF- (MP6-XT22) (both from BD
Biosciences), and IL-17 (clone 17B7; eBioscience). Data were acquired on
an LSR II ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences), and data analysis was per-
formed using FlowJo software v.10 (Tree Star).
Histology. Lungs were removed and ﬁxed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin (Fisher Scientiﬁc, Fair Lawn, NJ). Tissues were embedded with
parafﬁn, sectioned at 5-m thickness, and stained with hematoxylin and
eosin stain. Five different lung sections per mouse were analyzed. Images
of lung sections were taken using an Axio Observr microscope (Zeiss) at
1.25 or 2.5 or scanned at 2,000 dots per inch (dpi) using an Epson
Expression XL scanner. Digitized images were then analyzed using ImageJ
software. The number of square pixels was calculated for each distinct
lesion. The total disease area represented the area (m2) occupied by
granuloma and the percentage of lung surface affected by pneumonia. The
total disease area for the entire lung section was calculated by adding the
values for each lesion. The total percentage of diseased tissue was calcu-
lated by dividing the total disease area by the entire lung section and

multiplying by 100. One random left caudal lobe from ﬁve animals was
scanned per treatment group.
Statistical analysis. Standard one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Tukey’s multiple-comparison test of the means was used to
determine statistical signiﬁcance of immune responses and protective ef-
ﬁcacies of the indicated vaccines. A P value of 0.05 was considered
statistically signiﬁcant.
