Abstract
Background: Microorganisms capable of surviving within macrophages are rare, but represent very successful pathogens.
One of them is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) whose resistance to early mechanisms of macrophage killing and failure of
its phagosomes to fuse with lysosomes causes tuberculosis (TB) disease in humans. Thus, defining the mechanisms of
phagosome maturation arrest and identifying mycobacterial factors responsible for it are key to rational design of novel
drugs for the treatment of TB. Previous studies have shown that Mtb and the related vaccine strain, M. bovis bacille
Calmette-GueÂ´rin (BCG), disrupt the normal function of host Rab5 and Rab7, two small GTPases that are instrumental in the
control of phagosome fusion with early endosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes respectively.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we show that recombinant Mtb nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) exhibits
GTPase activating protein (GAP) activity towards Rab5 and Rab7. Then, using a model of latex bead phagosomes, we
demonstrated that Ndk inhibits phagosome maturation and fusion with lysosomes in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages.
Maturation arrest of phagosomes containing Ndk-beads was associated with the inactivation of both Rab5 and Rab7 as
evidenced by the lack of recruitment of their respective effectors EEA1 (early endosome antigen 1) and RILP (Rab7-
interacting lysosomal protein). Consistent with these findings, macrophage infection with an Ndk knocked-down BCG strain
resulted in increased fusion of its phagosome with lysosomes along with decreased survival of the mutant.
Conclusion: Our findings provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that mycobacterial Ndk is a putative virulence
factor that inhibits phagosome maturation and promotes survival of mycobacteria within the macrophage.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) is a devastating disease caused by Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis (Mtb), which claims about 2 million lives every
year [1]. Moreover, the emergence of drug resistant Mtb strains
and their spread to the general population now pose unprece-
dented difficulties to the control of TB disease [2]. Given the
persistent global burden of TB, it is crucial that research delineate
the underlying mechanisms of Mtb pathogenesis in order to pave
the road for developing better strategies to prevent and treat TB.
The ability of Mtb to persist and replicate within the host
macrophage is a central factor in the development of TB disease
[3]. Intracellular survival of Mtb is aided by a combination of
factors including a unique cell wall structure, which physically
shields the bacterium from bactericidal and hydrolytic enzymes
[4], and secretion of enzymes to combat host reactive oxygen and
nitrogen radicals [5,6]. Although all these factors contribute to Mtb
persistence within the macrophage, one recurring and highly
important feature of this pathogen is inhibition of normal
phagosome maturation process, thereby abrogating physical fusion
of phagosome with lysosomes and ultimately protecting the
bacterium from a bactericidal environment [7,8,9].
Phagosome biogenesis is characterized by a rapid and sequential
fusion of vacuoles containing ingested pathogens with various
endosomal compartments leading to acidification dependent on
recruitment
of
the
vacuolar
proton
ATPase
subunits
[8].
Thereafter, the acquisition of acidic lysosomal enzymes by the
phagosome and their activation results in efficient killing and
degradation of invading pathogens [10] from which the macro-
phage switch to the function of antigen presentation for proper
detection by effectors of the adaptive immune response [10,11].
Rab GTPases play a major role in the control of normal
phagosome biogenesis. Normally, phagosome biogenesis is initiat-
ed by fusion with endosomes coated with the small GTPase, Rab5.
This step is essential for recruitment of the early endosome antigen
1 (EEA1), which drives the phagosome towards further maturation
[12]. However, this early maturation event is disrupted by Mtb and
the closely related vaccine strain M. bovis BCG, both of which

exclude EEA1 from their phagosomes [13]. As the phagosome
matures into more advanced stages, another prominent member of
late phagosome markers, the GTPase Rab7 is recruited and serves
as a docking site for RILP (Rab7-interacting lysosomal protein).
RILP possesses two distinct domains: one that binds to the GTP-
bound form of Rab7 and another that recruits the dynein/
dynactin complex [14,15]. By simultaneously associating with both
targets, RILP promotes the interaction of vesicles bearing active
Rab7 with lysosomes [14]. Initially, one group demonstrated that
Mtb phagosomes retained Rab7 on the phagosome despite
arresting its maturation to phagolysosomes [16]. Our recent
studies have furthered advanced these findings and demonstrated
that
Rab7
molecules
on
the
membrane
of
mycobacterial
phagosome
are
inactivated
by
secreted
factor(s)
from
live
pathogenic mycobacteria [17]. Therefore, mycobacteria disrupt
phagolysosome fusion in a mechanism dependent on Rab7-RILP
interaction.
Rab cycling is a unique and essential characteristic of small
GTPases including Rab5 and Rab7. These proteins bind GDP/
GTP and to be functionally active, they must be in the GTP-
bound state. Our previous studies demonstrated that mycobacteria
interfere with this cycling through a GTPase activating protein
(GAP)-like activity, which depletes the c-phosphate from GTP-
bound Rab7 molecules [17].
The finding that live mycobacteria export a variety of proteins
and glycolipids intracellularly [18,19,20,21] and the demonstra-
tion that proteins with subunit size up to 70 kDa are able to cross
the phagosomal membrane towards the cytosol supported the
search for secreted mycobacterial products that might interact
with and inhibit critical regulators of phagosome biogenesis
[22,23]. In this context, our search for a secreted mycobacterial
factor that would interfere with Rab7 activation identified
nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) as a prominent candidate.
Ndk is a ubiquitous small protein (,15 kDa) found in virtually all
organisms, from eukaryotes to prokaryotes [24,25]. Initially,
mycobacterial Ndk was described as an intracellular nucleotide
pool balance mediator [25] because it has several enzymatic
properties such as autophosphorylation and GTPase activity, as
well as phosphotransfer activities [26,27]. More importantly Ndk is
now known to be secreted by mycobacteria, including Mtb and
BCG [28,29] and in vitro analyses have demonstrated that Mtb Ndk
possesses GAP activity towards Rho GTPases [26]. This raises the
question as to whether mycobacterial Ndk also alters the function
of
Rab
GTPases,
which
has
implications
for
phagosome
maturation arrest and survival within the host macrophage.
Here, we show that recombinant Mtb Ndk dephosphorylates
Rab7-GTP and also Rab5-GTP in a cell-free biochemical assay.
In contrast, recombinant Ndk from M. smegmatis, a non-pathogenic
mycobacteria,
had
little
or
no
effect
on
Rab
molecules.
Furthermore, we show that phagosomes containing latex beads
coated with Mtb Ndk resist fusion with lysosomes, consistent with
the finding that phagosomes containing a BCG strain with
knocked-down Ndk matures at higher rate leading ultimately to
increased intracellular killing.
Results
Ndk from Pathogenic Mycobacteria Deactivates Rab5
and Rab7 GTPases
Based upon a previously published work showing that secreted
Mtb Ndk manipulates the Rho GTPase regulatory cycle [26] and
our recent observation that pathogenic mycobacteria express GAP
activity towards Rab7 GTPase [17], we over-expressed and
purified recombinant Mtb Ndk to homogeneity and examined its
interaction with both Rab7, and the closely-related molecule,
Rab5. Recombinant Ndk from the non-pathogenic M. smegmatis
was also included in these experiments. We first examined Ndk
binding to Rab molecules. Recombinant Mtb or M. smegmatis Ndk
were coated onto flat bottom 96 well plates and exposed to
increasing concentrations of Rab5 or Rab7. As illustrated in
Figure 1, both M smegmatis and Mtb Ndk bind to Rab5 (Fig. 1A)
and Rab7 (Fig. 1B) in a dose-dependent manner. No difference in
binding characteristics was observed between M. smegmatis and Mtb
Ndk. In other experiments, soluble Rab7 and Rab5 were
incubated with Ndk then subjected to immunoprecipitation with
anti-Ndk antibodies and protein A agarose beads. SDS-PAGE and
western blotting analysis of pulled-down material with specific
antibodies showed that Ndk interacts effectively with both Rab5
and Rab7 GTPases (Fig. 1C and 1D), thus confirming the solid
phase binding assays. We next examined whether bound Ndk
expresses GAP activity towards Rab molecules. Rab5 and Rab7
proteins were preloaded with radioactive GTP as described in the
Material and Method section. GTP-bound Rab proteins were then
spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane squares and incubated in
presence and absence of Mtb or M. smegmatis Ndk and washed.
After exposure to X-ray films, membranes were probed with either
anti-Rab5 or anti-Rab7 antibodies. The blotting analysis con-
firmed equal loading of Rab5 and Rab7 proteins on membrane
squares (Fig. 1E and 1F, lower panels) and the radioactive signal
(Fig. 1E and 1F, top panels) clearly demonstrated that Mtb Ndk is
able to dephosphorylate the c-phosphate of bound GTP to Rab5
and Rab7. Quantification of the radioactivity showed 95% and
90% depletion of gamma phosphate from both Rab5 and Rab7,
respectively. In contrast, M. smegmatis Ndk dephosphorylated Rab5
only partially (35% reduction of GTP) (Fig. 1F) and had almost
no effect on Rab7 (Fig. 1E) despite efficient binding to both
GTPases (Fig. 1A and 1B). These findings demonstrated that Ndk
from pathogenic mycobacteria expresses strong GAP activity
towards Rab5 and Rab7 GTPases.
Ndk from Pathogenic Mycobacteria Inhibits
Phagolysosome Fusion
Rab5- and Rab7-regulated endosomal trafficking in macro-
phages is known to be dependent on GTP binding [30,31].
Therefore, the in vitro data showing that Rab5-GTP and Rab7-
GTP are potential substrates for Ndk GAP activity (Fig. 1)
suggested that Ndk might disrupt maturation of phagosome-
containing pathogenic mycobacteria. To verify this hypothesis, we
used the latex bead model for protein and glycolipid delivery into
phagosomes [13,23,32] and examined the effect of Ndk on
phagosome-lysosome fusion in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Thus,
4 mm latex beads were coated with Mtb or M. smegmatis Ndk or
BSA (control). The efficiency of coating was regularly examined by
SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, and FACS analyses of
beads labelled with specific antibodies (Data not shown). RAW
cells were first pulse-chased with FITC-labelled dextran (FITC-
DXT) and exposed to coated beads for 20 min at 4uC.
Synchronous uptake was induced by temperature shift to 37uC
and cells were incubated for 2 hr to allow for phagosome-lysosome
fusion to occur. Cells were then fixed and examined by digital
confocal microscopy. DXT is a non-biodegradable compound that
accumulates in the lysosome and is commonly used to directly
visualize fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes [33,34]. The results
illustrated in Fig. 2A and 2B show that most vacuoles containing
BSA-coated
beads
were
uniformly
surrounded
with
green-
fluorescent vesicles indicative of fusion with lysosomes. In contrast,
the images clearly demonstrated that phagosomes containing Mtb
Ndk-coated beads did not reach lysosomes. Consistent with these

findings, M. smegmatis Ndk, which has only minor effect on Rab
GTPases, did not oppose bead phagosome fusion with lysosomes.
To examine whether Ndk dissociates from beads and exit the
phagosomal membrane toward the cytosol to inhibit fusion with
lysosomes, we analyzed FITC-DXT-loaded macrophages co-
infected with red fluorescent (PKH-labelled) BSA-beads and
unlabelled Ndk-beads (or BSA beads, control). The expectation
was that protein released from Ndk-bead phagosomes would act

smegmatis Ndk or control BSA, and incubated for 1 h with increasing concentrations of Rab5 or Rab7, previously loaded with 1 mM GTP in reaction
buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM DTT, 5 mM EDTA and 1 mg/ml BSA) for 10 min at 37uC. Following 3 washes, attached Rab5 or
Rab7 was probed with primary rabbit anti-Rab5 or Rab7, followed by secondary anti-rabbit-HRP conjugate. Thereafter, the interaction was visualized
at absorbance 450 nm after addition of TMB substrate. Values from control BSA were subtracted. Results (mean 6 s.e.m) are from 3 independent
experiments. C and D. Recombinant Ndk (3 mg) and GTP-loaded Rab5 or Rab7 (3 mg) were incubated in PBS buffer for 1 h at 4uC. Thereafter, anti-
Ndk antibodies (1:100) were added (1 h at 4uC) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with protein A agarose beads for 30 min at room temperature.
Samples were washed three times then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and western blot with anti-Ndk and anti-Rab5 or anti-Rab7 followed subsequently by
monoclonal anti-rabbit IgG, native-peroxidase. Pulled down Rab7 and Rab5 are shown as the 25 kDa and 27 kDa protein bands respectively, while
the 15 kDa protein band correspond to Ndk. E and F. Recombinant Rab5 and Rab7 were loaded with [c-32P]-GTP and spotted onto nitrocellulose
membranes. After extensive washes, membranes were either left untreated or incubated with recombinant Mtb or M. smegmatis Ndk at room
temperature for 2 h. Membranes were washed, dried and exposed to X-ray film (upper panel). The radioactive signal observed depicts remaining
active GTP-Rab7 or -Rab5 on membranes and values are quantification of bound [c-32P]-GTP relative to control untreated samples as determined by
radioactive count in a liquid scintillation counter. After film development, membranes were probed with anti-Rab7 to ensure equal spotting of Rab7
protein (lower panel).

on distant vacuoles containing red-fluorescent BSA-beads. Indeed,
confocal images of cell co-infected with Ndk-beads and PKH-
beads, (Fig. 2C, lower panel) and their quantification (Fig. 2D)
showed that PKH-beads almost completely excluded FITC-DXT
vesicles from their phagosomes as result of block of fusion with
lysosomes. In contrast, an abundant green fluorescent signal
surrounded PKH-phagosomes in cells co-infected with control
beads coated with BSA (Fig. 2C, upper panel) indicative of fusion
with DXT-loaded lysosomes. The observation of Ndk-mediated
down-modulation of phagosome maturation cannot be attributed
to a global toxicity of the host cell maturation. Indeed, the
viability, morphology and adherence of RAW infected with

Ndk-beads over 24 h culture period were similar to that of the
control non-infected cells.
Collectively, these experiments suggest that secretory Ndk
released from pathogenic mycobacteria within the phagosome
might have access to the cytosolic face of the phagosomal
membrane to interact with and inhibit effectors of phagosome
maturation.
Mtb Ndk Inhibits Recruitment of Rab5 Effectors to
Phagosomes
Membrane
acquisition
of
EEA1
effector
is
an
essential
molecular event for phagosomal maturation [12]. Endosomal
recruitment of EEA1 occurs via binding to active (GTP bound)
Rab5 [30]. Given that pathogenic mycobacteria exclude EEA1
from their phagosomes [13] and that Mtb Ndk deactivates Rab5
(Fig. 1F) we examined whether Ndk interferes directly with the
process of phagosomal recruitment of EEA1. To do so, we
transiently
transfected
RAW
macrophages
with
a
chimera
consisting of GFP fused to EEA1 then subjected them to
phagocytosis of coated latex beads. Cells were examined by
confocal microscopy 20 min after bead attachment to the cell
membrane (Fig. 3A). In cells ingesting BSA-coated beads (control)
about 65% bead phagosomes were surrounded by abundant green
fluorescent signal reflecting normal recruitment of Rab5 effector
EEA1 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, macrophages infected with Ndk-
coated beads showed almost no recruitment of EEA1 to the
phagosomes. EEA1 is recruited to endosomal membranes via
binding of its FYVE domain to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate
(PI3P), which results from phospahtidylinositol (PI) phosphoryla-
tion by the class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase enzyme hVPS34

[35]. Therefore we examined whether inhibition of EEA1
recruitment in the presence of Ndk is related to reduced PI3P
formation on phagosomal membrane. RAW macrophages were
transfected with a 2xFYVE-GFP construct, which is commonly
used as a fluorescent probe for in situ detection of PI3P on
endosomal membranes [35,36]. Cells were then allowed to ingest
coated latex beads and were examined by confocal microscopy.
The images obtained (Fig. 3C) showed abundant recruitment of
the FYVE domain to about 55% of phagosomes containing BSA-
coated beads (Fig. 3D), reflecting a membrane enrichment in
PI3P product, while most (95%) of Ndk-bead phagosomes
excluded the fluorescent probe most likely due to a failure of
PI phosphorylation by hVPS34. Given that hVPS34 binds
to and is seemingly activated by GTP-bound (active) Rab5
[36,37], our findings strongly suggest that Mtb Ndk interrupts
hVPS34 recruitment to the phagosomes via dephosphorylation
of Rab5-GTP.
Mtb Ndk Inhibits Recruitment of RILP to Late
Phagosomes
Fusion of late phagosomes with lysosomes is dependent upon
interaction of Rab7 molecules with effector molecules RILP [14].
We have recently demonstrated that macrophage infection with live
BCG inhibited RILP recruitment despite acquisition of detectable
amount of Rab7 on the phagosome. Given that phagosomal
recruitment of RILP occurs via binding to active (GTP bound)
Rab7 [38,39] and the observation made here that Ndk catalyzes the
GTP/GDP switch on recombinant Rab7 molecules (Fig. 1), it is
likely that abortion of Rab7-RILP interaction in infected macro-
phages results from the export of Ndk by mycobacterium within the
phagosome. To verify this prediction, we double transfected RAW
macrophages with Rab7-GFP and RILP-DsRed and generated
phagosomes with BSA- or Ndk-coated beads. The results obtained
from confocal analyses (Fig. 4A) and their quantification (Fig. 4B)
showed a strong colocalization of red and green signals on a large

Methods. Thereafter, cells were allowed to ingest either control BSA- or Ndk-coated latex beads. The yellow signal seen (upper panel) shows
colocalization of Rab7 and RILP on the phagosome. The green signal (lower panel) shows phagosomes positive for Rab7 but no recruitment of RILP.

number (75%) of phagosomes containing BSA-beads, indicating
normal recruitment of Rab7 and its effector molecule RILP. In
contrast, most Ndk-bead-containing phagosomes (.80%) excluded
RILP from their membranes despite a substantial acquisition of
Rab7 molecules (Fig. 4A). These findings established a correlation
between phagolysosome fusion arrest observed above (Fig. 2A and
2C) and Ndk-dependent disruption of Rab7-RILP interaction.
Antisense Inhibition of Ndk Expression Attenuates
Survival of BCG in Macrophages
To assess directly the contribution of Ndk to mycobacterial
virulence in the context of phagosome maturation arrest, we
created a BCG strain with knocked-down expression of Ndk and
examined its fate in RAW macrophages. Thus, mycobacterial
shuttle vector pMV261 was engineered to express the Ndk gene in
sense (S-Ndk) and anti-sense (AS-Ndk) directions in BCG. This
resulted in a recombinant strain that expresses high level of Ndk
antisense mRNA leading to abolition of Ndk protein expression as
shown by western blot analysis (Fig. 5A). Additionally, compared
to its parental strain, the Ndk knocked-down BCG strain showed
no differences in its in vitro growth in culture media (Fig. 5B). To
examine the contribution of Ndk to mycobacterial survival within
the host, we infected RAW macrophages with wild-type BCG, or
BCG expressing sense or antisense Ndk. Cells were then lysed and
serial dilutions of recovered bacteria were plated on agar media
plates at 24 h and 48 h post infection. The CFU counts (Fig. 6A)
showed significantly decreased intracellular survival of BCG AS-
Ndk strain. Specifically, at the 48 h time point, we observed a 1.5
Log decrease of BCG AS-Ndk CFUs relative to CFUs obtained
from macrophages infected with wild-type and S-Ndk strains. Both
control strains showed comparable survival rates.
The reduction of BCG survival by inhibiting Ndk expression in
the macrophage further strengthens our findings that Ndk
functions within host cells to inhibit phagolysosome fusion.
Indeed, confocal analyses of macrophages loaded with FITC-
DXT and infected with BCG strains showed a substantial number
(,40%) of BCG AS-Ndk phagosomes that fuse with lysosomes,
whereas virtually no phagosome containing wild-type BCG
showed interaction with the lysosomal compartments (Fig. 6B
and 6C). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Ndk
contributes
significantly
to
successful
long-term
survival
of
pathogenic mycobacteria within the macrophage.
Discussion
Earlier observations that arrest of phagosome maturation occurs
only in macrophage ingesting live mycobacteria [40] suggested a
mechanism dependent on active secretion of virulence factors
capable of crossing the phagosomal membrane and deactivating
critical regulators of phagosome biogenesis. Ndk (,15 kDa) is one
of many secreted mycobacterial proteins [28,29] and the present
study examined its effects on the regulation of phagosome biogenesis
in the context of macrophage infection with mycobacteria.
Our hypothesis that Ndk acts as a potential inhibitor of
phagosome maturation was supported by i) our recent findings
that live mycobacteria express a GAP-like activity on Rab7 that
has been recruited to the phagosome [17] and ii) by concomitant
demonstration that mycobacterial Ndk acts as a GAP for Rho-
GTPases [26]. Furthermore, several pathogens were shown to
secrete proteins that act as GAP and facilitate their pathogenesis.
For instance, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoS cytotoxin disrupts the
actin cytoskeleton by acting as GAP for Rho-GTPases [41] and
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis cytotoxic factor, YopE, depolymerizes the
actin stress fiber through its GAP activity for Rho-GTPases [42].
Similarly Legionella pneumophila virulence factor LepB exhibits GAP
activity towards host cell Rab1 GTPase to disrupt proper
membrane cycling and activation [43].
The current study used purified recombinant Ndk adsorbed on
latex bead in order to mimic intraphagosomal expression of
proteins occurring during mycobacterial infection. In fact, a major
advance in phagosome biology was made possible by using the
latex bead system for analyses of many phagosome functions [44]
and the option of coating these beads has been successfully used
for examining modulation of phagosome biogenesis by several
bacterial products [45,46]. Thus, we have demonstrated that latex
bead-mediated intracellular delivery of Ndk blocks phagosome
fusion with FITC-DXT-loaded lysosomes as a result of exclusion
of the Rab7 downstream effector RILP from the phagosomal
membrane. These findings corroborate our observation of direct
binding of Ndk to Rab7 in vitro and the subsequent dephosphor-
ylation of the c-phosphate of Rab7-GTP leading to inactive GDP-
bound molecules.
The earlier observation that mycobacteria arrest phagosome
maturation despite the presence of constitutively active mutant
Rab7Q67L [16] suggested that Rab7 GTPase is not the only key
regulator of phagosome maturation. In fact, membrane recruitment
of another small GTPase, Rab5 was found to mediate EEA1-
dependent phagosome fusion with early endosomes [13]. EEA1 is
recruited to phagosomal membrane in the presence of the hVPS34
product PI3P and active Rab5 (GTP bound form) [30]. Binding of

the EEA1 FYVE domain to PI3P stabilizes the interaction between
Rab5 and EEA1 [47]. As EEA1 was shown to be excluded from Mtb
and BCG phagosomes by a mechanism dependent on mycobac-
terial lipid phosphatase SapM [22], we examined an alternate
mechanism mediated by mycobacterial GAP activity towards Rab5
GTPase. This hypothesis was confirmed by the demonstration of
direct binding of Ndk to Rab5-GTP and its dephosphorylation,
consistent with the observation of reduced recruitment of the Rab5
interacting effector EEA1 to phagosomes containing Ndk-coated
latex beads. Thus, while SapM decreases EEA1 recruitment
through hydrolysis of phagosomal PI3P [22], Ndk is acting through
Rab5-GTP deactivation and attenuation of its interaction with
hVPS34 leading ultimately to diminished phosphorylation of PI on
the phagosomal membrane. This conclusion is consistent with
previous findings that hVPS34 catalytic activity begins after binding
to GTP-bound Rab5 [37].
Figure 6. BCG-AS2Ndk has decreased intracellular survival due to increased phagolysosome fusion. A. RAW macrophages were
infected with BCG strains (MOI of 10:1). Then culture media was supplemented with 50 mg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular non-ingested
mycobacteria. Cells were washed three times in PBS and lysed in 0.025% SDS 1 h (0 h time point), 24 h, and 48 h post-infection. Serial dilutions of
recovered bacteria were then plated on solid 7H10 media supplemented with 10% OADC. CFU counts were performed after 3 weeks incubation at
37uC,. Bars, mean 6 s.e.m. (three independent experiments). B. RAW cells adherent to cover slips were loaded with 0.5 mg/ml Texas Red-Dextran
overnight and then infected with FITC-labelled BCG strains (wild-type: WT, expression of sense (S-), or antisense (AS-) Ndk) at an MOI of 20:1. At 4 h
post-phagocytosis, cells were fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde and mounted onto slides for confocal analysis. Bright field and merged fluorescent
images are shown with an outline of the cell boundaries. Green signal indicates BCG that are not colocalized with dextran, while yellow signal shows

Of particular note is the finding that recombinant Ndk from M.
smegmatis has a minor effect on Rab5 and no effect on Rab7
GTPase, consistent with its failure to block fusion of bead-
containing phagosomes with lysosomes. These observations are in
agreement with earlier reports showing that M. smegmatis fails to
block phagosome maturation and are unable to ensure successful
long term survival within the macrophage [21]. Comparison of
amino acid sequence (Fig. 7) showed high homology (,80%)
between
Mtb/BCG
and
M.
smegmatis
Ndks,
including
the
conservation of the key catalytic histidine 117 (H117). However,
the finding that mutation of the H117 residue does not affect GAP
activity, despite significantly reduced functions in autophosphor-
ylation, ATPase and GTPase activities [26,28] suggest a specific
domain âpresent in Mtb and BCG Ndks, but absent from that
of M. smegmatisâ involved in GAP catalytic activity, yet to be
identified. Based on the crystal structure of Mtb Ndk, there is a
distinct difference near the C-terminal region of the protein
compared to that of M. smegmatis [48]. In particular, alanine 136,
which is responsible for closing the polypeptide chain on itself with
a salt bridge to arginine 4, is substituted with gluatmic acid in M.
smegmatis Ndk. Furthermore, residues 95â99 show dissimilarities
between the two proteins, and this is of importance due to being
an integral part of the conserved âKpnâ loop. Both of these
differences suggest that the two Ndks differ in folding patterns,
subunit stability and quaternary structure in ways that might affect
functional activities of Ndk from M. smegmatis.
The ability to construct mutant strains of mycobacteria and test
individual gene products for specific functions has significantly
advanced discovery of virulence factors and our understanding of
TB pathogenesis. To demonstrate the relevance of Ndk-mediated
deactivation of Rab5 and Rab7 to the virulence of mycobacteria,
we knocked-down Ndk gene expression in BCG using established
antisense strategy [49,50]. We observed increased fusion of
phagosomes containing BCG AS-Ndk with lysosomes along with
a significant decrease in bacterial survival within the macrophage.
Thus Ndk appears to contribute to bacterial survival at early stages
of infection. It is likely that mycobacteria continue to export more
Ndk for alternate activities beyond the vicinity of the phagosome.
Indeed, Mtb Ndk was shown to localize into the nucleus of the host
cell and cause superoxide radical-mediated DNA cleavage [51].
Taken together, these findings suggest that Ndk contributes to the
survival of Mtb at least by two consecutive events: i) arrest of
phagosome maturation and subsequent establishment of the
infection and ii) interference with host gene expression via DNAse
activity.
Our finding that attenuated BCG AS-Ndk bacteria show
normal growth is highly relevant to development of live TB
vaccine. Thus far, two basic strategies are being employed in the
development of novel live mycobacterial vaccines. The first
strategy is to improve the immunogenicity of the existing BCG
vaccine [52,53] and the second is to use attenuated Mtb itself in
order to mimic natural infection [54,55]. Our demonstration of
decreased survival of BCG AS-Ndk and promotion of phagolyso-
some fusion provides a rational and straightforward basis for
extension to Mtb attenuation. By combining BCG AS-Ndk with
additional mutations that disable virulence-promoting functions
but preserve normal growth in culture media, it may be possible to
develop a new generation of safe and effective attenuated Mtb
vaccine strains that will have greater protective efficacy than BCG.
In summary, our findings suggest that mycobacterial Ndk
possesses GAP activity that is trafficking within the host cell
beyond phagosomes leading to inhibition of phagosome biogenesis
processes dependent on Rab5 and Rab7. In doing so, Ndk
contributes to intracellular survival and subsequent establishment
of mycobacterial infection.

protocol were approved by the Animal Care Office at the
University of British Columbia (Certificate number: A08-0873).
Bacteria
M. bovis BCG (Pasteur 1173P2) was grown in Middlebrook 7H9
broth (Difco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) OADC (oleic acid,
albumin and dextrose solution; Difco) and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 80
(Sigma-Aldrich) at 37uC on a rotating platform (50 rpm). For
macrophage infection, bacteria in mid-log phase were harvested
by 5 min centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. Bacteria were stained by
FITC (Sigma) at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml at 37uC for
1 h. They were subsequently washed three times with 7H9 plus
0.05% tween and passed through 25 gauge needles several times
prior to infection. Mycobacterial lysates were prepared by
resuspending cell pellets in 350 ml of 50 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA,
0.6% SDS, 0.05% NaN3, 1 mM PMSF. The cells were then
mixed with 100 mg of glass beads and shaked in a bead beater for
15 second
intervals
for
10
times.
Thereafter,
lysates
were
separated from insoluble fractions and cell debris by centrifugation
at 12,000 rpm at 4uC for 30 min.
Plasmid Constructs
Mtb Rv2445c (ndk) was amplified from genomic DNA using the
forward primer, TTG GGC CAT ATG ACC GAA CGG ACT
CTG, containing an NdeI site, and reverse primer CAC CCG
AAG CTT GGC GCC GGG AAA CCA, containing a HindIII
site. M. smegmatis ndk was amplified from its genomic DNA using
the forward primer TTG GGC CAT ATG ACT GAG CGG
ACC CTC and the reverse primer GAA TTG AAG CTT GGC
GGT GGC CTC GCC GGG, containing a NdeI site and HindIII
site, respectively. The amplified genes were inserted into pET22b
vector using the same restriction sites to generate a C-terminal his-
tag fusion protein. Human rilp gene was amplified from pGEX-
4T3-RILP [39], using the forward primer TTT CAT ATG GAG
CCC AGG AGG GCG GCG, containing a NdeI site, and the
reverse primer TTT AAG CTT GGC CTC TGG GGC GGC
TGA, containing a HindIII site. The amplified insert was cloned
into pET22b for His-tag expression. All plasmid constructs were
subsequently verified by sequencing (Macrogen Co, South Korea).
Plasmid vector expressing Rab7 and Rab5a in his-tag expression
vector pET16b were previously described [56,57]. Plasmids were
transformed into E. coli strain BL21 and grown to an OD600 of 0.8
at 37uC and expression was induced with 0.2 mM IPTG at 22uC
overnight. After centrifugation, bacteria were resuspended in PBS
containing 1 mM PMSF, 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min and
lysed by sonication. Bacterial lysates were clarified by high-speed
centrifugation and then purified on TALON polyhistidine-Tag
purification resin. Fusion proteins were eluted in 250 mM
immidazole. Rab7-GFP, Rab5-GFP plasmids were generated as
previously described [58,59]. RILP-DsRed plasmid was provided
by
Dr.
Brett
Finlay.
GFP-EEA1
and
GFP-2xFYVE
were
generated previously [60]. Ndk-DsRed plasmid was generated
by inserting PCR-amplified Ndk between the XhoI and HindIII
sites of pDsRed2-N1 (Clontech).
Coating of Latex Microspheres with Proteins
Latex beads were coated with proteins as described previously
[21,23]. In brief, 108 beads were washed twice with 25 mM MES
buffer (pH 5.8) and resuspended in 500 ml of the same buffer
containing 250 mg/ml of protein. After overnight incubation at
room temperature on a shaker, latex beads were washed 3 times
with PBS and resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 1% BSA.
Based on the difference between protein concentration of the
coating solution before and after incubation with beads, the
coating was estimated to be 0.2â0.3 pg protein per bead.
To generate red fluorescent beads, BSA-beads were labelled
with the PKH26 red Fluorescence linker kit (Sigma). In brief,
beads were incubated in 1:500 PKH dilution for 10 min at 37uC.
Beads were then washed three times and resuspended in PBS.
Cell Culture, Transfection and Infection
RAW 264.7 (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas,
VA) were maintained in 10 cm diameter culture dishes (Corning
Inc., Corning, NY) at a density of ,105 per cm2 in DMEM
containing 5% FCS and 1% each of L-glutamine, HEPES, non-
essential
amino
acids
(1006 solution,
StemCell).
Prior
to
transfection, RAW cells were washed extensively and harvested
by scraping. Approximately 56105 cells were allowed to adhere on
coverslips in 24-well plates. Cells were then transfected with the
GFP constructs described above using Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturerâs instructions. Twen-
ty-four hour post-transfection, cells were washed and infected with
latex beads or mycobacteria at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 2:1
or 20:1, respectively. Post-infection samples were washed exten-
sively and partially attached and non-ingested beads/bacteria are
removed by trypsin treatment followed by multiple washes.
Fluorescence Microscopy
Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides in FluorSaveTM
(Calbiochem-Novabiochem, La Jolla, CA) to minimize photo-
bleaching.
Slides
were
then
examined
by
digital
confocal
microscopy using an Axioplan II epifluorescence microscope (Carl
Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NY) equipped with 636/1.4 Plan-
Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss Inc). Images were recorded
using a CCD digital camera (Retiga EX, QImaging, Burnaby, BC,
Canada) coupled to the Northern Eclipse software (Empix
Imaging, Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada).
GAP (GTPase Activating Protein) Activity Assay
Rab5 or Rab7 (1 mg) were loaded with [c-32P]GTP by
incubation with 10 mCi of [c-32P]GTP in 100 ml of reaction
buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM DTT,
5 mM EDTA and 1 mg/ml BSA) for 10 min at 37uC. 10 mM
MgCl2 was then added (to terminate the reaction) and incubated
on ice for 10 min. Thereafter, 5 ml of each reaction mixture were
spotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. Unbound material was
removed with extensive washing with cold wash buffer (25 mM
HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT) and
membrane squares were then incubated in the presence or
absence of 10 mg/ml Mtb or M. smegmatis Ndk for 2 h at room
temperature. After 3 washes with cold wash buffer, membrane-
associated radioactivity was determined by autoradiography and
quantification was done by measuring membrane counts in a
scintillation counter.
Antisense Knock-Down
Mtb ndk gene was PCR amplified using the forward primer
CCG AAG CTT GTG ACC GAA CGG ACT CTG GTA, and
reverse primer CCG AAG CTT CTA GGC GCC GGG AAA
CCA GAG, both using the restriction site HindIII. The 411bp
insert was cloned into pMV261 cut at HindIII of the multicloning
site. Prior to ligation, the pMV261 was treated with CIAP to
remove the 59 phosphate and prevent self-ligation. Positive clones
were then digestion checked by PvuII. Clones with ndk inserted in
the sense orientation would give a fragment of 4800 bp and 60 bp,
while clones of ndk inserted in the anti-sense orientation would give

fragment sizes of 4400 bp and 360 bp. The plasmids were then
electroporated into competent BCG and plated on 7H10 media
supplemented with OADC and containing 25 mg/ml kanamycin.
