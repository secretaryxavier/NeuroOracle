Introduction
Since the ﬁrst reports in December 2019 in Wuhan,
China, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly developed into a pan-
demic
associated
with
substantial
morbidity
and
mortality.
Guillain–Barre
syndrome
(GBS)
is
an
acute
immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy that may
be triggered by various bacterial and viral infections.
Reports on possible neurological manifestations of
SARS-CoV-2 are still scarce. We report a case of
GBS after an infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Case presentation
A 50-year-old male with no relevant medical history
presented with 4 days of progressive bilateral facial
weakness, paresthesia of distal extremities and an
unsteady gait. Four weeks earlier he had experienced
an episode of dry cough lasting several days without
fever or other symptoms of infection.
Neurological examination showed facial diplegia,
normal eye movements, mild symmetric proximal
muscle weakness and impaired propriocepsis in the
legs. The patient had an ataxic gait and tendon
reﬂexes
were
absent.
Routine
blood
examination
showed no abnormalities. Routine analysis of cere-
brospinal ﬂuid showed a normal cell count and total
protein level. Polymerase chain reaction for SARS-
CoV-2 in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid was negative. Fecal
polymerase chain reaction and serum immunoglobulin
(Ig)M and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 were all positive.
Anti-GQ1b was negative. Serological tests for Borrelia
burgdorferi, syphilis, Campylobacter jejuni, cytomega-
lovirus,
hepatitis
E,
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae
and
Epstein–Barr virus were all negative. Magnetic reso-
nance
imaging
of
the
cerebrum
was
normal.
Electromyography showed a sensorimotor, predomi-
nantly demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.
Due to progression of limb weakness and inability
to walk, intravenous Ig (2 g/kg in 5 days) was initi-
ated on day 7 of hospitalization and recovery started
within days. On day 14 the patient was discharged
with a mild proximal weakness in the lower extremi-
ties and facial diplegia.
Discussion
We describe a case of GBS 4 weeks after a SARS-
CoV-2 infection. To our knowledge, this is one of
the ﬁrst cases of a GBS subtype after SARS-CoV-2
infection.
Guillain–Barre
syndrome
is
considered
a
post-
infectious disorder in which the infection may evoke
an immune response to peripheral nerve antigens, via
‘molecular mimicry’ and other mechanisms, resulting
in demyelination and/or axonal damage [1]. About
two-thirds of GBS cases report an antecedent infec-
tion, particularly gastrointestinal tract and respiratory
infections [1].
Previous studies report a peak in the incidence of
GBS during epidemics of Zika and inﬂuenza viruses
[2,3]. GBS has also been described after infection with
other
coronaviruses
[4].
Zhao
et al.[5]
recently
reported a patient with GBS developing symptoms of
SARS-CoV-2 7 days after onset of neurological symp-
toms. This sequence of events may argue against a
post-infectious pathogenesis, although the incubation
period of the infection in this case is unknown [5].
Other patients have been described who developed
GBS 3–10 days after the ﬁrst symptoms of SARS-
CoV-2 infection, like the current case, which is more
in line with the typical sequence of a post-infectious
immune-mediated disorder [6,7
].
Our patient reported an episode of dry cough 3–
4 weeks before admission, which is a classical presen-
tation of a mild SARS-CoV-2 infection. Positive IgM
and IgG serology for SARS-CoV-2 conﬁrmed the
diagnosis. The latency period of 3–4 weeks after

infection and negative SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain
reaction in cerebrospinal ﬂuid militates against a
direct infection of the nervous system and supports a
post-infectious immune-mediated pathogenesis [1,2].
It is remarkable that all published cases show diﬀer-
ent
clinical
features,
suggesting
a
heterogeneous
immunological response. Tested anti-ganglioside anti-
bodies were negative in the current and most previ-
ously reported cases, but these antibodies are usually
absent in GBS preceded by viral infections [1].
In the absence of the required studies to establish if
SARS-CoV-2 can trigger GBS, clinicians should be
aware that the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic may
lead to more cases of GBS. Diagnosis may be ham-
pered by the seemingly heterogeneous presentation.
Optimal treatment for these patients is yet to be deter-
mined, although our patient showed a rather fast and
good response after treatment with intravenous Ig.
