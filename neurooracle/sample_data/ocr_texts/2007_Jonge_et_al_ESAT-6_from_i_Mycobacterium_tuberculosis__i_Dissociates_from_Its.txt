The 6-kDa early secreted antigenic target ESAT-6 and the 10-kDa culture ﬁltrate protein CFP-10 of Mycobacte-
rium tuberculosis are secreted by the ESX-1 system into the host cell and thereby contribute to pathogenicity.
Although different studies performed at the organismal and cellular levels have helped to explain ESX-1-associated
phenomena, not much is known about how ESAT-6 and CFP-10 contribute to pathogenesis at the molecular level.
In this study we describe the interaction of both proteins with lipid bilayers, using biologically relevant liposomal
preparations containing dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC), dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol, and choles-
terol. Using ﬂoatation gradient centrifugation, we demonstrate that ESAT-6 showed strong association with lipo-
somes, and in particular with preparations containing DMPC and cholesterol, whereas the interaction of CFP-10
with membranes appeared to be weaker and less speciﬁc. Most importantly, binding to the biomembranes no longer
occurred when the proteins were present as a 1:1 ESAT-6  CFP-10 complex. However, lowering of the pH resulted
in dissociation of the protein complex and subsequent protein-liposome interaction. Finally, cryoelectron micros-
copy revealed that ESAT-6 destabilized and lysed liposomes, whereas CFP-10 did not. In conclusion, we propose that
one of the main features of ESAT-6 in the infection process of M. tuberculosis is the interaction with biomembranes
that occurs after dissociation from its putative chaperone CFP-10 under acidic conditions typically encountered in
the phagosome.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most successful human
pathogens, infecting nearly one-third of the world’s population.
Among the various factors that contribute, it is certainly the bac-
terium’s ability to multiply and persist within professional phago-
cytic cells that is of primary importance (30).
The extended RD1 region of M. tuberculosis encodes ESX-1,
a novel protein secretion system involved in the immunogenic-
ity and pathogenicity. The system, which is absent from the
attenuated vaccines Mycobacterium bovis BCG and Mycobac-
terium microti (4, 6, 24), is responsible for the export of the
6-kDa early secreted antigenic target ESAT-6 and the 10-kDa
culture ﬁltrate protein CFP-10. ESX-1 is present in the sapro-
phyte Mycobacterium smegmatis (9), where it acts in DNA
uptake (11), which suggests that pathogenic mycobacteria
might have adapted an ancestral conjugation system for pro-
tein secretion, which is required for survival and multiplication
in the host cell.
The importance of ESX-1 proteins for pathogenicity was
shown by reintroduction of the extended RD1 region into BCG
(34), deletion of RD1 from M. tuberculosis (23), signature-
tagged and insertional mutagenesis (8, 40, 46), and targeted
gene deletions (5, 15, 18). Several effects related to pathoge-
nicity have been found to be associated with the expression of
ESX-1 in M. tuberculosis and/or Mycobacterium marinum, a ﬁsh
pathogen that harbors an ESX-1 system similar to that of M.
tuberculosis (14, 27). These include suppression of proinﬂam-
matory responses (46), interaction with Toll-like receptor 2
(33) and/or syntenin (42), cytotoxicity and/or cytolysis (10, 12,
18), necrosis (19), phagosome maturation arrest (49), and
granuloma formation (52).
To further explore the involvement of ESAT-6 and CFP-10
in these processes, we have elaborated different approaches to
investigate the interaction of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 with bio-
membranes, which constitute important potential interaction
partners, once the bacterium is engulfed by professional
phagocytic cells.

BCG::RD1-2F9 Pasteur strains grown in Sauton’s medium. Culture ﬁltrates were
concentrated using Millipore ﬁlters with a 3-kDa cutoff.
Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) was transformed with expression vector
pMRLB7 or pMRLB46 for the expression of His-tagged ESAT-6 or CFP-10,
respectively. Cells were grown in 1 liter of LB medium supplemented with
ampicillin (100 g/ml) at 37°C. When the cultures reached an optical density at
600 nm of 0.6, isopropyl--D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to a ﬁnal
concentration of 1 mM. After 3 h of incubation at 37°C, cells were harvested by
centrifugation, and cell pellets were washed once with protein extraction buffer
containing 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer and 150 mM NaCl (pH 7) and
resuspended in 50 ml of protein extraction buffer supplemented with a cocktail
of protease inhibitors (Complete; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Ger-
many). The cells were lysed by sonication (Branson Soniﬁer 250). Lysates were
centrifuged at 11,500  g for 10 min at 4°C, and the pellets were resuspended in
1 ml of 8 M urea, 100 mM sodium phosphate, and 300 mM NaCl, pH 8. The
denatured lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 89,000  g; stepwise dialyzed
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 3 M, 1 M, and 0 M urea for
refolding; and loaded onto a 2-ml Ni2-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column
equilibrated with PBS. The proteins were eluted in PBS with 250 mM imidazole.
The puriﬁcation was monitored by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining (data not shown).
Puriﬁcation of nESAT-6. Sauton culture ﬁltrates were concentrated under 2
bars of nitrogen pressure using an ultraﬁltration membrane with a 3-kDa cutoff
and a diameter of 150 mm (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and then washed three
times with H2O containing 4% butanol (to reach a resistivity of lower than 30 S)
and lyophilized. The lyophilized samples were rehydrated with a buffer contain-
ing 100 mM NaCl and 50 mM Na2HPO4; the pH was adjusted to 7.1 with 1 M
KH2PO4. The samples were centrifuged for 1 h at 20,000  g and then passed
through a 0.22-m ﬁlter and applied to a Superdex G75 (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech) column after the addition of 4% butanol. The ESAT-6 containing
fractions were collected, pooled, washed, concentrated by ultraﬁltration as de-
scribed above, and applied to the strong basic ion exchange column R15 Q
(Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein was eluted in a 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH
8.1) buffer with a linear NaCl gradient (0 to 150 mM). The ESAT-6-containing
fractions were collected, pooled, desalted, and further puriﬁed by reversed-phase
high-pressure liquid chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in an am-
monium acetate buffer (20 mM). Protein was eluted from the column with a
linear acetonitrile (CH3CN) gradient (0 to 90%). The ESAT-6-containing frac-
tions were collected and pooled, and acetonitrile was evaporated using a Ro-
tavapor. The high-pressure liquid chromatography puriﬁcation was repeated
twice with C4 silica-based reversed-phase columns with two different acetonitrile
gradients (45 to 55% and 48.5 to 51%). The evaporated samples were analyzed
by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and mass spectroscopy (matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization and electrospray ionization) to conﬁrm the purity. All
puriﬁed nESAT-6 samples were lyophilized and stored at 20°C, as was also
done between the different puriﬁcation steps to maintain the stability of the
protein.
Preparation of liposomes. The standard preparations of liposomes used in this
study were made of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) (Rho¨ne-Poulenc
Rorer, Ko¨ln, Germany), dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) (a gift from
Lipoı¨d GmbH, Ludwigshafen, Germany), and cholesterol (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) in a 4:1:1 molar ratio. All lipids were dissolved in CHCl3-methanol (2:1,
vol/vol) and mixed in a round-bottom ﬂask. The solvent was evaporated using a
Rotavapor and subsequently ﬂushed with nitrogen for 30 min. The lipid ﬁlm was
hydrated in 50 mM Tris and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), by shaking with glass
beads and subsequently extruded four times through a 400-nm ﬁlter. The phos-
pholipid concentration of the liposomes was determined by the colorimetric
method of Rouser et al. (38). The mean particle size and size distribution were
determined by dynamic light scattering with a Malvern 4700 system (Malvern
Ltd., Malvern, United Kingdom).
Floatation gradient centrifugation. Puriﬁed proteins (5 g) or culture ﬁltrate
(100 g) was incubated for 10 min at 37°C in the absence or presence of 10 mM
liposomes in a ﬁnal volume of 100 l and subjected to ﬂoatation analysis using
a discontinuous sucrose density gradient as previously described by others (16).
After incubation, the samples were mixed with 80% sucrose in TBS. Onto this
suspension 2 ml of 60% sucrose, 1.5 ml of 50%, and 500 l of TBS without
sucrose were layered. The gradient was centrifuged at 115,000  g for 4 h at 4°C.
Fractions (1 ml) were taken from the top, trichloroacetic acid precipitated, and
analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15%)
and immunoblotting using monoclonal anti-ESAT-6 (AntibodyShop, Statens
Serum Institute, Denmark) or polyclonal anti-CFP-10 antibodies (34).
To investigate the inﬂuence of ESAT-6  CFP-10 complex formation on the
interaction with lipids, we incubated equimolar amounts (500 pmol) of rESAT-6
and CFP-10 for 10 min at room temperature as previously described by Renshaw
et al. (37). To test the inﬂuence of the pH on the dissociation of the ESAT-
6  CFP-10 complex and subsequent lipid association, the above-described ﬂoa-
tation gradient centrifugation was repeated using three different buffers: 50 mM
Na acetate and 150 mM NaCl (pH 4), 50 mM Na acetate and 150 mM NaCl (pH
5), and 50 mM NaH2PO4 and 150 mM NaCl (pH 6). The buffer of the concen-
trated culture ﬁltrates was changed using Microcon centrifugal ﬁlter devices with
a cutoff of 3 kDa (Millipore, Bedford, MA).
Surface plasmon resonance assays. The PentaHis monoclonal antibody (QIAGEN)
was covalently coupled to a CM5 sensor chip on a Biacore 2000 instrument at
25°C to a level of 10,000 resonance units. rCFP-10 (200 nM) was then captured
noncovalently to a level of 850 resonance units on the penta-His surface in 20
mM phosphate, 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA (pH 6.5), followed by nESAT-6
(1 M), and then 10 mM sodium acetate at different pHs (5.5, 5.0, 4.5, or 4.0) was
injected for 1 minute at 20 l  min1 during the dissociation phase. Control
experiments were performed on a CFP-10 surface devoid of ESAT-6.
Cryoelectron microscopy. Fifty microliters of DMPC-, DMPG-, and choles-
terol-containing liposomes (molar ratio, 4:1:1) was incubated with 500 pmol
rESAT-6, nESAT-6, or rCFP-10 protein (protein/phospholipid ratio of around
1:25,000) for 10 min at 37°C in TBS, pH 7.4. For cryoelectron microscopy, 4 l
of sample was applied to homemade holey carbon grids and vitriﬁed in liquid
ethane using a cryoﬁxation device obtained from F. Livolant and A. Leforestier.
The specimens were transferred to a Gatan 626 DH cryoholder and examined
with an FEG 2010F electron microscope (Jeol, Tokyo, Japan) operating at 200
kV. Images were recorded on Kodak SO163 ﬁlm or using a 1,024-by-1,024
charge-coupled device Gatan camera (Gatan 694 slow-scan charge-coupled de-
vice camera) at a nominal magniﬁcation of 25,000 with 2.0 m of underfocus
under low-dose conditions. The negative control (liposomes without protein) was
included in every experiment to exclude artifacts. Images were made from three
or four independent experiments per sample.
RESULTS
Interaction of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 with lipid bilayers. To
study the potential interaction of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 with
biomembranes, we incubated extruded liposomes with puriﬁed
ESAT-6 and CFP-10 proteins or with concentrated culture
ﬁltrate of BCG::RD1 and subjected these mixtures to ﬂoata-
tion gradient centrifugation. To reﬂect a biologically relevant
situation, the liposomes used in this assay contained phosphati-
dylcholine (PC), phoshphatidylglycerol (PG), and cholesterol
in a ratio of 4:1:1. Zwitterionic phosholipid PC is the main
component of biological membranes and, together with the
negatively charged phospholipid PG, belongs to the surfac-
tant lipids produced by alveolar type II cells (51), while
cholesterol is an important component of phagosomal mem-
branes (13, 22).
Floatation gradient centrifugation is a method in which the
protein-lipid interaction is measured by the presence of the
protein in the liposome-containing top fraction. As shown in
Fig. 1A and B, both puriﬁed recombinant proteins were found
in the upper fractions after incubation with liposomes, indicat-
ing interaction of ESAT-6 or CFP-10 with lipid bilayers. In
parallel, nESAT-6 from M. tuberculosis without a hexahistidine
tag showed a similar ﬂoatation pattern, indicating that the
interaction was independent of the tag (Fig. 1A).
In contrast, no coﬂoatation with liposomes of either ESAT-6
or CFP-10 was found when concentrated BCG::RD1 culture
ﬁltrate was tested (Fig. 1A and B). To further evaluate this
observation, equal amounts of puriﬁed ESAT-6 and CFP-10
proteins were incubated to allow the formation of a 1:1 protein
complex prior to the addition of liposomes, and this mixture
was subjected to ﬂoatation analysis. As depicted in Fig. 1C,
hardly any of the ESAT-6 or CFP-10 was detected in the top
fractions of this assay, conﬁrming that ESAT-6 and CFP-10 do

not associate with the lipid bilayer when they occur as a 1:1
complex.
Complex dissociation and subsequent lipid interaction in-
duced by pH shift. Previous structural analyses revealed that
the tight interaction between ESAT-6 and CFP-10 is stabilized
by two salt bridges (36). As pH changes are known to be key
factors inside the phagosome, we tested the protein-lipid in-
teraction at different pH levels. First, we repeated the ﬂoata-
tion experiments with concentrated culture ﬁltrates at pH 6,
pH 5, and pH 4 instead of pH 7.4. While ESAT-6 and CFP-10
were not found in the top fractions of the assay mixture when
the experiments were performed at pH 5 or pH 6, both pro-
teins were in the top fractions at pH 4 (Fig. 2). These results
suggest that between pH 5 and pH 4, which is close to the pI
of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 ( 4.5), the complex dissociates, al-
lowing the released monomeric ESAT-6 or CFP-10 molecules
to interact with the biomembranes.
Most interestingly, surface plasmon resonance assays using a
Biacore 2000 instrument further conﬁrmed that while the
ESAT-6  CFP-10 complex dissociated slowly at pH 6.5 (koff 
9  104 s1; half-life  13 min), 1-minute pulses of lower-pH
solutions induced a sudden disruption of an increasing propor-
tion of the complexes (30% at pH 5.5, 57% at pH 5.0, 84% at
pH 4.5, and 99% at pH 4.0) (Fig. 3), clearly indicating that the
ESAT-6  CFP-10 complex dissociates at acidic pH values that
are encountered in the phagosome.
Speciﬁc lipids or lipid complexes involved in ESAT-6 and
CFP-10 interaction. To determine the speciﬁcity of the pro-
tein-liposome interactions, we tested three different liposome
preparations derived from the standard preparation, DMPC-
DMPG-cholesterol (4:1:1). Each of the three preparations
combined two of the three lipids previously used in the stan-
dard preparation. The different combinations retained the mo-
lecular ratio used in the standard preparation: DMPC-DMPG
(4:1), DMPC-cholesterol (4:1), and DMPG-cholesterol (1:1).
Figure 4 shows that for binding of ESAT-6, the presence of PC
and cholesterol was important, while the interaction of CFP-10
with these liposomes appeared to be weaker and less speciﬁc.

Effect of the interactions of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 with lipo-
somal membranes. Cryoelectron microscopy is a very powerful
method to visualize potential changes in the shape of cellular
structures. Therefore, the liposomes were incubated with var-
ious ESAT-6 or CFP-10 protein preparations and subjected to
cryoelectron microscopy analysis. As shown in Fig. 5, the ad-
dition of small quantities of ESAT-6 to the liposomes (protein/
phosholipid ratio, 1:2.5  104) resulted in rigidiﬁed liposomal
membranes and fragments derived from disrupted liposomes.
At higher magniﬁcation, one can clearly see that the ﬁrst
changes in the lipid membrane, due to the addition of ESAT-6,
consist of nicks, which progress over time to cause lysis of the
liposomes. While these effects were observed for both the
rESAT-6 and the nESAT-6, such a phenomenon was never
observed when the liposomes were incubated with CFP-10.
Indeed, as shown in Fig. 5B, after incubation with CFP-10 the
liposomes remained completely round and intact, similar to
the controls without addition of protein. These observations
were highly reproducible and were independent of the individ-
ual ESAT-6 and CFP-10 preparations that were used.
DISCUSSION
Recent studies on ESAT-6 and ESX-1 have highlighted the
involvement of this novel secretion system in the pathogenesis
and immunogenicity of M. tuberculosis. One of the ultimate
aims now is to elucidate the actual role of ESAT-6 and CFP-10
in these processes. The two proteins have been shown to form
a 1:1 complex in vitro (37), and nuclear magnetic resonance
structure analysis of the complex revealed two similar helix-
turn-helix hairpin structures formed by the individual proteins,
which lie antiparallel to each other and form a four-helix bun-
dle (36). Overall, no clear structure-function relationship could
be deduced from this analysis; however, a few possibilities
could be excluded or classiﬁed as unlikely. No signiﬁcant cleft
or enzyme active site was identiﬁed, suggesting a noncatalytic
role for these proteins. Furthermore, interaction with nucleic
acids is unlikely due to the absence of basic patches, and the
electrostatic surface analysis argued against a pore-forming
role of the complex (36).
The high content of -helical structure and the hydrophobic
nature of both ESAT-6 and CFP-10 led us to look more closely
into a potential interaction of ESAT-6 and CFP-10 with lipid
bilayers, bearing in mind the principles of binding and spon-
taneous membrane insertion of -helical proteins or peptides
(20, 43).
Interestingly, ESAT-6 bound speciﬁcally to PC- and choles-
terol-containing liposomes, while less speciﬁcity was found for
CFP-10, indicating that the interaction with the lipid bilayers
might be different for the two proteins. This is in accordance
with the difference we observed in the effects on liposomes as
measured by cryoelectron microscopy and agrees with results
of Hsu et al., who found disruption of artiﬁcial lipid bilayers
with ESAT-6 but not with CFP-10 (18). Furthermore, Meher
et al. found an increase of the -helical content of ESAT-6 but
not of CFP-10 (29), suggesting that ESAT-6 is inserted into the
lipid bilayer, while CFP-10 might only remain loosely attached.
The two long helices in the ESAT-6 hairpin structure formed
by residues Phe8 to Trp43 and Glu49 to Ala79 are indeed twice
the length required to insert into a lipid bilayer. A number of
studies showed the importance of cholesterol in protein-lipid
interactions in bacterial infection processes (2, 13, 17). Al-
though our results suggest that both cholesterol and PC are
needed for membrane interaction of ESAT-6, under different
experimental conditions, the presence of PC alone has shown
some effect (18, 29).
We recently demonstrated by copuriﬁcation studies that
ESAT-6 and CFP-10 are present in the form of a complex in
the cytosol and the culture ﬁltrate of tubercle bacilli, before
and after secretion, respectively (3). However, it remains un-
clear what happens to secreted ESAT-6 and CFP-10 proteins
under natural circumstances when tubercle bacilli reside within
the phagosome of a macrophage, the key interface between M.
tuberculosis and its host. At ﬁrst glance, the observation that
ESAT-6 and CFP-10 individually interact with lipid bilayers
(Fig. 1) suggests that these proteins might act at the phagoso-
mal membrane. However, as clearly shown in Results, interac-
tion with liposomes was not observed when ESAT-6 and
CFP-10 formed a complex. These observations can be ex-
plained by the fact that hydrophobic residues in ESAT-6 and

ents; and processed for immunoblotting.

CFP-10 that are involved in lipid binding become hidden inside
the four-helical-bundle structure upon complex formation (3,
36). The results also agree with recent ﬁndings from Meher et
al., who measured conformational changes of ESAT-6 in the
presence of lipid vesicles and found that complex formation
interfered with potential lipid binding (29). The presence of
the complex might be important to keep ESAT-6 and CFP-10
water soluble under physiological conditions and to avoid as-
peciﬁc hydrophobic interactions with the cytoplasmic mem-
brane inside the bacterium. Another important aspect might
be the biochemical stability (29) and the resistance of the
complex against protease activity (26).
However, as demonstrated by two different methods (Fig. 2
and 3), we show here for the ﬁrst time that the ESAT-
6  CFP-10 complex dissociates at acidic pH, allowing ESAT-6
and CFP-10 to interact with phospholipid membranes, and it is
possible that the pH dependent effect is further enhanced by
posttranslational modiﬁcations (31). This behavior might have
important implications for the fate of M. tuberculosis in pro-
fessional phagocytes. While it is well established that M. tuber-
culosis can abolish or retard acidiﬁcation of the phagosome
(39), M. tuberculosis-infected cells also contain acidiﬁed phago-
somes or phagolysosomes under certain circumstances (21, 41,
47). This is in agreement with the observation that ESAT-6
shows superior T-cell activation compared to the ESAT-
6  CFP-10 complex (26). An attractive hypothesis in this re-
spect is that CFP-10 might function as a chaperone that is
uncoupled from ESAT-6 when the bacteria undergo acidic
stress. Further support for the role of CFP-10 as a potential
chaperone-like protein comes from Champion et al., who re-
ported that only CFP-10 and not ESAT-6 contains the C-
terminal signal sequence-like fragment that is needed for in-
teraction with membrane protein Rv3871 of the ESX-1
secretion machinery (7). This could mean that CFP-10 is in-
volved in the transport and protection of ESAT-6 until it
reaches the phagosomal compartment.
It should also be mentioned that M. marinum can escape
from phagosomes (44). This ability has been linked to the
activity of ESAT-6 (12). Although for tubercle bacilli the in-
fection mechanisms might be quite different, our data com-
bined with data for M. marinum suggest that ESAT-6 from M.
tuberculosis might exhibit similar properties. Several lines of
evidence support this hypothesis. We have previously shown
that certain single point mutations in ESAT-6 cause attenua-
tion of M. tuberculosis, emphasizing that ESAT-6 is one of the
key players in this phenomenon (3). Guinn and colleagues
have reported that ESAT-6 deletion mutants of M. tuberculosis
could multiply within macrophage-like cells lines but were un-
able to spread to uninfected macrophages (15). Hsu and col-
leagues described that ESAT-6 deleted mutants show reduced

tissue invasiveness due to lacking cytolytic activity (18), and
very recently it was suggested that ESAT-6 induces apoptosis
linked to a potential pore-forming activity of ESAT-6. This
subject also relates to a controversial study that reported that
M. tuberculosis H37Rv and H37Ra can escape from fused ves-
icles into the cytosol of the macrophage as the infection
progresses, whereas ESAT-6-lacking BCG did not (28). More
recently, a similar effect was observed when responses to major
histocompatibility complex molecules were investigated. M. tu-
berculosis, in contrast to BCG or an M. tuberculosis ESX-1
transposon mutant, was translocated from the phagosomes to
the cytosol in human dendritic cells and macrophages at later
time points of the infection (50a).
Altogether, these ﬁndings suggest that the ESX-1 system,
which is essential for the in vivo growth of M. tuberculosis,
might provide the bacterium with the tools necessary for even-
tually escaping from the phagosomal compartment of profes-
sional phagocytic cells. The ensuing access to the cytosol would
then also explain the strikingly higher recruitment and activa-
tion of CD8 T cells found in the lungs of mice that were
aerosol infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv or BCG::RD1
compared to uninfected or BCG-challenged mice (25). Indeed,
there is more and more evidence from immunologic studies
that ESX-1 proteins gain access to the cytosol of the host cell
(45). Such an effect could have important consequences for the
design of novel antituberculosis vaccines that show increased
CD8-mediated responses (35).
Finally, it should be mentioned that ESAT-6 and CFP-10
belong to the family of WXG100 proteins (32), which are
widely distributed among actinobacteria and gram-positive
bacteria (32). In M. tuberculosis some of them are encoded in
ESX loci that show similarity in gene content and operon
structure to ESX-1 (14, 50). In contrast to ESAT-6 and CFP-
10, these other Esx protein couples (e.g., Rv0287/88) do not
show the coiled-coil motif characteristic of ESAT-6 and
CFP-10 (3), nor do they contain the salt bridges that stabilize
the ESAT-6  CFP-10 complex (36). Thus, it remains to be
determined whether they form four-helical-bundle structures.
However, in a recent study, it was shown that ESX-5 was
involved in the secretion of protein PPE41 (1), which is orga-
nized with its binding partner in a four-helical bundle (48).
Hence, altogether, the pH-dependent interaction of ESAT-6
with biomembranes presented here not only helps to elucidate
the role of this protein in the infection process of M. tubercu-
losis but also opens new perspectives for the study of ESX
systems in a much wider range.
