Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) induces necrosis of infected cells to evade immune responses. 
Recently, we found that Mtb utilizes the protein CpnT to kill human macrophages by secreting its 
C-terminal domain, named tuberculosis necrotizing toxin (TNT) that induces necrosis by an 
unknown mechanism. Here we show that TNT gains access to the cytosol of Mtb-infected 
macrophages, where it hydrolyzes the essential co-enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
(NAD+). Expression or injection of a non-catalytic TNT mutant showed no cytotoxicity in 
macrophages or zebrafish zygotes, respectively, demonstrating that the NAD+-glycohydrolase 
activity is required for TNT-induced cell death. To prevent self-poisoning, Mtb produces an 
immunity factor for TNT (IFT) that binds TNT and inhibits its activity. The crystal structure of the 
TNT-IFT complex revealed a novel NAD+-glycohydrolase fold of TNT, which constitutes the 
founding member of a toxin family wide-spread in pathogenic microorganisms.
INTRODUCTION
Tuberculosis is a highly infectious disease and a global health threat. Survival within 
macrophages is a key feature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenesis and is 
crucial to a persistent infection in the human host1. The battle between Mtb and the human 
immune system to control the fate of infected macrophages is critical in determining the 
outcome of the infection2. The ability to control the timing and mode of host cell death plays 
a pivotal role in many microbial infections3. Virulent Mtb induces necrosis of infected cells 
and suppresses host cell apoptosis to evade immune responses and disseminate4,5. Killing of 
infected macrophages by necrosis is dependent on the ESX-1 secretion system and has been 
attributed to the membrane activity of ESAT-66. In contrast, apoptosis of infected 
macrophages is induced by the host immune system to control the bacterial infection.

Subsequently, apoptotic bodies containing Mtb are scavenged by other activated 
macrophages, or taken up by dendritic cells, to facilitate the priming of antigen-specific T 
cells to stimulate adaptive immunity4. Thus the fate of infected macrophages profoundly 
affects host resistance to Mtb2.
The molecular mechanisms by which Mtb induces macrophage necrosis are largely 
unknown7,8. Many bacterial pathogens utilize toxic proteins to kill host cells9. The lack of 
any protein in the Mtb genome with homologs of known bacterial toxins and the failure to 
isolate secreted proteins with strong toxicity against host cells led to the widespread belief 
that Mtb does not encode these classical virulence factors10-12. However, this paradigm was 
challenged by our discovery of the outer membrane protein CpnT as the main cytotoxicity 
factor of Mtb in macrophages13. CpnT is utilized by Mtb to secrete its toxic C-terminal 
domain (residues 651 – 846), which is sufficient to induce necrotic death in host cells by an 
unknown mechanism13. Hence, we named the secreted C-terminal domain of CpnT as TNT 
(tuberculosis necrotizing toxin).
In this study, we set out to identify the mechanism of TNT-induced necrotic cell death at the 
functional and structural level. We demonstrate that TNT possesses robust NAD+-
glycohydrolase activity, which depletes cellular NAD+ pools resulting in host cell death. 
TNT mutants with lower or abrogated NAD+-glycohydrolase activity, show reduced or no 
cytotoxicity, respectively, in macrophages and in zebrafish establishing a link between the 
enzymatic activity and toxicity of TNT. We further identify an endogenous Mtb protein 
which acts as an anti-toxin for TNT to prevent self-poisoning. The crystal structure of TNT 
in complex with its anti-toxin shows a novel NAD+ binding and hydrolysis module distinct 
from that of known NAD+-utilizing toxins.
RESULTS
TNT hydrolyzes NAD+
Recombinant expression of tnt (3′ end of rv3903c encoding the secreted C-terminal domain) 
is toxic in all tested prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, suggesting a common cellular target. 
Deep sequencing of E. coli RNA revealed that tnt expression induced nadA and nadB 
transcription by 16- and 44-fold, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 1a). These genes encode 
key enzymes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) biosynthesis suggesting a link 
between TNT and NAD+. Indeed, tnt expression completely depleted NAD+ in E. coli and 
Jurkat T-cells (Supplementary Fig. 1b), indicating an involvement of TNT in degradation of 
cellular NAD+. Purified recombinant TNT (Supplementary Fig. 2) hydrolyzed NAD+ in 
vitro and was inhibited by a TNT-specific antibody demonstrating that TNT degrades NAD+ 
(Fig. 1a). NAD+ is an essential coenzyme in many redox reactions as well as a substrate for 
NAD+-consuming enzymes14 that play important roles in transcriptional regulation and 
longevity15. Depletion of cytosolic NAD+ compromises ATP generation by glycolysis and 
leads to necrotic cell death16,17. Thus, NAD+ hydrolysis might explain TNT’s cytotoxicity.
All known NAD+-degrading enzymes release nicotinamide and a second reaction product 
that varies with the specific hydrolytic mechanism. NAD+-glycohydrolases and ADP-
ribosyl-cyclases produce ADP-ribose and cyclic ADP-ribose, respectively, while ADP-

ribosyltransferases attach ADP-ribose to a specific target protein. Thin layer 
chromatography revealed that TNT is a glycohydrolase that efficiently cleaves NAD+ into 
nicotinamide and ADP-ribose in vitro in the absence of any other protein (Supplementary 
Fig. 1c). A kinetic analysis of NAD+ hydrolysis by TNT (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) 
yielded a Michaelis constant Km of 614 ± 43 μM, near the physiological NAD+ 
concentration of ~500-600 μM in human cells18, a turnover number kcat of 52 s−1 and a 
catalytic efficiency kcat/Km of 8.4 × 104 M−1 s−1 (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 1). TNT has 
maximal activity at pH 6.5, but is only marginally active at pH 5.5 (Supplementary Fig. 3c) 
suggesting that TNT is not active in a mature phagolysosome19. TNT is also remarkably 
heat-stable retaining approximately 50% of its activity after prolonged heating at 95°C (Fig. 
1c). The pH dependency and heat stability of TNT match the uncharacterized NAD+-
glycohydrolase activity identified in Mtb cell extracts half a century ago20,21.
The Mtb protein Rv3902c binds to and inactivates TNT
The only other known bacterial NAD+-glycohydrolase is the secreted toxin SPN of 
Streptococcus pyogenes22. S. pyogenes protects itself against the toxicity of SPN by 
producing the immunity factor IFS which is encoded in the spn operon, and tightly binds to 
and inactivates SPN23. However, SPN and IFS have no sequence similarities to any Mtb 
protein. Since tnt expression is toxic in Mtb (not shown), we reasoned that rv3902c, the last 
gene in the cpnT operon, might encode an antitoxin to TNT. Indeed, equimolar amounts of 
purified recombinant Rv3902c protein completely inhibited TNT NAD+-glycohydrolase 
activity (Fig. 1a). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments using purified MBP-TNT 
and Rv3902c proteins (Fig. 2a) revealed that the two proteins form a stable complex with a 
dissociation constant KD of 2.3 × 10−10 M (Fig. 2b). Remarkably, an uncharacterized heat-
labile “inhibitor” of the Mtb NAD+-glycohydrolase activity was also described in the 
1960’s24,25. In agreement with this report, folding studies revealed that a complex of 
Rv3902c with TNT denatured irreversibly with an apparent melting temperature of ~ 65.4 
°C, leading to dramatic conformational changes of the TNT-IFT complex and liberating 
TNT (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Taken together, these experiments demonstrate 
that Rv3902c inhibits the NAD+-glycohydrolase activity of TNT by complex formation and 
constitutes the first inhibitor of a secreted toxin in Mtb. Hence, we named Rv3902c as 
Immunity Factor for TNT (IFT).
The atomic structure of the TNT-IFT complex
The discovery of IFT enabled us to purify milligram quantities of the TNT-IFT complex 
from E. coli after co-expression of the corresponding genes (Supplementary Fig. 2). We 
crystallized the TNT-IFT complex at physiological pH and determined its structure to a 
Rwork/Rfree of 12.8/14.3%, at 1.1 Å resolution (Table 1). The TNT-IFT complex adopts a 
blocky conformation of 50×50×35 Å3 that resembles a ‘ball-in-a-hand’ (Fig. 3a). IFT 
(‘ball’) fills a deep cavity in TNT (‘hand’) that buries ~20% of the complex solvent-
accessible area (~3,490 Å2). Consistent with the picomolar KD measured by SPR, the 
extensive binding interface between TNT and IFT involves approximately one third of the 
residues in each protein and results in over 50, mainly electrostatic, contacts. Strikingly, 
both TNT and IFT have minimal internal hydrophobic cores and as much as 97% of their

residues are exposed on the structure surface, resulting in huge predicted solvation energies 
(ΔGf = −157 and −163 kcal/mol for TNT and IFT, respectively).
The TNT structure consists of two regions: a ‘thumb’ (residues 648-736) and a ‘palm-
domain’ (residues 747-846) (Fig. 3b). Three-quarters of the residues in the thumb domain 
adopt a random coiled conformation interrupted by two shorts α-helices (α1, α2) and two 
antiparallel β-strands (β3, β4). The conformations of both main and side chains in the thumb 
domain between two crystal forms of the TNT-IFT complex (Table 1) revealed subtle 
structural differences between residues 669-679, possibly caused by the lack of crystal 
contacts in this region and underscoring the structural plasticity of this domain. The thumb 
wraps around the palm domain, which is formed by a six-stranded β-sheet surrounded by 
two short α-helices and two 3/10 helices. Four strands, arranged into two nearly orthogonal 
antiparallel β-hairpins (β12-β13 and β7-β11), are substantially longer and resemble the four 
fingers of a hand (Fig. 3b). IFT adopts a globular structure that consists of a β-rich domain 
containing two antiparallel β-sheets (β1–β5 and β7–β9) and a helical domain, exposed on the 
opposite surface, formed by 4 α-helices. Between the TNT palm and the thumb domain is a 
~15 Å deep crevice occupied by two IFT β-turns named TNT-interaction loops 1 and 2 (Fig. 
3c, 4a) that penetrate deeply inside the TNT core and make extensive electrostatic contacts. 
Although the structure of IFT in complex with TNT superimposes well to the structure of 
free IFT26 (rmsd ~0.52 Å), the side chain conformations in the TNT-interaction loops (N36, 
K37, E40, and D58, R59, M60, S61) projecting inside the TNT crevice are different (Fig. 
3c).
Identification of putative NAD+-binding site of TNT
TNT has no sequence similarity to any protein of known function13 and an exhaustive 
search for similar structures failed to yield significant hits. However, a restraint-based 
structural alignment of TNT with the SPN glycohydrolase domain27 and the 
ribosyltransferase domains of the diphtheria and cholera toxins28,29 revealed a similar basic 
architecture of the NAD+-binding core. Noticeable differences are that the TNT core 
contains only six β-strands as opposed to seven found in all known NAD+-utilizing toxins, 
and is significantly smaller, with only two short α-helices and two 3/10 helices. In silico 
docking readily placed NAD+ in the deep crevice of TNT (Supplementary Fig. 4a) with a 
predicted free-energy of binding of −8.7 kcal/mol. All solutions share a similar position of 
the nicotinamide group that inserts deeply inside the TNT crevice. Inspection of the amino 
acids surrounding the putative NAD+-binding pocket identified Q822, Y765 and R757 as 
residues possibly involved in NAD+-binding and hydrolysis (Supplementary Fig. 4b) based 
on similar positions of catalytic amino acids of ADP-ribosylating toxins30. Out of these 
residues, the glutamine 822 is highly conserved among TNT homologs. To determine the 
role of Q822 in NAD+ hydrolysis, we produced the TNTQ822A protein in E. coli in the 
presence of the anti-toxin IFT to prevent secondary mutations and separated the complex by 
selective thermal denaturation (as shown for wt TNT in Supplementary Fig. 2c). Purified 
TNTQ822A maintained structural integrity, as determined by IFT binding (Supplementary 
Fig. 5a), but its NAD+-glycohydrolase activity was reduced by two-fold compared to wild-
type TNT (Fig. 4c), suggesting that glutamine 822 is important, but not essential, for binding 
and/or hydrolysis of NAD+. Similarly, the TNTY765A mutant protein also had reduced

NAD+-glycohydrolase activity in vitro (Fig. 4c) and cytotoxicity in macrophages (Fig. 4d). 
By contrast, mutation of the corresponding glutamine 148 and tyrosine 65 residues in 
diphtheria toxin resulted in the drastic loss of its ADP-ribosyltransferase and NAD+-
glycohydrolase activities31,32, suggesting that TNT uses a different mechanism of NAD+ 
binding and possibly hydrolysis. The highly conserved G818 residue also lines the putative 
NAD+ binding pocket of TNT (Fig. 4b). However, the purified TNTG818V protein was 
unfolded as indicated by circular dichroism and lack of IFT binding (not shown) and hence 
did not hydrolyze NAD+ (Fig. 4c). Since several single mutants including TNTQ822A did not 
completely eliminate the NAD+-glycohydrolase activity of TNT, except for the unfolded 
TNTQ818V mutant (Fig. 4c), we exploited the inadvertent selection of an additional 
mutation, H792N, in E. coli carrying a tntQ822K expression vector in the absence of IFT. 
Indeed, the purified TNTH792N Q822K protein had no detectable NAD+-glycohydrolase 
activity in a sensitive assay with a detection limit of 0.1 μM NAD+ (Fig. 4c), but efficiently 
bound to IFT in pull-down experiments (Supplementary Fig. 5b) demonstrating that the loss 
of NAD+-glycohydrolase activity was not caused by impaired protein folding. Taken 
together, this mutational analysis identifies the putative NAD+ binding site of TNT, but also 
reveals substantial differences compared to SPN and ADP-ribosylating toxins30.
TNT-mediated NAD+ depletion causes macrophage cell death
To assess whether NAD+ depletion by TNT leads to cell death, RAW 264.7 macrophages 
were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing egfp fusions with wt tnt or mutant tnt 
genes. Thereafter, macrophage viability was assessed by 7AAD staining and flow 
cytometry. While wt TNT killed more than 50% of the transfected macrophages, the non-
catalytic TNTH792N Q822K mutant completely lost toxicity as did the unfolded TNT G818V 
mutant (Fig. 4d) indicating that macrophage cell death is indeed dependent on the NAD+-
glycohydrolase activity of TNT. The TNTQ822A mutant showed intermediate cytotoxicity 
(Fig. 4d), which is consistent with its partial enzymatic activity (Fig. 4c). Expression of all 
TNT mutants was much higher than wt TNT as shown by fluorescence of the GFP fusion 
proteins thus demonstrating that the lower toxicity was not due to lower expression levels.
To examine the role of the NAD+-glycohydrolase activity of TNT in the context of Mtb 
infection, we infected THP-1 macrophages with wt Mtb, the ΔcpnT mutant, and the ΔcpnT 
mutant complemented with cpnT encoding the wt TNT or the non-catalytic TNTH792N Q822K 
domain. Macrophages infected with wt Mtb showed a drastic decline in NAD+ levels 24 h 
post infection in contrast to macrophages infected with the Mtb ΔcpnT deletion mutant 
where NAD+ levels remained high (Fig. 4e). Importantly, the non-catalytic TNTH792N Q822K 
mutant was expressed to similar protein levels as wt TNT and showed a similar subcellular 
localization pattern (Fig. 5), but did not reduce NAD+ levels compared to that of the Mtb 
ΔcpnT deletion mutant (Fig. 4e). This result is consistent with the complete loss of NAD+-
glycohydrolase activity of the TNTH792N Q822K mutant (Fig. 4c) and demonstrates that 
NAD+-depletion in macrophages infected with Mtb mainly depends on the enzymatic 
activity of TNT. It should be noted that NAD+ levels are also reduced in Mtb-infected 
macrophages by 40% through TNT-independent mechanisms compared to uninfected 
macrophages (Fig. 4e).

To correlate the observed TNT-dependent NAD+ depletion during infection with the known 
cytotoxicity of Mtb7, we measured the viability of macrophages infected with Mtb strains 
secreting wt TNT or the catalytically inactive TNTH792N Q822K. Importantly, the 
cytotoxicity of Mtb secreting the non-catalytic TNTH792N Q822K was reduced to the same 
level as that of the Mtb cpnT deletion mutant (Fig. 4f). The interpretation of the infection 
experiments is complicated by the attenuation of the Mtb cpnT deletion mutant in 
macrophages13, because the reduced bacillary load may also reduce cytotoxicity by 
mechanisms other than NAD+ hydrolysis. However, the bacterial load of the Mtb strain 
expressing only the N-terminal domain of CpnT was increased by 12-fold, but showed the 
same cytotoxicity as the cpnT mutant indicating that the observed difference in cytotoxicity 
is likely not a consequence of fewer bacteria, but is dependent on TNT activity13. 
Furthermore, these results link NAD+ levels to cytotoxicity and are also consistent with our 
observations that no NAD+ is detectable in Jurkat T cells 24 hours after induction of tnt 
expression (Supplementary Fig. 1b) and that more than 90% of these cells died during this 
time13. Supplementation of this Jurkat T cell line with nicotinamide or nicotinic acid, both 
NAD+ precursors that elevate intracellular NAD+ levels (Supplementary Fig. 6a)18,33, 
reduced TNT-induced toxicity (Supplementary Fig. 6c). This effect is not due to inhibition 
of the enzymatic activity of TNT caused by addition of nicotinamide or nicotinic acid 
(Supplementary Fig. 6b). These NAD+ precursor supplementation experiments support the 
direct role of NAD+ hydrolysis in the toxicity of TNT. Taken together, these experiments 
provide compelling evidence that NAD+ hydrolysis by TNT is the main toxicity mechanism 
of Mtb in macrophages.
TNT gains access to the macrophage cytoplasm
Uptake of many bacterial toxins into target cells occurs by receptor-mediated 
endocytosis34-36. To examine putative cellular uptake pathways for TNT, purified TNT 
protein was added to THP-1 macrophages. However, extracellular TNT toxin did not induce 
macrophage cell death (Supplementary Fig. 7a) indicating that TNT lacks a membrane 
translocation domain. Hence, secreted TNT needs to exit the Mtb-containing phagosome in 
order to gain access to the NAD+ pools in the macrophage cytosol and induce necrotic cell 
death of infected macrophages as we proposed previously13. Furthermore, internalized latex 
beads coated with purified TNT protein did not cause macrophage death despite showing 
glycohydrolase activity in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c) suggesting that TNT itself is not 
capable of phagosomal exit. To examine the cellular localization of TNT, we selectively 
permeabilized the plasma- but not the phagosomal-membrane by digitonin to visualize 
proteins within the cytosol of macrophages infected with Mtb37. To validate this method, we 
stained Mtb-infected macrophages using an antibody against the antigen 85 complex 
(Ag85), a major secreted protein complex of Mtb38. Ag85 was only detected when 
macrophage membranes were solubilized by Triton X-100 but not in the presence of 
digitonin alone (Fig. 5), indicating that the phagosomal membrane is not permeabilized by 
digitonin. Then, we showed that TNT is secreted by Mtb into the cytosol of infected 
macrophages, while the bacteria are still confined to the phagosome (Fig. 5a, b). The 
fraction of macrophages with cytosolic localization of TNT 48 h after infection was ~ 50%, 
0%, and 10% for wt Mtb, Mtb ΔcpnT, and Mtb Δesx-1, respectively. Interestingly, TNT is 
not evenly distributed in the cytosol of macrophages, but rather shows punctate localization,

possibly from association with cellular vesicles and/or organelles. A similar phenotype was 
observed for the catalytically inactive TNTH792N Q822K mutant (Fig. 5a, b), indicating that 
the punctate distribution of TNT in macrophages is not associated with its enzymatic 
activity. Access to the macrophage cytosol, but not secretion of TNT by Mtb, completely 
depends on the ESX-1 secretion system (Fig. 5a, b) consistent with previous findings that 
the phagosomal membrane is perforated in an ESX-1 dependent manner39 and that the 
ESX-1 system is required for Mtb cytotoxicity7.
Direct injection of TNT protein kills zebrafish zygotes
Zebrafish zygotes are a well-established model to study higher order vertebrates. 
Fundamental cellular processes are highly conserved and the short, 24 hour, developmental 
period from a single-celled zygote to an embryo enables rapid phenotype detection40. 
Further, defined quantities of protein and protein complexes such as TNT-IFT can be easily 
injected directly into the cytoplasm eliminating potential confounding factors of transfection 
and infection experiments such as varying gene expression, potentially altered properties of 
GFP fusion proteins and the co-secretion of other proteins and/or lipids. To examine the 
toxicity of purified TNT protein in vivo, zebrafish zygotes were injected with buffer, BSA, 
wt TNT, catalytically inactive TNTH792N Q822K or wt TNT-IFT complex proteins at the 1-2 
cell state. While zygotes injected with buffer and BSA developed into morphologically 
normal larvae with a heartbeat 24 hours after injection, injection of wt TNT dramatically 
compromised embryonic development (Fig. 6). This result demonstrates that the TNT 
protein itself is toxic when directly introduced into the host cell cytosol. In contrast, 
injection of the non-catalytic TNTH792N Q822K mutant was not lethal to embryonic 
development demonstrating that NAD+ hydrolysis is required for TNT toxicity (Fig. 6 and 
Supplementary Table 2). The TNT-IFT complex was not toxic when injected into zebrafish 
zygotes (Supplementary Table 2) indicating that this protein complex is not dissociated 
under physiological conditions. Furthermore, TNT protein injected in the tail vein of 
zebrafish larvae 24 hours after fertilization was not toxic (not shown) in contrast to cholera 
toxin41 indicating that TNT lacks a cellular signal to access the host cell cytoplasm unlike 
the cholera toxin which contains a cell receptor-binding subunit42. Taken together, the 
results of the zebrafish protein injection experiments are consistent with the macrophage 
transfection (Fig. 4d) and infection experiments (Fig. 4e, f), and show that TNT toxicity in 
eukaryotic cells is completely dependent on its cytosolic localization and NAD+ 
glycohydrolase activity. These results are consistent with the lack of toxicity of TNT 
externally added to macrophages as well as the macrophage transfection and infection 
experiments.
DISCUSSION
The control of host cell death is of utmost importance for the survival, escape, and 
dissemination of M. tuberculosis. It has been clearly shown that Mtb induces a necrotic-like 
cell death7, but the components and molecular mechanism of this process were unclear43. 
Our recent discovery of TNT as a novel Mtb toxin led us to hypothesize that TNT is secreted 
by Mtb to induce cell death of infected macrophages13. In this study, we found that TNT (i) 
hydrolyzes the essential cellular co-factor NAD+ in vitro, (ii) translocates to the macrophage

cytosol in an ESX-1-dependent manner, while Mtb is still trapped in phagosomes, and (iii) 
kills macrophages infected with Mtb by depleting NAD+. Nonetheless, it remains unclear 
whether TNT-induced cell death results directly from metabolic collapse after NAD+ 
depletion or from other molecular events triggered by low NAD+ levels, or from a 
combination of different mechanisms. For example, low NAD+ levels have been shown to 
impair glycolysis, which prevents cells from rapidly generating ATP. Metabolic collapse 
leading to necrotic cell death can be prevented by NAD+ replenishment16,17,44,45 as also 
shown for TNT in this study (Supplementary Fig. 8). On the other hand, depletion of 
cytoplasmic NAD also deprives the cell from pyruvate blocking the tricarboxylic acid 
(TCA) cycle in mitochondria46. Mitochondrial dysfunction is known to increase production 
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to activate calcium-dependent proteases (calpains) 
that disrupt the cytoskeletal network47. Moreover, ROS and calpains permeabilize 
lysosomes and thereby release lipases which degrade phospholipids and disrupt 
mitochondrial and cellular membranes as observed during Mtb infection of macrophages7. 
Further, the observation that a TNT deletion mutant has a residual cytotoxicity of about 
20-30% compared to wt Mtb in macrophage infection experiments (Fig. 4f) indicates the 
involvement of other factors in Mtb-mediated cell death13. These factors may include the 
ESX-1 substrate ESAT-6, which damages lipid membranes6. In addition, Mtb activates the 
cytosolic “danger” sensor NLRP3 by Mtb in an ESAT-6 dependent manner that initiates 
inflammasome formation48 and impairs the membrane repair machinery by lipoxin A4, 
which down-regulates the pro-apoptotic and necrosis-protecting prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)4,5. 
Taken together, this study shows that Mtb-induced necrosis of infected macrophages is 
mainly dependent on NAD+ hydrolysis by TNT, although the exact sequence of downstream 
events that lead to cell death remain to be elucidated.
Since necrosis of infected cells promotes bacterial dissemination, the utilization of TNT’s 
NAD+-glycohydrolase activity is highly advantageous for Mtb compared to ADP-
ribosylating toxins of other bacterial pathogens that trigger apoptosis49-51. TNT may also 
enable Mtb to control the timing and mode of cell death in other cell types such as 
neutrophils and dendritic cells, which Mtb is known to invade52,53. However, the toxicity of 
TNT is also detrimental to Mtb13. To protect itself from from self-poisoning, Mtb produces 
the immunity factor IFT (Fig. 2). The atomic structure of the TNT-IFT complex presented in 
this study reveals a fully electrostatic binding interface, which ensures picomolar binding 
affinity between these two proteins and may enable disassembly of IFT in the phagosome at 
acidic pH. TNT has similar catalytic activity as the SPN glycohydrolase of group A 
streptococci54 and a similar protective mechanism23, although TNT and IFT lack 
identifiable sequence and structural similarities with proteins of known function. Although 
functionally equivalent, TNT and SPN differ in at least three ways. First, TNT is 
significantly smaller (~150 versus 450 residues) and represents one of the smallest NAD+-
binding domain identified to date. Second, TNT has ~160-fold slower catalytic turnover of 
NAD+, but similar substrate affinity (Supplementary Table 1), possibly resulting in slower 
toxicity kinetics in vivo. Finally, the secretion mechanisms of TNT and SPN differ greatly. 
While a signal peptide is sufficient to secrete SPN across the membrane of S. pyogenes, 
TNT constitutes the C-terminal domain of the outer membrane protein CpnT which 
resembles autotranporters of Gram-negative bacteria13. In the Pfam database, TNT is

annotated as a member of the Domain of Unknown Function 4237, which comprises over 
600 homologs encompassing approximately 300 bacterial and fungal species55. Thus, our 
results identify a class of novel toxins present in a large group of microorganisms including 
many mycobacteria, Listeria monocytogenes and Yersinia pestis, which are known to induce 
necrosis of infected host cells56,57. In conclusion, our study revealed the structure and 
enzymatic activity of TNT as an NAD+ glycohydrolase that affects host cell fate on multiple 
levels. These findings have broad implications in microbial pathogenesis.

Plasmid construction
Construction of plasmids are described in a flow-chart that includes the oligonucleotide 
pairs (Supplementary Table 4) used for PCR amplification and restriction enzymes utilized 
for cloning (Supplementary Fig. 8). All plasmids used are shown in Supplementary Table 5.
Purification of the TNT-IFT complex
E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring both plasmids pML1995 and pML1999 were grown in 2 
liters of the auto induction liquid medium ZYP-505259 supplemented with 100 μg/mL 
carbenicillin and 25 μg/mL chloramphenicol until the culture reached saturation (OD600 ~ 
10) for 3 hours. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (7,000 × g, 4°C, 20 min) and 
washed with a buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.6) and200 mM NaCl. The cell pellet (24 
g) was resuspended with 130 mL of the same buffer supplemented with 100 μg/mL 
lysozyme, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EDTA and 2.5 units benzonase per mL of suspension and 
was submitted to lysis using a French press (five cycles at 1,000, 5,000, 10,000 and 15,000 
psi each). The resulting lysate was cleared by centrifugation (60,000 × g, 4°C, 45 min). The

complex MBP-TNT-IFT was first purified using Ni-NTA affinity and then the elution was 
further purified using amylose resin, both according to manufactures’ protocols. The protein 
concentration of the fusion complex was determined with the Bradford assay and the 
corresponding amount of TEV protease NIa and 1 mM TCEP was added. The digestion was 
performed at 4°C and followed by SDS-PAGE analysis over a period of 96 h when > 90% 
of the fusion protein was cleaved. The resulting protein mixture was passed through a Talon-
Co column to retain MBP, the uncleaved fusion protein and the NIa protease, with the 
complex TNT-IFT being recovered in the flow-through. The fractions containing the toxin/
immunity factor complex were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration using an Amicon 
Ultracel unit (3 kDa cut-off) and submitted to size-exclusion chromatography using a 
Superdex sd75pg 16/60 column, bathed with 20 mM Tris pH7.6, 300 mM NaCl at a 1 
mL/min flow-rate and kept at 15°C. Absorbance at 280 nm was recorded on a paper chart 
and the chromatograms were digitized using a scanner then converted using the XYscan 
program (available at http://rhig.physics.yale.edu/~ullrich/xyscanDistributionPage/). The 
column was calibrated using albumin from bovine serum (66 kDa), carbonic anhydrase from 
bovine erythrocytes (29 kDa) and cytochrome C from horse heart (12.4 kDa). The fractions 
containing the complex TNT-IFT were pooled together and the concentration measured 
using Bradford assay.
Crystallization of the TNT-IFT complex and structure determination
Crystals of the TNT-IFT complex were obtained using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion 
method by mixing together 2 μl of TNT-IFT complex at 25 mg/ml with 2 μl of 0.2 M 
ammonium formate, 24% (w/v) PEG 3,350 at pH 6.2 and the resultant drop equilibrated 
against 600 μl of crystallization solution, at 18 °C. Diffraction quality, large rod-like crystals 
grew in 2-7 days to exceed ~1 mm in length. Crystals were harvested in nylon cryo-loops, 
cryo-protected by quick passage through a solution containing mother liquor solution 
supplemented with 27% ethylene glycol and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data 
were collected at beamlines X6A and X29 at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) 
on a ADSC Quantum Q270 and a Quantum-315r CCD detector, respectively. Data indexing, 
integration and scaling were carried out with the HKL2000 software package60 (Table 1). 
Initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement with Phaser61 using the deposited 
structure of Rv3902c (PDB entry 4O6G) as search model and diffraction intensities from 
Crystal form 2, that extends to 1.9 Å resolution (Table 1). An initial solution, which 
accounts for only ~40% of atoms in the asymmetric unit, was rebuilt automatically with 
Buccaneer62 and phenix.autobuild63 and manually with Coot64, and refined with 
phenix.refine63, yielding an initial complete model of the TNT-IFT complex. This model 
was then replaced in the high resolution crystal form I (Table 1) and refined to 1.10 Å 
resolution using phenix.refine63. The final model, which includes residues 1-175 of IFT, 
residues 648-846 of TNT, riding hydrogens and 798 water molecules, was refined to a 
Rwork/Rfree of 12.8/14.3%, at 1.10 Å resolution (the Rfree was calculated using 2,000 
randomly selected reflections). The final model has excellent geometry (r.m.s.d. bond = 
0.010 Å, r.m.s.d. angle = 0.14 °) and the Ramachandran plot shows over 95% of residues in 
the most favored regions with no disallowed residues, as assessed by MolProbity65 (Table 
1). The structure was analyzed using the PISA server66, PDBsum67 and all structural 
illustrations in the paper were done with Pymol.

Docking studies
Docking of NAD+ inside the refined structure of TNT (stripped of IFT) was performed 
using AutoDock Vina68. Atomic coordinates for NAD+ were downloaded from Coot64 and 
idealized using phenix.elbow69. Only polar hydrogens in TNT were used for docking 
simulation. To define an appropriate search space to dock NAD+ onto TNT, a generous grid 
box of 44 × 32 × 26 Å3 (along x, y and z) was generated around TNT crevice. 10 solutions 
were generated by Vina with calculated free binding energies (ΔGB) between −8.6 and −7.7 
kcal/mol (Supplementary Fig 6). All solutions share a similar position of the nicotinamide 
group that inserts deeply inside the TNT crevice placing the hydrolysable bond between 
nicotinamide and ribose in close proximity to Q822 and Y765. In contrast, the position of 
the NAD+ adenosine-dinucleotide group varies greatly among different solutions as a result 
of the greater degree of freedom of this group inside TNT. The phosphate at position β is 
always positioned close (~4 Å) to R757.
Purification of TNT for functional assays and SPR analysis
E. coli DH5αZ1 harboring the plasmid pML1993 (TNTwt) was grown in LB medium 
supplemented with 30 μg/mL kanamycin to an OD600 of 0.6. The culture was then induced 
with 200 ng/mL doxycycline for 1 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (7,000 × g, 4°C, 
20 min.) and washed with 20 mM Tris pH 7.6, 200 mM NaCl. The cell pellet was 
resuspended with 20 mL (per 500 mL of original culture) of the same buffer supplemented 
with 1 mg/mL lysozyme, 1 mM PMSF, and 2.5 units benzonase per mL of suspension and 
was submitted to lysis by sonication. The resulting lysate was cleared by centrifugation 
(10,000 × g, 4°C, 45 min). The cleared supernatant was used for purification by Ni-NTA 
resin (Pierce) following manufacturer’s protocol. Subsequently, the TNT containing elution 
was used for a second affinity chromatography step using Amylose resin (NEB) according 
to manufacturer’s protocol. The corresponding amount of TEV protease NIa and 1 mM 
TCEP was added to cleave MBP from TNT for 72 h at 4°C. The resulting protein mixture 
was passed through a Talon-Co column to retain MBP, the uncleaved fusion protein and the 
NIa protease, with the TNT being recovered in the flow-through. E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells 
harboring the plasmid pML3339 was used to express and purify TNTQ822K by auto 
induction as described for the TNT-IFT complex. To obtain enough fusion protein for SPR 
experiments, E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring the plasmid pML1997 was used to target 
expression of TNT into the periplasmic space. TNT was extracted by osmotic shock as 
previously described70, and purified by Ni-NTA resin followed by Amylose resin as above.
NAD+ glycohydrolase assays
Recombinant TNT (100 ng) was incubated with 1 μM β-NAD+ for 30 min at 37°C in 
reaction buffer (20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The amount of NAD+ remaining in 
each sample was then measured using the EnzyFluo NAD/NADH Assay Kit (Bioassay 
Systems) according to manufacturer’s protocol. The EnzyChrom NAD/NADH Assay Kit 
was used to measure the amount of NAD+ in E. coli or Jurkat T-cells. Protocols were carried 
out according to manufacturer’s directions with the minor modification of an additional 5 
min heat extraction at 90°C for E. coli samples.

TLC assays
NAD+ glycohydrolase assays were performed by incubating TNT (20 nM) with 1 mM 
NAD+ for 30 min at 37°C. 2 μL of this reaction were spotted onto silica-gel glass TLC 
plates (Sigma). The same amount of standard molecules NAD, ADP-R, and cADP-R were 
spotted. The TLC was developed in the ascending direction for 20 min at room temperature 
with a mixture of 30% water, 70% ethanol and 0.2 M ammonium bicarbonate. After drying, 
the TLC plates were sprayed uniformly with 10% cupric sulfate in 8% aqueous phosphoric 
acid, allowed to dry, and then placed into a 145 °C oven for 10 - 20 min.
Enzyme kinetics of TNT
Hydrolysis of β-NAD+ by TNT was monitored by detecting fluorescence as previously 
described71 with minor modifications. Briefly, initial rates of hydrolysis were measured by 
incubation of various concentrations of NAD+ (50 μM to 1.6 mM) with 10 nM TNT in assay 
buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4 and 200 mM NaCl) at 37°C. 100 μL aliquots of the reaction 
were taken out at various time points (1 – 10 min) and quenched by the addition of 70 μL of 
5 M NaOH in a 96 well plate. The plate was then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in 
the dark to develop the alkaline treatment generated fluorescence signal of NAD. 
Subsequently, the relative fluorescence at 360/460 nm (excitation/emission filter set) was 
determined on a BioTek Synergy HT plate reader and compared to a standard NAD+ 
concentration curve. The initial rate of NAD+ hydrolysis was determined by linear 
regression of plots of substrate depletion versus time. Thereafter, the rate was plotted as a 
function of NAD+ concentration and was fit using the Michaelis-Menten equation to 
determine the Km, Vmax, and Kcat for the enzyme. Non-linear regression analysis was 
performed with SigmaPlot 11.
Purification of IFT for surface plasmon resonance experiments
E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells harboring pML1974 were grown in liquid LB medium 
supplemented with 100 μg/mL carbenicillin to an OD600 of 0.8. The culture was then 
induced with 1 mM IPTG for 3 h at 37°C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 20 mM 
Tris pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl (5 mL/g cells) supplemented with 1 mg/mL lysozyme, 1 mM 
PMSF, and 2.5 units benzonase per mL of suspension. The lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 
× g, 4°C for 45 min to obtain the soluble fraction. Purification of polyhistidine tagged MBP-
IFT from this fraction was completed using Talon-Co affinity chromatography according to 
manufacturer’s protocol. The eluted fractions containing the MBP-IFT fusion protein were 
pooled and dialyzed against 20 mM Tris pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl to decrease the imidazole 
concentration prior to the addition of TEV protease NIa and 1 mM TCEP. The digestion was 
performed at 4°C over a period of 72 hours and was followed by SDS-PAGE analysis until 
> 90% of the fusion protein was cleaved. The resulting protein mixture was passed through 
Amylose resin to retain MBP and the uncleaved fusion protein, the IFT being recovered in 
the flow-through. IFT was further purified by anion exchange (Hi-Trap Q FF) in 20 mM 
Tris pH 8 using a 10 to 500 mM NaCl gradient.

Surface plasmon resonance binding assays and kinetic analysis
Binding interactions between TNT and IFT were examined using a Biacore T200 molecular 
interaction analysis system (GE Healthcare). HBS-EP (0.01 M HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 
mM EDTA, 0.005% polysorbate 20; pH 7.4) was used as the running buffer for the 
immobilization and kinetic studies. A Series S Sensor Chip NTA (Biacore) was used to 
immobilize polyhistidine tagged MBP-TNT (160 nM) onto its flow cell at a flow rate of 5 
μl/min for 120 s to reach a ligand density of approximately 500 RU. A control reference 
flow cell was used where the Ni-loading step onto the NTA chip was omitted prior to ligand 
capture, but otherwise contained all the same steps as the active flow cell. Different 
concentrations of the analyte IFT (0 – 62.5 nM) were diluted in running buffer and injection 
was carried out for 60 s at a flow rate of 20 μL/min to observe association, and then 
dissociation was followed for 10 min. A constant temperature of 25°C was used throughout 
the entire kinetic study. In order to minimize nonspecific binding and instrumental drift on 
the generated binding sensorgrams, a double referencing of the data was performed. The 
binding responses over the reference flow cell were subtracted from the active surface to 
correct for non-specific binding. Furthermore, an analyte run using running buffer alone was 
also subtracted from the binding sensorgrams to minimize noise. Biacore evaluation 
software was used to analyze the binding kinetics. A 1:1 binding model was used to fit the 
binding response curves over five analyte concentrations which resulted in residuals well 
within quality control standards as indicated by the chi-square value of 0.183.
In vitro pull down assay
Purified recombinant TNT (5μg) was incubated with equimolar amounts of MBP-IFT 
overnight at 4°C with 25 μL packed Amylose resin (NEB) in a final volume of 75 μL 
reaction buffer (20 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Equivalent amounts of TNT and 
MBP-IFT were incubated independently with Amylose resin as controls. Post incubation, 
the resin was washed thoroughly with reaction buffer. The washed resin was combined with 
an equivalent volume of protein loading buffer and heated at 95°C for 10 minutes to 
dissociate resin-bound protein. Captured proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE stained with 
Coomassie blue.
Cell culture, transfection and flow cytometry
Human THP-1 monocytic cell line (ATCC TIB-202) and mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage 
cell line (ATCC TIB-71) were propagated in RPMI-1640 or Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s 
medium (DMEM), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10 mM 
HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine (Thermo), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. 
Jurkat-derived cell lines58 were maintained in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with the 
same reagents. All cells were grown in a 37°C humidified incubator at 5% CO2. Cell lines 
were routinely tested negative for mycoplasma contamination every month. For 
transfections, 5 × 105 RAW macrophages were allowed to adhere onto glass coverslips in 
24-well plates overnight. Transfection was achieved using FuGENE HD (Promega). In brief, 
0.5 μg of purified plasmid DNA (pML3035, pML3036, and pML3059) were mixed with 1 
uL of FuGENE reagent in a final volume of 50 uL with DMEM. This mixture was incubated 
at room temperature for 15 min and then added to the macrophages contained in 450 uL of

media. Thirty hour post-transfection, cells were washed and detached by trypsin-EDTA. 
Cells were harvested by low-speed centrifugation and resuspended in PBS containing 1% 
FBS, and stained with 7-amino-actinomycin D (7AAD, eBioscience) according to the 
manufacturer’s recommendation. Analysis of cell viability was quantified by flow cytometry 
using the Guava easyCyte. Positively transfected cells were gated according to green 
fluorescence (FL-1; GFP), and the percentage of non-viable cells out of the transfected 
population was gated according to red fluorescence (FL-2; 7AAD).
NAD+ content in macrophages infected with Mtb
THP-1 monocytes were differentiated with 100 ng/mL PMA for 24 h, and subsequently 
infected with Mtb strains at a MOI of 20:1. 24 h post infection, macrophages were lysed in 
0.025% SDS to release all NAD+ from the macrophages, but not mycobacteria. The 
EnzyFluo NAD/NADH kit was then used to quantify the amount of NAD+ in each sample.
Intracellular staining
Mtb infected RAW 264.7 macrophages on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature and subsequently washed multiple times with 
PBS prior to staining. Cells were selectively permeabilized as described72. In brief, cells 
were permeabilized with 25 μg/mL digitonin in PBS alone for 5 min or in combination with 
0.2% Triton-X100 in PBS for an additional 5 min. Then, cells were washed and blocked 
with PBS containing 1% BSA (S-Buffer) for 20 min. Thereafter, polyclonal α-TNT 
antibody (1:75) or monoclonal α-Ag85 antibody (1:50) was used in S-Buffer and incubated 
with the cells for 60 min. After 3 washes with PBS, secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse 
Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen) was used at a dilution of 1:1000 and incubated with the cells 
for 30 min. Cells were then washed 3 times with PBS and coverslips were mounted onto 
microscope slides with FluorSave (Calbiochem) for fluorescence imaging. Imaging was 
performed using an Axiovert 200 microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with a 100x/1.4 Plan-
Apochromat (Carl Zeiss). Images were recorded using an AxioCam MRc camera (Zeiss) 
coupled to Axiovision v4.5 software (Carl Zeiss).
TNT toxicity in Jurkat cells and rescue by nicotinamide
Jurkat cells expressing tnt under an inducible system58 were pre-treated with either 5 mM 
nicotinamide, 10 μM nicotinic acid, or in combination for 2 h. At this point, expression of 
tnt was induced by addition of 100 ng/mL doxycycline for 2 h. Cells were subsequently 
washed free of doxycycline and incubated in regular media for 24 h. Cell viability was then 
assessed using the 7AAD dye followed by flow cytometry.

Figure 1. TNT is a novel β-NAD+-glycohydrolase of M. tuberculosis
(a) NAD+-glycohydrolase assay for wt TNT in the absence and presence of TNT antibody 
(400 ng) or IFT (100 ng).(b) The kinetics of NAD+ hydrolysis by TNT (10 nM) was 
determined using a fluorometric assay at pH 7.4. The values of Km and Vmax were 
determined by non-linear regression analysis using the Michaelis-Menten equation. (c) 
NAD+-glycohydrolase activity of TNT (10 nM) after heating to 65°C or 95°C for 5 minutes. 
The initial velocity v0 of NAD+ hydrolysis was determined at a substrate concentration of 
200 μM. All data in this figure represent the means ± s.e.m. of three independent 
experiments.

Å deep crevice involved in NAD+-binding. (b) Ribbon diagram of TNT showing residues 
lining the crevice and involved in NAD+-binding and/or hydrolysis. (c) in vitro NAD+-
glycohydrolase activity assay for wt and mutant TNT proteins. (d) Cytotoxicity of egfp 
fused wt and mutant TNT expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages were assessed by flow 
cytometry to measure of the percentage of 7AAD-positive cells. (e) The intracellular NAD+ 
content of Mtb-infected THP-1 macrophages was determined by an enzyme coupling assay 
in comparison to non-infected cells. (f) Cytotoxicity of Mtb-infected THP-1 macrophages 
(MOI 20) was determined by flow cytometry 48 h post infection after staining with the Live/
Dead fixable green cell stain. Data in (c-f) represent the means ± s.d. of three independent 
experiments.
