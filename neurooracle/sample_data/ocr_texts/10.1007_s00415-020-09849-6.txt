Dear Sirs,
The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic
originated in Wuhan (China) on December 2019. So far,
more than 1,500,000 cases have been confirmed world-
wide (> 150,000 cases in Italy) [1]. Severe acute respira-
tory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is
a systemic disorder typically presenting with fever, fatigue
and prevalent respiratory disturbances (dry cough, dyspnea,
chest pain, interstitial pneumonia) [2], although neurologi-
cal manifestations are increasingly reported [3].
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute/subacute
immune-mediated polyradiculoneuropathy characterized by
varying degrees of limbs or cranial-nerves weakness, loss of
deep tendon reflexes, sensory and dysautonomic symptoms
due to peripheral nerves and roots demyelination and/or
axonal damage [4]. According to a recent review about two-
third of all GBS are preceded by upper respiratory infection
or enteritis [4]. Here we describe a case of GBS following a
clinically resolved paucisymptomatic COVID-19.
A 70-year-old-woman was referred to our emergency
department (ED) on Mar-28 complaining of asthenia, hands
and feet paresthesia and gait difficulties progressing within
1 day. On Mar-4 she had developed fever (body tempera-
ture—BT = 38.5 °C) and dry cough. A day later she had
been tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-RNA on RT-PCR
with a nasopharyngeal swab. Symptoms of COVID-19 had

resolved in a few days. The epidemiological survey had
revealed a previous hospital visit to an inpatient in an area
with high incidence for COVID-19 (Piacenza, Italy) on Feb-
28, 29.
At the ED admission BT was 36.5 °C, oxygen saturation
was 98% on room air. Arterial blood gas analysis showed
pO,=76 mmHg with normal p/f ratio (= 363). Hemato-
logical investigations revealed slightly increased white
blood cells (10.41 x 10°/L, normal = 4-10 x 10°/L) with
8.15 10°/L neutrophils (normal = 2-8 x 10°/L) and lympho-
cytes in the normal range. D-dimer, creatine phosphokinase,
blood glucose, hepatic and renal function were normal, as
well as c-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate,
folate and vitamin B12 blood levels. A chest high-resolution
computed tomography revealed some small “ground glass”
areas in both lungs. A repeated nasopharyngeal swab for
SARS-CoV-2-RNA was negative. Mycoplasma Pneumo-
niae and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology (IgM and IgG),
Legionella Pneumophila and Streptococcus Pneumoniae
urinary tests were unrevealing. The neurological examina-
tion disclosed moderate (Medical Research Council grade
4/5) symmetric distal upper and lower limbs weakness, loss
of deep tendon reflexes, preserved light touch and pinprick
sensation. On Mar-31 a lumbar puncture was performed.
The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed slight albu-
mino-cytological dissociation (CSF proteins = 48 mg/dL,
normal = 0—40 mg/dL, white blood cells = 1 x 10°/L, nor-
mal =0-8 x 10°/L). Microbiologic testing on CSF was nega-
tive (including herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus,
Epstein-Bar virus, CMV, HIV-1, Borrelia Burgdorferi IgM
and IgG). Neurophysiologic findings were consistent with
a diagnosis of GBS (Table 1), according to current criteria
[S]. A trial with 400 mg/die intravenous immunoglobulin
(IVIg) for 5 days was started. On Apr-1 the patient was intu-
bated and mechanical ventilation was applied, because of
respiratory failure due to the worsening of muscle weakness.

To date, only a prior case of GBS concomitant with
SARS-CoV-2 infection and a parainfectious profile has been
reported [6]. In our patient, the temporal evolution of neu-
rological manifestations resembles that of a postinfectious
etiology, although a single repeated negative nasopharyn-
geal swab was available. Therefore, we may speculate an
association between the acute polyradiculopathy and SARS-
CoV-2 infection. This hypothesis is supported by the notion
of 24-days home isolation before the onset of neurologi-
cal symptoms and by the comprehensive exclusion of most
GBS symptoms ]

common infectious agents related to GBS (negative IgM/
IgG for CMV and Mycoplasma Pneumoniae, negative his-
tory for enteritis). However, we could not rule out with cer-
tainty a COVID-19 parainfectious neurological syndrome,
given the reported suboptimal sensitivity of the RT-PCR for
swab due to laboratory error or insufficient viral material in
the specimen [7]. Moreover, other less common infectious
agents (eg. West Nile and Toscana viruses), which were not
tested but are endemic in Northern Italy, might be respon-
sible for the present clinical picture [8]. A shortcoming of
our report is the lack of antiganglioside antibody testing to
identify specific targets of the autoimmune GBS process [9].
Furthermore, we did not perform a complete paraneoplastic/
autoimmune screening in the acute phase including testing
for serum onconeural and vasculitis-related antibodies (e.g.
antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies—ANCA). Hence, we
could not exclude the possibility of an autoimmune or para-
neoplastic polyradiculoneuropathy mimicking GBS [10].
Nevertheless, the postinfectious onset, the acute clinical
course and the typical neurophysiologic findings (polyra-
diculoneuropathy with predominant demyelination of both
motor and sensory fibers, sural sparing pattern), together
with the negative history for autoimmune, neoplastic or
neurologic antecedences, make these alternative diagnoses
less suitable. Another major limitation relies on the unavail-
ability of SARS-CoV-2 serology and CSF validated test (e.g.
PCR on CSF) in our center.
Taking together all these findings, the causal association
between GBS and COVID-19 remains speculative, but more
probable, given that GBS and Bickerstaff’s encephalitis have
been already described as postinfectious complications of
other coronavirus, sharing similarities with SARS-CoV-2
(Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV) [11]. If our
hypothesis will be confirmed in larger case series, neurolo-
gists and other clinicians should be aware of the important
early recognition and treatment of the potential neuromus-
cular and autonomic worsening leading to cardio-respiratory
failure in patients with GBS and mild or controlled pulmo-
nary COVID-19 Notwithstanding the causative relation-
ship remains unproved, we believe that our case description
provide further evidence to the heterogenous and multi-sys-
temic complications associated with SARS-CoV-2. Future
researches and data acquisition are needed to clarify the pos-
sible pathophysiological correlation, as well as to character-
ize the clinical/electrophysiological pattern of new cases of
GBS observed in the context of COVID-19 pandemic.
