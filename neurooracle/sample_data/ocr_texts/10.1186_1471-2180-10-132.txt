tuberculosis H37Rv

Abstract
Background: Membrane- and membrane-associated proteins are important for the pathogenicity of bacteria. We 
have analysed the content of these proteins in virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv using Triton X-114 detergent-
phase separation for extraction of lipophilic proteins, followed by their identification with high resolution mass 
spectrometry.
Results: In total, 1417 different proteins were identified. In silico analysis of the identified proteins revealed that 248 
proteins had at least one predicted trans-membrane region. Also, 64 of the identified proteins were predicted 
lipoproteins, and 54 proteins were predicted as outer membrane proteins. Three-hundred-and-ninety-five of the 
observed proteins, including 91 integral membrane proteins were described for the first time. Comparison of 
abundance levels of the identified proteins was performed using the exponentially modified protein abundance index 
(emPAI) which takes into account the number of the observable peptides to the number of experimentally observed 
peptide ions for a given protein. The outcome showed that among the membrane-and membrane-associated proteins 
several proteins are present with high relative abundance. Further, a close examination of the lipoprotein LpqG 
(Rv3623) which is only detected in the membrane fractions of M. tuberculosis but not in M. bovis, revealed that the 
homologous gene in M. bovis lack the signal peptide and lipobox motif, suggesting impaired export to the membrane.
Conclusions: Altogether, we have identified a substantial proportion of membrane- and membrane-associated 
proteins of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, compared the relative abundance of the identified proteins and also revealed subtle 
differences between the different members of the M. tuberculosis complex.
Background
Tuberculosis is an airborne infection caused by Mycobac-
terium tuberculosis. It is estimated that one-third of the
world's population is latently infected with M. tuberculo-
sis, and that each year about three million people die of
this disease. The emergence of drug-resistant stains is
further escalating the threat to public health (WHO,
2003). In spite of global research efforts, mechanisms
underlying pathogenesis, virulence and persistence of M.
tuberculosis infection remain poorly understood [1].
M. tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular pathogen
that resides within the host macrophages [2-4]. When M.
tuberculosis invades host cells, the interface between the
host and the pathogen includes membrane- and surface
proteins likely to be involved in intracellular multiplica-
tion and the bacterial response to host microbicidal pro-
cesses [4]. Recently, the cell wall of M. tuberculosis was
reported to posses a true outer membrane adding more
complexity with regard to bacterial-host interactions and
also important information relevant for susceptibility to
anti-mycobacterial therapies [5-7]. Revealing the compo-
sition of the membrane proteome will have an impact on
the design and interpretation of experiments aimed at
elucidating the translocation pathways for nutrients, lip-
ids, proteins, and anti-mycobacterial drugs across the cell
envelope. According to bioinformatic predictions, 597
genes (~15%) of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome [8,9],
could encode proteins having between 1 and 18 trans-
membrane α-helical domains (TMH), which interact with
the hydrophobic core of the lipid bilayer. The confirma-

tion of the expression of these genes at the protein level
may lead to new therapeutic targets, new vaccine candi-
dates and better serodiagnostic methods.
Membrane proteins resolve poorly in two-dimensional
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and pro-
teomic profiling of mycobacterial membrane proteins
remains a major challenge. Their limited solubility in
aqueous buffer systems and their relatively low abun-
dance in a background of highly abundant cytoplasmic
proteins have yet to be overcome. Several studies have
reported extraction of membrane- and membrane-asso-
ciated proteins using centrifugation to obtain purified cell
wall and cell membrane fractions for analysis by sodium-
dodecyl-sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) in combination with liquid chromatography
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) [10-13]. Com-
mon for these studies is pre-isolation of the membrane
and cell wall of the bacteria, and application of different
washing techniques prior to protein extraction by deter-
gents. In this study, we separated hydrophobic mem-
brane- and membrane-associated proteins directly from
sonicated M. tuberculosis H37Rv using phase separation
with Triton X-114. The efficacy of this method was
shown with Mycobacterium bovis BCG in a previous
work [14].
Comparison of expressed levels of the identified pro-
teins was performed using the emPAI [15,16] This
approach relates the number of experimentally observed
peptide ions in a given protein to the number of theoreti-
cally observable peptides. Our results show that among
the membrane-and membrane-associated proteins sev-
eral proteins are present in high relative abundance.
Using bioinformatic analysis, we also found that the gene
sequence encoding Rv3623 which is annotated as a
potential lipoprotein in both M. tuberculosis and M.
bovis, is shorter in M. bovis and have lost the N-terminal
signal peptide and lipobox that mediate the prelipopro-
tein translocation and its subsequent lipidation that
retains it to the membrane.
Results
Identification of Triton X-114 extracted proteins
The aim of this study was to enrich and perform a com-
prehensive proteomic analysis of membrane- and mem-
brane-associated proteins of the virulent reference strain
M. tuberculosis H37Rv. For this purpose, the hydrophobic
proteins were enriched by lysing whole bacilli followed by
phase separation with the Triton X-114 detergent. After
phase separation, the proteins in the lipid phase were pre-
cipitated by acetone and separated by SDS-PAGE. As
shown in Figure 1 panel A, the lipid phase was quite com-
plex, but appeared to be enriched for certain proteins as
compared to the unfractionated crude lysate. In a parallel
experiment, and to validate that the protein content in
the lipid and aqueous phases were different, proteins
from both phases were separated and transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes which were developed with
polyclonal antibodies against a cell wall fraction of M.
bovis BCG (Figure 1, panel B). Notably, Figure 1 not only
demonstrates that the protein content of the aqueous
phase and the lipid phase was different, but also clearly
shows that the lipid phase was indeed enriched for cell
wall proteins. In order to identify the proteins of the Tri-
ton X-114 detergent fraction, the protein mixture was
separated with SDS-PAGE (Figure 1A), run in duplicate
and cut into ten pieces each (twenty fractions in total)
and subjected to in-gel digestion by trypsin. The resulting
peptides were eluted and analysed by high accuracy mass
spectrometry. Additional file 1, Figure S1 illustrates the
sequence obtained for ion m/z 1210.62 which was identi-
fied by Mascot as peptide CGSPAWDLPTVFGPIA-
ITYNIK from protein Rv0932c with a Mascot score of 79.
Such fragmentation data contain a very good coverage of
the expected y- and b-series daughter ions plus the pres-
ence of other ions which indicates the correct MS/MS
assignment such as two highly abundant y-ions of proline
(y19++ and y14). This is very typical for peptides contain-
ing proline.
In total, 1417 proteins extracted with Triton X-114
were identified from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain out
of which 395 are described for the first time. The com-
plete lists of proteins with identified peptides are pro-
vided as additional data files (Additional file 2, Table S1
and Additional file 3, Table S2). Information about the
criteria for protein identifications, such as number of
peptides matching each protein, scores, identification
threshold and peak lists are given in Additional file 4,
Table S3. Identified proteins were categorized according
to functional classification (Table 1). An overview of the
number of observed proteins belonging to major groups
based on physicochemical properties is shown in Figure
2. These groups are described below:
Membrane proteins
According to TMHMM version 2.0, a bioinformatic algo-
rithm that predict transmembrane regions in the primary
amino acid sequences, 597 genes (~15%) of the M. tuber-
culosis H37Rv genome were found to possess between 1
and 18 TMHs. Each α-helix consists of 10 to 15 amino
acid residues which interact with the hydrophobic core of
the lipid bilayer. The proteins identified in this study were
analysed by the TMHMM algorithm and 248 were pre-
dicted to have 1 or more TMH regions (Figure 3), among
those, 90 represented novel identifications (Additional
file 2, Table S1). Proteins with one TMH were only con-
sidered as possible membrane proteins if the TMH region
was positioned beyond the first 70 N-terminal amino
acids. This was done to avoid confusion with potential
secreted proteins.

Lipoproteins
Lipoproteins represent a subgroup of exported proteins
characterized by the presence of a lipobox. The lipobox
motif is located in the distal C-terminal part of the N-ter-
minal signal peptide [17]. This motif is a recognition sig-
nal for lipid modification on the conserved and essential
cysteine residue. Precursor lipoproteins are mainly trans-
located in a Sec-dependent manner across the plasma
membrane and are subsequently modified [18]. The pro-
teins identified in this study were analysed by the lipoP
algorithm http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LipoP/, and 63
were predicted as potential lipoproteins (Additional file 2,
Table S1) based on the presence of a cleavable signal pep-
tide and a lipobox motif. Eight lipoproteins are described
for the first time. In sum the findings comprises over 56%
of all predicted lipoproteins in the genome.
Outer membrane proteins
Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are a class of proteins
residing in the outer membrane of bacterial cells. Identifi-
cation of OMPs is important as they are exposed on the
bacterial surface and so are accessible drug targets.
Recently, Song and colleagues analysed the genome of M.
tuberculosis and predicted 144 proteins as potential
OMPs based on the amphilicity of the β-strand regions,
absence of hydrophobic α-helices and the presence of a
signal peptide [19]. In our study, we observed 54 (37.5%)

of these proteins, and 9 of them have not been described
in previous proteomic works (Additional file 2, Table S1).
GRAVY
The 'grand mean of hydropathicity' (GRAVY) score is the
average hydropathy score for a protein. According to Kyte
and Doolittle, integral membrane proteins have a higher
GRAVY score than soluble proteins. A positive score >-
0.4 suggests increased probability for membrane associa-
tion; the higher the score, the greater the probability [20].
GRAVY scores were calculated for all the identified pro-
teins using the PROTPARAM tool http://us.expasy.org/
tools/protparam.html. Three-hundred and sixty nine
proteins without a TMH region had positive GRAVY
scores (Additional file 3, Table S2). A substantial propor-
tion of the detected proteins lacked a predicted retention
region and had a negative GRAVY score, suggesting that
they were soluble proteins. However, it is possible that at
least some of them might be functionally membrane-
associated through formation of protein complexes with
membrane-anchored proteins. In a previous study we
showed that several hydrophilic proteins are retained in
the lipophilic membrane fraction due to interaction with
hydrophobic proteins [21-23].
Relative abundance index
To estimate the relative abundance of the observed pro-
teins, we used the emPAI algorithm, which is based on
the calculation of identified peptides per protein and nor-
malized by the theoretical number of peptides for the
same protein (PAI). The outcome of the emPAI analysis is
given for a selection of membrane proteins and lipopro-
teins with the highest values in Table 2 and 3, respec-
tively. At the top of the membrane protein list is the
possible proline rich antigen pra (Rv1078), with 5.66 mol
%. This is a small protein with 25 kDa, and has 2 TMHs.
When digested with trypsin, it constitutes 6 observable
tryptic peptides, where 5 of them were identified. This
protein has also been observed in M. bovis [14,24]. The
membrane proteins Rv1078 and Rv1489 are the most
abundant ones, but with no annotated biological func-
tions. In the lipoprotein list only the first three proteins

biological functions.
Gene sequence analysis
An in-depth analysis of our data indicated that 2 proteins
were consistently identified in M. tuberculosis and not in
M. bovis and these were: possible glutamine-transport
transmembrane protein ATP binding cassette (ABC)
transporter (Rv0072) and possible conserved lipoprotein
LpqG (Rv3623). The DNA sequences encoding the two
proteins including 100 base pairs (bp) up-stream were
obtained from Tuberculist for M. tuberculosis and
BoviList for M. bovis and the sequences were aligned
using the Blast 2 algorithm. No differences were found for
Rv0072 which had 100% similarity between M. bovis and
M. tuberculosis. However, the conserved lipoprotein
LpqG (Rv3623) appeared to be 207 bp shorter in M. bovis
compared to M. tuberculosis with a difference in the N-
terminal end of the gene. Consequently, the protein prod-
uct was 69 amino acids shorter. When the primary
sequence of the protein product was analysed by the
LipoP algorithm, it appeared that the lipobox was missing
in M. bovis and the protein cannot be considered as a
lipoprotein (Figure 4).
Discussion
Due to the anticipated role of membrane- and mem-
brane-associated proteins of M. tuberculosis in virulence,
it is important to characterize these proteins. Therefore,
the aim of the present study was to perform a proteomic
analysis of these proteins from the virulent reference
strain M. tuberculosis H37Rv in extracts obtained with
the non-ionic detergent Triton X-114. The proteins from
the lipid phase of the detergent, which was enriched for
membrane proteins as validated by immuno-blotting
(Figure 1, panel B), were precipitated, separated, and
identified by high accuracy mass spectrometry. In total,
1417 proteins were identified and analysis of the primary
amino acid sequences by bioinformatic tools revealed
that 31% of the proteins were membrane- or membrane-
associated. The list included more than 50% of all pre-
dicted integral membrane proteins in the genome.
These results show a significant improvement com-
pared to the two studies of mycobacterial plasma mem-
brane proteins by Gu et. al. [25] and Xiong et al., [26]. In
these studies, membrane proteins were enriched by dif-
ferential centrifugation and alkaline treatment of crude
membranes with sodium carbonate and urea and sepa-
rated by SDS-PAGE followed by protein identification
with LC-MS/MS. The study by Gu et al. revealed 739 M.
tuberculosis H37Rv proteins including 85 membrane pro-
teins (11.5%), while Xiong et al. identified 349 proteins, of
which 100 were predicted membrane proteins (28.7%).
The low percentage of integral plasma membrane pro-
teins among the proteins identified in these studies was

probably based in the membrane enrichment methods.
We reduced the soluble protein contamination by phase
separation of whole bacterial sonicates, and also applied
state-of-the-art mass spectrometry analysis for identifica-
tion of peptides.
More than 50% of all predicted lipoproteins in the
genome were found. These are proteins translocated
across the cell membrane and retained in the cell enve-
lope by post-translational lipid modification. They are
functionally diverse, and are suggested to be involved in
host-pathogen interactions [27,28]. They are also of inter-
est with respect to development of serodiagnostic tests
for tuberculosis due to their strong immunogenicity
[29,30].
We also found 37% of all predicted OMPs [19], which is
an essential group of proteins involved in import of nutri-
ents, secretion processes and host-pathogen interactions
in gram-negative bacteria [31], and this is also likely to be
of great importance in mycobacteria because it is now
firmly established that they have a true outer membrane
[5-7].
Even though a considerable number of observed pro-
teins were predicted as integral membrane- or mem-
brane-associated proteins, a substantial proportion of the
detected proteins lacked a predicted retention region. For
those proteins we measured the GRAVY score which
express the total hydrophobicity of a protein as an indica-
tor for membrane association. However, this is just a
measure of increased probability for membrane associa-
tion based on the fact that most integral membrane pro-
teins have a positive GRAVY value. If a protein has a
positive value, even though it lacks a retention signal, it is
probably associated with the membrane. On the other
hand, some of the hydrophilic proteins with a negative

GRAVY value might still be retained in the membrane
through formation of protein complexes with membrane-
anchored proteins [21-23]. Several proteins in this group
are encoded in operons of well known integral enzyme
complexes [14].
Using state-of-the-art proteomic instrumentation and
techniques, subtle details could be revealed at the indi-
vidual protein level, such as experimental identification
of signal peptide cleavage sites of predicted secreted pro-
teins [32], or confirmation of the start codon, or identifi-
cation of peptides from regions predicted to be non-
coding thus indicating a more up-stream start codon
[33,34], or even detection of novel genes [35]. Therefore,
the data obtained in this study was examined both in
detail and in the context of what have been reported in
the literature. To examine the amounts of individual pro-
teins in the membrane fraction we applied the emPAI
algorithm. The emPAI calculation gives an approximate
estimate of the abundance of a certain protein, and it cal-
culates the protein concentration (in mol %) [15,16]. An
advantage of this method is that it gives a more realistic
picture of the protein profile compared to the mRNA lev-
els, which could be difficult to relate to the actual protein
amount. The membrane proteins (14 proteins) and the
lipoproteins (10 proteins), with the highest relative abun-
dance values are listed in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
Interestingly, two of the proteins (Rv0072 and Rv2563)
among those with the highest relative abundance values
were "possible glutamine-transport transmembrane ABC
transporter protein", with sequence motifs that belong to
the ABC transport system. Glutamine is a major cell wall
component of pathogenic mycobacteria only [36]. Its pro-
duction is mainly catalyzed extracellulary by glutamine
synthetase GlnA1 (Rv2220) [37]. Tullius et. al., 2003
showed that a M. tuberculosis glnA1 mutant requires a
relatively high level of exogenous L-glutamine for growth

in vitro, and the mutant was attenuated for intracellular
growth in differentiated THP-1 cells, and it was also avir-
ulent in infected guinea pigs [38]. Identification of two
related proteins among the most abundant membrane
proteins in M. tuberculosis, underlines the importance of
production and transport of glutamine for the pathogen
and its virulence.
The Rv0072 protein is only reported in studies con-
ducted on M. tuberculosis [25,26] and not on M. bovis
BCG (11, 17). It was identified by 11 different peptides
giving sequence coverage of 44%, and the high emPAI
value observed for this membrane protein suggests that it
is abundantly present in the membrane of the virulent M.
tuberculosis H37Rv strain. The open reading frames and
sequences 100 bp up-stream to the start codon from M.
tuberculosis H37Rv and M. bovis BCG 1173P2 and
AF2122/97 were aligned, but the DNA sequences were
identical and could not explain why Rv0072 has not been
observed in M. bovis (data not shown).
Among the 10 most abundant lipoproteins 7 were not
assigned any biological function, reflecting a fundamental
lack of knowledge about these proteins. A careful exami-
nation revealed that the possible conserved lipoprotein
LpqG (Rv3623) lies on the border of region of difference 9
(RD9) [39]. RD9 is deleted from all M. bovis lineages and
consequently this protein has only been identified in pro-
teomic studies performed on M. tuberculosis H37Rv
[25,40], but not been reported in previous proteomic
works on M. bovis BCG [14,24,41]. This RD region is also
missing in other mycobacterial strains such as Mycobac-
terium microti or Mycobacterium pinnipedii. This region
was first described by Gordon et. al., 1999 [42] as RD8
and later put in an evolutionary context by Brosch et. al.,
2002 [43], which now corresponds to the region RD09
described by Behr et. al., [39]. A close examination of the
gene encoding Rv3623 revealed that it is 207 bp shorter
with a deletion in the N-terminal region that includes the
signal peptide and the predicted lipo-box in the genomic
sequences of M. bovis AF2122/97 and M. bovis BCG Pas-
teur 1173P2. The gene is annotated to encode a lipopro-
tein in the M. bovis strains even though the lipo-box is
missing and it is therefore questionable whether it should
be considered as a lipoprotein in M. bovis. The identifica-
tion of this protein with 7 peptides covering 34% of its
sequence in M. tuberculosis H37Rv suggests that it is a
major lipoprotein.
The two lipoproteins listed in Table 3, annotated as
"periplasmic phosphate-binding lipoprotein" (Rv0932c) is
a known antigen [44] that also induces antibody
responses in tuberculosis patients [45]. The 19 kDa lipo-
protein antigen precursor (Rv3763) have been extensively
studied due to its immunogenic properties [46-49].
Enrichment and analysis of lipoproteins with respect to
humoral and cell-mediated immunity in infected individ-
uals might ultimately lead to the identification of addi-
tional antigens that can serve as biomarkers for M.
tuberculosis infection.
Conclusion
In summary, we have enriched and extracted membrane-
and membrane-associated proteins from M. tuberculosis
H37Rv using Triton X-114, and identified the largest
number of this subset of proteins reported so far. Further
analysis of the data obtained in this study with bioinfor-
matic tools suggests that several of these proteins are
major membrane proteins. We have described one major
lipoprotein of M. tuberculosis which has become a
pseudogene by the RD9 deletion in M. bovis.
Methods
Preparation of crude bacterial extracts
The mycobacterial reference strain M. tuberculosis
H37Rv (ATCC 27294), used in this study was kindly pro-
vided by Dr Harleen Grewal, The Gade Institute, Univer-
sity of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. The bacilli were cultured
on Middelbrook 7H10 agar plates with OADC enrich-
ment (BD Difco) at 37°C and 5% CO2 for 3-4 weeks. Bac-
terial colonies were harvested by using an extraction
buffer consisting of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH
7.4 with freshly added Roche Protease Inhibitor Cocktail
(Complete, EDTA-free, Roche Gmbh, Germany). Six
hundred μl of this extraction buffer was added to each
agar plate and the mycobacterial colonies were gently
scraped off the agar surface using a cell scraper. Aliquots
of the resulting pasty bacterial mass was transferred into
2 ml cryo-tubes with O-rings (Sarstedt, Norway) contain-
ing 250 μl of acid washed glass beads (≤ 106 μm; Sigma-
Aldrich, Norway) and an additional 600 μl of extraction
buffer, and stored at -80°C until protein extraction was
performed. For protein extraction, the mycobacteria were
disrupted mechanically by bead-beating in a Ribolyser
(Hybaid, UK) at max speed (6.5) for 45 seconds.
Triton X-114 extraction of exported proteins from whole 
bacteria
Triton X-114 phase-separation was used to isolate lipo-
philic proteins following the method of Bordier [50]. In
brief, 3-4 week old bacilli were lysed by bead beating and
centrifuged, initially at 2300 g to remove unbroken cells
and cell-wall debris. Triton X-114 was added to the
supernatant (final detergent concentration 2%, v/v) and
the suspension was stirred at 4°C for 20 minutes to obtain
the protein extract in a single phase. Residual insoluble
matter was removed by centrifugation at 15700 g for 10
min, and the solution separated into two phases, an upper
(aqueous) and lower (detergent) phase after 10 minutes
incubation at 37°C. The detergent phase was collected
and proteins were precipitated by acetone.

Gel electrophoresis and in-gel digestion of proteins
Extracted proteins (50 μg) were mixed with 25 μl SDS
loading buffer and boiled for 5 minutes before separation
on a 10 cm long 1 mm thick 12% SDS polyacrylamide gel
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.). The protein migration
was allowed to proceed until the bromophenol dye had
migrated to the bottom of the gel. The protein bands
were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250
staining (Invitrogen). Protein lanes were excised and
divided in fractions according to the bands of the protein
standard, ranging from ~3 kDa to ~188 kDa. The gel
pieces were washed twice with 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in
25 mM ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) for 15 min-
utes at room temperature (RT), and subsequently dehy-
drated by incubating them with 50 μl 100% ACN for 20
minutes at RT. The proteins were reduced using 10 mM
dithiotreitol and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide;
both in 100 mM NH4HCO3. The gel pieces were dehy-
drated by 100% ACN as described above, and rehydrated
in 25 mmol/l NH4HCO3 followed by in-gel protein diges-
tion with trypsin (Promega, Madison, U.S.A.) for 16-20 h
at 37°C. The digested peptides were eluted by incubating
the gel pieces with 50 μl 1% formic acid (FA) for 20 min-
utes at RT. The supernatant containing the peptides were
collected after centrifugation at 15700 g for 10 minutes.
Then, the gel pieces were incubated with 50 μl 0.1% FA in
50% ACN for 20 minutes at RT, followed by centrifuga-
tion at 15700 g. The supernatant was collected and com-
bined with the previous one. Finally, the gel pieces were
dehydrated with 50 μl 100% ACN for 20 minutes at RT,
and the supernatant was collected after centrifugation as
described above and added to the pool.
Mass spectrometry
Experiments were performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000
nano-LC system (Sunnyvale CA, USA) connected to a
linear quadrupole ion trap-Orbitrap (LTQ-Orbitrap)
mass spectrometer (Thermo Electron, Bremen, Ger-
many) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. The
mass spectrometer was operated in the data-dependent
mode to automatically switch between Orbitrap-MS and
LTQ-MS/MS acquisition. Survey full scan MS spectra
(from m/z 400 to 2,000) were acquired in the Orbitrap
with resolution R = 60,000 at m/z 400 (after accumulation
to a target of 1,000,000 charges in the LTQ). The method
allowed sequential isolation of up to five of the most
intense ions for fragmentation on the linear ion trap
using collision induced dissociation at a target value of
100,000 charges.
For accurate mass measurements the lock mass option
was enabled in MS mode and the polydimethylcyclosilox-
ane (PCM) ions generated in the electrospray process
from ambient air (protonated (Si(CH3)2O)6; m/z
445.120025) were used for internal recalibration during
the analysis [51]. Target ions already selected for MS/MS
were dynamically excluded for 30 seconds. General mass
spectrometry conditions were: electrospray voltage, 1.9
kV Ion selection threshold was 500 counts for MS/MS, an
activation Q-value of 0.25 and activation time of 30 ms
was also applied for MS/MS.
The obtained data was searched against the publicly
available Tuberculist database version R10 http://geno-
list.pasteur.fr/TubercuList/ using MASCOT software
version 2.1 (Matrix Science, UK). The database was in-
house modified to include reversed sequences of the orig-
inal ORFs in order to determine false-positive thresholds
of the Mascot identification engine [52]. Tuberculist was
preferred over secondary annotations performed by inde-
pendent institutes because previous data from our group
demonstrated that the Tuberculist annotation appear to
be more reliable [33]. The criteria for the Mascot search
were as follows: Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set
as fixed modification, methionine oxidation and N-acety-
lation (protein) as variable modifications. Up to 3 missed
cleavages were allowed. Peptide (precursor) ion mass tol-
erance was 15 ppm, and the fragment ion tolerance was
0.5 Da. Mascot scoring showed that p > 0.01 was equiva-
lent to a score of 24. The criterion for a positive identifi-
cation of proteins identified with at least 2 peptides was a
minimal score of 24 for each peptide which represents a
1:10,000 false positive rate at protein level. The maximal
score for a peptide from a reversed entry of the annotated
M. tuberculosis H37Rv database was found to be 31 (data
not shown). This was considered as a threshold for false-
positive identifications, and all proteins identified in this
study with only one peptide were based on a score higher
than 37 (25:10,000). No false positive identifications were
observed from the reversed database using these criteria.
For visualization and validation of spectra, MSQuant ver-
sion +1.4.2 was used. MSQuant is an open source tool
available at http://msquant.sourceforge.net and is widely
used for LC-MS/MS data analysis [51].
Western blot
Proteins from both lipid and aqueous phase were sepa-
rated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to nitrocellulose
membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and blocked with
5% non-fat milk in PBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (PBST)
for 1 hour at RT. The membranes were then washed with
PBST for 10 min. This was repeated three times. After the
last wash, the membranes were incubated overnight at
4°C with rabbit antisera raised against 1) a cell wall frac-
tion and 2) a crude whole cell lysate of M. bovis BCG.
Sera were diluted 1:500 in PBS with 1% non-fat milk and
0.1% Tween 20. The blots were washed thoroughly with
PBST as described above, and probed with Horse Radish
Peroxidase (HRP) conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000
dilution) (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 hour at RT. Anti-
gen-antibody complexes were visualized by a chemilumi-

nescent reaction (Pierce, Rockford, IL, U.S.A.) using
Chemidoc XRS (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA).
Gene and protein sequence analysis
Gene and protein sequences were obtained from Tuber-
culist http://genolist.pasteur.fr/TubercuList/ and BoviList
http://genolist.pasteur.fr/BoviList/. 
Sequences 
align-
ments were done using the Blast 2 algorithm http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi. For prediction of lipo-
proteins, the LipoP algorithm was used http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/LipoP/. For detection of poten-
tial secreted proteins SignalP version 3.0 was used http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/.
Estimation of protein abundance
The abundance of each protein was estimated by calcu-
lating the protein abundance index (PAI) [53], and the
emPAI [15]. The estimation is based on the calculation of
identified peptides per protein normalized by the theo-
retical number of peptides for the same protein. This is
considered to be a good method for quantitative estima-
tion because it takes into account that larger proteins are
expected to generate more observable peptides in the
mass spectrometry analysis, compared to smaller ones
[15,16]. The final peptide list obtained from the MS anal-
ysis was submitted to a publicly available tool http://
empai.iab.keio.ac.jp/, and emPAI values were calculated
using the following parameters: M. tuberculosis H37Rv
Tuberculist version R10 database; trypsin enzyme, carb-
amidomethyl (C) modification; peptide MW range from
300 to 6000 Da; no retention time filtering; peptide score
higher than 24 as filtered by Mascot.
