Abstract. Vegetation ﬁres emit large quantities of aerosol
into the atmosphere, impacting regional air quality and cli-
mate. Previous work has used comparisons of simulated and
observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) in regions heavily im-
pacted by ﬁres to suggest that emissions of aerosol particles
from ﬁres may be underestimated by a factor of 2–5. Here
we use surface, aircraft and satellite observations made over
the Amazon during September 2012, along with a global
aerosol model to improve understanding of aerosol emis-
sions from vegetation ﬁres. We apply three different satellite-
derived ﬁre emission datasets (FINN, GFED, GFAS) in the
model. Daily mean aerosol emissions in these datasets vary
by up to a factor of 3.7 over the Amazon during this pe-
riod, highlighting the considerable uncertainty in emissions.
We ﬁnd variable agreement between the model and observed
aerosol mass concentrations. The model reproduces observed
aerosol concentrations over deforestation ﬁres well in the
western Amazon during dry season conditions with FINN or
GFED emissions and during dry–wet transition season con-
ditions with GFAS emissions. In contrast, the model underes-
timates aerosol concentrations over savanna ﬁres in the Cer-
rado environment east of the Amazon Basin with all three
ﬁre emission datasets. The model generally underestimates
AOD compared to satellite and ground stations, even when
the model reproduces the observed vertical proﬁle of aerosol
mass concentration. We suggest it is likely caused by un-
certainties in the calculation of AOD, which are as large as
∼90 %, with the largest sensitivities due to uncertainties in
water uptake and relative humidity. Overall, we do not ﬁnd
evidence that particulate emissions from ﬁres are systemat-
ically underestimated in the Amazon region and we caution
against using comparison with AOD to constrain particulate
emissions from ﬁres.

Introduction
Vegetation and peat ﬁres (open biomass burning) are a ma-
jor source of particulate matter (aerosol) for the atmosphere
(van der Werf et al., 2010; Langmann et al., 2009), dominat-
ing the aerosol burden in many tropical regions (Lelieveld
et al., 2015). There is considerable uncertainty in the mag-
nitude of aerosol emissions from tropical ﬁres (Reddington
et al., 2016), hindering estimates of the impact of ﬁre on
weather (Kolusu et al., 2015; Archer-Nicholls et al., 2016),
climate (Rap et al., 2013; Thornhill et al., 2018) and human
health (Johnston et al., 2012; Marlier et al., 2013; Redding-
ton et al., 2015; Reid et al., 2016). Here we evaluate the
Global Model of Aerosol Processes (GLOMAP; Spracklen et
al., 2005) against a comprehensive set of measurement data
(including surface, aircraft and satellite observations) col-
lected during the South American Biomass Burning Analysis
(SAMBBA) ﬁeld campaign in September and October 2012
over the Amazon basin. Our aims are to (1) quantify the ef-
fects of biomass burning emissions on the aerosol distribu-
tion over the Amazon and (2) explore how different ﬁre emis-
sion datasets affect simulated aerosol concentrations over
this region.

C. L. Reddington et al.: Biomass burning aerosol over the Amazon
Models systematically underestimate aerosol optical depth
(AOD) in regions impacted by tropical biomass burning,
potentially suggesting that emission datasets underestimate
aerosol emissions (Reddington et al., 2016). Fire emission
datasets are typically created through combining information
on ﬁre location and extent from satellite remote sensing with
estimates of biomass consumption and species-speciﬁc emis-
sion factors (Langmann et al., 2009). Emissions could be un-
derestimated due to missing ﬁre detections or uncertainties
in burned area (Randerson et al., 2012), fuel consumption
(van Leeuwen et al., 2014; Andela et al., 2016) or emission
factors (van Leeuwen et al., 2013; Stockwell et al., 2016).
Agreement between bottom-up and top-down approaches for
carbon emissions from ﬁres is typically better than for par-
ticulate matter (PM) (Yin et al., 2016), suggesting that un-
certainties in burned area or fuel loads do not dominate.
Estimating emissions of PM from ﬁres is further compli-
cated by the emission of a range of semi-volatile and inter-
mediate volatility organic compounds that can contribute to
aerosol formation (Grieshop et al., 2009; Jathar et al., 2014).
These processes are poorly understood and are not treated in
many models. Observational studies report varying amounts
of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in different
biomass burning plumes. Analysis of Siberian biomass burn-
ing plumes (Konovalov et al., 2017) and southern African sa-
vanna and grassland ﬁre plumes (Vakkari et al., 2018) show
substantial in-plume SOA formation, whereas other stud-
ies report little SOA formation in tropical biomass burning
plumes (Jolleys et al., 2012). At the global scale, a recent
modelling study (Tsimpidi et al., 2016) estimates that 30 %
of organic aerosol (OA) in biomass burning aerosol origi-
nates from direct particulate emissions, with the remainder
being formed in the atmosphere. Analysis of OA : CO ratios
in biomass burning plumes during the SAMBBA campaign
suggests limited SOA formation from Amazon ﬁres (Brito et
al., 2014).
Top-down studies typically use AOD, available from satel-
lite remote sensing, to help constrain aerosol emissions from
ﬁres. In addition to particle mass concentration, simulated
AOD is sensitive to assumptions about particle size, chem-
ical composition, vertical proﬁle of aerosol, optical proper-
ties and water uptake, as well as meteorology and model res-
olution (Brock et al., 2016). Reddington et al. (2016) found
that a global aerosol model showed better agreement with ob-
served PM mass concentration compared to AOD, potentially
suggesting that some of the discrepancy between top-down
and bottom-up studies may be connected to the calculation
of AOD.
To help explore these issues we analyse observations from
the SAMBBA ﬁeld campaign over the southern Amazon dur-
ing the end of the dry season and transition to wet season.
The Amazon exhibits a very strong seasonal cycle in aerosol
concentrations (Martin et al., 2010). In the wet season (∼De-
cember to ∼May), PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameters
smaller than 2.5 µm) concentrations in the central Amazon
are ∼1.5 µgm−3 and has aerosol number concentrations of
220 cm−3 (Pöschl et al., 2010; Artaxo et al., 2013), some of
the lowest concentrations observed in a terrestrial environ-
ment. In the dry season (∼June to ∼November), ﬁres occur
across the southern Amazon, resulting in aerosol concentra-
tions that are an order of magnitude higher (PM2.5 concen-
trations of > 30 µgm−3 and aerosol number concentrations
of > 20 000 cm−3 (Artaxo et al., 2013).
Fires in the Amazon are a consequence of both climate
and human activity (van Marle et al., 2017). There was rela-
tively little ﬁre activity in the Amazon before the mid-1980s
(van Marle et al., 2017), when large-scale clearance of the
Amazon forests began. Fire is used to clear forest and veg-
etation, resulting in positive relationships between the rate
of deforestation and ﬁre activity in the Amazon (Aragao et
al., 2008; Reddington et al., 2015; van Marle et al., 2017).
A reduction in the rate of deforestation across the Brazilian
Amazon between 2002 and 2012 (Hansen et al., 2013) has
led to reductions in deforestation-related ﬁres (Reddington et
al., 2015) and observed reductions in CO (Jiang et al., 2017)
and AOD (Reddington et al., 2015). Fires are also used to
maintain agricultural and pastoral land and may escape into
surrounding forest leading to forest degradation (Chen et al.,
2013a) and resulting in a disconnection between ﬁre and de-
forestation (Aragao and Shimabukuro, 2010; Cano-Crespo et
al., 2015). There has been reduction in area burned by ﬁres in
the southwestern Amazon and increase in area burned further
east during the last decade (Andela et al., 2017). Droughts
enhance the occurrence of ﬁre (Chen et al., 2013b) with
seasons of increased large ﬁre occurrence coinciding with
the Amazon droughts of 2005, 2007 and 2010 (Chen et al.,
2013a).
Aerosol from ﬁres degrades air quality, with negative im-
pacts on human health (Marlier et al., 2013; Reddington et
al., 2015; Koplitz et al., 2016; Crippa et al., 2016). Inhala-
tion of smoke from ﬁres in the Amazon causes DNA dam-
age and death of human lung cells (de Oliveira Alves et al.,
2017), impacts lung function (Jacobson et al., 2014), causes
increased hospitalisations for respiratory diseases (Smith et
al., 2014), and is estimated to result in thousands of mortal-
ities each year (Reddington et al., 2015). Estimates on the
health impacts of degraded air quality from ﬁres require ac-
curate information on the magnitude of particulate emissions
from ﬁre. A range of policy interventions will be necessary
to reduce Amazonian ﬁre (Morello et al., 2017).
Here we combine detailed observations of aerosol vertical
proﬁles made over the Brazilian Amazon during the dry sea-
son of 2012 with surface observations, remote sensing and an
aerosol model to better understand model representations of
the magnitude and spatial distributions of particulate emis-
sions from biomass burning.

Method
2.1
GLOMAP global aerosol model
We used the TOMCAT chemical transport model (Chip-
perﬁeld, 2006), coupled to the GLOMAP global aerosol
model (Spracklen et al., 2005), to simulate aerosol during
the SAMBBA campaign. Below we describe the features of
the model relevant for this study; see Spracklen et al. (2005)
and Mann et al. (2010) for more detailed descriptions of the
model and Reddington et al. (2016) for further details of the
model set-up used here.
Large-scale atmospheric transport and meteorology in
TOMCAT are speciﬁed from European Centre for Medium-
Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanal-
yses, updated every 6 h and linearly interpolated onto the
model time step. The model has a horizontal resolution of
2.8◦× 2.8◦, with 31 vertical model levels between the sur-
face and 10 hPa. The vertical resolution in the boundary layer
ranges from ∼60 m near the surface to ∼400 m at ∼2 km
above the surface.
The aerosol size distribution is represented by a two-
moment modal aerosol scheme (Mann et al., 2010).
GLOMAP includes black carbon (BC), particulate organic
matter (POM), sulfate (SO4), sea spray and mineral dust.
Concentrations of oxidants are speciﬁed using monthly mean
3-D ﬁelds at 6-hourly intervals from a TOMCAT simulation
with detailed tropospheric chemistry (Arnold et al., 2005)
linearly interpolated onto the model time step.
Wet removal of aerosol in GLOMAP occurs via two pro-
cesses: (1) in-cloud nucleation scavenging, calculated for
both large-scale and convective-scale precipitation based on
rain-rates diagnosed from successive ECMWF ERA-Interim
reanalysis ﬁelds and (2) below-cloud impaction scaveng-
ing via collection by falling raindrops. For dry deposition
of aerosol, GLOMAP calculates the wind speed and size-
dependent deposition velocity due to Brownian diffusion, im-
paction and interception. Detailed descriptions of the dry and
wet aerosol removal process are in Mann et al. (2010).
Anthropogenic emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), BC and
organic carbon (OC) were speciﬁed using the MACCity
emissions inventory for 2010 (Lamarque et al., 2010). Open
biomass burning emissions of SO2, BC and OC are described
in Sect. 2.2. Primary carbonaceous aerosol particles are as-
sumed to be non-volatile and are emitted into the model with
a ﬁxed log-normal size distribution, assuming a number me-
dian diameter (NMD) of 150 nm for biomass burning emis-
sions and 60 nm for fossil fuel emissions and a modal width
(σ) of 1.59. We convert primary OC to POM using a pre-
scribed POM : OC ratio of 1.4, which is at the lower end of
the range prescribed in other global models (1.4 to 2.6) (Tsi-
garidis et al., 2014). Monthly mean emissions of biogenic
monoterpenes are taken from the Global Emissions InitiAtive
(GEIA) database (Guenther et al., 1995). Monoterpenes are
oxidised to form a product that condenses irreversibly in the
particle phase (Scott et al., 2014). Size-resolved emissions
of mineral dust are prescribed from daily varying emissions
ﬂuxes provided for AEROCOM (Dentener et al., 2006).
2.1.1
Description of model simulations
We performed four main model simulations with GLOMAP:
one simulation excluding open biomass burning emissions
(“noBBA”) and three simulations including open biomass
burning emissions (using three different open biomass burn-
ing emission datasets: “FINN”, “GFED” and “GFAS”; see
Sect. 2.2). Simulations were run from 1 January 2003 to
31 December 2012, using ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalyses
that correspond to the simulation date and time. The model
aerosol ﬁelds were generated from an initially aerosol-free
atmosphere initialised on 1 October 2002 and spun up for
92 d to produce a realistic aerosol distribution (Spracklen et
al., 2005). The model was set up to output 3-D monthly mean
global ﬁelds and 1-D daily mean vertical proﬁles at the loca-
tions of ground and AERONET stations (Sect. 2.3). In this
study, we show results from the model simulations for the
year 2012. Speciﬁcally for this study, the model was set up
to output additional 3-D ﬁelds every hour between July and
November 2012 over a South American domain.
2.1.2
Calculation of aerosol optical depth
AOD was calculated from the simulated aerosol size distri-
bution as in Reddington et al. (2016), using Mie theory as-
suming spherical particles (Grainger et al., 2004) that are in-
ternally mixed within each log-normal mode. Modelled AOD
was calculated at speciﬁc wavelengths to match observations
(500 and 550 nm), using component-speciﬁc refractive in-
dices at the closest wavelength available from Bellouin et
al. (2011).
The aerosol hygroscopicity in the AOD calculation was
obtained directly from GLOMAP using the aerosol water
uptake calculated online in the model using Zdanovskii–
Stokes–Robinson (ZSR) theory (Stokes and Robinson, 1966)
(described in Sect. S1.1 in the Supplement). We explore the
sensitivity of simulated AOD to the calculation of aerosol
water uptake in Sect. 3.5, by also using the κ-Köhler scheme
(Petters and Kreidenweis, 2007) to calculate an ofﬂine esti-
mate of water uptake (described in Sect. S1.2). The ZSR and
κ-Köhler methods used in this study represent high and low
aerosol water uptake cases, respectively (Reddington et al.,
2016). In Sect. 3.5 we also explore the sensitivity of simu-
lated AOD to assumed refractive indices and aerosol mixing
state.

Biomass burning emissions
2.2.1
Biomass burning emissions in GLOMAP
We used three different emission datasets of aerosol from
open biomass burning: the National Centre for Atmospheric

C. L. Reddington et al.: Biomass burning aerosol over the Amazon
Research Fire Inventory (FINN) (Wiedinmyer et al., 2011),
the Global Fire Emissions Dataset (GFED) (van der Werf et
al., 2010) and the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS)
(Kaiser et al., 2012). We use daily mean ﬁre emissions from
FINN version 1.5, GFED version 4.1s (Mu et al., 2011; van
der Werf et al., 2017) and GFAS version 1.2 (hereafter re-
ferred to as GFAS, FINN and GFED, respectively).
Brito et al. (2014) analysed OA : CO ratios and found lit-
tle enhancement of OA in ﬁre plumes during the SAMBBA
campaign, suggesting that SOA formation is limited or bal-
anced by loss of OA through volatilisation. A recent study
analysed airborne in situ observations of biomass burning
carbonaceous aerosol during SAMBBA and found ﬁnd lim-
ited evidence for net increases in aerosol mass through at-
mospheric ageing (Morgan et al., 2019). These observations
suggest that SOA formation in plumes may be occurring on
short timescales (Morgan et al., 2019), but since a net in-
crease in OA mass was not observed in the regional-scale
analyses of Brito et al. (2014) and Morgan et al. (2019), we
do not include any SOA formation associated with biomass
burning emissions.
Fires can inject emissions above the surface due the buoy-
ancy of the ﬁre plume. Marenco et al. (2016) analysed li-
dar data during the SAMBBA campaign and found that the
mean height of aerosol layers was 2.0 ± 0.4 km, suggesting
that the majority of the aerosol is injected into the boundary
layer. Fire emissions in GLOMAP are distributed vertically
over six ecosystem-dependent altitudes between the surface
and 6 km according to Dentener et al. (2006). Over Brazil
∼53 % of emissions were injected below 500 m elevation,
∼30 % between 500 and 1000 m elevation, and ∼17 % be-
tween 1000 and 3000 m elevation. We also performed a sen-
sitivity simulation where ﬁre emissions were injected into the
model surface layer. We evaluate the vertical proﬁle of simu-
lated aerosol in Sect. 3.2.
2.2.2
Description of biomass burning emission datasets
FINN, GFED and GFAS provide daily ﬁre emissions of
aerosol and gas-phase species. FINN emissions (Wiedinmyer
et al., 2011) are available from 2002 to 2018 on a 1 km2 grid.
GFAS emissions (Kaiser et al., 2012) are available from 2003
to present on a 0.1◦× 0.1◦grid. GFED emissions (van der
Werf et al., 2017) are available from 2003 to 2018 (monthly
emissions are available from 1997) on a 0.25◦× 0.25◦grid.
Reddington et al. (2016) include a detailed a description of
the FINN version 1.0, GFED version 3 and GFAS version 1.0
datasets. A brief description of the updated datasets is given
below.
FINN emissions are based on the location and timing
of active ﬁre detections from the MODIS Fire and Ther-
mal Anomalies Product (Giglio et al., 2003), using MODIS
Land Cover Type and Vegetation Continuous Fields prod-
ucts to specify land cover classes and identify fractions of
tree and non-tree vegetation and bare ground. A burned
area is assigned to each ﬁre count (0.75 km2 ﬁres detected
on grassland and savanna land cover classes and 1 km2 for
all other ﬁre detections), with adjustments made to the as-
sumed burned area if the ﬁre pixel extends partially over bare
ground. Estimates of biomass loading are taken from Hoelze-
mann et al. (2004) and emission factors for each species
are taken from Akagi et al. (2011). The version 1.5 dataset
used here (acquired in 2014) includes emission factors up-
dated to incorporate measurements published in Yokelson et
al. (2013) and Akagi et al. (2013) (for more information, see
updates described here: http://bai.acom.ucar.edu/Data/ﬁre/,
last access: 30 March 2019).
GFAS uses the observed geolocation of active ﬁres (like
FINN) combined with ﬁre radiative power (FRP) derived
from the MODIS instrument. The FRP ﬁelds are corrected
for observation gaps due to partial cloud cover and/or spu-
rious signals (e.g. from volcanoes, gas ﬂares, etc.). FRP is
converted to the combustion rate of dry matter using land-
cover-speciﬁc conversion factors based on data from GFED
(Heil et al., 2010; Kaiser et al., 2012). Trace gas and aerosol
emission rates are calculated using updated emission factors
based on Andreae and Merlet (2001). The version 1.2 dataset
is at a higher spatial resolution than previous versions, with
improvements made to the processing and assimilation of
satellite observations.
GFED emissions are based on estimates of burned area
(Giglio et al., 2013), active ﬁre detections and plant produc-
tivity from the MODIS instrument. To derive total carbon
emissions, the satellite datasets are combined with estimates
of fuel loads and combustion completeness for each monthly
time step from the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach bio-
geochemical model. Carbon emission ﬂuxes are converted
to trace gas and aerosol emissions using species-speciﬁc
emission factors based on Akagi et al. (2011) and Andreae
and Merlet (2001), with updates provided in 2013 by Mein-
rat O. Andreae. Signiﬁcant updates in the version 4.1s dataset
relevant for this study include (i) higher spatial resolution,
(ii) new burned area estimates (Giglio et al., 2013) with addi-
tional contributions from small ﬁres (Randerson et al., 2012)
and (iii) improved representation of fuel consumption (see
van der Werf et al., 2017, for more detail on updates from
version 3 to version 4).

Figure 1 compares total annual OC emissions from GFAS,
FINN and GFED. The ﬁgure shows long-term (2002–2012)
mean annual total emissions as well as annual total emissions
in 2012, the year of the SAMBBA ﬁeld campaign (total emis-
sions for the SAMBBA ﬁeld campaign are shown in Fig. S1
in the Supplement). For the long-term mean, all datasets
show broadly similar spatial patterns with greatest OC emis-
sions across the arc of deforestation (roughly 8–14◦S, 65–
50◦W). Total annual BC emissions show very similar spatial

compares total annual BC and OC emissions from the three
datasets and Figs. S2, S3 and S4 compare the total daily OC
emissions for the 2012 dry season and the SAMBBA cam-

For annual total emissions averaged over the 2002–2012
period, FINN emissions are greater than GFED and GFAS
across regions of deforestation in the western Amazon but
lower than GFED and GFAS in the eastern Amazon (4–
15◦S, 50–40◦W). Annual total aerosol (OC+BC) emissions
averaged over 2002–2012 differ by up to a factor of 2.4
(FINN : GFAS) in the western region and by up to a factor
of 1.9 (GFAS : FINN) in the eastern region. Matching 2002–
2012 comparisons, FINN emissions in 2012 (and during the
SAMBBA period) were also greater than GFED and GFAS
over deforestation regions of the western Amazon and lower
than GFED and GFAS in the eastern Amazon. Annual total
OC+BC emissions in 2012 vary by up to a factor of 3.5 in
the west (FINN : GFAS) and up to a factor of 2.1 in the east
(GFAS : FINN). Pereira et al. (2016) also reported that FINN

had lower (higher) aerosol emissions in the eastern (western)
Amazon compared to GFAS during the SAMBBA period.
Reddington et al. (2016) reported similar patterns for com-
parison of GFAS version 1.0, FINN version 1.0 and GFED
version 3 emissions. During the SAMBBA campaign, daily
mean aerosol (OC+BC) emissions differ between the differ-
ent datasets by up to a factor of 3.7 in the western Amazon
(FINN : GFAS) and by up to a factor of 2.4 in the eastern
Amazon (GFAS : FINN).
Figure 1 also shows the difference in annual total OC emis-
sions between 2012 and the 2002–2012 mean (very simi-
lar spatial patterns are seen for BC emissions). All three
datasets show consistently lower emissions in 2012 com-
pared to 2002–2012 across the arc of deforestation in west-
ern Brazil and Bolivia (8–18◦S, 70–50◦W). OC emissions
in 2012 in the western Amazon were 4 %–47 % lower than
the 2002–2012 mean (Table 1). Aerosol emissions from ﬁre
in Brazil have declined over this period, related to reduc-
tions in deforestation (Reddington et al., 2015) and consis-
tent with observed declines in CO (Jiang et al., 2017) and
AOD (Reddington et al., 2015). Figure S5 shows a reduction
in the area dominated by deforestation type ﬁres (and an in-
creasing dominance of savanna-type ﬁres) in 2012 relative to
the 2002–2012 mean. In 2012, emissions were greater than
the 2002–2012 average across much of Peru, possibly due
to increased deforestation there (Kalamandeen et al., 2018).
In the eastern Amazon, emissions in 2012 were 30 %–96 %
greater than the 2002–2012 mean (Table 1), with the largest
differences in GFAS and GFED datasets.

South American Biomass Burning Analysis
(SAMBBA)
We used observations from the South American Biomass
Burning Analysis (SAMBBA) campaign. Aircraft and
ground observations took place from 13 September to 3 Oc-
tober 2012. We separate the campaign into the dry season
(Phase 1; 13 to 22 September) and the dry–wet season tran-
sition (Phase 2; 23 September to 3 October) following Brito
et al. (2014). Figure 2 shows locations of aircraft ﬂights and
surface measurement sites.
2.3.1
Aircraft observations
The BAe-146 research aircraft from the Facility for Air-
borne Atmospheric Measurements (FAAM) made 20 re-
search ﬂights with measurements of a range of gas-phase
and aerosol species. We use measurements of OA and sul-
fate mass in the 50–750 nm size range from an aerosol mass
spectrometer (AMS) (Canagaratna et al., 2007; Morgan et al.,
2010; Allan et al., 2014), refractive BC from a single-particle
soot photometer (SP2) (Stephens et al., 2003; McMeeking
et al., 2010; Allan et al., 2014) and aerosol size distribution
from a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) (Wang and
Flagan, 1990; Morgan et al., 2015) and a GRIMM model
1.108 optical particle counter (OPC) (Heim et al., 2008).
Further details about the instruments used aboard the BAe-
146 during SAMBBA can be found in Sect. S2.1, includ-
ing information about measurement uncertainty. See Allan
et al. (2014), for more speciﬁc details regarding the aerosol
sampling during SAMBBA.
The ﬂights sampled a broad region spanning 1–12◦S, 46–
68◦W (Fig. 2). Aerosol properties and ﬁre emissions (Fig. 1)
varied across this region, so we separated data into a west-

during the SAMBBA campaign are shown by black crosses: Porto Velho UNIR (8.84◦S, 63.94◦W), Alta Floresta (9.87◦S, 56.10◦W), Rio

ern region (6–12◦S, 54–68.5◦W) and an eastern region (4.5–
15◦S, 43–50◦W), following Johnson et al. (2016). We note
that the aircraft sampling in the eastern region (including one
full ﬂight and sections of three ﬂights) was limited relative
to the sampling performed in the western region (including
14 full ﬂights and sections of 5 ﬂights). We used aircraft data
from both vertical proﬁles and straight and level runs (SLRs).
To avoid bias, time periods when the plane was actively sam-
pling smoke plumes were removed from the SLR data using a
plume removal algorithm (Darbyshire et al., 2019). Visually
observable plumes were speciﬁcally avoided when perform-
ing vertical proﬁles during SAMBBA, so any enhancements
due to smoke plumes in the proﬁle data are small. Time peri-
ods when in-cloud sampling was performed were also ﬁltered
out of the data; speciﬁcally the data were screened for cloud
artefacts when the liquid water content exceeded 0.05 g m−3
(Darbyshire et al., 2019).
2.3.2
Ground observations
A large suite of instruments were deployed at a site in
the southwestern Amazon (8.69◦S, 63.87◦W) (Brito et al.,
2014). The site is located in a forest reserve about 5 km
from Porto Velho (population of around 500 000) and is usu-
ally upwind of the city (Brito et al., 2014). Here we used
measurements from an aerosol chemical speciation monitor
(ACSM; Ng et al., 2011) and an aethalometer (Magee Sci-
entiﬁc, model AE30). The ACSM measured 30 min resolu-
tion mass concentrations of particulate ammonium, nitrate,
sulfate, chloride and organic species in the 75–650 nm size
range. The Aethalometer measured 5 min resolution equiv-
alent black carbon (BCeq) mass concentrations. Details re-
garding the aethalometer and ACSM measurement uncer-
tainty can be found in Sect. S2.2. Data from both instruments
are available from the 6 September to the 1 October 2012.
Mean aerosol mass concentration (ACSM + Aethalometer)
during this period was 13.7 µgm−3, with OA contributing an
average of 83 % of the total mass. Mean aerosol mass con-
centrations were lower in Phase 2 (6.0 µgm−3) compared to
Phase 1 (17.8 µgm−3). Full details are provided in Brito et
al. (2014). PM2.5 concentrations were measured using gravi-
metric ﬁlter analysis, with a measurement duration ranging
from less than 1 to ∼7 d (Artaxo et al., 2013).
2.3.3
AERONET aerosol optical depth
We used spectral columnar AOD measured by Aerosol
Robotic Network (AERONET) Cimel sun photometers (Hol-
ben et al., 1998) from ﬁve stations deployed across the
region that have data available for the SAMBBA cam-
paign period: Porto Velho UNIR (8.84◦S, 63.94◦W),
Alta Floresta (9.87◦S, 56.10◦W), Rio Branco (9.96◦S,
67.87◦W), Cuiabá-Miranda (15.73◦S, 56.02◦W) and Santa
Cruz UTEPSA (17.77◦S, 63.20◦W). We used Version 3
Level 2 cloud-screened and quality-assured daytime average
AOD (Giles et al., 2019), retrieved at 500 nm. Locations of
the AERONET stations are shown in Fig. 2.

Simulated daily mean concentrations are shown with FINN1.5 (green), GFAS1.2 (blue), GFED4 (red) emissions and with no biomass burning
emissions (noBBA; orange). Observed PM2.5 concentrations are averages over sampling periods that ranged from < 1 to 7 d in 2012. The
NMBF values are given separately for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of the SAMBBA ﬁeld campaign in Table 2.
2.3.4
MODIS aerosol optical depth
We used daily AOD retrieved at 550 nm from the Mod-
erate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in-
strument on board the Terra and Aqua satellites for the
SAMBBA campaign period to calculate regional average
AODs. Speciﬁcally, we used the Collection 5.1 Level-3
MODIS Atmosphere Daily Global Product gridded to 1◦×1◦
resolution (Terra: MOD08_D3; Aqua: MYD08_D3; https://
modis-atmosphere.gsfc.nasa.gov/products/daily, last access:
30 March 2019) (Hubanks et al., 2008) acquired through
NASA’s Level 1 and the Atmosphere Archive and Distri-
bution System (LAADS). Daytime Equator crossing is at
10:30 LT for Terra and at 13:30 LT for Aqua.
2.3.5
Measurement uncertainty
Section S2 describes further details of the instrumenta-
tion used during SAMBBA, including information about
measurement calibration and uncertainty. In summary, for
conditions during SAMBBA the mass concentration mea-
surement uncertainty has been estimated to be ∼20 % for
the aethalometer (Schmid et al., 2006), 10 %–35 % for the
ACSM (depending on the species, OA is 15 %; Crenn et al.,
2015), ∼30 % for the AMS (Bahreini et al., 2009; Middle-
brook et al., 2012 and ∼30 % for the SP2 (Schwarz et al.,
2008; Shiraiwa et al., 2008). For AOD retrievals, the 1σ un-
certainty is estimated to be ±0.05 + 15% for MODIS (Levy
et al., 2010) and ±0.01 for AERONET (Giles et al., 2019).
2.3.6
Comparing model and observations
To compare the model to the aircraft and ground-based ob-
servations, we linearly interpolated the simulated hourly data
along the ﬂight path of the aircraft and to the horizontal lo-
cation of the Porto Velho ground station. To compare with
the aircraft AMS and ground-based ACSM measurements,
the same detection ranges of the instruments (see Sect. 2.3.1
and 2.3.2) were applied to the simulated mass concentrations.
Prior to analysis, simulated data corresponding to periods
of missing or invalid measurement data were removed. To
quantify the agreement between the model and observations,
we use the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (r) and normalised
mean bias factor (NMBF) as deﬁned by Yu et al. (2006):

where M and O represent model and observed values, re-
spectively, for each time step, i. A positive NMBF indi-
cates the model overestimates the observations by a factor
of NMBF+1. A negative NMBF indicates the model under-
estimates the observations by a factor of 1−NMBF.

Results and discussion
3.1
Surface aerosol measurements
Figure 3 shows surface PM2.5 concentrations observed at
Porto Velho, in the southwestern Amazon, from January to
November 2012. Observed PM2.5 concentrations are less
than 2 µgm−3 between January and July 2012, increasing
to 30–50 µgm−3 in late August and September, then de-
clining to less than in 10 µgm−3 in October. This seasonal
cycle is well reproduced by the model with all ﬁre emis-
sion datasets. Simulated PM2.5 concentrations are enhanced
by biomass burning from August through to October, when
more than 80 % of PM2.5 concentrations are from biomass
burning. PM2.5 concentrations during September are well re-
produced by the model with GFED and FINN emissions but
underestimated by the model with GFAS emissions. PM2.5
concentrations are underestimated during early August, po-
tentially indicating that emission datasets have missed ﬁres
during the start of the dry season (see Fig. S2). During the
SAMBBA campaign (13 September–3 October), PM2.5 con-
centrations are well reproduced by the model with FINN
(r2 = 0.65; NMBF = 0.03) and GFED (r2 = 0.69; NMBF =

Table 2. Summary of comparison between the model and observations expressed as normalised mean bias factor (NMBF, italics indicates
model underestimation). Comparisons are shown for observations from the Porto Velho measurement station (PVH): PM2.5 (particulate mat-
ter with diameters smaller than 2.5 µm) mass; total aerosol mass (mass measured by the ACSM plus equivalent black carbon measured by the
aethalometer); and organic aerosol (OA), black carbon (BC), and sulfate mass concentrations. Comparisons are shown from the aircraft: total
aerosol mass (mass measured by AMS plus refractive BC measured by the SP2) and OA, BC, and sulfate mass concentrations; aerosol scatter-
ing; and aerosol extinction. Comparisons are shown from the satellite: aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD550) from MODIS and AOD500
from AERONET. Aircraft comparisons are for concentrations below 2.5 km (western Amazon) or 4 km (eastern Amazon). AERONET com-
parisons are the average NMBF across ﬁve stations. For aircraft total aerosol mass, scattering and extinction, the model and observations are
compared only during time periods with available AMS measurements. Values are shown for the model with FINN1.5, GFAS1.2, GFED4.1s
emissions and with no biomass burning emissions (noBBA). The numbers highlighted in bold show the model simulation with the smallest
bias.

C. L. Reddington et al.: Biomass burning aerosol over the Amazon
Figure 4. Composition-resolved aerosol mass at Porto Velho ground station during the SAMBBA campaign. (a) Time series of hourly mean
observed (black) and simulated (colour) total aerosol mass. The observed aerosol mass is the total mass from the ACSM plus equivalent BC
from the aethalometer. Simulated total aerosol mass is shown for the model with FINN1.5 (green), GFAS1.2 (blue), GFED4 (red) emissions
and with no biomass burning emissions (noBBA; orange). Numbers on the panel show the NMBF for the SAMBBA campaign separately
for Phase 1 (P1) and Phase 2 (P2) (also see Table 2). (b) Bar chart showing observed and simulated average aerosol composition during the

−0.45) but underestimated with GFAS (r2 = 0.44; NMBF =
−1.09) (see Table 2 for a summary of NMBF values).
Figure 4 compares simulated and measured composition-
resolved aerosol at Porto Velho during September 2012.
Measured total aerosol mass, calculated as mass measured
by the ACSM plus BCeq measured by the aethalometer,
varies consistently with measured PM2.5 concentrations dur-
ing the campaign (Fig. S6). However, when averaged over
the gravimetric ﬁlter analysis sampling time, measured total
(ACSM+BCeq) aerosol mass concentrations are consistently
lower than measured PM2.5 concentrations by ∼20 %–60 %
(Fig. S6a). This difference in the measurements is mostly ap-
portioned to the reduced aerosol detection–size range from
the ACSM (i.e. submicrometric) in comparison to the gravi-
metric analysis (< 2.5 µm) (Sect. 2.3.2), and, to a smaller
extent, the different measurement techniques and aerosol
species unaccounted by the on-line instrumentation (ACSM),
e.g. crustal elements.
Average observed total (ACSM+BCeq) aerosol mass con-
centrations are 20 µgm−3 in Phase 1, reducing to 7 µgm−3 in
Phase 2. The model with ﬁre emissions captures the decrease
in observed aerosol mass concentrations between Phase 1
and Phase 2 but underestimates the magnitude of the reduc-
tion (5–10 µgm−3, depending on the ﬁre emission dataset,
compared to 13 µgm−3 in the observations). The model with
GFED simulates observed total mass well in the ACSM de-
tection range in Phase 1 (NMBF = 0.08) but overestimates
observed mass in Phase 2 (NMBF = 0.89). Conversely, the
model with GFAS emissions simulates observed total mass
reasonably well in Phase 2 (NMBF = 0.30) but underesti-
mates in Phase 1 (NMBF = −0.49). The model with FINN
emissions overestimates observed total mass in both Phase 1
(NMBF = 0.45) and Phase 2 (NMBF = 1.94).
Observed total aerosol mass is dominated by OA (84 %),
with BC contributing 9 % and summed NH4, NO3 and Chl
contributing less than 5 % of total mass during the SAMBBA
campaign (Fig. 4b). Simulated aerosol (with ﬁre emissions
included) is also dominated by OA (86 %–88 %), with BC
contributing a slightly smaller fraction of the total aerosol
mass (5 %) than observed (see Fig. S7 for simulated and mea-
sured hourly OA and BC time series). NH4, NO3 and Chl are
not accounted for in GLOMAP. Sulfate accounts for 2.6 % of

11 % in the model (Fig. 4b). Sulfate concentrations are well
reproduced by the model with no ﬁre emissions and are over-
estimated when ﬁre emissions are included (Table 2). This
suggests that either emissions of sulfate from ﬁres are over-
estimated or that other sources of sulfate are overestimated
in the model in the region of Porto Velho.

(ﬂights 1–8) and Phase 2 (ﬂights 9–20). We also split the
data spatially into western and eastern Amazon regions (see
Fig. 2). We note that the aircraft sampling in the eastern
region was limited relative to sampling in the western re-
gion (Sect. 2.3.1). Figure S8 shows the number of OA (from
the AMS) and BC (from the SP2) observations per vertical
bin for the western region (Phases 1 and 2) and eastern re-
gion. Figure 5 shows that observed aerosol concentrations
are greatest in the boundary layer (BL) then reduce rapidly
above it (see also Fig. S9). Figures 5 and S9 show that the
shape of the aerosol vertical proﬁle is well reproduced by the
model, further conﬁrming that simulated vertical mixing and
the vertical injection height of ﬁre emissions are reasonable.
Observed aerosol concentrations are relatively constant be-
tween the surface and ∼2500 m in the western Amazon and
between the surface and ∼4000 m in the eastern Amazon.
This behaviour is reproduced by the model and is likely due
to a deeper BL over grassland vegetation in the eastern Ama-
zon (Fig. S10).
In the western Amazon, average concentrations of OA be-
low 2.5 km (roughly the BL) were 19 µgm−3 in Phase 1 com-
pared to 6 µgm−3 in Phase 2, similar in both magnitude and
temporal pattern to the surface observations at Porto Velho.
In Phase 1, the model underestimates observed OA con-
centrations in the BL with all emission datasets (NMBF =
−0.25 for FINN to −1.64 for GFAS). OA concentrations
in Phase 1 in the western Amazon between 3 and 4.5 km
are also underestimated by the model, with all emission
datasets consistent with comparisons in the BL. The model
does not simulate the observed reduction in OA concentra-
tions between Phase 1 and Phase 2, overestimating OA con-
centrations in the western Amazon in Phase 2 with GFED
(NMBF = 0.39) and FINN (NMBF = 1.21) emissions but
having good agreement with GFAS (NMBF = 0.02). This
may be because the emission datasets report only moderately
lower emissions in Phase 2 compared to Phase 1 (Fig. S3a;
Table 1) but also because the model may underestimate wet
removal of aerosol during Phase 2 (consistent with model and
observation comparisons in Archer-Nicholls et al., 2015). In
the eastern Amazon, average concentrations of OA below
4 km (roughly the BL) of 16 µgm−3 are underestimated by
the model with all three emission datasets (NMBF = −0.92
for GFAS to −3.14 for FINN).
Disagreement between observed and simulated OA may
be due to uncertainty in the OA : OC ratio. In this study we
assume an OA : OC ratio of 1.4, at the lower end of the range
(1.4 to 2.6) assumed by other models (Tsigaridis et al., 2014).
Philip et al. (2014) combined satellite data and AMS mea-
surements to estimate an OA : OC ratio of 1.3 to 2.1. Prelim-
inary analysis of aircraft data during SAMBBA suggests an
OA : OC ratio of 1.5 to 1.8 for fresh biomass burning aerosol
and 2.0 to 2.3 for aged aerosol (Johnson et al., 2016). Assum-
ing an OA : OC ratio of 2.3 would enhance our simulated OA
concentrations by 60 %, reducing our underestimate of OA in

both the western (Phase 1: NMBF = −0.64 to 0.29) and east-
ern (NMBF = −1.59 to −0.20) Amazon.
Observed refractive BC (rBC) concentrations in the BL are
∼1.0 µgm−3 in the western Amazon during Phase 1, drop-
ping to ∼0.5 µgm−3 during Phase 2. BC concentrations ob-
served at the surface (Sect. 3.1; Phase 1, 1.6 µgm−3; Phase
2, 0.9 µgm−3) are greater than those measured on the air-
craft, although this may be partly due to the different mea-
surement techniques used and different size detection ranges.
In the eastern Amazon, observed rBC concentrations are
higher (1.8 µgm−3), qualitatively reproduced by the model
with GFAS and GFED emissions but not with FINN emis-
sions. The model strongly underestimates BC concentrations
in the eastern Amazon with all emission datasets, particularly
with FINN (NMBF = −1.48 for GFAS to −6.10 for FINN).
In the west, the agreement is more variable, with the model
simulating concentrations in Phase 1 well with FINN emis-
sions but overestimating in Phase 2, GFED underestimat-
ing in Phase 1 but simulating concentrations well in Phase
2 and the model with GFAS emissions underestimating in
both phases.
In the western Amazon, comparison with sulfate aerosol
is fairly consistent with OA and BC comparisons, with
the model underestimating in Phase 1 and overestimating
in Phase 2. In the eastern Amazon, the model overesti-
mates sulfate concentrations even without a contribution
from ﬁres, suggesting that other natural and anthropogenic
sulfate sources may be overestimated in the model.
Observed average BC : OA mass concentration ratios in
the BL vary from 0.05 in the western Amazon (Phase 1,
1/19 = 0.05; Phase 2, 0.5/6 = 0.08) to 0.11 (1.8/16 = 0.11)
in the eastern Amazon. These ratios reﬂect the much higher
BC emission factors found for ﬂaming Cerrado ﬁres in the
eastern Amazon relative to tropical forest ﬁres in the western
Amazon (Hodgson et al., 2018). Simulated ratios are in good
agreement with observations in the western Amazon with
all emission datasets (e.g. Phase 1, FINN: 0.9/15 = 0.06;
Phase 2, FINN: 0.8/13 = 0.06). In the eastern Amazon, BC :
OC ratios are underestimated using FINN (0.26/3.8 = 0.07)
emissions, with better agreement using GFED (0.63/7.0 =
0.09) and GFAS (0.74/8.2 = 0.09) emissions.
In the western Amazon, average aerosol concentra-
tions at 4 km are ∼27 %–50 % of concentrations in the
BL (< 2.5 km) (OAP1: 7/19 = 0.37, OAP2: 3/6 = 0.50;
BCP1: 0.27/1 = 0.27, BCP2: 0.26/0.5 = 0.52). Marenco et
al. (2016) reported a mean aerosol layer of 2.0±0.4 km dur-
ing the SAMBBA campaign, which is consistent with the
model results presented here. A plume rise model coupled to
WRF-Chem overestimated OA concentrations at 6–8 km alti-
tude observed over tropical forest regions during SAMBBA,
suggesting the plume rise model overestimated ﬁre injection
height (Archer-Nicholls et al., 2015). Injecting ﬁre emissions
into the surface layer (Fig. S11, “GFED_surﬂev”) has a rel-
atively small impact on the simulated aerosol vertical pro-
ﬁle in the west (a mean change of −0.3 % below 2.5 km),
with a small change in the bias against observations (e.g. for
OA in Phase 1; NMBF = −0.82 for GFED and −0.77 for
GFED_surﬂev), demonstrating that vertical mixing rapidly
redistributes aerosol in the model. In the eastern region, the
impact is larger (a mean change of +5 % below 4 km), with
a slight improvement in the model bias (e.g. for OA; NMBF
= −1.23 for GFED and −0.90 for GFED_surﬂev). Overall
there appears to be limited evidence for the need for substan-
tial injection of ﬁre emissions above the BL for ﬁres in this
region.
Overall, the comparisons with aircraft observations show
variable agreement between the model and observations. The
model with GFAS emissions consistently underestimates ob-
served aerosol mass concentrations by up to a factor of 3 but
gives the best agreement (relative to GFED and FINN) with
observations in the eastern Amazon. Agreement between the
model and observations with GFED and FINN emissions is
more variable, with up to a factor of 2–3 underestimation
or overestimation, depending on the region and time period.
In general, the model with FINN emissions performs well
against observations in the western Amazon in Phase 1 (when
observed aerosol mass concentrations are relatively high) but
gives the largest underestimation of aerosol mass concentra-
tions in the eastern Amazon (relative to GFED and GFAS).
3.3
Aerosol size distribution
Figure 6 compares simulated aerosol size distributions
against those measured on the aircraft during straight and
level runs. In the eastern Amazon, the model underestimates
particle number below 300 nm in diameter, consistent with
aerosol mass comparisons (Sect. 3.2). In the western Ama-
zon, the model with FINN and GFED emissions generally
matches the observed size distribution well above 200 nm in
diameter (N200), with a small underestimate during Phase 1
with GFED (NMBFP1 = −0.52; NMBFP2 = −0.08) and a
small overestimate during Phase 2 with FINN (NMBFP1 =
−0.13; NMBFP2 = 0.39), consistent with the vertical pro-
ﬁles of aerosol mass (Fig. 5). The model with GFAS emis-
sions underestimates throughout the size distribution (e.g.
for N200: NMBFP1 = −1.20; NMBFP2 = −0.45), consistent
with earlier comparisons.
There is a persistent underestimation of aerosol number at
particle sizes below about 100 nm. We assume all biomass
burning emissions are emitted into the accumulation mode
with a geometric mean diameter of 150 nm (Sect. 2.1.1;
Mann et al., 2010), which is substantially higher than ob-
served in the Porto Velho ground station data (94 nm; Brito et
al., 2014). The observations suggest biomass burning makes
a considerable contribution to aerosol number from ∼50 to
200 nm in diameter that is not included in the model. This is
consistent with Vakkari et al. (2018), where assumed emis-
sion size distributions in models poorly represented the num-
ber of particles in the 30–100 nm (Aitken mode) size range
for southern African savanna and grassland ﬁres.

C. L. Reddington et al.: Biomass burning aerosol over the Amazon
Figure 7. Time series of simulated (colour) and observed (black) aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD550) for the SAMBBA campaign
(13 September–3 October 2012) over (a) the western Amazon (6–12◦S, 54–68.5◦W) and (b) the eastern Amazon (4.5–15◦S, 43–50◦W).
Observed AOD550 retrieved by MODIS on board Terra (overpass time 10:30 LT) is shown by the black diamonds and AOD550 retrieved by
MODIS on board Aqua (overpass time 13:30 LT) is shown by the black crosses; the black line shows an average value for each day (plotted at
midday local time). Simulated hourly AOD550 (plotted at local time for Rondônia, Brazil: UTC−4h) is shown for the model with FINN1.5
(green), GFAS1.2 (blue), GFED4 (red) emissions and with no biomass burning emissions (noBBA; orange). The NMBF values are given
separately for the western region (Phase 1 and Phase 2) and eastern region in Table 2.
We performed two sensitivity tests where we varied the as-
sumed emission size distribution for primary biomass burn-
ing aerosol in GLOMAP (Fig. S12). Reid and Hobbs (1998)
measured count median diameters (CMD) of 130 ± 10 nm
(σ = 1.68±0.02) and 100±10 nm (σ = 1.77±0.02) for de-
forestation ﬁres and 100 ± 10 nm (σ = 1.91 ± 0.15) for Cer-
rado ﬁres (Reid et al., 2005). Assuming a CMD of 100 nm
increases the simulated particle number concentration be-
low 100 nm in diameter by factors of ∼1.8 (with σ = 1.7)
and ∼1.5 (with σ = 1.8) over the SAMBBA regions. This
results in a reduction in the negative bias in simulated
number concentration above 50 nm (N50) (GFED, 150 nm,
σ = 1.59: NMBFWestP1 = −1.85; GFED, 100 nm, σ = 1.7:
NMBFWestP1 = −0.51) but a slight increase in the nega-
tive bias in N200 (GFED, 100 nm, σ = 1.7: NMBFWestP1 =
−0.55). Therefore, reducing the assumed emission size dis-
tribution for primary BC and OC from biomass burning may
be important for cloud condensation nuclei concentrations
but will only have a small effect on simulated aerosol mass
and AOD (see Sect. 3.5.1).

compares
simulated
and
satellite-retrieved
(MODIS) AOD at 550 nm (AOD550) over the eastern
and western regions for the SAMBBA campaign period.
Compared to MODIS, the model generally underestimates
AOD550 over both regions and with all ﬁre emission
datasets (NMBF = −2.41 to −0.38; Table 2). The model
with GFAS emissions has the largest underestimation in the
western Amazon (the smallest with FINN) and the model
with FINN emissions has the largest underestimate in the
eastern Amazon (the smallest with GFAS). The model with
FINN emissions underestimates AOD550 in the western
Amazon in Phase 2 even when it overestimates aerosol mass
concentrations throughout the vertical proﬁle. In the eastern
region, the underestimation of AOD550 with all emission
datasets is consistent with the comparison of the vertical
proﬁle of aerosol mass concentration.
Figure 8 compares simulated and observed AOD at 500 nm
(AOD500) at ﬁve AERONET sites across the western and
southern Amazon during SAMBBA (no data are available
from the AERONET station located in the eastern region dur-
ing the campaign). There is reasonable agreement between
AOD500 reported by AERONET and AOD550 reported by
MODIS, with AERONET generally reporting higher values
(Aqua: NMBF = −0.60 to −0.27; Terra: NMBF = −0.47 to
−0.18), partly due to differences in the wavelengths of the
retrievals.
Consistent with comparisons to MODIS, the model gener-
ally underestimates AOD500 at all stations and with all ﬁre
emissions, except at two stations in the western Amazon (Rio
Branco in both campaign phases and Porto Velho in Phase 2)
with FINN emissions. The negative model bias in AOD500
across all AERONET stations is consistent with the nega-
tive model bias in AOD550 (against MODIS) (Table 2) but
is smaller at some individual stations (Fig. 8). This is likely
due to multiple reasons including differences in (i) the AOD
wavelengths (500 nm versus 550 nm), (ii) the AERONET and
MODIS retrieval uncertainties (Sect. S2.3), (iii) the location

Figure 8. Time series of simulated (colour) and observed (black) daily aerosol optical depth (AOD) during the SAMBBA campaign at ﬁve
AERONET stations in the western and southern Amazon: (a) Porto Velho UNIR (8.84◦S, 63.94◦W), (b) Santa Cruz UTEPSA (17.77◦S,
63.20◦W), (c) Cuiabá-Miranda (15.73◦S, 56.02◦W), (d) Rio Branco (9.96◦S, 67.87◦W) and (e) Alta Floresta (9.87◦S, 56.10◦W). Daily
mean AOD at 500 nm (AOD500) from AERONET (black line) is compared to AOD550 retrieved by MODIS (Terra: black diamonds; Aqua:
black crosses), using grid cells nearest to the AERONET station location. Simulated daily mean AOD500 is shown for the model with
FINN1.5 (green), GFAS1.2 (blue), GFED4 (red) emissions and with no biomass burning emissions (noBBA; orange). The NMBF values are

and region of comparison affecting magnitude and sources of
AOD, and (iv) the AERONET and MODIS data coverages.
For all stations, the model with GFAS emissions has the
largest underestimation (Table 2). The ﬁre emission dataset
that gives the smallest model bias varies between GFED and
FINN depending on the station and time period (Phase 1 or
2 of the campaign; Table 2). At Porto Velho, the model with
GFED emissions underestimates AOD500 (NMBF = −0.70;
Table 2) during Phase 2 even when it overestimates aerosol
mass concentrations at the surface (NMBF=0.89; Table 2).
The smallest model bias for all simulations is at Rio Branco
in the western Amazon (e.g. with FINN: NMBFP1 = 0.03,
NMBFP2 = 0.11).
Figure 9 compares average vertical proﬁles of aerosol scat-
tering and extinction coefﬁcients (at 550 nm) measured on
the aircraft to that simulated by GLOMAP. In the west-
ern region, during Phase 1, the model underestimates the
observed scattering coefﬁcient throughout the vertical pro-
ﬁle (NMBF = −1.29 with GFAS to −0.29 with FINN; Ta-
ble 2); consistent with the comparisons against MODIS and
AERONET AOD. During Phase 2, the agreement between
simulated and measured scattering coefﬁcient is more con-
sistent with the vertical proﬁle of aerosol mass concentra-
tions than with MODIS or AERONET AOD, i.e., good agree-
ment with GFAS emissions (NMBF = −0.07) and overesti-
mation with FINN (NMBF = 0.92), respectively. The agree-
ment between simulated and measured extinction coefﬁcient
is similar but with larger negative biases during Phase 1 and
slightly smaller positive biases in Phase 2. In the eastern re-
gion, the model strongly underestimates observed scattering
(NMBF = −3.3 to −1.29) and extinction (NMBF = −3.90
to −1.51) coefﬁcients, consistent with MODIS AOD550
(with larger negative biases than for total aerosol mass con-
centrations).
In summary, the model generally underestimates observed
AOD during the SAMBBA campaign. The negative biases
in simulated AOD and scattering and extinction coefﬁcients
are generally larger than in simulated aerosol size distribu-
tion (> 200 nm in diameter) and in total aerosol mass con-
centrations at the surface (consistent with Reddington et al.,
2016) and aloft, which suggests that model underestimation
of AOD is not solely due to an underestimation of biomass

burning aerosol mass and/or emissions. The calculation of
AOD also depends on aerosol optics and water uptake. We
explore the sensitivity of simulated AOD to these other fac-
tors in the following section.
3.5
Exploring the sensitivity of simulated aerosol
optical depth
In Reddington et al. (2016) we identiﬁed a greater model un-
derestimation of AOD than surface PM2.5 in the Amazon re-
gion, where coincident observations were available, suggest-
ing that the negative model bias in AOD could be caused by
errors in the calculation of AOD rather than by errors in sim-
ulated aerosol properties. However, due to a lack of available
observations, we were unable to rule out errors in simulated
aerosol size distribution and vertical proﬁle (i.e. an underes-
timation of aerosol aloft) with any certainty.
In this work, using the detailed SAMBBA observations,
we have shown that the model represents the vertical proﬁle
of aerosol mass concentrations and aerosol size distribution
well (in the diameter range relevant for visible light) in the
western Amazon, yet continues to underestimate AOD. Be-
low we explore the sensitivity of simulated AOD to the treat-
ment of biomass burning emissions in GLOMAP and to other
relevant aerosol properties including aerosol mixing state, re-
fractive indices and hygroscopicity (summarised in Table 3,
Figs. 10 and S13). To quantify the sensitivity of each simula-
tion we calculate the percentage change of simulated hourly
AOD550 during the SAMBBA campaign relative to simu-
lation 1 in Table 3; the relative changes are summarised in
Fig. 10. Figure S13 summarises the agreement between sim-
ulated and measured optical properties during the SAMBBA
campaign for each simulation in Table 3.

Figure 10. Box-and-whisker plot summarising the relative difference between simulated hourly mean AOD550 from the control simulation
(GFED emissions with ZSR water uptake scheme) and each of the sensitivity simulations listed in Table 3. Simulation numbers in the
ﬁgure correspond to the simulation numbers in Table 3. Simulations are compared during the SAMBBA campaign period (13 September–
3 October 2012) for the western region (6–12◦S, 54–68.5◦W; a) and the eastern region (4.5–15◦S, 43–50◦W; b) separately. Simulations 18,
19 and 20 are compared to the control simulation only on days with available aircraft measurements of RH. Circles show the mean values,
whiskers show the minimum and maximum values, boxes show the 25th and 75th percentiles, and horizontal lines show the median values.
3.5.1
Biomass burning aerosol emission strength,
particle size and injection height
Figure 10 shows that simulated AOD is sensitive to the
ﬁre emission dataset used in the model. Changing between
GFED emissions (simulation 1 in Table 3) and GFAS emis-
sions (simulation 2 in Table 3) changes simulated hourly
AOD550 during the SAMBBA campaign by −14 % on av-
erage in the western region and by +10 % on average in
the eastern region (Fig. 10). Changing from GFED emis-
sions to FINN emissions (simulation 3 in Table 3) increases
simulated AOD550 in the western region (a mean change of
+32 %) and decreases simulated AOD550 in the eastern re-
gion (a mean change of −28 %) (Fig. 10). As discussed in
Sect. 3.4, the model with FINN emissions has the smallest
underestimate against MODIS AOD550 in the western re-
gion (the largest underestimation is with GFAS) but overes-
timates measured scattering and absorption coefﬁcients dur-
ing Phase 2 (Fig. S13). In the eastern region, the model with
GFAS has the smallest underestimate of MODIS AOD550
and aircraft-measured scattering and absorption coefﬁcients
(the largest underestimation is with FINN) (Fig. S13).
Altering the injection height of biomass burning emissions
to the surface level (simulation 4 in Table 3) has an almost
negligible effect on simulated AOD550, with mean changes
of < 1 % in the eastern region (ranging from +6 to −17 %
on the hourly timescale) and −3 % in the western region rela-
tive to the control simulation (Fig. 10). Injecting GFED emis-
sions at the surface results in an increase in the model NMBF
in AOD550 against MODIS in the west (e.g. Phase 1: from
0.97 to −1.03) and a slight reduction in the NMBF in the east
(from −1.44 to −1.42) (Fig. S13).
Reducing the assumed emission size for primary BC and
OC particles from biomass burning (from a CMD of 150
to 100 nm; simulation 5 in Table 3) decreases simulated
AOD550 in both the eastern (−9 %) and western (−13 %)
regions (Fig. 10), consistent with the decrease in simulated
N200 (Sect. 3.3). As a result, the model bias in AOD550
against MODIS is increased relative to the control from
NMBF = −0.97 to −1.28 in the west (Phase 1) and from
NMBF = −1.44 to −1.70 in the east (Fig. S13).
3.5.2
Mixing state
We ﬁnd that simulated AOD is relatively insensitive to the as-
sumption about the aerosol mixing state, with a less than 5 %
difference in the magnitude of AOD550 between internally
mixed (simulation 1; Table 3) and externally mixed (simu-
lation 6; Table 3) cases (consistent with Reddington et al.,
2016). Calculating AOD550 assuming optical properties de-

rived from an external mixture of aerosol species leads to
slightly reduced values (by ∼1 %–4 % – mean reduction in
the west: ∼2 %; mean reduction in the east: ∼1 %; Fig. 10)
when compared to AOD550 calculated assuming an internal
(volumetrically averaged) aerosol mixture (Fig. 10). There-
fore, assuming an internal mixture leads to slightly improved
agreement between simulated and observed AOD over the
external mixture assumption (Fig. S13).
Han et al. (2013) also ﬁnd relatively small changes in
the magnitude of AOD (0.03 to 0.07) in high AOD regions
(∼0.8 to 2.0) between internally and externally mixed cases,
with the internal mixture assumption giving higher values
than the external mixture assumption. Curci et al. (2015) ﬁnd
a greater difference (∼37 %) in simulated AOD between in-
ternally and externally mixed assumptions, with the external
mixed case giving the highest AOD. However, the greater
sensitivity of simulated AOD to the mixing state assumption
in Curci et al. (2015) was primarily due to the difference in
the calculation of the aerosol number size distribution rather
than the difference in the calculated optical properties. The
GLOMAP model simulates both mass and number concen-
tration of each size mode so the total number concentration
stays identical for both mixing state assumptions (in the ex-
ternally mixed case the number concentration of particles in
a given size mode is split between aerosol components based
on the volume fraction of that component in the mode). We
note that the internally mixed case used in this study does not
consider different mixing structure assumptions, i.e. core–
shell internal mixing, which may account for an additional
uncertainty of ∼5 %–10 % in simulated AOD (Curci et al.,
2015).
3.5.3
Refractive index
To investigate the sensitivity of simulated AOD to assump-
tions about the aerosol optical properties, we calculated
AOD550 from the model simulation with GFED emissions
assuming a range of refractive indices appropriate for BC
and POM aerosol (see simulations 7 to 12 in Table 3). We
ﬁnd that the magnitude of simulated AOD550 varies by up
to ∼7 % (relative to the control AOD550) depending on the
choice of refractive indices.
Applying smoke aerosol refractive indices from Matichuk
et al. (2007, 2008) to the model BC and POM components
(simulations 8–10 in Table 3) leads to a small mean decrease
in AOD550 relative to the control (by 2 %–5 % in the eastern
region and 0 %–3 % in the western region; Fig. 10). Assum-
ing medium and highly absorbing refractive indices for BC
from Bond and Bergstrom (2006) (simulation 11 in Table 3)
increases AOD550 by an average of 4 %–6 % in the eastern
region and 2 %–4 % in the western region. Using the highly
absorbing refractive index for BC (simulation 12 “rﬁdx_6”
in Table 3) gives the best agreement between the model and
satellite-retrieved (MODIS) AOD550 out of the refractive in-
dex sensitivity tests (Fig. S13).
The relatively small sensitivity of simulated AOD to as-
sumed aerosol refractive indices is consistent with previous
studies (Matichuk et al., 2007; Curci et al., 2015; Reddington
et al., 2016) and suggests that the negative bias in AOD can-
not be wholly explained by the uncertainty associated with
this assumption.
3.5.4
Aerosol water uptake
Aerosol water uptake plays a signiﬁcant role in determining
AOD, altering the refractive index and the size distribution of
the aerosol. Our estimate of aerosol water uptake depends on
the calculation method (including assumptions made regard-
ing aerosol hygroscopicity; described in Sects. 2.1.2 and S1),
the model relative humidity (from ECMWF reanalyses), and
the simulated aerosol physical and chemical properties (size
distribution and composition).
To test the sensitivity of AOD to the calculation of aerosol
water uptake, we compare AOD550 calculated using two
methods (described in Sect. S1): (1) using ZSR online in the
model (simulation 1 in Table 3) and (2) using the κ-Köhler
water uptake scheme (Petters and Kreidenweis, 2007) of-
ﬂine during post-processing (simulation 13 in Table 3). Our
previous work demonstrated that simulated AOD is sensi-
tive to this calculation, with simulated AOD440 varying by
a factor of ∼1.6 between the upper and lower estimates of
water uptake (Reddington et al., 2016). We ﬁnd the same
here, with AOD550 varying by a mean factor of 1.6 over the
western Amazon and a mean factor of 1.5 over the eastern
Amazon, between the two calculation methods. Using the κ-
Köhler water uptake scheme decreases AOD550 (by 32 %–
39 %; Fig. 10) relative to AOD550 calculated using ZSR,
thus increasing the negative model bias against observations
(Fig. S13).
To explore the sensitivity to assumed κ values, we varied
κ values separately for the sulfate and POM components in
the model. Assuming a higher κ for sulfate (1.19, the same
as for sulfuric acid; Petters and Kreidenweis, 2007, and sim-
ulation 14 “κK_2” in Table 3) results in simulated AOD550
being 26 % and 33 % lower on average than ZSR in the east-
ern and western regions, respectively (Fig. 10). Assuming a
higher κ for both sulfate (1.19) and for POM (0.2) (simu-
lation 15 “κK_3” in Table 3) results in simulated AOD550
being 23 %–25 % lower than ZSR on average (Fig. 10). Fig-
ure S14 shows the change in simulated AOD550 due to as-
suming different κ values for sulfate and POM relative to the
simulation using the κ-Köhler water uptake scheme with κ
of 0.53 for sulfate and 0.1 for POM (simulation 1 “κK_1”
in Table 3). Using high κ values for both sulfate and for
POM (simulation 15 “κK_3” in Table 3) increases simu-
lated AOD550 on average by 12 %–23 %, improving agree-
ment with MODIS AOD550, relative to simulation “κK_1”
(Fig. S13). However, these high κ values are likely to be un-
realistically high for biomass burning aerosol (particularly

9144
C. L. Reddington et al.: Biomass burning aerosol over the Amazon
for sulfate) and, despite this, the model bias remains nega-
tive.
The higher AOD550 values calculated using the ZSR
scheme can be explained by the steeper hygroscopic growth
curve for biomass burning aerosol (at ambient relative hu-
midity, RH, < 90 %) when calculated with the GLOMAP
ZSR scheme compared with the κ-Köhler scheme (see
Fig. 13 of Johnson et al., 2016). At ambient RH above 90 %
the opposite is true, with a steeper growth curve for the κ-
Köhler scheme (due to the RH restriction of 90 % applied
in GLOMAP for ZSR; see Sect. S1.1). However, the model
RH stays below 90 % during the SAMBBA campaign (see
Sect. 3.5.5). We note that AOD simulated with ZSR (assum-
ing sulfuric acid and high water uptake for organics) is likely
to be an upper estimate for water uptake. Our results conﬁrm
the large uncertainty present in the simulated AOD due to
aerosol hygroscopicity.
3.5.5
Relative humidity
In Reddington et al. (2016), we discussed the potential sen-
sitivity of simulated AOD to errors in ambient RH. In this
work we are able to evaluate the model relative humid-
ity against SAMBBA aircraft observations. The model cap-
tures the shape of the mean proﬁle of observed relative hu-
midity in both the western and eastern regions (NMBF =
−0.03), with small overestimates and underestimates in the
BL in the western and eastern regions, respectively (western
BL: NMBF = 0.10; eastern BL: NMBF = −0.05) (Fig. S15).
However, the model underestimates the variability in ob-
served RH above ∼1.5 km altitude in the west and below
∼4 km altitude in the east. In particular, in the western re-
gion, the model does not capture the elevated observed RHs
(≥90 %), which disproportionately affect aerosol water up-
take and hygroscopic growth. This underestimation is likely
due to the relatively coarse vertical and horizontal resolu-
tion of the model. A recent study by Haslett et al. (2019)
found that high AODs observed by AERONET in southern
West Africa could only be recreated by accounting for very
elevated and variable RHs in the BL. They found that hu-
mid layers had a signiﬁcant impact on AOD (particularly for
RH > 98 %), resulting in a wet AOD more than 1.8 times the
dry AOD (Haslett et al., 2019). This suggests that inadequate
representation of sub-grid variability of RH may contribute
to the model discrepancy in AOD.
To explore the sensitivity of model AOD to variability
in RH, we forced the model RH to match either the mean
or maximum observed RH in each vertical model level (on
days with available aircraft data) and calculated the resulting
water uptake using the κ-Köhler scheme (with κPOM = 0.1;
κSO4 = 0.53; simulations 18–20 in Table 3). These sensitivity
tests have mixed results on simulated AOD (see Figs. 10 and
S14). Setting the model RH to the mean observed RH in each
vertical level (simulation 18 “κK_RH” in Table 3) results in
a small mean increase in simulated AOD550 in the east (by
∼11 %) and small mean decrease in the west (by ∼8 %) rel-
ative to AOD550 calculated using κ-Köhler and GLOMAP
RH (simulation 13 “κK_1” in Table 3; see Fig. S13). Setting
the model RH to the maximum observed RH in each ver-
tical level (with a restriction of RH ≤99 %; simulation 20
“κK_RHmax99” in Table 3) increases model AOD550 (by
∼58 %–87 % on average; Fig. S14) improving agreement
with MODIS AOD550 (Fig. S13) but leads to overestima-
tion of the observed aerosol scattering and extinction coefﬁ-
cients between 4 and 6 km altitude. Using the maximum ob-
served RH but with a restriction of RH ≤96 % (simulation
19 “κK_RHmax96” in Table 3) increases by ∼20 %–58 %
on average, improving agreement with MODIS AOD550 rel-
ative to simulation “κK_1” (Fig. S13) and maintains good
agreement with the relative vertical proﬁles of the scatter-
ing and extinction coefﬁcients. However, the negative bias in
AOD550 remains larger than for total aerosol mass concen-
trations (Table 2).
Although these sensitivity tests do not resolve the model
discrepancy in model AOD, they demonstrate the large sen-
sitivity of simulated AOD to the magnitude and variability
of RH and that changes in RH can be important for simu-
lated AOD even at RH < 90 % (for instance, in the eastern
region). Improving model representation of RH variability
while using an upper estimate for water uptake (e.g. the on-
line ZSR scheme in GLOMAP) would likely bring the model
bias in AOD more in-line with that of total aerosol mass con-
centration but this would require thorough testing in a high-
resolution model.
3.5.6
Model spatial resolution
The relatively coarse spatial resolution of the simulated
aerosol and relative humidity (Sect. 3.5.5) ﬁelds may also
contribute to the model underestimation of AOD, due to
underestimation of sub-grid variability (e.g. Weigum et al.,
2016). Increasing model spatial resolution has been shown
to increase simulated AOD by ∼11 %–13 % (Bian et al.,
2009; Weigum et al., 2016), depending on the initial and al-
tered grid resolutions. However, we note that comparisons
between simulated and aircraft observed aerosol mass con-
centrations suggest that the model captures observed spatial
variations in aerosol mass concentrations reasonably well for
the SAMBBA period, at least over the western Amazon re-
gion.
Model spatial resolution will also affect the model–
measurement sampling uncertainty, which can be up to 50 %
for hourly time resolution data (e.g. Schutgens et al., 2016a,
2017; Reddington et al., 2017). In our analysis we have
strived to reduce spatial and temporal sampling errors as
much as possible by (1) running the model and using anal-
ysed meteorology for the same time period as the observa-
tions, (2) temporally co-locating model and measurement
data points, removing time periods with missing or invalid
measurement points from the model data (as discussed in
Atmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 9125–9152, 2019
www.atmos-chem-phys.net/19/9125/2019/

C. L. Reddington et al.: Biomass burning aerosol over the Amazon
9145
Schutgens et al., 2016b) (and temporal averaging for bias
calculations and comparisons with aircraft measurements),
and (3) spatially co-locating model data to observational data
points using interpolation (and spatial averaging for compar-
isons with aircraft and MODIS observations). For compar-
isons with aircraft measurements, we have also attempted
to reduce measurement representativeness error by removing
in-plume and in-cloud sampling from the data where pos-
sible. We estimate remaining model–measurement sampling
uncertainty to be up to ∼30 %, corresponding to monthly
average model–measurement comparisons (Schutgens et al.,
2016a). A higher-resolution model would be required to ac-
curately quantify the model–measurement sampling uncer-
tainty for this speciﬁc analysis and to explore the degree
of sensitivity of AOD to the spatial resolution of simulated
aerosol and relative humidity ﬁelds in detail.
3.6
Summary of AOD sensitivity simulations and
uncertainties
Simulated AOD varies by more than a factor of 2 across the
different sensitivity simulations (Figs. 10 and S14). The dif-
ferent emission inventories change simulated AOD by up to
approximately ±30 %. Altering assumed refractive indices
changes simulated AOD by less than 8 % and assumptions
about external mixing change simulated AOD by less than
2 %. Changes to assumptions controlling aerosol water up-
take change simulated AOD by up to −40 % (for assump-
tions regarding the water uptake calculation scheme) and up
to +20 % (for assumptions regarding the hygroscopicity pa-
rameter, κ). Uncertainty in the variability of RH changed
simulated AOD by up to +87 %. This analysis suggests that
the largest uncertainties in simulated AOD are associated
with uncertainty in aerosol water uptake and model repre-
sentation of relative humidity.
For the magnitude of AOD observed during the SAMBBA
campaign, the uncertainty in the retrievals of AOD are ap-
proximately ±30 % for MODIS AOD550 and < 10 % for
AERONET AOD500 (see Sects. 2.3.5 and S2). Although
the uncertainties in AOD retrievals are important to consider,
they are smaller than the uncertainties associated with simu-
lated biomass burning aerosol properties and AOD.

Conclusions
We have used surface, aircraft and satellite observations
made during the SAMBBA ﬁeld campaign in the southern
Amazon during September and October 2012 to improve
our understanding of biomass burning emissions. We ap-
ply three different biomass burning emission datasets (FINN,
GFAS, GFED) in the GLOMAP global aerosol model. In
ﬁre-impacted regions of the Amazon, total annual aerosol
emissions from ﬁres (averaged over 2002–2012) vary by up
to a factor of 2.4 across these datasets, highlighting the large
uncertainty in aerosol emissions from ﬁres. In 2012, annual
aerosol ﬁre emissions were 4 %–47 % lower than the 2002–
2012 mean in the western Amazon but 30–96 % greater than
the long-term mean in the eastern Amazon. This reﬂects de-
clining deforestation rate and associated ﬁres in the western
Amazon over this period (Reddington et al., 2015) and op-
posing trends in ﬁres in the eastern Amazon (Andela et al.,
2017).
During 2012, observed surface PM2.5 concentrations in the
southern Amazon increased from ∼2 µgm−3 between Jan-
uary and July to 30–50 µgm−3 in September, then declined
to less than 10 µgm−3 in October. Observed aerosol mass
(in the 75–650 nm in diameter size range) in September was
dominated by OA, which accounted for 84 % of total mass
with BC accounting for 9 % of mass. The model reproduced
the observed seasonal cycle of aerosol concentrations, with
∼54 %–78 % of simulated PM2.5 concentrations originating
from ﬁre emissions during September 2012. Fires are the
dominant source of PM2.5 across the region during the dry
season.
In the western Amazon, where deforestation ﬁres are the
dominant ﬁre type, agreement between simulated and ob-
served aerosol mass concentrations in the BL is variable,
depending on the ﬁre emission dataset used both for OA
(NMBF = −1.6 to +1.2) and BC (NMBF = −1.5 to +0.6).
In this region we do not ﬁnd evidence that aerosol emis-
sions are systematically underestimated across all emission
datasets. In the eastern Amazon, where grassland and sa-
vanna ﬁres are dominant, GLOMAP underestimates OA
(NMBF = −0.9 to −3.1) and BC (NMBF = −1.5 to −6.1)
concentrations with all three emission datasets. This sug-
gests that all emission datasets may underestimate aerosol
emissions from grassland and savanna ﬁres in the eastern
Amazon, although we acknowledge the limited measurement
sampling in this region relative to the western Amazon. We
assume ﬁre emissions have an OA : OC ratio of 1.4. Increas-
ing our OA : OC ratio to 2.3, towards the upper end of that
used in models (Tsigaridis et al., 2014), and matching aged
aerosol observed in SAMBBA (Johnson et al., 2016), would
improve the model–observation OA comparison in the east-
ern Amazon but would lead to an overestimate of OA in the
western Amazon in some periods.
Comparisons of the simulated particle number size distri-
bution against aircraft observations revealed a persistent un-
derestimation of number concentrations of particles smaller
than ∼100 nm in diameter. Reducing the assumed emission
size of primary carbonaceous aerosol in the model improved
agreement with observed number concentrations of particles
less than 100 nm in diameter but increased the negative bias
in simulated AOD. Assuming a bimodal emission size dis-
tribution for primary biomass burning aerosol may solve the
model discrepancy in particle number concentrations below
∼100 nm in diameter while retaining the simulated accumu-
lation mode of biomass burning aerosol. Model underestima-
tion of particle number concentration of particles less than

C. L. Reddington et al.: Biomass burning aerosol over the Amazon
100 nm will have implications for simulation of cloud con-
densation nuclei concentrations and simulated aerosol–cloud
interactions.
Observed vertical proﬁles of aerosol mass concentrations
were characterised by enhanced concentrations from the sur-
face up to around 2 km altitude in the western Amazon and
4 km altitude in the eastern Amazon. In our model, we as-
sume that all emissions from vegetation ﬁres in this region
are injected below 3 km altitude, with ∼80 % of emissions
injected below 1 km. The model simulated a realistic rela-
tive vertical proﬁle of aerosol mass concentrations, suggest-
ing that our assumptions about injection height are valid. Our
results further conﬁrm that Amazon ﬁres rarely inject emis-
sions above the BL, as found by previous studies (Archer-
Nicholls et al., 2015, Marenco et al., 2016).
The model generally underestimates AOD across the
Amazon both in comparison to AERONET (NMBF = −1.3
to −0.4) and MODIS (NMBF = −2.4 to −0.4). In the east-
ern Amazon, the underestimation of aerosol mass concentra-
tions through the vertical proﬁle contributes to this under-
estimation of AOD. In the western Amazon, the model un-
derestimates AOD even when the vertical proﬁle of aerosol
mass concentration is either well predicted or overestimated.
This suggests that underestimation of AOD may be due to
uncertainties in the calculation of AOD, rather than under-
estimation of aerosol mass concentrations. To explore this
possibility we tested the impact of uncertainty in refractive
index, aerosol mixing state, aerosol water uptake and rela-
tive humidity on model AOD. We found that simulated AOD
was most sensitive to assumptions about water uptake and
the model representation of variability in relative humidity,
leading to an average uncertainty range in simulated AOD of
approximately −40 % to +90 %.
Overall, our work suggests that aerosol emissions from
ﬁres are on average underestimated over the Amazon, partic-
ularly over grassland and savanna ﬁres in the eastern Ama-
zon, albeit by less than the factor of ∼3–5 assumed in some
previous studies. Conﬁrming our previous work (Redding-
ton et al., 2016), we ﬁnd that simulated and observed aerosol
mass concentrations are generally in better agreement than
simulated and observed AOD. We show that the model un-
derestimates AOD even when it reproduces the observed ver-
tical proﬁle of aerosol mass. This suggests that uncertainties
in the calculation of AOD, rather than the aerosol mass con-
centration, are the dominant reason for underestimation of
AOD, and we ﬁnd the largest sensitivity to uncertainty in
water uptake and model representation of relative humidity
variability. We therefore caution against using comparison
with AOD to scale particulate emissions from ﬁres, as has
been done in a number of previous studies.
