Apoptosis inhibition is a critical strategy of mycobacteria facilitating its survival in
macrophages, but the underlying mechanism is not completely understood. In this
study, we found that Rv3033, a secreted virulence factor of mycobacteria, played
an important role in bacillary survival within macrophages. Forced over-expressed
of Rv3033 in macrophages could efﬁciently resist mycobacteria-induced early and
late apoptosis, accompanied with the obvious increased cellular bacterial burden. By
exploring the underlying mechanism, we found that Rv3033 efﬁciently repressed the
intrinsic (caspase-9 meditated), but not the extrinsic (caspase-8 mediated) apoptotic
pathway in mycobacteria-infected macrophages. And this repression relied on the
orchestrating blockade of both mitochondrial cytochrome c release and endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress PERK branch activation. Our study uncovered a novel function of
mycobacterial virulence factor Rv3033 as an anti-apoptotic protein, which may provide
a new target for tuberculosis (TB) treatment.

INTRODUCTION
Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by the intracellular pathogen mycobacteria,
which results in 1.7 million deaths and 6.3 million new cases annually worldwide (1).
Mycobacteria infection has become increasingly severe due to the increasingly mobile population,
the emergence of drug-resistant mycobacteria strains, and the epidemic of co-infection with HIV
(2).
As the ﬁrst line of host defense, macrophages are key immune cells in resistance against
mycobacteria (3–5). Long-term struggling with macrophages, mycobacteria has developed various
immune modulation strategies to facilitate its survival (6). Among them, inhibiting apoptosis
is one of the major mechanisms (7–9). For example, virulence factors, such as SodA, NuoG,
Eis, and Rv3364c, have been found to potently inhibit host cell apoptosis by blocking either
the TNF-α-mediated pathway or the mitochondria pathway (10–14), and these virulence factors
represent the possible targets for future prophylactic and therapeutic regimes. Therefore,
identiﬁcation of new virulence factors that could potently alter macrophage apoptosis has becoming
a hot spot in the ﬁeld of anti-tuberculosis work.
In 2005, Rengarajan and colleagues screened a genome-wide mycobacteria transposon mutant
library and established several candidate factors that are essential for mycobacteria survival in

macrophages (15). Based on their work, we screened four
secreted proteins, Rv0928, Rv1096, Rv3033, and Rv3369, and
assessed their eﬀects on macrophage apoptosis. Interestingly, we
found that Rv3033 had a robust inhibitory eﬀect on macrophage
apoptosis. Herein, we tried to elucidate Rv3033 anti-apoptotic
eﬀect and the corresponding mechanism in the context of
mycobacteria infection.
In this study, we found that Rv3033 had higher expression
in the virulent strain H37Rv than the avirulent strain BCG
and H37Ra, could suppress mycobacteria-induced macrophage
apoptosis and enhance the bacillary survival. In addition, this
inhibitory eﬀect relied on the repressing intrinsic apoptosis by
orchestrating blockade of mitochondrial cytochrome c release
and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress PERK branch activation.
In conclusion, this study revealed the anti-apoptosis role of
Rv3033 in mycobacteria-infected macrophages, and modulating
Rv3033 expression might represent a new therapeutic target for
controlling TB.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells, Mice, and Bacteria Culture
RAW264.7 and HEK293T cells (ATCC) were cultured in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM, Sigma-Aldrich)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM
L-glutamine, and 1% penicillin- streptomycin. Cells were
cultured in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37◦C and 5% CO2.
Mice were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China).All
animal-related
experimental
procedures
were
performed
in accordance with the guidelines for the Care and Use
of Laboratory Animals (Ministry of Health, China, 1998).
The guidelines were approved by the Ethics Committee of
Soochow University. BMDMs were prepared as previously
described (16). Brieﬂy, femurs and tibias from C57B6/C
mice were dissected, and bone marrow were ﬂushed out.
The isolated cells were ﬁltered through a nylon mesh and
plated in RPMI 1640 containing M-CSF, 10% FBS, 2 mM
L-glutamine, 1% penicillin- streptomycin for 6 days. The
purity of BMDMs was >90% as determined by FACS analysis
using FITC-conjugated anti-F4/80 monoclonal antibody (BD
Biosciences)
and
PE-conjugated
anti-CD11b
monoclonal
antibody (BD Biosciences).The M. tuberculosis strains BCG
(ATCC35733), H37Ra and H37Rv were grown in Middlebrook
7H9 broth medium supplemented with 10% ADC, 0.5%
glycerol, and 0.05%Tween-80 at 37◦C. M. smegmatis mc2155
(Ms), Ms::Vector, Ms::Rv0928, Ms::Rv1096, Ms::Rv3033, and
Ms::Rv3369 were grown in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented
with 0.05% Tween-80.
BCG, H37Ra, and H37Rv Pellets Isolation
For mycobacterial pellets isolation, BCG, H37Ra, and H37Rv
were ﬁrst grown in 7H9 medium to mid-log phase and then sub-
cultured into the 7H9 media at a starting OD600 of 0.1. Cultures
were harvested when they reached an OD600 of 1.0 and were
centrifugation at 8200∗g for 15 min to generate pellets isolation,
then were denatured by heating for 30 min at 100◦C.
Cloning and Expression of Rv0928, Rv1096,
Rv3033, and Rv3369
The
construction
of
recombinant
strains
was
performed
using Ms. The Rv0928, Rv1096, Rv3033 and Rv3369 genes
(Tuberculist database) were cloned into the pMV261 vector in
frame with a C-terminal ﬂag-tag. All constructed gene were
electroporated into Ms. The selected pMV261 (MS::Vector) and
pMV261-Rv0928, Rv1096, Rv3033, and Rv3369 (Ms::Rv0928,
Ms::Rv1096, Ms::Rv3033, and Ms::Rv3369) were cultured in
Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 0.05%Tween-80
containing 50 µg/ml kanamycin. These recombinant strains were
identiﬁed by western blot using an anti-ﬂag antibody. The

RESULTS
Different Apoptosis Levels and Consequent
Distinct Bacillary Loads Were Evidenced in
H37Rv- and BCG-Infected Macrophages
Macrophage line RAW264.7 cells were infected with distinct
virulent mycobacteria (virulent H37Rv or avirulent BCG) for
24 h, and cell death was evaluated by CCK8, TUNEL, and
western blot assays. As shown in Figures 1A–D, fewer apoptosis
occurred in H37Rv-infected macrophages compared with the
counterpart infected with BCG, reﬂected by the lower apoptotic
cell percentage (50 vs. 15%) and active caspase-3 level, and
this limited apoptosis led to the better bacillary replication in
H37Rv-infected macrophages, as a much higher bacillary load
was observed in H37Rv-infected macrophages compared with
the counterpart infected with BCG. Meanwhile, the bacillary
survival was also signiﬁcantly increased in ZVAD-pretreated
group, due to the obviously decreased macrophage apoptosis
(Figure 1E).

Apoptosis Induced by Mycobacteria
Infection
Mycobacterial

factors
play
signiﬁcant
roles
in
promoting mycobacteria survival in macrophages (11, 12, 17–
23). Rengarajan et al. (15) identiﬁed several genes that
support mycobacteria survival in macrophages by screening
a
genome-wide
mycobacteria
transposon
mutant
library.
Based on their work, here we focused on four secreted
factors, Rv0928, Rv1096, Rv3033 and Rv3369, and tried
to explore their inﬂuence on macrophage apoptosis. By
overexpressing these four genes in M. smegmatis individually,
we found that compared with other recombinant bacteria,
Rv3033 possessed the most potential anti-apoptotic function,
evidenced by the lowest macrophage apoptosis level post
M.

infection
(Figure 2A).
We
also
evaluated
the
apoptotic
ration
of
primary
murine
macrophages
(bone
marrow-derived
macrophages,

post
Rv3033-expressing Ms (Ms:: Rv3033) infection. Compared
with
the
control
group
(Ms::Vector-infected
BMDMs),
Ms::Rv3033-infected
BMDMs
showed
much
lower
total
(AnnexinV+,27%vs13%), early (AnnexinV+/PI−, 15%vs7%)
as well as late (AnnexinV+/PI+,12%vs6%) apoptotic rations
(Figures 2B,C), indicating the obviously decreased apoptosis.
Consistently, we found that Rv3033 expression level in BCG
was comparable with that in H37Ra, both of them were much
lower than that in H37Rv (Figures 2D,E), further suggesting
the anti-apoptosis role of Rv3033 in mycobacteria-infected
macrophages.
Rv3033 Decreased Mycobacteria-Infected
Macrophage Apoptosis and Promoted
Bacillary Survival
To further conﬁrm the Rv3033 anti-apoptosis eﬀects, RAW264.7
cells
stably
over-expressing
Rv3033
(RAW-Rv3033)
were
established. Following infected with BCG, the apoptotic cell
percentages were assessed by Annexin V /7-AAD staining
assay. As shown in Figure 3A, compared with the control
group (RAW-Vector), infected RAW-Rv3033 cells showed
obvious lower apoptotic cell percentages (50 vs. 30%), of note,
both the early and late apoptotic cell percentages obviously
decreased, indicating that the Rv3033-mediated anti-apoptosis
eﬀect occurs at the early stage. This decreased apoptosis was
also detected in H37Ra-infected RAW-Rv3033 cells (Figure 3B).
And active caspase-3 was signiﬁcantly decreased in RAW-
Rv3033 cells compared with RAW-Vector cells post H37Ra
and H37Rv infection (Figure 3C). In addition, these data were
further supported by the high-throughput next generation
sequencing data, in which Rv3033 overexpression resulted in
the alteration of multiple apoptosis-associated gene expression
(Figure 3D). Accordingly, RAW-Rv3033 cells had signiﬁcantly
increased bacillary burdens compared to RAW-Vector cells
(Figure 3E).
Rv3033 Suppressed Mycobacteria-Infected
Macrophage Apoptosis by Inhibiting the
Intrinsic but Not Extrinsic Apoptotic
Pathway
Apoptosis could be caused by two main pathways: caspase-9-
mediated intrinsic pathway and caspase-8-mediated extrinsic
pathway, both of which have been reported to be activated
post mycobacteria infection (7). These two pathways ﬁnally
converge on caspase-3 activation and ultimately lead to apoptotic
DNA fragmentation via cleaving several target proteins. Herein,
we found that active caspase-3 was signiﬁcantly decreased
in RAW-Rv3033 cells compared with RAW-Vector cells,
indicative of a lower apoptosis level, which was consistent
with our FACS data (Figures 4A,B, 3A). When detected
the activation of upstream apoptosis pathways, we found
that intrinsic apoptosis molecules (both cleaved caspase-9
and cleaved caspase-12) were obviously reduced in RAW-
Rv3033
cells,
while
extrinsic
apoptotic
factor
caspase-8
activation was not aﬀected (Figures 4C–E), indicating that
Rv3033 inhibited the intrinsic but not the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway.

Rv3033 Inhibited Macrophage Intrinsic Apoptosis
Rv3033 Inhibition on Intrinsic Apoptosis
Was Mediated by Blocking the
Mitochondrial as Well as ER Stress PERK
Branch Pathway
Cytochrome c release from mitochondria to cytosol is a
canonical trigger for intrinsic apoptosis. To verify whether
Rv3033 aﬀected mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic apoptosis after
mycobacteria infection, we tested the translocation of the
mitochondrial apoptosis-related markers Bax and cytochrome c
from the mitochondria to cytosol. As shown in Figures 5A,B,
more obvious accumulation cytoplasm Bax were seen in
mycobacteria-infected RAW-Rv3033 cells compared to control
cells, indicating that Rv3033 inhibited Bax entering into
the mitochondria. Consistently, obvious lower cytochrome c
translocation from mitochondria to cytosol were observed in
mycobacteria-infected RAW-Rv3033 cells compared to control
cells, suggesting a lower apoptosis-inducing status of the
mitochondria (Figure 5C). These data demonstrated that Rv3033
could prevent mitochondrial-mediated intrinsic apoptosis in
mycobacteria-infected macrophages.
Several studies have indicated that intrinsic apoptosis could
also be mediated by ER stress after mycobacteria infection
(21, 24–27). Therefore, we investigated whether Rv3033 aﬀected
ER stress-mediated apoptosis. As shown in Figure 5D, ER
stress inhibition by tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA, a bile
acid acting as a potent chemical chaperone that inhibited
ER stress) treatment could robustly decrease the RAW-Vector
apoptosis (50–30%), indicating that ER stress was involved

Rv3033 Inhibited Macrophage Intrinsic Apoptosis
in mycobacteria-induced macrophage apoptosis. While this
phenomenon was absent in RAW-Rv3033 cells. In support
of these data, no obvious altered apoptosis were occurred
when RAW-Rv3033 were treated with PERK pathway inhibitor
(salubrinal) neither (Figure 5E), indicating that ER stress,
especially PERK branch-mediated apoptosis was inhibited
in Rv3033-over-expressing macrophages compared with the
control cells following mycobacteria infection. In consistent
with it, we also detected the lower expression of two critical
factors of the PERK pathway (p-eIF2α and Chop) both
in mycobacteria infection and tunicamycin (Tm, a classical
ER stress inducer by inhibiting the synthesis of N-linked
glycoproteins)-treated (Figures 5F–J). All of these data showed
that Rv3033 could suppress intrinsic apoptosis by simultaneously
blocking mitochondrial-mediated and ER stress PERK branch-
mediated pathways.
DISCUSSION
TB is a highly infectious disease that has become a major
threat to public health. Currently, although a cocktail of ﬁrst-
line drugs, including isoniazid (INH), rifampin, pyrazinamide
(PZA), and ethambutol are eﬀective during the active phase
of TB infections (28), the eﬀective treatments for latent
infection are still limited which are partly due to the
superb immune evasion abilities. In the long-term evolution,
mycobacteria adopts several immune evasion strategies to
convert macrophages from immune clearance to immune
sanctuary (including inhibiting apoptosis, blocking autophagy
and modulating inﬂammation) to facilitate bacillary growth and
survival (9). Among them, modulating macrophage apoptosis
is an important defense mechanism, but the detailed processes
and the corresponding mechanisms remain unclear. To date,
exploring and identifying novel potent mycobacterial proteins
possessing macrophage apoptosis modulation ability attract more
and more attention.
Rv3033, a 19 kDa mycobacterial protein, was ﬁrst identiﬁed
by the complete mycobacteria genomic sequencing in 1998
(29), while its function remained unknown until 2005 when
suggested as a possible candidate to facilitate mycobacteria
survival in macrophages. In this study, we detailedly explored
the exact role of Rv3033 in mycobacteria-infected macrophages
and tried to decipher the corresponding mechanisms. Firstly,
we screened four mycobacterial secreted proteins (Rv0928,
Rv1096,
Rv3033,
and
Rv3369).
By
overexpressing
these
genes in M. smegmatis individually, we found that Rv3033
behaved as the most potent macrophage apoptosis inhibitor
and
could
potently
facilitating
intracellular
mycobacteria
survival.
Apoptosis can be induced by extrinsic (caspase-8 mediated)
and intrinsic (caspase-9 mediated) pathways, which all play
eﬀective roles in eliminating mycobacteria in macrophages
(7, 11–13, 30). For example, mycobacteria infection promoted
TNF-α
production,
which
induced
macrophage
extrinsic
apoptosis by binding to TNFR1 and limited bacillary survival.
Accordingly, mycobacteria have adopted a serial of bacterial
proteins
to
inhibit
the
macrophage
extrinsic
apoptosis.
Miller et al. reported that mycobacterial virulence factor
NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain G (NuoG) decreased
TNF-α-mediated extrinsic apoptosis by neutralizing NOX2-
derived ROS production (12). Danelishvili et al. found that
mycobacterial Rv3654c suppressed caspase-8-mediated extrinsic
apoptosis via binding to protein-associated splicing factor (PSF)
in macrophages (18). While, in this study, Rv3033 barely changed
the activation extent of the extrinsic apoptosis in mycobacteria-
infected macrophages, indicating that it highly possibly fact on
the intrinsic apoptosis pathway.
The canonical intrinsic apoptosis is relied on mitochondrial
release of pro-apoptotic factor cytochrome c and apoptosis
inducing factor (AIF). Following interacting with the apoptotic
protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), cytochrome c drives the
apoptosome assembly and caspase-9 activation, leading to
apoptotic DNA fragmentation via cleaving several target proteins
(31). To oppose this hostile cellular process, mycobacterial
virulence factors, such as PtpA, MPT64, and GroEL2 have been
found to inhibit mycobacteria-infected macrophage apoptosis
by repressing caspase-9-mediated intrinsic pathway. Poirier
et al. (32) showed that mycobacterial PtpA inhibited intrinsic
apoptosis by dephosphorylating host GSK3α. Wang et al.
(33)
found
that
mycobacterial
protein
MPT64
repressed
macrophage apoptosis through NF-kB-miRNA21-Bcl-2 pathway.
Joseph et al. (34) reported that Cpn60.2 (GroEL2) disturbed
macrophage mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis via interacting
with mortalin. In this study, we found that the Rv3033
over-expression could notably decrease intrinsic apoptosis
molecule caspase-9 activation and led to the lower survival of
mycobacteria-infected macrophage as well as higher bacterial
loads.
Besides of mitochondrial pathway, recently ER stress is also
found as a novel apoptosis pathway in mycobacteria-infected
macrophages (25, 27, 35). ER stress mainly activates three
pathways: IRE1, PERK, and ATF6. Among them, the PERK
pathway is the major pathway that induces cell apoptosis and
eliminates mycobacteria (26). To date, several experiments have
demonstrated that mycobacterial proteins (ESAT-6, 38-kDa,
PPE32, HBHA) are involved in ER stress-mediated apoptosis
(21–23, 36). Interestingly, all of these virulence factors have
been proved to increase ER stress-mediated apoptosis in
mycobacteria-infected macrophages. Few mycobacterial protein
functions as a repressor of ER stress-mediated apoptosis has
been shown. Fortunately, herein we found that unlike the
previously identiﬁed ER stress apoptosis-promoting protein,
virulent Rv3033 protein could potently inhibit the expression
of the ER stress PERK branch marker protein Bip/GRP78, p-
eIF2α, Chop, and caspase-12, demonstrating that in addition
to repressing the canonical (mitochondrial-mediated) intrinsic
apoptosis pathway, Rv3033 could also simultaneously suppress
the novel ER stress-(PERK-eIF2a-Chop-) mediated intrinsic
apoptosis. This further emphasized the important role of Rv3033
in favoring intracellular bacillary survival, as compared with
the most identiﬁed apoptosis-inhibiting virulence proteins which
usually acts on solo apoptosis pathway, Rv3033 could more
widely repress intrinsic apoptosis by orchestrating blockade of

mitochondrial cytochrome c release and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress PERK branch activation.
In conclusion, we identiﬁed a novel function of the
mycobacterial virulence factor Rv3033 as facilitating latent
infection
by
inhibiting
macrophage
intrinsic
apoptosis.
This function relied on simultaneously blockade of both
mitochondrial cytochrome c release and endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress PERK branch activation. This might make Rv3033
as a more promising therapeutic target to control the latent
mycobacteria infection.
