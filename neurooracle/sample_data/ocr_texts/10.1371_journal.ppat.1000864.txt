Abstract
The capacity of infected cells to undergo apoptosis upon insult with a pathogen is an ancient innate immune defense
mechanism. Consequently, the ability of persisting, intracellular pathogens such as the human pathogen Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) to inhibit infection-induced apoptosis of macrophages is important for virulence. The nuoG gene of Mtb,
which encodes the NuoG subunit of the type I NADH dehydrogenase, NDH-1, is important in Mtb-mediated inhibition of
host macrophage apoptosis, but the molecular mechanism of this host pathogen interaction remains elusive. Here we show
that the apoptogenic phenotype of MtbDnuoG was significantly reduced in human macrophages treated with caspase-3
and -8 inhibitors, TNF-a-neutralizing antibodies, and also after infection of murine TNF2/2 macrophages. Interestingly,
incubation of macrophages with inhibitors of reactive oxygen species (ROS) reduced not only the apoptosis induced by the
nuoG mutant, but also its capacity to increase macrophage TNF-a secretion. The MtbDnuoG phagosomes showed increased
ROS levels compared to Mtb phagosomes in primary murine and human alveolar macrophages. The increase in MtbDnuoG
induced ROS and apoptosis was abolished in NOX-2 deficient (gp912/2) macrophages. These results suggest that Mtb, via a
NuoG-dependent mechanism, can neutralize NOX2-derived ROS in order to inhibit TNF-a-mediated host cell apoptosis.
Consistently, an Mtb mutant deficient in secreted catalase induced increases in phagosomal ROS and host cell apoptosis,
both of which were dependent upon macrophage NOX-2 activity. In conclusion, these results serendipitously reveal a novel
connection between NOX2 activity, phagosomal ROS, and TNF-a signaling during infection-induced apoptosis in
macrophages. Furthermore, our study reveals a novel function of NOX2 activity in innate immunity beyond the initial
respiratory burst, which is the sensing of persistent intracellular pathogens and subsequent induction of host cell apoptosis
as a second line of defense.

Introduction
The phagocytic NADPH-oxidase (NOX2-complex or phox)
resides on phagosomes and has been shown to be involved in
microcidal activity in phagocytes. NOX2 is the original member
of the NOX family of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-generating
NADPH oxidases, which now includes NOX1-NOX5, DUOX1
and DUOX2 [1,2]. The multicomponent NOX2 complex
consists of two transmembrane proteins, gp91phox and gp22 phox,
and three cytosolic components, p40
phox, p47 phox and p67 phox
[1,2]. Additionally, the cytosolic GTPase Rac has to be recruited
in order to form a fully active NOX2 complex [1]. The gp91phox
subunit, which is constitutively associated with gp22 phox, is a
transmembrane redox chain that generates phagosomal superox-
ide by transferring electrons from cytosolic NADPH to phagoso-
mal oxygen [1]. NOX2-generated superoxide can then be
converted into a multitude of microcidal oxidants, including
hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorous acid, which are important
components of the bactericidal activity of the macrophage
phagosome [3]. However, NOX2 activity seems to serve a
different function in phagosomes of dendritic cells, where it is
important for efficient crosspresentation of antigens [4]. The
significance of the NOX2-complex for innate immune response is
illustrated by the development of chronic granulomatous disease
(CGD) in human subjects that have genetic defects in components
of the complex. CGD is characterized by greatly increased
susceptibility to fungal and bacterial infections [5]. Correspond-
ingly, mice deficient in the NOX2 subunits are much more
susceptible to infections with bacterial pathogens such as
Salmonella typhimurium for example [3,5]. Not surprisingly, some
pathogens have developed strategies to counter the NOX2
response by either inhibiting NOX2 assembly on the phagosome,
as is the case for S. typhimurium [3] and Helicobacter pylori [6], or
reducing steady-state levels of NOX2 components as illustrated
by Anaplasma phagocytophila [7] or Ehrlichia chaffeensis [8] (for
review [9]).

Programmed cell death (PCD), or apoptosis, plays an important
role in the innate immune response (IR) against pathogens, a
defense strategy that is evolutionarily conserved and extends even
into the plant world[10]. Inhibition of host cell apoptosis has been
extensively studied and there are numerous examples of viral
proteins directly interfering with host cell apoptosis signaling[11].
Furthermore, an increasing number of protozoal pathogens have
been shown to manipulate PCD signaling of infected host
cells[12]. Finally,
prokaryotic pathogens
such as Chlamydia,
Legionella, Rickettsia, and Mycobacterium among others have the
capacity to inhibit host cell apoptosis signaling [13,14].
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an extremely successful human
pathogen that manipulates host cells via multiple pathways in
order to achieve survival[15,16,17]. The inhibition of host cell
apoptosis by Mtb has been implicated as a potential virulence
mechanism[18]. Indeed, an inverse correlation between the
virulence of a mycobacterial species and their capacity to induce
apoptosis of primary human alveolar macrophages was demon-
strated[19]. Cells infected with virulent Mtb have also been shown
to be more resistant to various apoptosis stimuli when compared to
uninfected or avirulent strains of Mtb[18]. For example, Mtb-
infected macrophages secrete soluble TNF-a-receptor in order to
inhibit TNF-a-mediated host cell apoptosis induction [20]. Mtb-
infection reduces the cell surface expression of Fas receptors,
resulting in the resistance of the host cells to Fas-ligand induce cell
death[21]. Infection with Mtb also induces the upregulation of the
anti-apoptosis gene mcl-1, which confers resistance of cells to
apoptosis induction via the host cell mitochondria[22]. Finally, it
has recently been shown that Mtb can manipulate the surface of
infected macrophages in order to favor a necrotic, rather than
apoptotic, cell death outcome[23]. In macrophages infected with
virulent MtbH37Rv, but not avirulent MtbH37Ra, the amino-
terminal
domain
of
annexin-1
is
removed
by
proteolysis,
preventing completion of the apoptotic envelop [24]. Similarly,
cells infected with Mtb are less likely to induce host cell membrane
repair, which is important for the induction of apoptosis and
supports the induction of necrotic cells death and the subsequent
dissemination of bacteria[24,25].
While there is substantial evidence supporting the ability of Mtb
to inhibit host cell apoptosis, a causal link between apoptosis
inhibition and virulence of Mtb had not been established due to
the lack of defined pro-apoptosis mutants. We have recently
performed a ‘‘gain-of-function’’ genetic screen and identified three
independent regions in the genome of Mtb that contain anti-
apoptosis genes[26]. The deletion of one of the identified genes,
the nuoG gene of Mtb, which encodes one of the 14 subunits of the
type I NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-1), increased infection-
induced apoptosis of macrophages and significantly reduced
bacterial virulence in mice. These findings support a direct causal
relationship between virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria and
their ability to inhibit macrophage apoptosis[26]. Our findings are
consistent with the identification of another anti-apoptosis gene
(superoxide dismutase A) that plays an important role in the
virulence of Mtb[27]. Finally, a third gene (Protein kinase E) with
anti-apoptosis capacity has recently been described, but the impact
of the deletion of this gene on bacterial virulence has not been
established[28]. Altogether, the identification of multiple anti-
apoptosis genes suggests that Mtb utilizes several strategies to
inhibit the apoptotic response of the host cell; however the
molecular mechanisms of these interactions have not been
investigated.
The present study describes the investigation of the molecular
mechanisms by which NuoG of Mtb inhibits host cell apoptosis.
The use of TNF-a-neutralizing antibodies and specific caspase
inhibitors on human macrophage cell lines, as well as the infection
of bone-marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) of wild-type and
TNF2/2 mice demonstrated that NuoG is involved in inhibiting
an extrinsic, TNF-a-dependent, apoptosis pathway. Furthermore,
the pro-apoptotic phenotype of the nuoG mutant was abolished in
the presence of both ROS scavengers and in the absence of a
functional NOX2 system as demonstrated in BMDM and primary
human alveolar macrophages. Altogether, our results reveal a
novel function of the NOX2 system in helping the host
macrophage in sensing persistent intracellular mycobacteria via
increased phagosomal ROS levels and the subsequent induction of
host cell apoptosis. This may constitute a second line of defense of
the macrophage and it is intriguing to speculate that this NOX2
mediated apoptosis induction is equally important in the defense
against other intracellular pathogens.
Results
The MtbDnuoG mutant induces apoptosis via an
extrinsic, caspase-dependent pathway
We previously demonstrated that a DnuoG mutant of Mtb
induced more apoptosis in host cells than wild type bacteria [26].
In order to analyze the mechanism of the NuoG/NDH-1
mediated host cell apoptosis inhibition, we first determined the
involvement of caspases in the pro-apoptotic phenotype of
MtbDnuoG using specific caspase inhibitors. PMA-differentiated
THP-1 cells were pre-treated with Caspase-3 inhibitor (C3I) or a
chemical analog with no inhibitor activity (C3I-A) at 20 mM for
3 h before infection, during infection, and after infection. Cells
were either left uninfected, or were infected with Mtb or
MtbDnuoG. After five days cells were harvested and stained for
genomic DNA degradation using the fluorescent Terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)
assay. The percentage of TUNEL positive cells was determined by
flow cytometry analysis. This analysis revealed that the uninfected
population

cells
(2.360.3%), Mtb infection slightly increased this amount to
1160.6%. As expected from previously published results [26], cells
infected with the nuoG mutant showed a very significant increase in
apoptosis (67.567.0%). Interestingly, treatment of THP-1 cells
Author Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuber-
culosis, is highly adapted to survive in macrophages of its
human host. Host cell suicide is an ancient host cell
defense mechanism employed by organisms to wall off
invading pathogens. M. tuberculosis manipulates infected
cells
to
inhibit
host
cell
death
but
the
molecular
mechanism of this interaction has not been elucidated.
Here we describe that M. tuberculosis uses an enzyme
complex (NDH-1) usually needed for energy generation in
order to neutralize the NOX-2 enzyme-mediated produc-
tion of toxic oxygen radicals (ROS) by the host cell. We
demonstrate that an M. tuberculosis mutant deficient in
NDH-1 accumulates ROS inside the macrophage which
induces the secretion of an inflammatory cytokine (TNF-a)
and subsequent host cell death. The increase of ROS is
dependent upon functional NOX-2, since host cells missing
a NOX-2 component do not undergo cell death upon
infection with the mutant. We propose that a novel
function of the host cell NOX-2 complex is to allow sensing
of intracellular pathogens by the host cell in order to
commit suicide and thus limit bacterial survival.

with the C3I reduced the percentage of DnuoG induced apoptosis
to 8.361.2%, whereas the C3I-A had no significant effect on
apoptosis induction (65.369.7%)(Figure 1A). The C3I did not
have an effect on the low level of Mtb-induced apoptosis, as
10.061.0% of C3I-treated Mtb-infected cells were TUNEL
positive, suggesting that Mtb may be inducing low levels of
apoptosis via a caspase independent mechanism. In order to
determine if the nuoG mutant induces apoptosis via the extrinsic
(i.e., death receptor mediated), or the intrinsic (i.e., mitochondrial)
pathway [29], cells were treated with Caspase-8 and Caspase-9
inhibitors, respectively. The experimental conditions and analysis
were identical to the previous experiment with the exception that
cells were harvested 3 days post infection. Analysis of TUNEL
staining after this shorter time period resulted in similar rates of
apoptosis for Mtb infected and uninfected cells (2.160.1% and
1.160.1%, respectively). Treatment of these populations with
either C8I or C9I had no effect. The nuoG mutant induced
apoptosis in about 34.760.7% of cells, which was not significantly
affected by the addition of C9I (33.260.6), but was significantly
reduced by the addition of C8I to levels similar to uninfected cells
(1.260.2%)(Figure 1B). These results indicated that the nuoG
mutant induced host macrophage apoptosis via an extrinsic,
caspase-8 dependent signaling pathway.
Host macrophage TNF-a is important for the
apoptogenic phenotype of the nuoG mutant
TNF-a is of major importance for a successful host defense
against mycobacterial infections, and has also been implicated in

TNF-a
production and signaling were involved in apoptosis of MtbDnuoG
infected THP-1 cells. We first determined if infection with
MtbDnuoG resulted in an increase of secreted TNF-a. Superna-
tants from infected THP-1 (Figure 2A) and BMDM cells
(Figure 2B) were collected 3 days post infection and levels of
TNF-a were measured by ELISA. In both systems, MtbDnuoG
infected cells secreted significantly more TNF-a than those
infected with wild type (30 pg/ml to 2.1 ng/ml for Mtb and
MtbDnuoG in THP-1 cells; 0.2 ng/ml to 1 ng/ml for Mtb and
MtbDnuoG in murine cells). Having established the presence of
higher levels of TNF-a, we next evaluated the effect of TNF-a
signaling on the pro-apoptotic phenotype of MtbDnuoG. This was
first addressed by addition of human TNF-a-specific, neutralizing
antibodies (5 mg/ml) to the culture media of THP-1 cells during
and after infection. The anti-TNF-a-antibody significantly inhib-
ited macrophage apoptosis induced by MtbDnuoG infection, as the
percentage of apoptotic cells was reduced from 62.369.6% to
7.261.96% after addition of antibody (Figure 2C). PCD in
uninfected or Mtb infected cells was not significantly affected by
the addition of antibodies (Figure 2C). The involvement of TNF-a
in the pro-apoptotic phenotype of the nuoG mutant was further
analyzed by utilizing BMDM from TNF-a2/2 mice. The nuoG
mutant induced apoptosis in 2862.3% of wild type C57B/6 (B6)
cells, as compared to 5.861.8% of Mtb infected cells (Figure 2D).
In contrast, the pro-apoptotic phenotype of the nuoG mutant was
partially complemented in TNF2/2 BMDM, resulting in levels of
apoptosis of 13.361.9%, where as Mtb infected cells were not
significantly different at 4.361.6%. Overall, these experiments
confirmed the involvement of TNF-a in the pro-apoptosis
phenotype of the nuoG mutant.
Host macrophage NOX2-derived reactive oxygen species
are necessary for MtbDnuoG-induced apoptosis and
increase in TNF-a secretion
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in shifting the balance
of TNF-a-R1 mediated signaling from anti-apoptotic to pro-
apoptotic [32,33]. We investigated the role of ROS in MtbDnuoG
induced apoptosis by utilizing a general ROS scavenger (the
antioxidant glutathione) and an oxidase inhibitor (diphenylene
iodonium or DPI) during infections of THP-1 cells [1]. THP-1 cells
were incubated with 15 mM glutathione or 10 mM DPI 3 hours
prior to and throughout infection with Mtb and MtbDnuoG.
Untreated cells infected with the nuoG mutant induced apoptosis in
about 40.9563.8% in the population, as compared to 1.360.4% in
uninfected, and 3.160.2% in Mtb infected cells (Figure 3A). The
presence of DPI and glutathione reduced apoptosis induced by the
mutant to 6.660.4% and 3.360.2% of cells, respectively (Figure 3A).
Thus, both of these agents greatly suppressed apoptosis induced by
MtbDnuoG in THP-1 cells, a finding consistent with a strong
dependence of the apoptotic death response on ROS accumulation
(Figure 3A) [33]. These inhibitors can also potentially affect cellular
NO levels but we determined, using the Griess assay, that THP-1 cells

cells. Statistical analysis was performed on three independent
experiments (ANOVA with Tukey post-test) and significance is indicated
as follows: *, 0.01,p,0.05; **, 0.001,p,0.01; ***, p,0.001.

produce no significant increase in NO after infection with the bacteria
(Figure S2). Increased ROS levels in the cytosol can also lead to
increased gene transcription of an array of genes involved in oxidative
stress and immunity, including TNF-a [32]. For that reason, the
TNF-a levels in the supernatant of infected THP-1 cells were
analyzed after 3 and 5 days by ELISA. Insignificant amounts of TNF-
a were detected in supernatants of uninfected cells, and only low
concentrations of TNF-a (below 50 pg/ml) were detected in
supernatants of cells infected with Mtb or the complemented nuoG
mutants strains (Figure 3B). In contrast, the nuoG mutant increased
secretion of TNF-a by a factor of 10 to 0.5–0.6 ng/ml. This increase
was partially reduced to about 0.1–0.2 ng/ml by treatment of the
cells with DPI, and almost completely reduced by the addition of
glutathione (0.02–0.03 pg/ml)(Figure 3B). Thus, the increase of
intracellular ROS induced by infection of cells with the nuoG mutant
is required for the increase in TNF-a secretion by infected cells.
Next, we addressed the question of the subcellular origin of
ROS during MtbDnuoG infection. The mitochondrial respiratory
chain complex I is an important generator of cellular ROS that is
shared by all cells types and might be at the origin of
mitochondrial-induced host cell apoptosis. However, the NADPH
oxidases are also potent inducers of cellular and extracellular
ROS. In macrophages, the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, NOX2, is
recruited
to
phagosomes
and
generates
the
production
of
superoxide in the lumen of the phagosome. These superoxides
and their derivates are thought to be important for the killing of
ingested bacteria, although their role in pathogenesis is not
completely understood. In order to address the importance of
NOX2 in the pro-apoptotic phenotype of the nuoG mutant, we
utilized BMDM derived from mice deficient in NOX2 activity due
to the deletion of the major transmembrane subunit of the NOX2
complex, gp91phox (gp912/2). The nuoG mutant induced signifi-
cantly more apoptosis than Mtb in macrophages of wild type
C57Bl/6
mice,
28.663.4%
versus
8.861.6%,
respectively
(Figure 3C). Importantly, this increase was abolished when
gp912/2 BMDM were used as host cells, since only 5.761.1%
of MtbDnuoG infected cells were apoptotic compared to 4.161.1%
of Mtb-infected cells. Therefore, the presence of functional NOX2
is required for the pro-apoptotic phenotype of the nuoG mutant of
Mtb. Interestingly, the absence of NOX2 in infected primary
macrophages did not result in the reduction of TNF-a secretion as
nuoG infected cells secreted more TNF-a (day 3: 1.760.3 ng/ml;
day 5: 1.160.2 ng/ml) than those infected with Mtb (day 3:
0.560.2 ng/ml; day 5: 0.260.1 ng/ml).

nuoG mutant originate from NOX2, then macrophages infected

with MtbDnuoG should have higher intracellular levels of ROS
than those infected with Mtb. In order to address this hypothesis,
two dyes for detection of ROS were used: DCFDA, which is more
sensitive to H2O2, and DHE, which is more sensitive to O2
-.
Macrophages were infected and after 24 h the amount of ROS
was detected in uninfected, Mtb and MtbDnuoG infected cells using
flow cytometry analysis. Mtb infection induced only slightly
elevated levels ROS as detected either by DCFDA or DHE since
the histogram overlays closely with that of uninfected cells
(Figure 4A–4C). Conversely, both dyes detected a significant
increase in ROS levels after infection of wild type cells with the
nuoG mutant as depicted by the positive shift in fluorescence
(Figure 4A–4C). The pro-apoptotic phenotype of the nuoG mutant
was also observed under these conditions (Figure S1A). Impor-
tantly, this increase in ROS staining was abolished in gp912/2
BMDM, thus clearly indicating that ROS are being generated by
the NOX2 complex (Figure 4A–4C). In order to directly observe
ROS localization on a subcellular level, macrophages were
infected with DiI-labeled mycobacteria (Figure 4D), stained with
DCFDA, fixed, and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. Only in
the MtbDnuoG infected macrophages were phagosomes stained
with the ROS sensor DCFDA, whereas phagosomes of Mtb-
infected macrophages remained DCFDA negative (Figure 4E).
This data also revealed that the DiI fluorescence is quenched in
the presence of ROS and thus the bacterial staining is lost during
infection with MtbDnuoG, but not during infection with Mtb
(Figure 4E). Other dyes were used for external labeling of bacteria
with similar results (Data not shown). These results not only
confirmed the flow cytometry analysis in which an increase of
ROS signal was detected only after infection of macrophages with
the MtbDnuoG mutant (Figure 4A), but furthermore localized this
increase of ROS to the host cell phagosome (Figure 4E). Nitric
oxide (NO) can also oxidize DCFDA to induce fluorescence[34].

Primary human alveolar macrophages undergo
apoptosis upon MtbDnuoG infection in a ROS-dependent
fashion
In order to analyze if the ROS-dependent mechanism of
apoptosis induction upon infection with the DnuoG is conserved in
human cells, primary alveolar macrophages were used as host
cells. Due to the source of the cells, only a limited number of cells
were available, and therefore the apoptosis assay was adapted to
be performed on slides which were analyzed by fluorescence
microscopy. For each donor triplicate wells were infected with
Mtb, MtbDnuoG, or were left uninfected. Cells were stained with
TUNEL assay 3 days post infection (Figure 5A). Approximately
500 cells were counted on each slide in blinded fashion and the
number of TUNEL positive cells was recorded (Figure 5B).
Approximately
7.962.2%
of
uninfected
macrophages
were
apoptotic, a percentage which was not significantly different from
that of Mtb infected cells (8.561.7%). In contrast, there was

ROS was analyzed in two different donors using the inhibitor DPI
as described above. Approximately 5 times as many human cells
infected with the nuoG mutant underwent apoptosis as compared
to those infected with Mtb (21.962.4% and 4.560.8% respec-
tively). However, this difference between the two strains was
abolished by the treatment of cells with the inhibitor DPI, as about
8.762.3% of Mtb and 8.160.3% of DnuoG infected cells were
apoptotic under these conditions (Figure 5C). These data strongly
suggests that in primary human alveolar macrophages, as in
murine BMDM, the NOX2 complex is critical for the pro-
apoptotic phenotype of the nuoG mutant. Lastly, the intracellular
ROS levels in Mtb or MtbDnuoG infected cells were analyzed using
DCFDA staining. The percentage of infected cells containing one
or more ROS-positive phagosomes was quantified from two
donors. The amount of cells containing ROS-positive Mtb
phagosomes was similar from both donors (19.162.9% and
21.861.1%). However, these percentages were increased at least 3
fold in MtbDnuoG infected cells to be 69.361.9% and 69.567.4
for the two donors (Figure 6A). Also of note, cells infected with
MtbDnuoG contained many more ROS-positive phagosomes than
those infected with Mtb (Figure 6B and data not shown).
MtbDkatG infection increases ROS production and
induces apoptosis in macrophages
Since the pro-apoptotic phenotype of MtbDnuoG is dependent
upon the accumulation of ROS in the phagosome, we hypothe-
sized that neutralization or countering of phagosomal ROS may
be a general mechanism of inhibition of apoptosis. If this
hypothesis was true, other known ROS neutralizing proteins
could potentially play a role in inhibition of PCD in host cells. M.
tuberculosis contains several enzymes involved in the neutralization
of ROS including a secreted Mg, Fe superoxide dismutase (SodA),
an outer membrane bound Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SodC),
and a secreted catalase (KatG). Interestingly, a previous report
established the involvement of SodA in the inhibition of apoptosis
[27]. To determine if SodC or KatG could likewise affect cell
death pathways, THP-1 cells were infected with sodC and katG
deletion mutants and stained with TUNEL after 3 days. MtbDsodC
did not induce more apoptosis than the wild type Mtb (strain
Erdman) (Figure S3), possibly due to the redundant presence of
secreted SodA. However, MtbDkatG induced significantly more
apoptosis than Mtb, both at day 3 (6365.1% and 2363.2%,
respectively)(Figure 7A) and at day 1 (Figure S1B) post infection.
Similar to cells infected with DnuoG bacteria, MtbDkatG infected
cells secreted 50-fold more TNF-a (0.5 ng/ml) than those infected
wild type bacteria (16 pg/ml)(Figure 7B). Infection of murine
macrophages with the katG knockout also resulted in the increase
of NOX2-dependent phagosomal ROS (Figure 7C–7E). These
results are consistent with the data obtained from the MtbDnuoG
analysis and reinforce the hypothesis that the NOX2-mediated
accumulation of phagosomal ROS can lead to induction of host
cell apoptosis.
Discussion
The search for anti-apoptosis genes in the genome of M.
tuberculosis led to the identification of nuoG as being important in
host cell apoptosis inhibition and bacterial virulence [26]. Here we
describe that primary human alveolar macrophages and murine
BMDMs infected with the nuoG mutant responded with a NOX2-
mediated increase in phagosomal ROS, which was essential to its
pro-apoptotic phenotype when compared to wild-type Mtb-
infected cells. The presence of TNF-a was necessary but not
sufficient for the nuoG mediated apoptosis induction. Further-
more, the infection with the nuoG mutant led to an increase in
TNF-a secretion in human and murine macrophages. It is to our
knowledge the first time that a direct connection between
phagocytosis of a pathogen, NOX2-generated phagosomal ROS
levels,
and
TNF-a-mediated
apoptosis
signaling
has
been
demonstrated in infected macrophages.
TNF-a receptor 1 (TNF-R1) mediated signaling has either pro-
survival or pro-apoptotic consequences [32]. The ligation of
TNFR-1 results in either activation of NF-kB, leading to survival
of the cell, or activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK),
which entails an apoptotic response [32,35]. A major determinant
in
the
outcome
of
TNF-a-mediated
cell
signaling
is
the
concentration of cytosolic ROS [36]. High ROS levels lead to
oxidation and inactivation of the MAP Kinase Phosphatases
(MKPs), which in their active form inhibit JNK activity. Without
active MKP, TNF-a signaling leads to prolonged activation of
JNK and subsequent cell death [33]. We have clearly demon-
strated that intracellular ROS levels are important for the
apoptosis phenotypes of the nuoG and katG deletion mutants of
Mtb (Figure 3+7). It will be of interest to determine if the increased
phagosomal ROS during mutant Mtb-infection leads to the
oxidation of MKPs, or if other components are involved to modify

TNF-a signaling outcome. How the increase in phagosomal ROS
actually affects cytosolic host cell signaling components is not a
trivial question. NOX2-complex generated superoxide is imper-
meable to lipid bilayer of the phagosome[37]. In contrast,
hydrogen peroxide is highly permeable and might thus quickly
diffuse into the host cell cytosol to oxidize susceptible cysteines in
signaling proteins. Indeed, the JNK phosphatases MKP-1, MKP-
3, MKP-5 and MKP-7 all share a phosphatase domain that
contains a cysteine which is oxidized upon increase of H2O2 to
inactivated the phosphatase and thus lead to increased JNK
activity[33]. Nevertheless, H2O2 diffuses rapidly and so it would
be surprising that we could detect such a strong accumulation of
ROS in the phagosome of infected cells (Figures 4D, 6B and 7E).
An alternative hypothesis is that the increase in phagosomal ROS
leads to a change in the signaling of receptors in the phagosomal
membrane. Cell surface receptors such as TLRs, MARCO and
TNF-R1 are phagocytosed together with bacteria in macrophages
and the content of the phagosome influences outcome of receptor
signaling [38,39,40,41]. The highly oxidative environment of the
phagosome containing mutant Mtb compared to wild-type Mtb,
may lead to the modification of the ligand/receptor-interactions
which could affect the outcome of the signals transmitted by the
receptors. The signaling difference observed between non-oxidized
and oxidized LDL may serve as an example of how the oxidative
modification of a ligand affects receptor signaling [42].
Infection of macrophages with either the katG mutant or the
nuoG deletion mutant of Mtb increased the amount of secreted
TNF-a (Figures 2A, 2B and 7B). Infection of macrophages with
wild-type Mtb induces a low basal level of TNF-a secretion which
is induced by transcriptional upregulation of TNF-a mRNA
expression[43]. The Mtb mutant mediated increase in TNF-a
secretion in human THP-1 cells was inhibited by glutathione and
DPI but was not affected in murine BMDMs derived from NOX2-
deficient mice (Figures 3B and 3D). This would suggest that there
are functional differences between the human macrophage-like
cell line THP-1 and murine BMDMs. Alternatively, the TNF- a
induction might be mediated via ROS generated in mitochondria
which would be inhibited by glutathione and DPI but not by
deletion of NOX2. How the nuoG mutant infection leads to an
increase in TNF-a secretion by macrophages needs to be
investigated in more detail but activation of transcription factors
such as ATF-2, Elk-1 and c-Jun upon JNK activation have been
reported and would lead to an increase in TNF-a gene
transcription[35].
The respiratory burst associated with Mtb infection has been
shown to rapidly induce a MAP kinase cascade and NF-kB
activation in a NOX2-dependent manner during very early time
points (,1 hr post infection)[44]. However, our data suggests that
ROS signaling may also play a role at later stages of infection as
NOX2-derived ROS are necessary for induction of apoptosis
several days post infection (Figure 3). Comparing the effects of
Mtb and the nuoG mutant should prove to be a useful model for
elucidating the interactions of NOX2-generated phagosomal ROS
levels on the host cell apoptosis signaling cascade after prolonged
infection.
The specific mechanism by which NuoG inhibits ROS
accumulation in the phagosome remains to be determined.
However, one potential mechanism could be via the direct
neutralization of NOX2 generated superoxides, since they are able
to oxidize iron-sulphur ([Fe-S]) clusters with extremely high
efficiency[37]. The Mtb NuoG protein contains four [Fe-S]
clusters which could directly compete for NOX2 generated
superoxides. Nevertheless, this model would require NuoG to
enter the lumen of the phagosome, and to date there is no
evidence that NuoG is being secreted by Mtb. NuoG does not
have a signal peptide and structural analyses of other bacterial
NDH-1 systems predict NuoG to be in the cytosol of the bacteria
[45]. Furthermore, we have previously failed to detect secretion of
a NuoG-phoA fusion protein[26] and in the current manuscript
we also did not observe secretion of a myc-tagged NuoG protein
into culture filtrate (Figure S4). These results are significant as they
suggest that it is not NuoG by itself that is important for
phagosomal superoxide neutralization, but that it is potentially the
enzymatic activity of the NDH-1 complex that it is required. In
order to address this question experimentally, deletion mutants of
the NuoL and NuoM subunits of NDH-1 will be created. In
homology with other prokaryotic NDH-1 complexes the L and M
subunits are proposed to be important in translocation of protons
across the membrane during the dehydrogenase activity of NDH-1
and thus their deletion should abolish the enzymatic activity of the
NDH-1 complex[45]. If the hypothesis that the enzymatic activity
of the NDH-1 complex is important for NOX2 neutralization is
valid, then these deletion mutants should have a similar phenotype
to the nuoG mutant in regard to ROS and apoptosis increases in
host macrophages.
In the light of our results it is tempting to hypothesize that the
NDH-1-encoding nuo-operon in M. tuberculosis might have acquired
a different function when compared to other prokaryotes.
Accordingly, regulation of the Mtb nuo-operon is opposite to that
in E. coli. In Mtb, gene expression of the nuo-operon is down-
regulated under hypoxic conditions in vitro and at late stage
infections in the lungs of mice, whereas it is upregulated under
these conditions in E.coli [46]. Interestingly, it is the type II
dehydrogenase complex, NDH-2 (ndh, ndhA), of Mtb that is
upregulated under hypoxic, nonreplicating conditions[46]. Under
these conditions NDH-2 is crucial for maintaining a minimal PMF
which is essential for survival[47], suggesting a possible alternative
role for the Mtb NDH-1 system. The nuo-operon is under positive
control by the two-component system PhoPR [48], which is
important for virulence of Mtb and is one of the targets for
attenuating mutations in Mtb H37Ra[49,50]. The phoP mutant
fails to replicate in macrophages and infected mouse organs;
however bacteria are able to survive in a state of nonreplicating
persistence, suggesting that the dormancy regulon is not affected
by the phoP mutation and that the PhoPR system is important for
early steps of Mtb infection[51]. This is consistent with a role of
the NDH-1 complex during the replicative phase of Mtb infections
when the host cell NOX2 system is the most active.
The NOX2 complex has been investigated and demonstrated to
be of great importance for innate immune defense against a variety
of pathogens[5]. In order for bacterial or protozoal pathogens to
survive inside the macrophage they must have developed strategies
to overcome NOX2 activity. One approach is to directly inhibit
NOX2 activity by either perturbing the recruitment of the
subunits to the phagosome[3,52] or by decreasing the steady state
levels of NOX2 complex subunits[7,8]. A novel mechanism
employed by Helicobacter pylori is to misdirect the assembly of
functional
NOX2
complex
away
from
the
membrane
of
phagosome to the plasma membrane, so that superoxides are
being released into the extracellular
space instead of the
phagosomal lumen[6]. Furthermore, a common strategy used by
several pathogenic bacteria, including M. tuberculosis, is the
enzymatic detoxification of NOX2 generated superoxides via the
secretion
of
enzymes
such
as
superoxide
dismutases
and
catalases[53]. In the case of Mtb, the secretion of large amounts
of SodA and KatG may account for the relative insensitivity of the
bacteria to bactericidal effects of NOX2 produced superox-
ides[54]. If our discovery that the NuoG-mediated neutralization

of NOX2 activity is important for inhibition of host cell apoptosis
is of general importance, one would predict that any mutant
deficient in inhibition NOX2 activity should have a pro-apoptotic
phenotype. There are few defined mutants for any pathogen
described that are deficient in neutralizing NOX2 activity, and
could thus be used to confirm or disprove this hypothesis. In the
present study, we interrogated a Mtb deletion mutant of the only
catalase in the Mtb genome (katG) and demonstrated that it had a
similar phenotype to the nuoG mutant of Mtb in regard to an
increase in phagosomal ROS and host cell apoptosis induction,
both of which were dependent upon functional NOX2 (Figure 7).
Interestingly, the katG mutant has been described as being
attenuated and the attenuation was dependent on the presence
of functional NOX2 complex in the host[55]. Furthermore,
inhibition of SodA secretion by Mtb achieved either via deletion of
secA2 or via inhibiting sodA transcription also leads to a pro-
apoptotic phenotype of the bacteria[27]. This increase in apoptosis
is likely to be due to increases in phagosomal ROS levels and
dependent upon host cell NOX2 activity, although that has not
been investigated to date.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis also contains the membrane bound
superoxide dismutase SodC. We have found that the deletion of
sodC does not result in a pro-apoptotic phenotype, likely due to the
presence of secreted SodA (Figure S3). However, this deletion does
render the mutant more susceptible to the bacteriacidal effects of
ROS [56]. It is possible that the deletion of nuoG from Mtb may
also create a bacterial strain that is more vulnerable to ROS
mediated killing, in which case the pro-apoptotic phenotype of
DnuoG may be due to decreased fitness of the mutant. However,
the nuoG deletion mutant was not more susceptible to superoxides
being added directly to bacteria using the hypoxanthine/xanthine
oxidase system (Figure S5). Therefore, the increase in phagosomal
ROS may be affecting apoptosis signaling rather than direct
bacterial killing.
The identification of both SodA and KatG as anti-apoptotic
proteins indicate that for Mtb, mutants deficient in countering host
cell NOX2 activity are generally pro-apoptotic. It will be
interesting to know if this mechanism can be extended to other
pathogens such as Leishmania donovani, which is able to inhibit host
cell NOX2 recruitment to the phagosome. This hypothesis is
testable as a mutant deficient in producing the surface glycolipid
lipophosphoglycan
has
lost the
capacity
to inhibit
NOX2
recruitment [52].
Other pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, may evade
NOX2 activity by escaping from the phagosome into the cytosol.
This is clearly a successful approach to evading the detrimental
effects of increased proteolytic activity associated with phagosome
maturation. Nevertheless, in the light of our results it is tempting to
speculate that this strategy also helps to evade the NOX2-
mediated apoptosis induction. It will interesting to test this
hypothesis using bacterial mutants that fail to escape the
phagosome such as the Listeriolysin O mutant of Listeria
monocytogenes.
In conclusion, the investigation of the pro-apoptotic phenotype
of a mutant of Mtb deficient in functional NDH-1 complex
serendipitously revealed a novel important function of host cell
NOX2 complex in macrophages. Our results demonstrate that
continuous NOX2 activity will ultimately lead to host macrophage
apoptosis induction. The classical respiratory burst is transient,
since this generates sufficient amounts ROS to kill susceptible
bacteria and thus reduce NOX2 activity. However, infection of
macrophages with persistent pathogens, who have adapted to the
macrophage as a survival niche and are able to survive this initial
ROS burst, would thus potentially lead to continuous NOX2
activity. The results presented in the current manuscript enable us
to formulate the following hypothesis: successful intracellular
pathogens need strategies to inhibit prolonged activation of NOX2
and/or neutralize the generated superoxides since this will
otherwise be sensed by the host cell and will lead to host cell
apoptosis. This hypothesis expands the function of NOX2 from
the previously described ROS generation for bactericidal activity,
to postulate that the host cell macrophages use the NOX2
complex
as a mechanism to
detect persisting
intracellular
pathogens.

infection as detailed in the figure legends. The protocol to obtain
normal human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was pre-
approved by the IRB of the University of Maryland-Baltimore (H-
23204). Normal, asymptomatic, non-smoking volunteers between
the ages of 18 and 50 were anesthetized with topical and
endobronchial lidocaine, and clinically standard fiberoptic bron-
choscopy (FOB) was performed in the endoscopy suite at the
University of Maryland Hospital. BALF was obtained using
200 mL of sterile normal saline infused in an identical manner into
the right middle lobe of each subject, yielding 75–125 mL of
BALF. 10–15 mL of BALF was filtered through sterile gauze to
remove mucous, and the alveolar macrophages were washed 3
times with PBS before being used in experiments. Cells were
resuspended in warm RPMI with 10% heat inactivated FCS,
seeded on 8 well slides, and allowed to rest for 1–3 days. Infection
was carried out as described above. Bone marrow macrophages
were derived from the femur and tibia of C57B/6 and knockout
mice and differentiated in DMEM media containing 20% L-929
supernatant. Murine cells were infected as described above using
10% FCS and 5–10% L929 supernatant in the infection and chase
media. L929 supernatant was included in order to protect against
cytokine withdrawal induced apoptosis. For experiments using
caspase inhibitors or analog (20 mM), antioxidants (15 mM
glutathione), and oxidase inhibitor (10 mM diphenylene iodonium,
DPI), the cells were incubated with the reagents during infection
and chase period. In experiments using TNF-a neutralizing
antibody (#500-M26, Peprotech) the antibody was included only
in the chase medium at a concentration of 5 mg/ml.
Apoptosis assays
The TUNEL assay was preformed to reveal apoptosis-induced
DNA fragmentation in tissue culture, primary human, or murine
cells using the ‘‘In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit-Fluorescein or –
TMR Red’’ (Roche Applied Sciences at roche.com). The assay
was carried out as described by the manufacturer and the
percentage of stained cells was analyzed using flow cytometry or
quantification via fluorescent microscopy.
ROS detection assays
Reactive oxygen species in primary murine bone marrow cells
and alveolar macrophages were detected at 24 hrs or 3 days post
infection respectively using the ROS sensitive dyes 5-(and-6)-
chloromethyl-29,79-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate,
acetyl
ester (CM-DCFDA) and dihydroethidium (DHE) (Invitrogen).
Bone marrow cells were deprived of L929 supernatant 16 hrs prior
to infection and maintained in L929 free media without phenol
red for the length of the experiment. Human alveolar macro-
phages were maintained in normal growth, infection, and chase
media. In some cases bacteria were labeled with lipophilic red dye
Vybrant-DiI (invitrogen). Bacteria were incubated in 7H9 media
containing 5 ml/ml of DiI for 30 minutes, washed twice with PBS
with 0.05%tween, and then used for infection as normal. Post
infection, murine or alveolar macrophages were washed once in
HBSS and then incubated in 10 mM DCFDA for 30 minutes or
2 mM DHE for 15 minutes. Cells were washed 3 times with HBSS,
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and analyzed by either flow
cytometry or fluorescence microscopy.
Nitrite detection assay
Nitrite (NO) concentrations in supernatants from C57/B6
BMDMs were quantified via the Griess assay according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. In brief, supernatants were collected
from macrophagess 3 days post infection with Mtb or DnuoG.
Supernatants from macrophages primed for 16 hrs with IFNc
(100 units/ml), and infected with heat-killed M. smegmatis (MOI of
5 and 20), were used as positive controls. 150 ml of sample was
mixed with 20 ml of Greiss reagent and 130 ml water, and the
mixture was incubated at 30uC for 30 minutes before measuring
absorbance at 548 nm. Nitrite concentrations were calculated
from a standard curve with sodium nitrite as the reference.
TNF-a ELISA
ELISA was performed with the supernatants of bone marrow
derived macrophages or THP-1 cells infected for 3 or 5 days and
treated with or without glutathione or DPI as described above. For
detection of human TNF-a, the ELISA-plates were coated with
2 mg/ml capture antibody (500-M26, Peprotech) for 2 hours at
37uC. 100 ml of cell supernatant was used for the reaction and
recombinant human TNF-a (554618, BD Pharmingen) diluted in
infection medium was used as a standard. TNF-a was detected
using the secondary biotinylated anti human-TNF-a detection
antibody at 200 ng/ml (500-P31Abt, Peprotech Inc), Streptavidin-
alkaline phosphatase at 1 mg/ml (Zymed), and phosphatase
substrate at 1 mg/ml (Sigma). The plate was read at an
absorbance of 405 nm. Murine TNF-a ELISAs were preformed
as above using recombinant mouse TNF-a standard, the capture
antibody rat anti murine-TNF-a at 8 mg/ml, and the biotinylated
detection antibody rat anti mouse-TNF-a antibody at 1 mg/ml
(Catalog numbers 554589, 551225, 554415 respectively, BD
Pharmingen).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed on three independent
experiments (ANOVA with Tukey post-test) unless otherwise
noted in the figure legends. Significance indications are as follows:
*, 0.01,p,0.05; **, 0.001,p,0.01; ***, p,0.001. Graphs and in
–text citations are a representation of the population mean and
standard error of mean. Percentages of DCFDA or DHE positive
cells found in the sample and not the control (Figure 4 and
Figure 7) were calculated by subtracting the histogram of
uninfected cells from experimental histograms using Overton
cumulative histogram subtraction (FlowJo version 8.8.6 DMV).
Differences were compared via ANOVA.

IFNc and LPS treated cells were collected after 18 hrs, whereas
supernatants from infected and uninfected cells were assayed 3
days post infection.

Figure S3
The sodC deletion mutant does not have a pro-
apoptotic phenotype. THP-1 cells were infected with either Mtb-
Erdman or the sodC deletion mutant at an MOI of 10 for 4 h and
assayed for apoptosis after 3 days by TUNEL staining (Mean+/2
SEM of three experiments).

Figure S4
Mtb NuoG is not secreted into the culture filtrate.
NuoG knockout bacteria were complemented with a NuoG-myc
construct and grown in Sauton’s media to an OD600 nm of 0.7.
Shown is a western blot of NuoG-Myc (92KDa) on culture filtrate
(CF) and the bacterial pellet (P). Equal ratios of protein were
loaded for CF and P. Antibodies against Antigen 85 (32KDa) were
used as a loading control and to show that the CF contained
protein (representative sample shown).

Figure S5
The nuoG deletion mutant has no increased sensitivity
to superoxide-dependent killing. The resistance of the nuoG mutant
(open squares) to ROS was compared to survival of wild-type Mtb
(open circles) using hypoxanthine/xanthine oxidase to generate 02
-
in the bacterial culture medium. The number of surviving bacteria
was determined at 0, 1, and 3 h after exposure to superoxide in
vitro by plating dilutions of the bacteria on 7H10 plates. Viability of
Mtb (closed circles) and DnuoG (closed squares) not exposed to
xanthine oxidase were also determined. The means from triplicate
tubes were calculated, and the data are expressed as the mean
percentages of the time zero value with SEM.
