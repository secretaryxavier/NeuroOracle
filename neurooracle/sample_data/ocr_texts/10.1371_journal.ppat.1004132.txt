Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) employs multiple strategies to evade host immune responses and persist within
macrophages. We have previously shown that the cell envelope-associated Mtb serine hydrolase, Hip1, prevents robust
macrophage activation and dampens host pro-inflammatory responses, allowing Mtb to delay immune detection and
accelerate disease progression. We now provide key mechanistic insights into the molecular and biochemical basis of Hip1
function. We establish that Hip1 is a serine protease with activity against protein and peptide substrates. Further, we show
that the Mtb GroEL2 protein is a direct substrate of Hip1 protease activity. Cleavage of GroEL2 is specifically inhibited by
serine protease inhibitors. We mapped the cleavage site within the N-terminus of GroEL2 and confirmed that this site is
required for proteolysis of GroEL2 during Mtb growth. Interestingly, we discovered that Hip1-mediated cleavage of GroEL2
converts the protein from a multimeric to a monomeric form. Moreover, ectopic expression of cleaved GroEL2 monomers
into the hip1 mutant complemented the hyperinflammatory phenotype of the hip1 mutant and restored wild type levels of
cytokine responses in infected macrophages. Our studies point to Hip1-dependent proteolysis as a novel regulatory
mechanism that helps Mtb respond rapidly to changing host immune environments during infection. These findings
position Hip1 as an attractive target for inhibition for developing immunomodulatory therapeutics against Mtb.

Introduction
The outcome of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the
causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is determined by a complex
interplay between the host immune response and pathogen factors
that promote virulence. In response to multiple stresses encoun-
tered during infection, Mtb employs a wide array of strategies to
evade the first-line defenses mounted by host innate immune
responses and successfully replicates intracellularly within host
macrophages [1]. Mtb hinders macrophage functions by inhibiting
phagosome maturation and acidification, interferes with IFN-c-
mediated activation, counters toxic reactive oxygen (ROI) and
nitrogen intermediates (RNI) and resists antimicrobial agents that
damage the mycobacterial cell envelope [2,3]. The lipid-rich Mtb
cell envelope effectively protects the pathogen from antimicrobial
agents and immune toxins and provides a potent hydrophobic
barrier against several antibiotics [4]. Remodeling of its cell
envelope in response to the rapidly changing immune milieu
allows Mtb to adapt to intracellular macrophage environments and
to persist within granulomatous lesions in the lung. Mtb also
secretes a number of gene products extracellularly, many of which
can serve as effector molecules to modulate host cells and promote
disease progression [5]. Delineating the molecular functions of cell
envelope-associated and extracellular Mtb factors that are required
for evading host immunity is therefore critical for understanding
Mtb pathogenesis.
We have recently identified the cell envelope-associated serine
hydrolase,
Hip1
(Hydrolase
important
for
pathogenesis
1;
Rv2224c), as a key immunomodulatory protein that prevents
robust activation of macrophages following Mtb infection and
controls the onset and magnitude of pro-inflammatory responses
induced by Mtb [6–8]. This strategy of dampening early pro-
inflammatory responses is likely to be advantageous to the
pathogen by allowing it to escape immune detection. In addition,
Mtb Hip1 and its Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) ortholog are
important for maintaining Mtb cell envelope integrity and confer
resistance to cell envelope-directed stresses [7,9,10]. In this study,
we provide key insights into the molecular and biochemical
mechanisms underlying Hip1 enzymatic activity and its immuno-
modulatory functions. Hip1 is predicted to encode a serine
protease based on its similarity to the tripeptidyl-peptidases TPP B
(SlpD) and TPP C (SlpE) from Streptomyces lividans, which are
mycelium-associated proteases involved in cell growth [11]. Hip1

members,
including
esterases,
lipases
and
proteases, but the presence of 11 cysteine residues and 5 predicted
disulfide bonds within the protein, complicated previous efforts to
purify this protein and, thus, the true enzymatic activity of Hip1
has remained unclear [12,13]. We now conclusively demonstrate
that Hip1 is a serine protease with activity against protein and
peptide substrates. Further, we show that the Mtb GroEL2 protein
is a substrate of Hip1 protease activity. While several proteases
have been implicated in promoting Mtb virulence, identification of
their physiological substrates has been largely lacking and the
interplay between proteases and their substrates during Mtb
infection is poorly understood [14–23]. Here, we show that Hip1
proteolytically cleaves GroEL2 in the N-terminus of the protein
and we have mapped the cleavage site within GroEL2. Interest-
ingly, cleavage of GroEL2, which encodes a chaperone-like
immunomodulatory protein, converts the protein from a multi-
meric form to a monomeric form. Remarkably, while GroEL2
remains uncleaved in the hip1 mutant, ectopic expression of
cleaved GroEL2 monomers within the hip1 mutant strain restores
wild type levels of cytokine responses in infected macrophages.
Our studies implicate Hip1-dependent proteolysis of its substrate
as a novel regulatory mechanism in Mtb that helps the pathogen
respond rapidly to changing host immune environments during
infection.
Results
Purification of recombinant Hip1 protein
Hip1 is a cell envelope-associated a/b hydrolase that is predicted
to have serine protease activity. Multiple attempts to overexpress full
length or truncated Hip1 proteins in Escherichia coli (E. coli) yielded
insoluble protein (data not shown) and we suspected that the
presence of 11 cysteine residues and 5 predicted disulfide bridges
within the protein hindered our initial efforts at refolding the protein
in vitro [12]. To overcome these challenges, we developed a method
to successfully refold Hip1 under anaerobic conditions, which
resulted in correctly folded, active protein (described in detail in
Methods). Hip1 (minus the first 49 amino acid segment which
contains within it a Type II signal sequence) with an in-frame N-
terminal polyhistidine tag was expressed in E. coli, immobilized on
nickel (Ni2+) beads and allowed to completely refold under reducing
conditions in an anaerobic chamber. To promote refolding of Hip1
into its native conformation, the protein was refolded on the beads
in a step-wise procedure using buffers containing varying concen-
trations of denaturant as well as reducing and oxidizing agents. The
protein rich elution fraction was further purified on an anion
exchange column (Figure 1A). Since the different peaks in the
elution spectrum likely represent differently refolded species, protein
fractions corresponding to each peak were tested for activity and
only the fraction that showed the highest level of enzyme activity
(indicated by the arrow in Figure 1) was used for subsequent
experiments. Similar methods were used to express and purify a
Hip1 protein containing a serine to alanine mutation in the
predicted active site at Ser228 (Figure 1B). Purity of Hip1 and
Hip1(S228A) proteins was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 1A, B).
Circular dichroism (CD) analysis (Figure 1C) showed that both
proteins contain alpha-helical structures as indicated by the negative
bands at 222 and 208 nm. CD spectra for wild-type Hip1 and
Hip1(S228A) were identical, indicating that mutating the serine at
residue 228 does not affect the overall folding of the protein.
Hip1 exhibits serine protease activity
Hip1 shares 30%, 38% and 32% identity with the TPP A, TPP
B and TPP C serine proteases from Streptomyces lividans and
contains a catalytic triad (Ser228, Asp463, His490) that is typically
present in serine proteases [11,13]. Thus, while Hip1 is predicted
to encode a serine protease, previous reports were unable to detect
protease activity and the enzymatic activity of Hip1 has not been
conclusively established [24,25]. To determine the enzymatic
activity of purified recombinant Hip1, we first tested its activity
against general protease and esterase substrates (Figure 2A, B). We
found that Hip1 exhibited esterase activity against the ester
substrate p-nitrophenylbutyrate (Figure 2A), indicating that the
purified protein was active. Importantly, Hip1 exhibited protease
activity
against
the
general
protease
substrate
azocasein
(Figure 2B). In contrast, Hip1(S228A), carrying a mutation of
the serine residue in the active site of the protein, was unable to
hydrolyze azocasein (Figure 2B), indicating that Hip1 catalytic
activity was necessary for its protease activity. To further
investigate the enzymatic activity of Hip1 against peptide
substrates, we used the peptides Ala-Pro-Ala and Gly-Pro-Leu,
which are substrates for TPP A and TPP B, as well as Ala-Pro-Ala-
Arg, which is a substrate for TPP C. We also included Ac-Ala-Pro-
Ala-Arg to test if blocking the N-terminus prevents enzymatic
cleavage of the peptide substrate [11]. These peptides were
synthesized with the addition of a C-terminal p-nitroanilide (pNa)
chromophore, and Hip1 enzyme activity against these peptides
was assessed first in an endpoint spectrophotometric assay.
Figure 2C shows that Hip1 shows the best activity against the
Ala-Pro-Ala-pNa and Gly-pro-Leu-pNa substrates. Taken togeth-
er, these data show that Hip1 is a serine protease that is capable of
hydrolyzing ester and peptide substrates.
We used a continuous spectrophotometric assay using the
chromogenic substrate Ala-Pro-Ala-pNa to test inhibition of Hip1
protease activity with inhibitors for the major classes of proteases
(Figure 2D). Hip1 proteolytic activity is abolished in the presence
of 4-(2-Aminomethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF). AEBSF is
a serine protease-specific active site inhibitor that sulfonylates only
the active site serine to inhibit catalysis [26]. Hip1 activity was
abolished by leupeptin and significantly reduced by chymostatin
and antipain, all three of which block both serine and cysteine
proteases [27,28]. However, the cysteine protease inhibitor E-64,
Author Summary
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) faces adverse conditions
within host cells and has evolved many mechanisms to
adapt quickly to the hostile immune environment. We
have previously shown that an Mtb factor, Hip1, is
important for Mtb virulence and for modulating host
immunity. While Hip1 was predicted to be a protease, its
enzymatic activity and molecular mechanism of function
remained
unclear.
We
have
now
characterized
the
biochemistry of Hip1 and conclusively show that Hip1 is
a serine protease that can process peptide substrates.
Further, we have identified a physiological target for Hip1
activity in Mtb, the Mtb chaperone-like protein GroEL2.
Interestingly, cleavage of GroEL2 by Hip1 converted
GroEL2 from a multimeric cell wall-associated protein to
a monomeric form that is secreted extracellularly. Impor-
tantly, we show that cleavage of GroEL2 by Hip1 is
biologically relevant and promotes dampening of macro-
phage responses during Mtb infection. Thus, our studies
have uncovered a fine-tuned strategy of immune modu-
lation at the protein level that involves regulating Hip1-
GroEL2 interactions and provide key molecular insights for
targeting Hip1 protease activity for inhibition.

the aspartyl protease inhibitor pepstatin, and EDTA, which
chelates the essential metal ion of metalloproteases [24,26] do not
inhibit Hip1 indicating that Hip1 is a serine protease. These results
demonstrate that Hip1 is a serine protease and support our
mutagenesis studies showing that Ser228 is required for Hip1
activity in vitro (Figure 2).
Mtb GroEL2 is a Hip1 substrate
To determine the mechanism for Hip1 function in Mtb
pathogenesis, we sought to identify physiological substrates of
Hip1 protease activity. We previously reported that full length Mtb
GroEL2 protein (Rv0440, hsp65) was present in mycobacterial cell
wall fractions, while a smaller cleaved form was secreted
extracellularly into culture supernatants [7]. This cleaved form
of GroEL2 was absent in the hip1 mutant, suggesting that Hip1
was necessary for GroEL2 processing. To test whether GroEL2 is
a direct target of Hip1 protease activity, we incubated purified
recombinant GroEL2 protein with recombinant Hip1 and assayed
for GroEL2 cleavage by Western blotting. The GroEL2 contains a
His6X-tag at the N-terminus and a C-terminal S-tag for ease of
purification as well as visualizing on Western blot. The presence of
the two different tags also allowed us to verify which end of the
protein is being cleaved. In the presence of Hip1, full length
GroEL2 protein was cleaved to a smaller form, GroEL2(cl), which
was detected by Western blotting using anti S-tag antibodies
(Figure 3A). Cleavage of GroEL2 was entirely dependent on the
catalytic serine active site as no cleavage was observed with the
Hip1(S228A) protein (Figure 3A) and GroEL2 processing was
inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor AEBSF (Figure 3B).
Further, incubation of Hip1 and GroEL2 under varying pH
conditions showed that Hip1 protease activity against GroEL2 was
optimal between pH 5.37 and 7.67 (Figure 3C). Thus, GroEL2 is
a substrate of Hip1 serine protease activity.
To examine protein-protein interactions between Hip1 and its
substrate GroEL2 within mycobacteria, we used the Mycobacte-
rium Protein Fragment Complementation (M-PFC) assay. This
assay is based on functional reconstitution of two small murine
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) domains that are independently
fused to two interacting proteins of interest. Interaction between
candidate proteins in vivo, i.e. within M. smegmatis, leads to
reconstitution of the DHFR domains and results in resistance to
trimethoprim. Figure 3D shows that Hip1 and GroEL2 interact
with each other, as seen by growth on plates containing
trimethoprim. This interaction appears to be more robust in the
presence of Hip1(S228A), suggesting as expected that interaction
of GroEL2 with catalytically inactive Hip1 may be stronger. These
interactions appear to be specific, as GroEL2 does not interact
with Mtb KdpE, InhA or SigA proteins. These results are
consistent with the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex
between Hip1 and GroEL2.
Hip1 proteolytically cleaves GroEL2 between Arg12 and
Gly13
To identify the site at which Hip1 cleaves GroEL2, we
electrophoretically separated Mtb cell-free culture supernatants,
and excised the bands corresponding to full length and cleaved
GroEL2 from SDS-PAGE. The eluted proteins were subjected to
LC/MS
mass
spectrometry,
which
indicated
that
cleavage
occurred within the first 18 amino acids at the N-terminus of
GroEL2 (data not shown). To further delineate the cleavage site,
we synthesized a peptide corresponding to amino acids 1-19 of
GroEL2 (AKTIAYDEEARRGLERGLN; m/z = 2163) and sub-
jected this to proteolysis by Hip1 (Figure 4B). LC/MS analysis
showed that the peptide was cleaved at two positions. Based upon
Figure 1. Purification of Hip1 and Hip1(S228A) by ion

proteins were purified by gravity column chromatography and anion
exchange chromatography. Top and bottom panels show the anion
exchange column elution peak profiles of recombinant Hip1 and

by SDS-PAGE analysis after each purification procedure. The arrows

and A12 for Hip1(S228A). (C) CD spectra of Hip1 and Hip1(S228A)

the masses of the most abundant cleavage products (IAY-
DEEARR; m/z = 1122) and (GLERGLN; m/z = 757) the positions
of the cleavage sites were determined using the FindPept tool on
the Expasy server. The small polar fragment, AKT, was not
detected due to its lack of retention on the reverse phase column.
The cleavages sites were determined to be between the Thre3 and
Ile4, as well as between Arg12 and Gly13 (Figure 4B). Hip1
mediated processing at the Thre3/Ile4 and Arg12/Gly13 cleavage
sites was completely inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor,
AEBSF (Figure 4C).
To test whether the cleavage site predicted by experiments with
the GroEL2 peptide corresponds to the cleavage site within the
intact Mtb GroEL2 protein, we developed an assay system in M.
smegmatis (Figure 4E). We first expressed Mtb GroEL2 containing a
C-terminal FLAG tag in M. smegmatis. Figure 4E shows that while
full length, uncleaved, GroEL2-FLAG is present in the culture
supernatant fraction of M. smegmatis, the cleaved form is absent. Mtb
GroEL2-FLAG is effectively cleaved in the presence of recombinant
Hip1 provided in trans (Figure 4E), thus providing a convenient assay
for testing Mtb GroEL2 harboring mutations in the predicted
cleavage sites. Although two cleavage sites were predicted by the in
vitro LC/MS study, we chose to focus the mutational studies on the
Arg12/Gly13 cleavage site, since this is the only cleavage site that
could have resulted in the GroEL2 mass shift observed in our earlier
studies. We expressed FLAG-tagged Mtb GroEL2 containing
mutations in the predicted Arg12 and Gly13 cleavage sites by
replacing Arg12 with proline (R12P), or both Arg12 and Gly13 with
prolines (R12P/G13P). M. smegmatis supernatants containing each
of the GroEL2 cleavage site mutants were incubated with Hip1 and
assayed for full length and cleaved GroEL2 by Western blot using

anti-FLAG antibodies. GroEL2 R12P showed reduced cleavage
while cleavage was completely abolished in GroEL2 R12P/G13P.
These results indicate that GroEL2 is cleaved between Arg12 and
Gly13 within the N-terminus of GroEL2. To test whether Arg12 and
Gly13 within GroEL2 are required for cleavage within Mtb, we
expressed intact FLAG-tagged GroEL2 and the cleavage site
mutant R12P/G13P in wild type Mtb and prepared protein extracts
from pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions to detect GroEL2
cleavage by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibodies (Figure 4F).
As predicted, the R12P/G13P mutant was unable to be cleaved,
thus demonstrating that cleavage of GroEL2 occurs between Arg12
and Gly13 within Mtb.
Hip1-dependent proteolytic cleavage converts
multimeric GroEL2 to a monomeric form
The oligomeric state of a protein is intrinsically linked to its
biological function and many chaperones have been shown to
form higher order oligomers [29] [30]. While the precise function
of GroEL2 in Mtb remains unclear, GroEL2 shows sequence
similarity to members of the heat shock protein (Hsp) family of
molecular chaperones [30]. To investigate the oligomeric state of
full length, uncleaved GroEL2 protein, we used analytical size
exclusion chromatography to determine its molecular weight. We
found that GroEL2 eluted as a multimer with the molecular
weight ranging from 198 to 321 kDa across 4 independent
Figure 3. Mtb GroEL2 is a physiological substrate of Hip1 protease activity. (A) Recombinant GroEL2 is cleaved by recombinant Hip1 but

detect GroEL2 and GroEL2(cl). (C) Optimal pH range for GroEL2 cleavage. Recombinant GroEL2 was incubated with recombinant Hip1 for 24 hours at

Hip1; GroEL2 and Hip1(S228A) or negative controls: vector and Hip1; vector and Hip1(S228A); GroEL2 alone; GroEL2 and KdpE; GroEL2 and SigA;

experiments (i.e. 198, 219, 258, 312 kDa), with the average
molecular weight corresponding to 245 kDa. Figure 5A shows a
representative experiment where the molecular weight of the
multimer is 312 kDa. We next asked whether cleavage of GroEL2
by Hip1 would alter its multimeric state. Full length GroEL2 was
incubated with Hip1 for 24 hours for complete cleavage to occur.
Nickel beads were used to remove Hip1 protein and the small N-
terminal fragment of GroEL2 (amino acids 1-12), leaving behind
the cleaved GroEL2 protein. The presence of cleaved GroEL2 was
confirmed using anti-S-tag antibodies as seen in the Western blot in
supplementary Figure S1A. Cleaved GroEL2 was then applied to
the size exclusion column and interestingly, eluted from the size
exclusion column as a monomer of approximately 54 kDa
(Figure 5A). To show that Ni2+-bead depletion removed the
majority of the Hip1, we performed a Western blot using anti-His
antibodies and showed that Hip1 protein was absent from depleted
fraction (Supplementary Figure S1B). Thus the predominant
protein eluting from the size exclusion column is cleaved GroEL2.
These results show that proteolytic cleavage by Hip1 converts
GroEL2 from a multimer to a monomer (Figure 5A and 5B).
The cleaved form of GroEL2 complements the hip1
mutant hyperinflammatory phenotype
We have previously shown that Hip1 modulates macrophage
responses by limiting macrophage activation and dampening the
production of TLR2-dependent proinflammatory responses [6–8].

and analyzed by Western blot with anti-FLAG antibody (to detect GroEL2) and anti-SigA antibody (to detect the sigma 70 subunit of RNA
polymerase). Data (A–F) are shown as one representative experiment from three independent experiments.

Thus the hip1 mutant strain induces significantly higher levels of
proinflammatory cytokines compared to wild type Mtb. While
several studies have reported that purified GroEL2 protein is
capable of inducing cytokine production in macrophages in vitro,

proteolytic cleavage of GroEL2 in infection of macrophages and
its contribution to the hyperinflammatory phenotype of the hip1
mutant, we generated a hip1 mutant strain complemented with a
secreted, cleaved form of GroEL2. This strain was constructed by
cloning GroEL2(cl) (starting at amino acid G13) downstream of a
signal sequence derived from the secreted Mtb Ag85B protein and
containing a C-terminal Myc tag. We confirmed that this protein
was present in the supernatant fraction by Western blotting with
anti-Myc antibody (Supplementary Figure S2A). We also com-
pared levels of endogenous GroEL2 in each of the Mtb strains used
for infection of macrophages (Supplementary Figure S2B). To
determine the effect of introducing cleaved GroEL2 into the hip1
mutant, we infected macrophages derived from the bone marrow

phage supernatants, 24 hours post-infection. As shown previously,
the levels of IL-6, IL-1b, and TNF-a were significantly increased
in the absence of Hip1 (Figure 6) [8]. This enhanced cytokine
production was complemented by ectopic expression of Hip1
protein, which restored wild type levels of IL-6, IL-1b, and TNF-a
(Figure 6). Interestingly, expression of cleaved GroEL2 in the hip1
mutant strain significantly abrogated the hyperinflammatory
response induced by the hip1 mutant (Figure 6). This finding
suggests that the enhanced cytokine responses induced in hip1
mutant-infected macrophages are directly linked to defective
GroEL2 cleavage and that Hip1-dependent proteolytic processing
of GroEL2 contributes to dampening early macrophage responses.
To provide further mechanistic insights into GroEL2 cleavage,
we tested whether full length and cleaved GroEL2 proteins exhibit
differences in eliciting cytokine production by macrophages. We
purified recombinant full length GroEL2 and cleaved GroEL2 and
compared the ability of purified GroEL2 and GroEL2(cl) to induce
cytokine production from macrophages. As shown in Figure 7A,
GroEL2 induced significantly higher levels of IL-6 and IL-1b
compared to GroEL2(cl), and this was partially dependent on
TLR2 (Figure 7B). These results suggest that cleavage of GroEL2
reduces its ability to induce proinflammatory cytokine responses
and that Hip1-dependent proteolysis of GroEL2 modulates
macrophage responses. The presence of GroEL2(cl) dampens
these proinflammatory responses since the levels of cytokines
induced by a 1:1 molar ratio of GroEL2 and GroEL2(cl) in
combination is less than the additive effect of each individual
protein (Figure 7C). Together, these studies reveal proteolysis of
effector proteins as a novel immune evasion mechanism employed
by Mtb to modulate host immunity.
We propose a model in which Hip1-dependent cleavage of
multimeric GroEL2 results in release of cleaved monomeric
GroEL2 into the extracellular milieu (Figure 8). Within macro-
phages, this is likely to occur upon contact with the macrophage
cell surface and continue within the phagosomal compartment. In
contrast, in the hip1 mutant, in the absence of cleavage, GroEL2 is
present as a multimer. Thus, conversion of multimeric GroEL2
into monomeric GroEL2 via Hip1 proteolysis is likely to be a
mechanism for regulating GroEL2 functions during Mtb patho-
genesis.
Discussion
Establishing the true enzymatic activity of Hip1 is critical for
understanding the mechanistic basis for how Hip1 modulates host
innate immune responses during Mtb infection. While hip1 was
predicted to encode a protease, the true enzymatic activity of Hip1
has remained unclear [24,25]. In this study, we demonstrate that
Mtb Hip1 is a protease with a serine-based active site and report
the identification of a physiological substrate, Mtb protein GroEL2
(Figure 3). Hip1 contains highly conserved a/bhydrolase fold
sequences and GxSxG consensus motifs that are typically present
in serine proteases, esterases and lipases. Also typical is the
catalytic triad consisting of the catalytic nucleophile serine active
site (Ser228), which associates with the proton carrier histidine
(His490), and a charge relaying aspartic acid (Asp463). The closest
structural orthologs of Hip1, which is localized to the cell envelope
of Mtb, are the serine proteases TPP A, TPP B and TPP C from
Streptomyces lividans, which are mycelium-associated proteases
involved in cell growth [11]. Previous work from our group

showed that GroEL2 is present as both a full length and a smaller
processed form in wild type Mtb and that this processing was
defective in the absence of hip1, suggesting that GroEL2 may be a
substrate for Hip1 protease activity [7]. However, our initial efforts
to characterize the enzymatic activity of Hip1 were hindered by
difficulties in producing soluble recombinant protein in E.coli, and
refolding of denatured protein from insoluble fractions using
standard refolding procedures did not result in correctly folded
protein as determined by 1-dimensional NMR (JN, unpublished
results) and circular dichroism (CD) analyses. While refolded Hip1
protein was reported to hydrolyze synthetic ester substrates in vitro
[25], this study was unable to detect protease activity against
general protease substrates and concluded that Hip1 encoded a
carboxyesterase. However, since serine proteases are capable of
hydrolyzing both ester and amide bonds, these data did not
exclude the possibility that Hip1 was a protease [33]. Thus the

true enzymatic activity of Hip1 remained unknown. We were able
to overcome the difficulties inherent in refolding a protein
containing multiple disulfide bonds by developing a method to
successfully refold Hip1 and Hip1(S228A) (Figure 1), under
reducing conditions in an anaerobic chamber, which resulted in
correctly folded, active protein. This allowed us to demonstrate
that Hip1 exhibits proteolytic activity against a general protease
substrate azocasein, synthetic peptides and against the GroEL2
protein. This protease activity requires catalytically active enzyme
and is inhibited by serine protease inhibitors (Figure 2) but not by
cysteine protease inhibitors. Interestingly, while Hip1 was inhib-
ited by AEBSF, this activity was not inhibited by PMSF. We
suspect this is due to the fact that PMSF lacks the longer, positively
charged amino group present in AEBSF, which binds in the S1
pocket
of
the
enzyme’s
active
site.
Overall,
our
findings
conclusively establish that Hip1 is a novel serine protease family
member and studies are underway to determine its 3-dimensional
structure by X-ray crystallography.
Mtb encodes over one hundred predicted proteases and it is
increasingly appreciated that proteases play an important role in
Mtb pathogenesis [34]. However, very few proteases have been
characterized with respect to their enzymatic activities and even
fewer have known physiological substrates. Moreover, many of
these proteases, including Hip1, belong to novel protease families
and therefore detailed biochemical characterization of these
enzymes and their substrates is an important goal [24,35,36]. In
this study we demonstrate that Hip1 is a serine protease and have
identified a key physiological substrate. We show that Hip1 cleaves
Mtb protein GroEL2 in vitro and have mapped this cleavage site to
the N-terminus of the GroEL2, between amino acid residues Arg12
and Gly13. Interestingly, the optimal pH range that we determined
for cleavage of GroEL2 in vitro (pH 5.65 to 7.39) overlaps with the
intraphagosomal pH of the Mtb-arrested phagosome (estimated to
be ,6.3), and that of the macrophage cell surface (,7.0) [37–40].
Since the pH of the lysosomal compartment is ,4.5 to 5.0, we
speculate that, within macrophages, GroEL2 cleavage occurs upon
contact with the macrophage cell surface and continues within the
phagosomal compartment but is unlikely to occur within the acidic
environment of the lysosome [39].
Additional insights into the relationship between Hip1 and
GroEL2 are provided by our data showing that Hip1 not only
directly cleaves GroEL2 but also impacts its oligomeric state. Size
exclusion chromatography using recombinant full length GroEL2
indicates the presence of a single species of multimeric GroEL2,
which is converted to a monomeric state after cleavage by Hip1.
The apparent molecular weight of the GroEL2 multimer is
consistent with a tetrameric or pentameric complex consisting of
four or five monomer subunits. Our observations are consistent with
previously reported data that GroEL2 is capable of forming higher
order oligomers under certain conditions [41]. To test for
concentration-dependent effects that may affect the oligomeric
state of the protein, we tested the oligomeric state of recombinant
GroEL2 over a range of concentrations and identified that GroEL2
is a multimer even at the lowest concentration at which it is
detectable on the size exclusion column (unpublished results). Thus,
the conversion of multimeric GroEL2 to monomers in the presence
of Hip1 is not a result of dilution of protein during the experimental
procedures. The 3-dimensional structure of GroEL2 has been
investigated by two separate X-ray crystallographic studies at 2.2
and 2.8 angstroms resolution. In both studies, GroEL2 was found to
be a dimer in the asymmetric unit [42–44]. Our studies show that
full length GroEL2 forms a multimer with an average molecular
weight that predicts a tetrameric structure. Experimental studies in
solution do not always agree with structural studies in determining
the oligomeric state of proteins, since packing in the crystal can
adversely
impact
oligomerization. While our analytical
size
exclusion studies are consistent with a multimeric structure for
GroEL2, it is possible that GroEL2 consists of a dimer of dimers.
Interestingly, a closer look at the crystal structure of GroEL2 revelas
that the first 60 amino acids are absent from the crystal subunits
[44]. This suggests that the N-terminal portion is most likely part of
a flexible region of the protein and any modification in that segment
of the protein will result in major structural changes. Based on our
size exclusion data, we propose a model in which Hip1-dependent
cleavage of multimeric GroEL2 results in release of cleaved
monomeric GroEL2 into the extracellular milieu. In contrast, in
the hip1 mutant, in the absence of cleavage, GroEL2 is present as a
multimer. Studies on E. coli chaperonin, GroEL, have demonstrated
that the N terminus of the protein is a crucial element for its
structure and that specific mutations at the N terminus lead to
disruption of the formation of higher order GroEL oligomers [45].
While it is unclear whether Mtb GroEL2 functions as a canonical
chaperonin, we show that removal of the N-terminal peptide of
GroEL2 following cleavage by Hip1 clearly promotes GroEL2
monomer formation, which may be advantageous to the pathogen.
Thus conversion of multimeric GroEL2 into monomeric GroEL2
via Hip1 proteolysis is likely to be a mechanism for regulating
GroEL2 functions during Mtb pathogenesis.
To investigate the role of cleaved, monomeric GroEL2 in Hip1-
dependent innate immune responses to Mtb, we examined a key
phenotype
of
hip1
mutant-infected
macrophages.
We
have
previously shown that the cell envelope in the hip1 mutant is
altered such that infection of macrophages with this mutant
induces a more rapid onset and significantly higher levels of
proinflammatory cytokines compared to wild type Mtb infection
[6–8]. Thus Hip1 dampens proinflammatory responses in Mtb-
infected macrophages. Our data supported a model in which
contact between the hip1 mutant and macrophage cell surfaces,
early in infection, triggered a more rapid and robust activation of
TLR and inflammasome pathways in macrophages, which in turn
ameliorated TB disease progression and immunopathology at later
stages [8]. Since purified full length GroEL2 protein has been
implicated in modulating cytokine responses in murine and human
Figure 8. Model of Hip1-GroEL2 interactions. Proteolysis of full
length GroEL2 by Hip1 converts multimeric GroEL2 to
monomers. In the cell wall of wild type Mtb, GroEL2 multimer
interacts with the Hip1 protease, which cleaves GroEL2 and leads to
release of GroEL2 monomers extracellularly. In contrast, in the hip1
mutant, GroEL2 remains in its multimeric form and is released
extracellularly as a multimer.

macrophages in vitro, we sought to investigate the role of Hip1-
mediated GroEL2 cleavage in modulating these cytokines by
asking whether there was a connection between the defective
processing
of
GroEL2 in
the
hip1
mutant
strain
and
its
hyperinflammatory phenotype [31,32,46–48]. When we ectopi-
cally expressed the monomeric, cleaved form of GroEL2 into the
hip1 mutant strain, we found that the cytokine levels induced by
this engineered strain were comparable to the low levels induced
by wild type Mtb and the hip1 mutant complemented with Hip1
(Figure 6). Thus provision of monomeric GroEL2 to the hip1
mutant almost completely restored wild type cytokine levels,
indicating that the cleaved, monomeric GroEL2 is biologically
relevant and significantly contributes to Hip1-mediated dampen-
ing of innate immunity. Interestingly, we found that purified
recombinant GroEL2(cl) protein is less stimulatory than full length
GroEL2 when exposed to macrophages (Figure 7A, B) and is
capable of dampening the stimulatory effect of full length GroEL2
(Figure 7C). These data suggest that Hip1-mediated proteolysis of
GroEL2 contributes to the ability of Mtb to dampen macrophage
proinflammatory responses during infection [8].
GroEL2 has been implicated in a wide variety of processes,
ranging from modulating immune responses and conferring
resistance to stress, to chaperone-like functions [31,32,41–44,46–
51]. GroEL2 is highly induced in response to environmental cues
during infection like heat shock, oxidative stress, growth in
macrophages and hypoxia [30,49–52]. GroEL2 is an abundant
Mtb protein and is a dominant contributor to the potent immune
response elicited by Mtb Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) [53,54].
Purified GroEL2 protein has also been shown to induce cytokine
responses when exposed to macrophages, and have adhesion-like
properties when localized to the Mtb cell wall [31,32,46–48,55,56].
Mtb is unusual among bacteria in possessing two GroEL proteins,
the cytoplasmic protein GroEL1, which is highly homologous to
the E. coli GroEL chaperonin, and GroEL2, which is localized to
the cell envelope and whose functions appear to be more diverse.
While GroEL2 exhibited only weak ATPase activity in vitro, the
crystal structures of GroEL2 suggest that it has chaperone-like
qualities and may assist in protein folding or antigen presentation
[41–44,46]. All the studies described here were conducted with full
length GroEL2. In light of our finding that Hip1 cleavage of
GroEL2 impacts macrophage functions, it is interesting to
speculate that multimeric and monomeric GroEL2 may have
distinct functions. Further studies with the two oligomeric forms of
GroEL2 will allow us to dissect their potential differential functions
at the host-pathogen interface, along with the identification of
additional pathogen-derived or host substrates of Hip1 proteolysis.
It is important to consider the studies presented here within the
larger context of the role of proteases in Mtb pathogenesis.
Compared to other bacterial pathogens like Yersinia and Chlamydia,
relatively little was known about proteases in Mtb [57,58]. However,
in the past decade, several proteases have been implicated as
virulence factors. For example, MarP (Rv3671) is a periplasmic
protease that was shown to be required for Mtb resistance to acid
and oxidative stress and exhibited protease activity against synthetic
peptide substrates [16–18]. PepD, a secreted serine protease that
promotes Mtb virulence was shown to hydrolyze the general
protease substrate casein [19, [20]. Both these proteases also
exhibited autoproteolytic activity but their physiological substrates
remain unknown. As examples of proteases with known substrates,
the intramembrane protease Rip1 (Rv2869c) was shown to be
involved in regulating cell envelope mycolic acids by cleaving Mtb
anti-sigma factors leading to release of the sigma factors SigK and
SigL which in turn regulate cell envelope composition [5,59].
Further, Rip1 cleaves a penicillin-binding protein, PBP3 under
conditions of oxidative stress [60]. The serine protease MycP1 is
required for secretion of ESX-1 substrates, which are known to be
important for Mtb virulence [61]. The authors demonstrated that
MycP1 directly cleaved its substrate EspB and mapped the cleavage
sites within the EspB protein [61]. Our studies on Hip1 and the
examples of proteases described here underscore the idea that, as
enzymes that allow for quick responses to changing environmental
conditions, proteases offer a unique mechanism for regulating Mtb
responses at the protein level. This allows Mtb to rapidly orchestrate
immune evasion strategies that promote disease progression and
facilitate adaptation to the host immune milieu.
As a cell surface protease involved in modulating host immune
responses [6–8] and conferring resistance to cell envelope-directed
stresses, Hip1 is an attractive target for inhibition [34]. Hip1-
deficient Mtb is more susceptible to cell wall directed stresses [7,9],
induces robust innate immune responses and causes mild immu-
nopathology and significantly prolonged survival in infected mice,
despite high bacterial burdens [6–9,25]. We speculate that Hip1
inhibitors have the potential to synergize with antibiotics to increase
susceptibility to drugs and/or serve as adjunctive immunomodula-
tory therapeutics that elicit beneficial immune responses and thus
improve or shorten anti-TB regimens. Using the information gained
through our detailed analyses of Hip1 enzymatic activity and its
molecular interaction with its substrate GroEL2, studies are
underway to determine the 3-dimensional structure of Hip1 and
develop inhibitors of the enzyme-substrate complex.

Expression and purification of recombinant proteins in E.
coli
Hip1 and Hip1(S228A).
The plasmids pET28Hip1D49 and
pET28Hip1D49 (S228A) were transformed into E. coli BL21 Star
(DE3) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for protein expression. Luria-
Bertani (LB) broth (1L) containing 50 mg/mL kanamycin was
inoculated with 5 mL of overnight culture and incubated at 37uC
to an OD600 of 0.6 to 1.0. The cells were cooled to room
temperature
for
15–30
minutes
after
which
1 mM
IPTG
(isopropyl b-D-thiogalactopyranoside, Gold Biotechnology, St.
Louis, MO) was added and the cells were allowed to incubate
overnight at 25uC. The cells were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm
for 1 hour. The pellet containing Hip1 or Hip1(S228A) was
resuspended in 16 PBS (Boston Bioproducts, Ashland, MA),
sonicated and centrifuged at 10,000 rpm to separate the soluble
and insoluble fractions. No protease inhibitors were used for this
purification. Using a dounce homogenizer, the pellet containing
the inclusion bodies was washed by resuspending in 50 mM Tris-
HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.5% Triton-X followed by
centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 1 hour. After washing twice, the
inclusion bodies were resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
100 mM NaCl, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol (BME) and 8 M urea
and incubated overnight at 4uC while gently stirring to allow for
complete solubilization of the proteins within the inclusion bodies.
Nickel (Ni2+) resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was added to the
solubilized protein and allowed to equilibrate for 1 hour at 4uC
before adding the suspension into a gravity column. The next steps
were carried out in an anaerobic chamber at 4uC as follows. The
proteins immobilized on the Ni2+-charged beads were allowed to
slowly refold into native conformation by stepwise decreasing the
amount of urea in the wash buffer in the presence of a redox pair,
reduced (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) and oxidized glutathi-
one (Calibiochem/EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA), within the
anaerobic chamber. The beads were washed with 10 column
volumes of buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM
NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol, 1 mM reduced glutathione,
0.2 mM oxidized glutathione with varying urea concentrations of
8 M, 6 M, 3 M, 1 M and no urea for wash buffers 1-5,
respectively. Protein was eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0,
100 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, 5% glycerol and dialyzed
against 50 mM Tris pH 8.0 (Buffer A) using 10 kDa molecular
cutoff dialysis tubing. The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a
MonoQ column with Buffer A and eluted using a gradient of
Buffer B (50 mM Tris, pH8.0, 1 M NaCl). The MonoQ elution
spectrum showed multiple peaks corresponding to differently
refolded species. Protein fractions corresponding to each peak
were tested for activity and for subsequent experiments only the
fraction that showed highest level of activity was used. Glycerol
was added to a final concentration of 10%, the protein was
aliquoted and stored at -80uC. The expressed proteins were each
present as single bands on SDS-PAGE.
GroEL2.
The plasmid, pACYCDuet-1 GroEL2 was trans-
formed into E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for
protein expression. LB broth (1L) containing 34 mg/mL chloram-
phenicol was inoculated with 5 mL of overnight culture and
incubated at 37uC to an OD600 of 0.6 to 0.8. The cells were cooled
to room temperature for 15–30 minutes after which 1 mM IPTG
was added and the cells were incubated overnight at 28uC. The cells
were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 1 hour. The cell pellet
containing GroEL2 was resuspended in 50 mM NaPO4 pH 8.0,
300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, plus protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), sonicated and centrifuged at
10,000 rpm for 1 hour to remove cell debris. The soluble fraction
was incubated with Ni2+-charged beads for 1 hour at 4uC and then
applied to a gravity column. The cell lysate in the gravity column
was first washed with Buffer C (50 mM NaPO4 pH 8.0, 300 mM
NaCl) containing 20 mM imidazole and then with Buffer C plus
50 mM imidazole. The protein was eluted with 250 mM imidazole
in Buffer C and dialyzed overnight in Buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 8.0). The dialyzed protein was loaded onto a MonoQ column
equilibrated with Buffer A and eluted using a gradient of Buffer B
(50 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl). The protein was further purified
by size exclusion S200 column equilibrated with Buffer D (50 mM
Tris pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl). The purified protein was concentrat-
ed, aliquoted and stored at 280uC.
Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and visualized as a single
band by staining with 0.05% Coomassie blue R-250. The
concentrations of purified proteins were determined by Bradford
method using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard.
Preparation of recombinant GroEL2 and GroEL2(cl) for
macrophage stimulation
GroEL2 and GroEL2(cl) (minus the first 12 amino acids), each
bearing an in-frame N-terminal 6XHis-tag were expressed in E.coli
BL21 star (DE3) (as described above). The cell pellet containing
GroEL2 or GroEL2(cl) was resuspended in binding buffer (20 mM
Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole, pH 7.9, 200 mg/ml
lysozyme, 1.8 mg/ml DNase) plus protease inhibitor cocktail (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), sonicated and centrifuged at 16,
0006g for 90 min to remove cellular debris and clarify. The soluble
fraction was added to Ni2+- charged beads in a gravity column. The
cell lysate in the gravity column was first washed with wash buffer 1
(20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 60 mM imidazole, pH 7.9) and
then wash buffer 2 (10 mM Tris-HCl) to remove residual salts from
the column. To remove endotoxin, the cell lysate was washed with
0.5% ASB-14 (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in 10 mM Tris-HCl.
Finally, the lysate was washed with 10 mM Tris-HCl to remove any
excess detergent. The protein was eluted with 1 M imidazole in
10 mM Tris-HCl and dialyzed overnight in 16 PBS buffer. The
protein was further purified by size exclusion chromatography on
GE Superdex 75 10/300 GL column. The purified protein was then
concentrated. The endotoxin levels for each protein were ,10 ng21
ml21 mg21 as determined using LAL Chromogenic endotoxin
quantitation kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).
Circular Dichroism (CD)
CD data was acquired using a Jasco J-810 Spectropolarimeter.
The spectra was recorded from 200 to 280 nm at room
temperature with a scan rate of 20 nm/min and a bandwidth of
1.0 mn Each spectra was the average of five scans. Protein
concentration was 5 mM for both Hip1 and Hip1(S228A) in buffer
containing 50 mM phosphate pH 7.0 plus 150 mM NaCl. The
spectra of the buffer was recorded under the same conditions and
subtracted from the sample spectra. The data was then converted
to molar ellipticity and plotted using Prism 6.0. The plot for the
molar ellipticity between 200 to 250 nm is reported.

broth), with the addition of 25 mg/ml kan (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) for the hip1 mutant, and, for complemented strains,
10 mg/ml streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or 50 mg/
ml hygromycin (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) was added.
Construction of mycobacterial plasmids and strains
GroEL2-FLAG.
To construct FLAG-tagged GroEL2 driven
by its own promoter, the groEL2 gene was amplified from Mtb
H37Rv genomic DNA using forward primer 59-ACGTCTA-
GATGGTAGCCGATGCCGGTGTTG-39 and reverse primer
59-AGTAAGCTTTCACTTGTCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTC-
CGAGCCGCCCGAGCCGCCGAAATCCATGCCACCCATG-
TC-39 to clone GroEL2 into the XbaI and HindIII sites of pTC
(kindly provided by Dr. Sabine Ehrt) with a C-terminal FLAG tag.
Forward primer 59-ACGAGATCTATGGCCAAGACAATTGC-
GTAC-39 and reverse primer 59-AGTAAGCTTTCACTTG-
TCGTCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCCGAGCCGCCCGAGCCGC-
CGAAATCCATGCCACCCATGTC-39
were
used
to
clone
GroEL2 into BamHI and HindIII sites of pMV762 with C-terminal
FLAG tag.
GroEL2 (R12)-FLAG.
The R12 mutation was introduced
into the pTC GroEL2-FLAG construct by site-directed mutagen-
esis using primers 59-GAGGCCCGTCCAGGCCTCGAGCG-
GGGC-39 AND 59-GCCCCGCTCGAGGCCTGGACGGGC-
CTC-39.
GroEL2 (R12P G13P)-FLAG.
The R12P and G13P muta-
tions were introduced into the pTC GroEL2-FLAG construct by
site-directed mutagenesis using primers 59-GAGGCCCGTC-
CACCACTCGAGCGGGGC-39 and 59-GCCCCGCTCGAG-
TGGTGGACGGGCCTC-39. All mutations were confirmed by
sequencing.
Secreted GroEL2(cl)-FLAG.
To express the cleaved form of
GroEL2, GroEL2 (cl), the groEL2 gene (minus the first 13 amino
acids) was amplified from the Mtb genome using forward pri-
mer
59-ACGCAGCTGGGCCTCGAGCGGGGCTTGAACG-

39 and cloned into the PvuII and HindIII sites of pMV762, down-
stream of the predicted N-terminal signal sequence from Mtb
antigen 85 complex B NH2- MTDVSRKIRAWGRRLMIG-
TAAAVVLPGLVGLAGGAATAGA-OH and an in-frame C-
terminal Myc tag.
Preparation of protein extracts from M. smegmatis and
Mtb strains
Each M. smegmatis and Mtb strain was grown to an OD600 of
0.6–0.8 in Sautons’ medium plus 0.05% Tween 80, then pelleted,
washed, resuspended into Sautons’ medium minus Tween 80 and
grown for 22 hours at 37uC. Supernatants were concentrated by
using Centricon Plus-70 (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Each pellet was
resuspended in 50 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl, 34.3 mM BME
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), protease inhibitor cocktail (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX), and lysing matrix B beads (MP
Biomedicals, Solon, OH) and processed by bead beating for 3
cycles of 20 seconds. The lysate was then centrifuged at 12,000
rpm for 20 min at 4uC, and 100 ml was removed for protein
estimation by Bradford method using BSA as the standard.
Enzyme assays
Protease activity assays against a general protease substrate,
azocasein, was performed with 1%–5% azocasein (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) in 16 TBS buffer pH 7.4 (Boston BioProducts,
Ashland, MA). Azocasein was incubated with 1 ug each of purified
recombinant Hip1, Hip1(S228A), BSA (Thermo Scientific, Rock-
ford, IL) or the protease Subtilisin Carlsberg (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) at 37uC for 30 min in a total volume of 200 mL. The
reactions were terminated with 200 mL of 10% trichloroacetic acid
and incubated for 30 min on ice. The reactions were then
centrifuged at 13, 200 rpm at 4uC for 10 min after which 200 mL
of the supernatant was transferred to a 96 well plate. Next, 50 mL
of 1.8 N NaOH was added to each reaction mixture and the
absorbance was read at 440 nm. The enzyme activities are
expressed as units of enzyme/mg protein (one enzyme unit is the
quantity of enzyme required to increase absorbance by 0.01 units
at 440 nm). Endpoint assays showing Hip1 peptidase activity were
conducted as follows. Hip1 (7.5 mM) was incubated with 1.5 mM
of each of the following peptide substrates in separate reactions:
APA-pNa, GPL-pNa, Ac-APAR-pNA, APAR-pNA (AnaSpec,
Fremont, CA) in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 for 18 hours at 25uC.
Elastase (4 mM) was used in a positive control reaction. Cleavage
of the peptide substrates was detected by monitoring the increase
in
absorbance
at
410 nm
using
a
Cary
50
Bio
UV-Vis
spectrophotometer.
To test for esterase activity, Hip1 (7.5 mM) or PreScission
Protease (0.6 mM) (GE Healthcare) was incubated with 100 mM p-
nitrophenylbutyrate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in 50 mM
Tris, pH 8.0 at 25uC. Hydrolysis of the ester substrate was
detected in a continuous assay by monitoring an increase in
absorbance at 410 nm.
Visualizing GroEL2 cleavage and western blotting
Purified recombinant GroEL2 (6.6 mM) was incubated with
either Hip1 or Hip1(S228A) (19.8 mM) in 16 TBS buffer (Boston
BioProducts, Ashland, MA) for 24 hours. Protein samples were
added to 46SDS-PAGE loading dye, boiled for 10 min, separated
on NuPAGE 10% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen, Carslbad, CA), and
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad, Berkeley,
CA). Membranes were blocked in TBST (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM
Tris-HCl pH 7.0, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% Blotto (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) for 1 hour at room temperature
or 1% BSA (anti-sigma 70) for 2 hours at 4uC, and probed with
antisera overnight at 4uC. Antisera included rabbit polyclonal anti-
Myc (1:10 000 dilution in 3% Blotto; Novus Biologicals, Littleton,
CO), anti-FLAG (1:1000 dilution in 5% Blotto, Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO), anti-S-tag (1:5000 dilution in 5% Blotto, Novagen,
Darmstadt, Germany), anti-sigma 70 (1:2000 dilution in 1% BSA,
NeoClone, Madison, WI), and anti-His tag (1:2000 dilution in 5%
Milk, Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Membranes were washed in
TBST and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with
Immunopure goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugated second-
ary antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) (for anti-S-
tag and anti-sigma 70) or Immunopure goat anti-rabbit IgG
peroxidase
conjugated
secondary
antibody
(Thermo
Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA) (for anti-Myc). Blots were developed
using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate kit
or NBT/BCIP kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) and
visualized using UVP Biospectrum imaging system (Upland, CA).
To determine the optimal pH of Hip1 cleavage of GroEL2, a
series of reactions were set up in buffers containing 50 mM sodium

phosphate with 150 mM NaCl at a pH range of 4.26, 4.85, 5.37,
5.65, 5.96, 6.14, 6.69, 6.86, 6.93, 7.16, 7.39, 7.67, 8.05, and 8.64.
Initially the buffer for both GroEL2 and Hip1 was switched to
50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 plus 150 mM NaCl. The
samples were then concentrated and diluted 1:100 in the
appropriate buffer. The samples were incubated for 24 hours at
37uC. Aliquots of the samples were taken and analyzed by
Western blotting using mouse anti-S-tag antibody.
Inhibitor profiling of Hip1
Peptide substrate.
The effect of protease inhibitors on Hip1
activity was determined by measuring the proteolytic cleavage of
Ala-Pro-Ala-pNa. Hip1 (4 mM) was pre-incubated with inhibitor
for 30 min in 50 mM Tris, pH 8, 25uC and protease activity was
measured by the addition of 1.5 mM Ala-Pro-Ala-pNa. The final
concentrations of the inhibitors were AEBSF (2 mM), PMSF
(1 mM), Chymostatin (0.2 mM), Leupeptin (0.4 mM), Antipain
(1.0 mM), E-64 (1 mM), Pepstatin (0.3 mM), and EDTA (10 mM)
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI)
GroEL2 substrate.
Hip1 or Hip1(S228A) (19.8 mM) was
added to 6.6 mM of purified recombinant GroEL2 protein and
incubated for 24 hours at 37uC in the presence or absence of the
protease inhibitors as follows. Bestatin hydrochloride (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MI) was resuspended in H2O to a final
concentration 0.3 mM. AEBSF (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MI) was
resuspended in H2O to a final concentration 1 mM. PMSF
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) was resuspended in methanol to
a final concentration of 1 mM. PMSF (Sigma), Bestatin (Sigma)
and AEBSF (Fisher) at 1 mM were added to reaction mixtures
containing 1 microgram of recombinant GroEL2 and Hip1.
Following the 24 hour incubation at 37uC, one fifth of the reaction
was taken for Western blot analysis.
GroEL2 cleavage site identification and LC/MS/MS
analysis
To prepare protein samples of GroEL2 and GroEL2(cl) for LC/
MS analysis, we made pellet and supernatant fractions (as
described above) from wild type Mtb. For dialysis, the protein
samples were injected in dialysis cassette with a 2 kDa molecular
weight cut-off (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) using 21 gauge 1
inch
beveled
needle
and
dialyzed
against
400 ml
50 mM
ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.0. After overnight dialysis, the
samples were taken out and concentrated using Millipore Amicon
ultra 0.5 ml 3 kDa centrifugal filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
The dialyzed protein samples (20–25 mg) were separated on 10%
SDS-PAGE gel. The bands of interest, a blank spot and a BSA
band were cut out of the gel and stored in 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate until LC/MS analysis. A synthetic peptide corre-
sponding to the first 19 N-terminal amino acids of GroEL2 (NH2-
AKTIAYDEEARRGLERGLN-OH) was synthesized (Biosynthe-
sis). 1 mM of this peptide was incubated either alone, with Hip1
(5 mM), or with Hip1 and the serine protease inhibitor AEBSF in
500 mM Tris, pH 8, 18 hrs, 25uC. Samples were analyzed by
LC/MS/MS on an Agilent 1100 binary pump HPLC and
Thermo Fisher LTQ XL ion trap mass spectrometer (Stanford
University). Samples were diluted with water and the injection
volume was 10 uL. The column was a 10062.1 mm Thermo
Hypersil Gold C18. The elution profile consisted of initial
conditions of 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water)/5% B (0.1%
formic acid in acetonitrile) for 1 minute, then a continuous
gradient to 100% B over 17 min, then remained at 100% B for 3
minutes at a flow rate of 250 uL/min. Ionization was in positive
ESI with mass range 150–1000 m/z. To determine the location of
the enzymatic cleavage sites within the 19 amino acid peptide, the
program FindPept on the ExPASy server was utilized. FindPept
identifies
peptides
that
result
from
unspecific
cleavages
of
polypeptides from their experimental masses.
Mycobacterial-Protein Fragment Complementation (M-
PFC)
The M-PFC plasmids pUAB100 (hyg) and pUAB200 (kan) were
a kind gift of Dr. Adrie Steyn, University of Alabama Birmingham
and have been previously described [62]. The bait plasmid was
constructed by PCR-amplifying groEL2 from H37Rv genomic
DNA using primers 59- GAT CCGAGATCTGAATCACTTCG-
CAATGG-39 and 59- GAAGCCATCGATGAAATCCATGCC
ACCCATG-39 and subsequent ligation to ClaI/BamHI linearized
pUAB100. The prey plasmid was constructed by PCR-amplifying
hip1 and hip1(S228A) 59-AGCCTTGAATTCCGGGTC TGC-
TCTGGCAGC-39
and
59-
AGCCTTATCGATGCACTTG-
GCGCCGCTGG-39
and
subsequent
ligation
to
MunI/ClaI
linearized pUAB200. Control plasmids carrying inhA, sigA or kdpE
were kindly provided by Dr. Adrie Steyn. The M-PFC bait and
prey plasmid constructs were transformed into M. smegmatis using
the previously described protocol [62]. Protein-protein interaction
between gene products were analyzed by subculturing kan/hyg
transformants on 7H11 plates supplemented with 10% ADC
glycerol, and 1% Difco yeast extract tryptone medium (Becton
Dickenson, Sparks, MD), with the addition of 25 mg/ml kan
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 50 mg/ml hyg (Roche Diagnos-
tics, Indianapolis, IN) and 20 mg/ml trimethoprim (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
Size exclusion chromatography
GroEL2 and Hip1 proteins were concentrated to 30–100 mM
and loaded onto a Superdex 200 5/150 GL column (GE
Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with 50 mM sodium
phosphate pH 7.0 plus 150 mM NaCl. The fractions containing
the GroEL2 and Hip1 proteins were collected, concentrated, and
incubated together overnight at 37uC to ensure complete cleavage.
The reaction mixture was then incubated with Ni2+ beads for 1–
2 hours at 4uC to allow for binding of the GroEL2 cleaved N-
terminal peptide and Hip1 to the beads. The reaction mixture
supernatant was then concentrated and injected on the size
exclusion column. Elution times of proteins with known molecular
weights were used to obtain a standard curve by plotting log of the
molecular weight verses Kav (partition coefficient). The Kav is
determined by the equation:
Kav = (Ve – Vo)/(Vc2Vo)
The elution volume of blue dextran is the value used for the void
volume (V0), Ve is the elution volume of the proteins, and Vc is the
geometric column volume, which is determined by the equation:
Vc = r26p6l
where r is the radius of the column and l is the column length.
The proteins used to determine the standard curve are
Ovalbumin (44 kDa), Conalbumin (75 kDa), Aldolase (158 kDa),
Ferritin
(440 kDa)
and
Thyroglobulin
(669 kDa),
Carbonic
Anhydrase
(29 kDa),
Ribonuclease
A
(13.7 kDa),
Aprotinin
(6.5 kDa). The standard curve was plotted using GraphPad Prism
6.0.
Macrophage infection and cytokine assays
Murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM) were
generated as previously described [8] Briefly, bone marrow cells
from C57BL/6 mice were grown in DMEM/F-12 medium
(Lonza) with 10% FBS (HyClone), 2 mM glutamine, 10% L-cell

conditioned medium (LCM) for 7 days of differentiation at 37uC
with 5% CO2. For infection, macrophages were plated onto 24-
well plates (36105 per well). Bacteria were resuspended in
DMEM/F-12 medium containing 5% LCM and sonicated twice
for 5 seconds each before addition to adherent monolayers. Each
bacterial strain was used for infection in triplicate at an MOI = 10
and infection of macrophages was carried out for 4 hours as
previously described [8]. To determine intracellular CFU, one set
of infected macrophages was lysed in PBS containing 0.5% Triton
X, and plated onto 7H10 agar plates containing the appropriate
antibiotics. For stimulation of macrophages with recombinant
proteins, endotoxin-free GroEL2 and GroEL2(cl) in 5% LCM
were added to C57BL/6 or TLR2-/- BMM for 24 hours. Cell-free
supernatants from macrophage monolayers were isolated at
various time points and assayed for cytokines by ELISA kits for
IL-6, IL1-b, and TNF-a (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).
Assays were carried out according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Uninfected macrophages were used as controls for each experi-
ment.
Statistical analysis
The statistical significance of data was analyzed using the
Student’s unpaired t-test (GraphPad Prism 5.0a). Data are shown
as mean 6S.D. of one representative experiment from three
independent experiments.
