Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenicity depends on its
ability to inhibit phagosome acidiﬁcation and maturation processes
after engulfment by macrophages. Here, we show that the secreted
Mtb protein tyrosine phosphatase (PtpA) binds to subunit H of the
macrophage vacuolar-H+-ATPase (V-ATPase) machinery, a multisub-
unit protein complex in the phagosome membrane that drives
luminal acidiﬁcation. Furthermore, we show that the macrophage
class C vacuolar protein sorting complex, a key regulator of endo-
somal membrane fusion, associates with V-ATPase in phagosome
maturation, suggesting a unique role for V-ATPase in coordinating
phagosome–lysosome fusion. PtpA interaction with host V-ATPase
is required for the previously reported dephosphorylation of
VPS33B and subsequent exclusion of V-ATPase from the phago-
some during Mtb infection. These ﬁndings show that inhibition
of phagosome acidiﬁcation in the mycobacterial phagosome is
directly attributed to PtpA, a key protein needed for Mtb survival
and pathogenicity within host macrophages.

T
he etiological agent of tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, is one of the most devastating infectious agents
in the world. One-third of the world’s population is exposed to
Mtb, which causes nearly 3 million deaths annually, and is
expected to cause an estimated 1 billion new infections by 2020
(1). Mtb primarily infects alveolar macrophages that provide
the ﬁrst line of defense against microbial invasion. Normally,
macrophages’ engulfment of foreign bodies results in the for-
mation of phagosome, which matures in a process that remodels
its membrane and luminal contents through interaction and
fusion with the endosomal network (2, 3). These membrane
fusions allow the phagosome to acquire antimicrobial properties,
including a profoundly acidic lumen, the hallmark of the mac-
rophage maturation process (4).
Macrophages acidify the phagosomal lumen by recruiting
V-ATPase, a multisubunit protein-pump complex that actively
transports protons across membranes using energy from ATP
hydrolysis (5). Structurally similar to ATP synthase, the V-
ATPase consists of a membrane-bound domain with ﬁve differ-
ent subunits and a cytosolic domain composed of subunits A–H
(reviewed in ref. 6). Delivery of the V-ATPase to the phagosome
results in a pH decrease from 6.5 to 5.0 within minutes of phag-
osome maturation (7). This acidic environment inhibits bacterial
growth and enhances the activities of antimicrobial hydrolases.
Acidic pH is also crucial for proper vesicular trafﬁcking, directing
the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes or vesicles harboring
antimicrobial molecules (8). Therefore, phagosome acidiﬁcation is
a critical event that prompts the destruction of invading particles
into constituents for antigen presentation and the initiation of
adaptive immune responses (9).
Intracellular pathogens that enter host cells through the
phagocytic or endocytic pathway have developed mechanisms to
counter the acidic environment within phagosomes. For instance,
Salmonella enterica adapts to lower pH by activating acid toler-
ance genes (10). Yersinia pseudotuberculosis blocks phagosome
acidiﬁcation by directly inhibiting V-ATPase activity in mouse
macrophages (11), and Legionella pneumophila secretes sub-
strates into the host phagocyte to inhibit vacuole acidiﬁcation
through interaction with V-ATPase subunit A (12). In the case of
Mtb, lack of acidiﬁcation in the mycobacterial phagosome is
mainly because of the absence of the V-ATPase on the phag-
osomal membrane (13). However, the mechanism by which Mtb
accomplishes this remains undeﬁned.
Mtb is known to be capable of sensing engulfment by macro-
phages and subsequently interferes with host signaling pathways to
promote its intracellular survival (14–16). Mtb possesses a wide
repertoire of signal transduction systems, including 11 two-com-
ponent systems, 11 eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kina-
ses (PknA-PknL), two protein tyrosine phosphatases (PtpA and
PtpB), and the newly identiﬁed protein tyrosine kinase (PtkA)
(17–19). These signaling proteins play key roles in bacterial ad-
aptation and response to host defense mechanisms. PtpA, a
secreted protein phosphatase, is essential for Mtb pathogenicity,
participating in the arrest of phagosome maturation within the
host macrophages (14, 20). Earlier, we identiﬁed the host vacuolar
protein sorting 33B (VPS33B) as the cognate substrate of PtpA
(18). VPS33B is a member of the class C VPS complex that reg-
ulates membrane fusion within the endocytic pathway (21). PtpA
dephosphorylation of VPS33B inactivates this host protein, lead-
ing to inhibition of phagosome–lysosome fusion (14).
In this work, we report that Mtb PtpA binds to subunit H of
macrophage V-ATPase to block V-ATPase trafﬁcking and phag-
osome acidiﬁcation. We further identiﬁed a unique role for V-
ATPase in the process of phagosome–lysosome fusion. Our results
demonstrated that Mtb success in inhibiting phagosome acidiﬁca-
tion and establishing infection in host macrophages relies on PtpA.
Results
Mtb PtpA Binds Subunit H of Human V-ATPase. Previously, we used
a substrate-trapping mutant of PtpA to pull down the catalytic
substrate of PtpA, VPS33B, from the Mtb-infected THP-1 cell
lysate (14). Interestingly, when we used the WT recombinant
PtpA as bait, we were able to pull down another, previously
unidentiﬁed, 55-kDa macrophage protein (14). We identiﬁed
this protein by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to be subunit
H of human V-ATPase (Fig. S1A) and veriﬁed its identity by
Western blot analysis (Fig. 1A). In vitro kinase assay and phos-
phoamino acid analysis showed that subunit H was phosphory-
lated on threonine and could not serve as a catalytic substrate for
the tyrosine phosphatase PtpA (Fig. S1 B and C). In vitro pro-
tein–protein interaction analysis of PtpA and subunit H dem-
onstrated direct contact between mycobacterial PtpA and host
V-ATPase subunit H (Fig. 1 B and C). A hyperbolic curve ﬁtting

the 1:1 Langmuir binding model and a dissociation constant of
Kd 1.1 × 10−7 M indicate a high level of afﬁnity between the
two proteins.
PtpA Binds to Amino Acids 220–402 of Subunit H. We determined the
PtpA binding site on subunit H by constructing overlapping
polypeptide fragments of subunit H. As shown in Fig. 1D, only
fragments that included the linker region (amino acid 220–402)
were able to bind PtpA with high afﬁnity. This ﬁnding is con-
sistent with previous predictions that the linker region of subunit
H is involved in protein–protein interactions (22).
The C-Terminal α-Helix of PtpA Binds Subunit H. Subunit H was
reported to interact with dileucine-based motifs on the HIV Nef
protein (23). Therefore, we performed site-directed mutagenesis
to investigate whether dileucine motifs or other leucine residues
on PtpA participate in binding subunit H (Fig. S2A). One mu-
tant, PtpAL146A, located in the C-terminal α-helix, was defective
in binding subunit H (Fig. 1E). This ﬁnding and the previous
ﬁndings are consistent with the predicted structure of PtpA
bound to subunit H using the protein-docking algorithm 3D-
Garden (Fig. S2 B and C) (24). Interestingly, the PtpAL146A
mutant retained its phosphatase activity with kinetics similar to
the WT protein (Fig. S2D). This result is in line with our ob-
servation that subunit H is not a catalytic substrate but rather
a binding partner of PtpA.
PtpA Binds V-ATPase Subunit H in Vivo. Using immunoprecipitation,
we investigated the in vivo interaction between PtpA and subunit
H during macrophage infection. Antibodies against subunit H
coimmunoprecipitated PtpA from lysates of THP-1 cells infected
with H37Rv Mtb expressing WT PtpA, conﬁrming the physio-
logical relevance of PtpA/subunit H interaction during Mtb in-
fection (Fig. 2A).
To further monitor PtpA interaction with subunit H, we used
a modiﬁed split-Trp mycobacterial assay for detecting protein–
protein interactions (25, 26). In this system, a tryptophan auxo-
trophic strain of Mycobacterium smegmatis only grows in the
absence of tryptophan if the tested proteins interact with each
other. As shown in Fig. 2B, coexpression of subunit H and PtpA
fusion proteins restored mycobacterial growth on 7H9 agar
plates, conﬁrming protein–protein interaction within a surrogate
host. Coexpression with the binding-defective PtpAL146A did not
lead to mycobacterial growth, suggesting that this phosphatase-
active PtpA mutant lost its ability to bind subunit H. The phos-
phatase-defective PtpAD126A retained its subunit H binding
ability, further indicating the interaction is independent of the
catalytic activity of PtpA (Fig. 2B).
PtpA Binding to Subunit H Is Required for Mtb Intracellular Survival.
To test whether PtpA binding to subunit H is required for Mtb
pathogenicity, we investigated the ability of the binding-defective
PtpAL146A Mtb strain to survive in human THP-1 macrophages.
As shown in Fig. 2C, a ΔptpA strain complemented with a con-
struct encoding PtpAL146A was attenuated within the macrophage
in a manner similar to that of the ΔptpA knockout strain, whereas
the parental and the complement strains were able to establish
a stable infection after 3 d. Expression and stability of the WT
and mutant PtpA proteins in these strains were conﬁrmed with
Western blot analysis (Fig. S3A). At 6 d after infection, the
binding-defective strain showed a 2-log reduction in cfu com-
pared with the WT strain. Though the parental and comple-
mented strains entered into growth phase within the macrophage,
the ΔptpA and the binding-defective strains were continually
cleared, establishing the importance of PtpA interaction with the
V-ATPase machinery for Mtb survival within macrophages.

PtpA Inhibits Phagosome Acidiﬁcation. The in vivo PtpA/subunit H
interaction and the impaired intracellular survival of the binding-
defective PtpAL146A strain suggest that PtpA interferes with the
phagosome acidiﬁcation process. To examine this hypothesis, we
used FACS to analyze the pH of Mtb-containing phagosomes.
Parental and mutant strains were dually labeled with the pH-
sensitive pHrodo ﬂuorescent dye and the pH-insensitive Alexa
Fluor 488 while undergoing phagocytosis by THP-1 macro-
phages. Covalent labeling of the bacteria with ﬂuorescent dyes
does not affect PtpA secretion (Fig. S3B). Overlaid FACS his-
tograms showed a clear increase in the mean pHrodo ﬂuores-
cence intensity for phagosomes harboring ΔptpA Mtb, ΔptpA
complemented with the phosphatase-inactive ptpAD126A, and
ΔptpA complemented with the binding-defective ptpAL146A
(corresponding to pH 5.8, 5.6, and 5.55, respectively), compared
with phagosome containing parental and complemented Mtb
(corresponding to pH 6.7 and 6.4, respectively) (Fig. 3 A and B,
Fig. S4, and Table S1). These results indicate a direct functional
role for PtpA in the inhibition of Mtb phagosome acidiﬁcation,
which is dependent on both the binding ability and phosphatase
activity of PtpA.
To examine PtpA’s ability to modulate phagosome acidiﬁcation
independently of other Mtb proteins, we transfected THP-1
macrophages with GFP-fused constructs of parental and mutated
forms of PtpA in a mammalian vector. All constructs were
expressed at similar levels, and the survival and phagocytic ability
of the macrophages were not impaired by the transfection (Fig. S5
A and B). PtpA-transfected macrophages were infected with
Escherichia coli labeled with pHrodo and Alexa Fluor 350, and the
phagosomal pH was assessed by spectroﬂuorometry (Fig. S5C).
Expression of PtpA within THP-1 macrophages inhibited acidiﬁ-
cation of E. coli-containing phagosomes, whereas both catalyti-
cally inactive PtpAD126A and binding mutant PtpAL146A were
unable to block phagosome acidiﬁcation, showing a marked
decrease in phagosomal pH similar to untransfected and empty
vector control macrophages (Fig. 3C). Digital confocal microscopy
of the infected macrophages conﬁrmed these ﬁndings (Fig. 3D
and Fig. S5D). These results established that PtpA alone can ef-
fectively prevent phagosome acidiﬁcation in the macrophage. This
inhibition depends on both PtpA phosphatase activity and its
ability to bind to host V-ATPase machinery.
V-ATPase Machinery Recruits the Class C VPS Complex. The in-
teraction of PtpA with both subunit H and the previously de-
scribed VPS33B (14) suggested that the V-ATPase and class C
VPS complexes might be in close proximity or even directly in-
teract during phagosome maturation and endosome–lysosome
fusion. To investigate this hypothesis, we conducted immuno-
precipitation experiments in THP-1 macrophages using antibodies
against VPS33B as bait and probed for subunits H, B, and E of the
V-ATPase complex and VPS18 of the class C VPS complex by
Western blot. In uninfected THP-1 macrophages, faint bands
corresponding to subunits of the V-ATPase complex were cap-
tured with VPS33B and VPS18 when a higher amount of lysate
was used (Fig. S6A). This ﬁnding suggests that V-ATPase interacts
transiently with the class C VPS to regulate normal endosome–
lysosome fusion in resting cells. Furthermore, this interaction
is up-regulated upon phagocytosis of E. coli, as demonstrated by
the prominent bands of V-ATPase subunits captured 2 h post-
infection (Fig. 4A and Fig. S6A), further supporting that the
class C VPS complex interaction with V-ATPase has a key role in
phagosome maturation and fusion with lysosome.
Mtb PtpA Blocks the Interaction Between Class C VPS and V-ATPase
Complexes. When THP-1 macrophages were infected with Mtb
H37Rv, subunit H, B, or E of the V-ATPase machinery was not
captured using antibodies against VPS33B (Fig. 4A). Mtb in-
hibition of V-ATPase and class C VPS interaction is maintained
24 h postinfection (Fig. S6B). However, the V-ATPase subunits
coimmunoprecipitated with VPS33B and VPS18 in THP-1 mac-
rophages infected with ΔptpA. Complementation of the ΔptpA
mutant strain with WT ptpA restored the ability of Mtb to inhibit
class C VPS interaction with the V-ATPase complex. Further-
more, complementation with ptpAD126A, but not ptpAL146A,
restored Mtb inhibition of class C VPS and V-ATPase interaction
(Fig. 4A). These results indicate that Mtb infection disrupted the
V-ATPase and class C VPS association; PtpA is responsible for
blocking this interaction; and PtpA binding to subunit H is spe-
ciﬁcally necessary for this disruption.
VPS33B Remains Phosphorylated in THP-1 Macrophages Infected with
Binding-Defective PtpA. VPS33B phosphorylation is required for
phagosome–lysosome fusion, and Mtb PtpA dephosphorylation
of VPS33B blocks this process (14). Because the class C VPS
complex is recruited to the V-ATPase, we asked whether PtpA

binding to V-ATPase subunit H affects the phosphorylation
status of VPS33B during Mtb infection. To address this question,
we immunoprecipitated VPS33B and analyzed its phosphoryla-
tion with the antiphosphotyrosine antibody 4G10. When E. coli
was used to infect macrophages, VPS33B was phosphorylated
(Fig. 4B). However, as expected, when macrophages were infec-
ted with Mtb, down-regulation of VPS33B phosphorylation was
observed. The ΔptpA strain did not reduce VPS33B phosphory-
lation, and this was reversed by complementation with WT ptpA.
Interestingly, VPS33B remained phosphorylated in macrophages
infected with ΔptpA complemented with either the phosphatase-
defective ptpAD126A or the binding-defective ptpAL146A, despite
being catalytically active (Fig. 4B). This ﬁnding suggests that the
binding of PtpA to subunit H of V-ATPase is a prerequisite for
VPS33B dephosphorylation, which is consistent with our ﬁndings
that the loss of interaction with subunit H renders PtpA non-
functional within the host cell.
PtpA Binding to Subunit H Participates in the Exclusion of the V-
ATPase from the Mtb Phagosome. Disruption of the interaction
between class C VPS and V-ATPase by PtpA suggests that PtpA
directly impairs V-ATPase trafﬁcking to the Mtb phagosome.
To check the effect of PtpA on V-ATPase trafﬁcking, we used
digital confocal microscopy to monitor class C VPS and V-
ATPase localization within infected macrophages, represented
by VPS33B and subunit H, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 5A,
VPS33B and V-ATPase subunit H colocalized to the phagosome
of macrophages infected with E. coli. In contrast, whereas Mtb-
infected macrophage phagosomes were decorated with VPS33B,
subunit H was excluded, indicating a lack of V-ATPase recruit-
ment. However, the ΔptpA knockout strain exhibited colocaliza-
tion of VPS33B and subunit H on the mycobacterial phagosomal
membrane. Complementation with WT ptpA reversed this pattern
with a similar percentage of phagosomes lacking V-ATPase as
the WT strain (Fig. 5B). Corecruitment of subunit H and VPS33B
to the bacilli-containing phagosomes was not observed despite
complementation with either the catalytically inactive ptpAD126A
or the binding-defective ptpAL146A. Therefore, PtpA binding
to subunit H is needed for blocking V-ATPase trafﬁcking to the
Mtb phagosome, leading to the inhibition of Mtb phagosome
acidiﬁcation.
Although we have shown that the antibodies against VPS33B
and subunit H are highly speciﬁc (Fig. S7), to overcome any
potential cross-reactivity, we also performed double transfection
of the THP-1 macrophages with GFP and DsRed2-fused con-
structs of subunit H and VPS33B, respectively, allowing direct
visualization of host proteins’ localization within the macro-
phage. Colocalization of GFP-subunit H and DsRed2-VPS33B
in uninfected macrophages provides further support that V-
ATPase and class C VPS functions in the same pathway to
regulate normal endosome–lysosome fusion. When the trans-
fected macrophages were infected with the same Mtb strains,
similar patterns of subunit H and VPS33B localization was
observed compared with the immunoﬂuorescent-stained mac-
rophages (Fig. S8). This result further supports that PtpA
binding to subunit H is needed for the exclusion of V-ATPase
from the phagosome.
Discussion
More than a decade ago, Sturgill-Koszycki et al. (13) showed that
macrophages fail to acidify phagosomes containing mycobacteria
because these phagosomes did not accumulate the V-ATPase
responsible for phagosomal acidiﬁcation. This ﬁnding suggested
inhibition of the fusion between membrane vesicles harboring

ATPase complexes during infection. Immunoprecipitation was performed
with anti-VPS33B (α-VPS33B) using 2 mg of soluble lysate from THP-1 mac-
rophages infected with the indicated strain for 2 h and followed by Western
blot analysis with the indicated antibody. Rabbit IgG was used as negative
control. (A) The class C VPS (VPS33B and VPS18) interacts with the V-ATPase

plemented strain disrupted the host proteins interaction. (B) Western blot

the V-ATPase complex and the mycobacterial phagosome (13).
Despite the lack of a mechanistic explanation, the exclusion of
the V-ATPase complex during Mtb infection has become a long-
established paradigm. Here, we show that the lack of phagosome
acidiﬁcation is directly attributed to the Mtb-secreted protein
PtpA, which speciﬁcally inhibits V-ATPase trafﬁcking to the
mycobacterial phagosome during phagosome maturation.
The exact mechanism by which PtpA is secreted across the
phagosomal membrane remains unclear. However, using elec-
tron microscopy, neutralizing antibodies, and Western blot
analysis, we have previously shown that PtpA is present in the
host cytosol milieu (14, 27). There is evidence suggesting that
bacterial proteins <70 kDa in molecular size can cross the
phagosomal membrane (28). This observation might be related
to the more recent discovery that the ESX-1 secretion system
with its substrate ESAT-6 can activate the inﬂammasome and
perturb host cell membrane to facilitate the translocation of
mycobacterial proteins into the macrophage cytosol (29, 30).
Further investigation is needed to elucidate the mechanistic
details of PtpA secretion.
We have shown previously that Mtb PtpA dephosphorylates
the host macrophage protein VPS33B, a key regulator of mem-
brane fusion, leading to inhibition of phagosome–lysosome
fusion (14). In this study, we identiﬁed an additional key partner
to the process, subunit H of the host V-ATPase machinery. The
interaction with V-ATPase subunit H and dephosphorylation of
VPS33B are both required for PtpA inhibition of macrophage
phagosome–lysosome fusion and phagosome acidiﬁcation. We
were able to identify a catalytically active mutant, PtpAL146A,
which does not interact with subunit H. Because of its predicted
location within the core region of PtpA (Fig. S2 A and B), this
mutation most likely alters the conformation of the entire C-
terminal α-helix, leading to defective binding. The loss of either
PtpA phosphatase activity or subunit H binding renders PtpA
nonfunctional within the host cell.
During phagosome maturation, lysosomal V-ATPase is di-
rectly recruited to the phagosomal membrane for luminal acid-
iﬁcation (3). The class C VPS complex has been implicated in
this process as the membrane-tethering factor. Although studies
of Drosophila neurons and mammalian renal medulla cells have
shown interaction between subunits of V-ATPase and SNARE
proteins (31, 32), our studies of PtpA in Mtb demonstrate a di-
rect interaction between the class C VPS and V-ATPase. We
further showed that this mechanism is not limited to phagosome
maturation, because the same interaction could be detected,
albeit at a weaker level, in uninfected macrophages. This ﬁnding
suggests that class C VPS and V-ATPase interacts transiently in
the resting cell to regulate normal endosome–lysosome fusion,
and this association is likely up-regulated during phagocytosis to
deliver lysosomal contents to the phagosome. Our ﬁnding pro-
vides compelling evidence that V-ATPase is a key player in the
membrane fusion machinery, particularly in cooperating with the
class C VPS complex to tether the fusing phagosomal or endo-
somal membrane with the lysosome (Fig. 6). Disruption by Mtb
PtpA further exempliﬁes the importance of this interaction in
host defense mechanism.
With these results, our current model suggests a two-step
process for PtpA exclusion of V-ATPase and inactivation of
VPS33B. During Mtb infection, PtpA binding to subunit H may
ﬁrst disrupt initial membrane tethering and localize it to the
proximity of its catalytic substrate VPS33B (Fig. 6). Subsequent
dephosphorylation of VPS33B would then inactivate the entire
membrane fusion machinery and its downstream effectors, pre-
venting delivery of V-ATPase to the mycobacterial phagosome.
This mechanism would explain the failure of the phosphatase-
defective mutant PtpAD126A, which retains the capability of
binding to V-ATPase and disrupting host complex associations,
to shut down the host macrophage pathway completely. Our ob-
servation that VPS33B remains phosphorylated in both the
phosphatase-defective and binding-defective strain supports such
a two-step process, suggesting that PtpA binding to subunit H is
a prerequisite for VPS33B dephosphorylation. This phenomenon
is also supported by our confocal data, where both the PtpAD126A
and PtpAL146A strains failed to inhibit V-ATPase trafﬁcking to
Mtb phagosomes.
However, the mycobacterial phagosome is not an isolated
compartment; rather, it interacts extensively with early endo-
some to acquire nutrients, such as iron-bound transferrin, to
maintain survival within the host cell (33). Vesicle fusion in the
endocytic pathway depends on two membrane-tethering protein
complexes, class C core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET)
and homotypic fusion and protein sorting (HOPS) (34, 35). The
class C VPS complex serves as the core of both CORVET and
HOPS complexes through reversible association with CORVET-
speciﬁc (VPS3 and VPS8) and HOPS-speciﬁc (VPS39 and
VPS41) accessory subunits, which mediate early-to-late endo-
some fusion events and fusions with lysosome, respectively
(reviewed in ref. 36). Our results suggest that V-ATPase may
speciﬁcally interact with the HOPS complex during phagosome–
lysosome fusion (Fig. 6). Therefore, by binding to the V-ATPase,
PtpA could speciﬁcally localize to the phagosome–lysosome in-
terface, and CORVET-mediated early endosome fusions with
the phagosome will remain intact. This speciﬁc localization
mechanism would then allow PtpA to distinguish HOPS from
CORVET, thereby speciﬁcally excluding V-ATPase to inhibit
mycobacterial phagosome acidiﬁcation. In fact, a link between
the V-ATPase and HOPS complexes was observed by a previous
study demonstrating that the HOPS-speciﬁc subunit VPS41
failed to function in yeast that had mutations in the V-ATPase
complex (37). This ﬁnding suggests that the HOPS-speciﬁc
subunits VPS39 and VPS41 might be direct effectors of the V-
ATPase complex during phagosome–lysosome fusion (Fig. 6),
and the CORVET complex might be recruited to the phagocytic
pathway through a different mechanism. As the HOPS-speciﬁc
subunits are known to interact with activated Rab7 during
endosome maturation (38), it is likely that Rab7 is the upstream
activator of V-ATPase association with class C VPS complex.
Further experiments will be needed to fully characterize these
host cellular pathways in the context of mycobacterial infection.
Nonetheless, our study clearly demonstrates that the absence of
V-ATPase and the lack of mycobacterial phagosome acidiﬁca-
tion are directly attributed to the Mtb protein tyrosine phos-
phatase PtpA.
Materials and Methods
In Vitro Pull-Down Assay. In vitro pull-down assay with recombinant His-
tagged PtpA was performed as described previously (14).
Fig. 6.
A model for the speciﬁc exclusion of V-ATPase and the inhibition of
mycobacterial phagosome acidiﬁcation by PtpA. During infection, the V-
ATPase recruits the class C VPS complex, possibly associated with VPS39 and
VPS41 as the HOPS complex, aiding the tethering of the fusing phagosomal
and lysosomal membranes. PtpA, secreted into the host cytosol by Mtb,
binds to subunit H of the V-ATPase complex, disrupting the interaction be-
tween the two protein complexes and localizing itself near its catalytic
substrate, VPS33B. PtpA then dephosphorylates and inactivates VPS33B,
thereby shutting down the membrane fusion machinery. Binding to subunit
H, therefore, allows PtpA to speciﬁcally inhibit V-ATPase trafﬁcking to the
mycobacterial phagosome.

ALPHAScreen
Protein–Protein
Interaction
Assay.
An
assay
using
the
ALPHAScreen Histidine (Nickel Chelate) Detection Kit was performed
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Perkin-Elmer). Puriﬁed recombi-
nant protein was biotinylated using the EZ-Link Biotinylation Kit (Pierce)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Mycobacterial Split-Trp Protein–Protein Interaction Assay. DNA encoding PtpA
and subunit H were cloned into pJC10 and pJC11 vectors, generating
translational fusion constructs with the Ntrp and Ctrp fragments, respectively,
of the N-(5′-phosphoribosyl)-anthranilate isomerase under the control of the
acetamidase promoter. The split-Trp assay (26) was carried out as described
previously (25).
Infection of THP-1. THP-1 human-derived monocytes (ATCC; TIB-202) were
grown in RPMI medium 1640 (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% L-
glutamine (StemCell). THP-1 cells (1.0 × 106 or 5.0 × 105) were seeded onto
12- or 24-well tissue culture plates, respectively, and differentiated with 40
ng/mL 12-phorbol 13-myristate acetate in RPMI 1640 supplemented with
10% FBS and 1% L-glutamine. Infection of THP-1 macrophages was per-
formed using human serum-opsonized Mtb or E. coli DH5α at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 10:1. For Mtb intracellular survival studies, infected
macrophages (MOI 1:1) were harvested at deﬁned time points, lysed with
0.025% SDS, serial diluted, and plated on 7H10 agar medium supplemented
with appropriate antibiotics.
Immunoﬂuorescence Microscopy. THP-1 macrophages were seeded on cov-
erslips at 5.0 × 105 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates. Infection of THP-
1 macrophages and immunostaining was performed as described previously
(14, 39) (more details in SI Materials and Methods).
Measurement of Phagosomal pH. Assessment of the phagosomal pH of E. coli
and Mtb phagosomes was performed according to previous literature (40,
41). Bacteria were labeled with the pH-sensitive pHrodo probe (Invitrogen),
which emits red ﬂuorescence in acidic environment, and the indicated pH-
insensitive probes [Alexa Fluor 350 (Blue) and Alexa Fluor 488 (Green);
Invitrogen] according to established protocols (41). Phagosomal pH was
measured with either spectroﬂuorometry in the Fusion-Alpha HT Micro-
plate Reader (Perkin-Elmer) or with FACS in the FACSCalibur Flow Cytom-
eter (BD Bioscience). The calculated ﬂuorescence ratios of the pH-sensitive
and pH-insensitive probes were used to determine phagosomal pH ac-
cording to a calibration curve. pH calibration was performed by incubating
infected THP-1 macrophages in 10 mM phosphate-citrate buffer of pre-
determined pH (5.0–8.0) containing 145 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.5 mM
CaCl2, 10 mM glucose, 20 μM nigericin, and 4 μM monesin (Figs. S4 and S8).
Concanamycin (50 nM) was added to the macrophages to inhibit V-ATPase
proton transport in the indicated samples (more details in SI Materials
and Methods).
