Mothers whose infants varied in early biological characteristics (born at term, n  120; born at very low
birth weight [VLBW], n  144) were randomized to a target group (n  133) or developmental feedback
comparison group (n  131) to determine whether learning responsive behaviors would facilitate infant
development. The target condition included videotaped examples, problem-solving activities, and moth-
ers’ critique of their own behaviors through video procedures across 10 home visits. All target versus
comparison mothers showed greater increases across multiple responsiveness behaviors observed in 4
assessments conducted across 6–13 months of age; changes in emotionally supportive behaviors were
strongest for target mothers of infants born at VLBW. Increased maternal responsiveness facilitated
greater growth in target infants’ social, emotional, communication, and cognitive competence, supporting
a causal role for responsiveness on infant development. Although benefits were generally comparable
across risk groups, aspects of social and emotional skills showed greater change for those born at VLBW.
Evidence for responsiveness as a multidimensional construct was provided as well as the importance of
different aspects of responsiveness mediating the effect of the intervention on different infant skill
domains.

Decades of interest in responsive parenting is based, in part, on
the critically important role it is thought to play in promoting
children’s social–emotional, cognitive, and language outcomes
(e.g., Bornstein & Tamis-LeMonda, 1989; Londerville & Main,
1981; Olson, Bates, & Bayles, 1984). Responsiveness is an aspect
of supportive parenting referred to in several theories and research
frameworks including attachment (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, &
Wall, 1978; Sroufe, 1983), sociocultural (Rogoff, 1990; Vygotsky,
1978), and socialization of young children (Grusec & Goodnow,
1994; Maccoby & Martin, 1983). Although responsiveness has a
central role in various research frameworks, to date, much of
researchers’ knowledge regarding the influence of responsive par-
enting on children’s development is based on descriptive studies
(e.g., Bornstein & Tamis-LeMonda, 1989; Landry, Smith, Swank,
Assel, & Vellet, 2001). Although observational research can pro-
vide strong empirical support for inferring the importance of
responsive parenting for children’s development, experimental
designs are necessary to further researchers’ understanding of a
causal influence.
A recent meta-analysis on the available interventions targeting
the influence of maternal sensitivity–responsiveness demonstrates
support across a relatively small number of studies for the impor-
tance of this parenting style on an aspect of social–emotional
development, attachment security (Bakermans-Kranenburg, van
IJzendoorn, & Juffer, 2003). A second small group of intervention
studies targeting responsiveness has specifically focused on high-
risk children (e.g., premature, high irritability, adopted), with
evidence of positive consequences for cognitive and social skills
(e.g., Beckwith & Rodning, 1992; Juffer, Hoksbergen, Riksen-
Walraven, & Kohnstamm, 1997). In the present experimental
study, we addressed a number of objectives to further understand
the influence of responsive parenting on a broad range of infant
behavior.
Objective 1 and Related Hypotheses: Determine Whether
Changes in a Range of Maternal Responsiveness
Behaviors Result in Increases in Infant Skills
Examination of the responsiveness behaviors described in stud-
ies from different theoretical orientations reveals at least four
aspects: contingent responding, emotional–affective support, sup-
port for infant foci of attention, and language input that supports
developmental needs. Warm acceptance of infants’ needs and

interests with responses that are prompt and contingent on infants’
signals are often considered as behaviors that are responsive (e.g.,
Ainsworth et al., 1978; Sroufe, 1983). These are thought to support
infants’ ability to self-regulate by facilitating the development of
mechanisms for coping with stress and novelty and, ultimately, a
trust and bond with the caregiver through the process of internal-
ization (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bornstein & Tamis-LeMonda,
1989). This, in turn, promotes an interest and willingness for
infants to explore their environment, to continue to signal, and to
cooperate with caregiver requests (Baumrind, 1989; Darling &
Steinberg, 1993). The process is thought to occur through a three-
term chain of events in which infants signal, mothers respond in a
prompt and sensitive manner, and infants experience that their
needs are met in a predictable way (e.g., Bornstein & Tamis-
LeMonda, 1989).
Behaviors that emphasize emotional support may include the
presence of positive affective input (e.g., warmth, smiling) and the
absence of highly negative behaviors (e.g., harsh voice tone,
physical intrusiveness) and are thought to communicate affectively
the caregiver’s interest and acceptance (e.g., Darling & Steinberg,
1993). Contingent responsiveness and emotional support are de-
scribed as having a particular importance for children’s social
development (e.g., cooperation, regulation of affect) because they
alter children’s openness to parental socialization practices and
facilitate an understanding of how to make appropriate choices
(Grusec & Goodnow, 1994; Maccoby & Martin, 1983).
Support for infant foci of attention, a behavior associated with a
sociocultural framework, is thought to facilitate higher levels of
learning and self-regulation because it provides a structure, or
scaffold, for infants’ immature skills (e.g., Bruner, 1972; Rogoff,
1990; Vygotsky, 1978). Responsive parenting within this frame-
work includes behaviors that encourage joint engagement and
reciprocity in dyadic interactions (e.g., Bakeman & Adamson,
1984; Trevarthen, 1988). Maintaining as opposed to redirecting
supports infants’ immature attention and cognitive capacities by
not requiring a shift in attentional focus (Tomasello & Farrar,
1986). This type of sensitive parental input guides and structures
interactions so that the child begins to take a more active role and,
ultimately, assumes regulation of his or her own behavior (Rogoff,
1990; Vygotsky, 1978). Maintaining frequently relates to greater
vocabulary development (e.g., Akhtar, Dunham, & Dunham,
1991) and greater object exploration (Landry, Garner, Swank, &
Baldwin, 1996).
Conversations with infants have specific characteristics that
appear to support early language development. In a study investi-
gating the genetic versus environmental influences on infant com-
municative competence, two important early direct environmental
influences that were not confounded by shared genetic variance
were mothers’ imitation of their infants’ vocalizations and moth-
ers’ contingent vocal responsivity (Hardy-Brown & Plomin,
1985). Research also emphasizes how important it is for children
to receive rich language input (e.g., providing labels of objects and
actions and how these go together or function) in order to develop
vocabulary and semantic knowledge (Hart & Risley, 1995; Weiz-
man & Snow, 2001) and acknowledges the importance of this
occurring in infancy (Bruner, 1972; Kuhl et al., 1997).
As there is limited experimental research addressing whether
multiple aspects of responsiveness support infant development, our
first objective was to determine whether increases in mothers’
responsive behaviors resulted in increases in four aspects of in-
fants’ skills across the 1st year of life. To evaluate this possibility,
we conducted a randomized, experimental study in which we first
determined whether mothers could be facilitated to increase their
use of contingent responsiveness, emotional–affective support,
support for infant foci of attention, and quality of language input.
Target in contrast to the comparison mothers were hypothesized to
show higher levels and greater increases for each of these behav-
iors (Hypothesis 1a). When interacting with their mothers, the
target infants in contrast to those in the comparison group also
were expected to show higher levels and greater increases in three
skill areas: social (i.e., cooperation with maternal requests), early
communication (i.e., word use), and affective (i.e., increases in
positive and decreases in negative) domains (Hypothesis 1b).
To determine the extent to which these skills generalized to
situations in which mothers were not present, we evaluated these
same skills while infants were interacting with a novel adult as
well as in independent toy play. We hypothesized that when
interacting with a novel adult, target in contrast to comparison
infants would demonstrate higher levels and greater growth in the
same three skill areas evaluated when interacting with their moth-
ers (Hypothesis 1c). This situation was expected to be more
stressful because the adult was unfamiliar and, although respon-
sive, did not attempt to scaffold the infant’s individual learning
needs. This finding would support the notion that increased ma-
ternal responsiveness helps infants develop resources for coping
with stress and novelty (Goldberg, Grusec, & Jenkins, 1999) and
learn to self-regulate when maternal support is not present (Rogoff,
1990). In the second situation, an independent goal-directed play
task examining aspects of infants’ cognitive skills, the target in
contrast to the comparison infants were expected to show greater
gains in their play skills, as functional play with objects is theo-
rized to first occur in a social context with caregivers (Hypothesis
1d; Bruner, 1972).
Objective 2 and Related Hypothesis: Determine Whether
There Is Differential Effectiveness of Responsiveness for
Varying Infant Characteristics
To date, there is limited experimental research on the differen-
tial impact of responsiveness for infants who vary in birth status,
as most intervention studies of infants born preterm do not include
infants born at term (e.g., Patteson & Barnard, 1990). If the process
by which responsiveness facilitates children’s development is
through parental sensitivity and willingness to meet infants’ indi-
vidual needs, then one could hypothesize that responsive parenting
would have positive consequences that are comparable for children
of varying characteristics (Hypothesis 2). To test this possibility,
we included children born preterm at very low birth weight
(VLBW) to determine whether they would show comparable in-
creases in four skill areas. Similar effects of responsiveness on
high-risk children’s development would be consistent with de-
scriptions of the potential powerful self-righting tendency of the
caregiving environment to compensate for the types of biological
disadvantages experienced, for example, by infants born at VLBW
(Sameroff, Seifer, & Zax, 1982). Caregiving is frequently de-
scribed as an important factor for preventing less optimal devel-
opmental pathways for children who vary in their vulnerability for
628

negative outcomes, and support for this finding is found in obser-
vational studies (Landry et al., 2001).
Objective 3 and Related Hypotheses: Evaluate Whether
Different Aspects of Responsiveness Mediate the
Intervention Impact on Domains of Infant Development
Studies emphasizing responsiveness in terms of the contingency
of the response in ways that provide affective–emotional support
report
outcomes
such
as
secure
attachment
(Bakermans-
Kranenburg et al., 2003), use of social strategies (Goldberg,
Lojkasek, Gartner, & Corter, 1989), and decreased problem be-
haviors (Wakschlag & Hans, 1999). However, it has been sug-
gested that responsiveness is a broader construct that includes
distinct but conceptually related behaviors that provide support for
a range of cognitive and social skills (Martin, 1989; Van Egeren,
Barratt, & Roach, 2001). Studies defining responsiveness as a
broader construct comprising behaviors such as supportive stimu-
lation (e.g., language input), in addition to contingent responsive-
ness to signals, report positive consequences for cognitive skills
(e.g., Bornstein & Tamis-LeMonda, 1989) and greater growth in
both social and cognitive–language skills (Landry et al., 2001).
Rarely have different aspects of responsiveness (e.g., contingency,
stimulation) been considered within a single investigation, and
thus there is limited information on the extent to which different
aspects relate to different child outcomes. It may be that behaviors
typically examined in relation to secure attachment and/or social
skills also are important for children’s concept development and
language skills because they provide support for children’s efforts
through positive affect and warmth. An observational study that
did examine responsiveness from an interface of these two frame-
works found that emotional support and verbal input played a role
in understanding language development (Tamis-LeMonda, Born-
stein, & Baumwell, 2001).
Thus, the third objective was to determine whether different
aspects of responsiveness mediated the impact of the intervention
on different domains of infant skills and whether this was moder-
ated by VLBW status. We hypothesized that responsive behaviors
from an attachment framework would be particularly important for
infant social skills, whereas those from a sociocultural framework
would be important for understanding increases in early language
and cognitive development (Hypothesis 3a). In light of our expec-
tation that responsive behaviors would have a similar effect across
infants born at VLBW or at term, birth status was not expected to
moderate these relations (Hypothesis 3b).
The literature describes multiple aspects of responsiveness that
may provide differential support of infant development (e.g., so-
cial, cognitive). To date, however, there are limited empirical
studies that provide a test of the causal influence of these behaviors
on multiple aspects of infant development and whether this impact
differs for infants of varying characteristics. Thus, this study
addresses these goals.
Method
Participants
A medical record review approved by the Institutional Review Board
was used to determine eligibility and contact information. The cohort was
recruited from three hospitals serving families from lower income back-
grounds and included 264 mother–infant pairs who participated in 10
weekly home visits when the infant was 6–10 months of age.
In order to obtain a randomly split sample between the two study
conditions while also keeping the infant risk groups equal across condi-
tions, we used an equal number of markers per condition for each risk
group and drew out one marker per family, without replacement, after the
preassessment was completed. Of families contacted, 35% declined, but no
differences were found for a range of medical and demographic factors
(e.g., gender, birth weight) for participants versus decliners. Study attrition,
defined as not completing all 10 home visits and the pre-, interim, post-,
and follow-up assessments, was 9% (n  24) and primarily was due to
families’ inability to complete the program because of scheduling problems
or moving outside the study area. On a range of variables shown in Table
1, the only difference between families completing the program versus
those lost to attrition was for ethnicity, 2(3, N  282)  13.49, p  .004.
African American and “other” ethnicities were represented at higher num-
bers in the attrition group compared with Hispanic and Caucasian ethnici-
ties, 2(1, N  282)  12.22, p  .0005.
Expected differences were apparent between the infant risk groups on
medical variables for birth weight, F(2, 248)  1,430, p  .0001, and

gestational age, F(2, 254)  1,364, p  .0001, but no differences between
treatment conditions were found when collapsing across risk group (see

and shows that gender was the only demographic that differed across
conditions, 2(1, N  282)  5.01, p  .03. Socioeconomic status
(Hollingshead, 1975) was in the upper-lower-class to lower-middle-class
range (M  31.8, SD  12.3), which is consistent with a high school
education and clerical or semiskilled occupations. Target in contrast to
comparison mothers took 1 week longer to complete the program, F(1,
151)  4.09, p  .05, as extra time was required to schedule two home
visits with an alternate caregiver.
Procedure
Both study conditions required families to meet with a facilitator in their
homes for 10 visits that lasted about 1.5 hr, with the intent of visits
occurring on a weekly basis. Families were seen by staff masked to study
condition for assessments to evaluate maternal and infant behaviors, sched-
uled at ages corrected for gestational age. Each assessment included
videotaped living room and toy play situations and occurred 2 weeks prior
to Home Visit 1 (n  264; infant age: M  6.2 months, SD  0.66), after
Home Visit 5 (n  253; infant age: M  8.4 months, SD  1.1), 2 weeks
after the final Home Visit 10 (n  258; infant age: M  10.7 months, SD 
1.5), and about 3 months later (n  240; infant age: M  13.1 months,
SD  1.5). In order for participants to be assessed at the post- and
follow-up evaluations, all 10 home visits had to be completed. Thus, each
family was seen for 14 visits.
Rationale and description for the intervention condition.
The playing
and learning strategies (PALS) condition incorporated factors known to
impact intervention efficacy: short term, starting later in 1st year of life, a
clearly defined focus, and linking intervention goals to theoretical models
(Bakermans-Kranenburg et al., 2003). It also acknowledged the importance
of including the family’s social context into the intervention, supporting
facilitators to accept the role of change agent and involving mothers by
active construction of knowledge and practice. The PALS home visits were
guided by a detailed curriculum that included behaviors linked to the four
aspects of responsiveness supported by the literature, and the format
included facilitators (a) asking mothers to review their experiences across
the last week related to their efforts to try the targeted behaviors, (b)
describing the current visit’s targeted behavior, (c) watching and discussing
with mothers the educational videotape of mothers from similar back-
grounds, (d) videotaping mothers interacting with their infants in situations
that the mothers selected (e.g., toy play, feeding, bathing) with coaching,
(e) supporting mothers to critique their behaviors and the infants’ responses
during the videotaped practice, and (f) planning with mothers as to how to
integrate responsive behaviors into their everyday activities with laminated
cards defining the behavior and its importance provided to support practice.
A key component of the intervention was the facilitator coaching moth-
ers to use the target behaviors, including commenting on the infants’
responses when these behaviors were used. This procedure provided moth-
ers with immediate feedback about their success in using targeted behav-
iors and supported them to begin to pay close attention to the impact these
behaviors had on their infants. Thus, mothers had immediate feedback in
their success in using the behaviors and how to start paying close attention
to their impact on their infants. Facilitators were trained to use the curric-
ulum in a flexible manner to meet the learning needs of individual families.
Table 1 in the Appendix (which is available on the Web at http://
dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.42.4.627.supp) provides a detailed descrip-
tion of the goal for each home visit.
Description of the comparison condition.
For the comparison condi-
tion, developmental assessment screening (DAS) facilitators made the
same number of home visits, scheduled similar to the PALS condition.
Visits included discussion with mothers about new infant skills observed
during the previous week, assessment of infant development across a range
of skills with a screening measure, and feedback provided to mothers.
Maternal questions about infant skill levels were answered, and mothers
were provided handouts on common issues such as sleep, feeding, and
pacifiers. PALS mothers also received these handouts. When mothers had
questions regarding how to facilitate infant development, they were en-
couraged to talk with their health care providers.
Systematic training of facilitators and assessment of fidelity of interven-
tion implementation.
Initial training for both conditions occurred with a
review of the procedures and role play as well as discussion of what type
of information could and could not be provided in each condition. Imple-
mentation fidelity occurred through a stringent monitoring system to assure
that fidelity remained at high levels throughout the study period using two
approaches. First, study investigators accompanied each facilitator on
monthly intervention and control home visits during which strengths and
weaknesses were documented. These were then discussed and adjusted to
ensure the study conditions were faithfully implemented. Also, monthly
3-hr group meetings were held in which facilitators worked with senior
investigators and reviewed their videotapes of home visits and discussed
problems. This step informed the development of an implementation man-
ual that provided systematic information regarding challenges with sug-
gested solutions.
Another aspect of fidelity, mothers’ knowledge and skill, was docu-
mented with a checklist in Sessions 4 and 8 as the mother taught behaviors
to an alternative caregiver. For each concept, mothers were rated across
0–4 on the basis of the extent to which she could demonstrate and explain
the importance of the concept. A score of 4 was found for 50% of mothers
across the six concepts, and a score of 3 was found for 58%–87% of the
mothers depending on the concept. Contingent responsiveness, a complex
concept, showed understanding at this level for 81% of the mothers.
Assessment procedures.
With the exception of 4 families evaluated in
their homes, all infants and their mothers were evaluated in the develop-
mental laboratories at the two sites (Houston, Texas, and Galveston,
Texas). At each assessment, infant communication and social skills were
evaluated with videotaped procedures while they interacted with their
mothers and an examiner. Their independent goal-directed play also was
evaluated using videotaped coding procedures. The social interaction with
mothers involved a 15-min naturalistic living room situation in which
mothers were requested to do what they would typically do with their
infants. Books, toys, magazines, and other items found in a living room
were provided during this time similar to longitudinal study procedures
previously used (Landry et al., 2001). A second context, the toy play
situation, was included to determine whether results were similar across
types of activities. In toy play, mothers were provided a group of toys and
asked to play for 10 min with one or more of the toys with their infant.
Measures
Maternal observed behaviors.
Observational measures quantified with
either frequencies or global ratings evaluated changes in targeted behaviors
in the two contexts, as these are sensitive to variability in maternal
interactive behaviors and the prediction to later developmental outcomes
(Landry, Smith, Miller-Loncar, & Swank, 1998). The use of frequencies
and ratings together is thought to capture the most information about
parenting behaviors (Darling & Steinberg, 1993). Ratings are an effective
means for assessing behaviors that reflect a disposition that permeates all
of a mother’s interactive behaviors (e.g., contingent responsiveness; Bake-
man & Brown, 1980), whereas frequency counts capture aspects of ma-
ternal behavior where quantity is important (e.g., maintaining).
Targeted behaviors were conceptualized into four types related to the
scaffolding support provided. All targeted mother behaviors have been
included in a large body of previous descriptive research and have shown
to predict various aspects of infant and child development (e.g., exploratory
630
LANDRY, SMITH, AND SWANK

goal-directed play, language, following requests; e.g., Landry et al., 1996;
Landry, Smith, Swank, & Miller-Loncar, 2000). Contingent responsive-
ness was coded as one type of maternal responsiveness. The second type,
emotional–affective support, included both responsive (i.e., positive affect,
warm sensitivity) and nonresponsive (i.e., restrictiveness, physical intru-
siveness, harshness voice tone) behaviors. The third type, support of infant
foci of attention or maintaining of infant attention, was coded as positive
responsiveness, whereas redirecting was considered a lack of responsive-
ness. The final type, quality of language input, included verbal scaffolding,
labeling of objects and actions, and verbal encouragement. Definitions
for coding of the observed behaviors are provided in Table 2 of the
Appendix, which is available on the Web at http://dx.doi.org/
10.1037/0012-1649.42.4.627.supp.
Mothers’ interactions were quantified using rules separating them into
events based on verbal and nonverbal behavior and time separating these
behaviors using procedures previously described (Landry et al., 2001).
Global ratings using a 5-point scale were used to quantify other maternal
behaviors. Two of the mother behaviors coded for multiple levels (i.e.,
labeling objects and actions) were combined into two variables using a
scaling technique: labels for objects and labels for actions. One approach
to scaling discretely ordered responses is to use an ordinal regression
model with a random intercept term. A cumulative probability, or propor-
tional odds, model was used with random intercept and fixed response
scale effects to estimate a latent variable level using a nonlinear mixed
modeling process (SAS Institute, 1999). As the latent variable increases,
the likelihood that the mother engages in higher levels of labeling
increases.
Infant behaviors with mothers.
Behaviors were coded as responses if
they followed within 3 s of a maternal attention-directing event. Outside of
this interval, we also coded for infant behaviors that attempted to attract
their mothers’ attention. For the social domain, infant cooperation with
requests was coded. Word approximations and use of words were coded for
the communication domain, and negative and positive affect were coded
for the emotional domain. Definitions for all infant behaviors are included
in Table 3 of the Appendix, which is available on the Web at
http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0012-1649.42.4.627.supp.
Infant behaviors with examiner.
Infants also were evaluated in a toy-
centered, scripted interaction with an examiner while seated in an infant
chair with an attached adjustable table tray. Although the requests were
scripted to assure a standard procedure, examiners were trained to engage
infants with positive voice tone, facial expression, and pacing as well as to
hold the infant’s attention with positive verbal encouragement. The script
included 20 interactive events in which infants were requested to engage
verbally or gesturally with the examiner who sat facing the infant so that
joint attention and eye contact easily could be accomplished. For example,
the examiner would say, “Hi, [baby’s name]. Can you talk to me? What can
you tell me?” or “Here is Lenny the lion [puppet]. He has funny hair. Do
you want to touch it?” After each request, the examiner paused for 10-s to
allow the infant ample time to engage with the object, vocalize, or use other
social behaviors. In order to make the 10-s pause appear natural, the
examiner continually engaged all infants with head nods or short verbal
encouragements such as “yeah” or “okay.”
Independent goal-directed play.
Infants were videotaped while playing
alone with five sequentially presented toys (rainstick rattle, nesting cups,
five blocks and a cup, flutter rattle, smiley face manipulative toy). Each toy
was presented for 1 min while the examiner, who remained in the room,
only interacted minimally to bids for attention by saying she could not play.
When an infant was off task for a 15-s period (i.e., not touching or looking
at the toy), examiners nonverbally prompted the infant to return to play by
tapping on the tray or a by giving a brief demonstration. A description of
the coding scheme for this measure and its use with similar populations is
found in other publications (Landry, Miller-Loncar, Smith, & Swank,
2002; Landry et al., 2000). Every 10 s, the highest level of infant play was
determined on the basis of a hierarchical level-of-play scale that ranged
from 1 (off task) to 13 (goal-directed play with mastery) based on devel-
opmental sequences reported in the literature (e.g., Fenson, Kagan, Keas-
ley, & Zelazo, 1976), although for these infants, behaviors most often
included looking with or without holding to active manipulation and early
functional use of toys. The percentage of the 10-s intervals across toys that
included functional play was used in data analyses.
In previous studies, this measure has been correlated with the Bayley
Mental Scale (Bayley, 1993), providing concurrent validity for the task’s
ability to capture early cognitive abilities. Additional support comes from
descriptive studies in which independent play at 4 and 6 years was
predicted by early cognitive language (Landry et al., 2000) and nonverbal
reasoning ability (Landry et al., 2002).
Coding procedures and interrater reliability.
The coding staff from
both sites (Houston: n  4; Galveston: n  2) was trained by an expert,
senior coder under the direction of Susan H. Landry. Initial training
involved each member achieving interrater agreements greater than or
equal to 80% per variable. To guard against observer drift, we conducted
monthly cross-site meetings in which videotapes were coded as a team and
interrater agreements were checked to assure that they continued to meet
the criterion of greater than or equal to 80% per variable. In coding mother
and infant behaviors in the living room context, we randomly chose one of
the three 5-min segments for coding. For the toy play context, the first 5
min of interaction was coded.
For all observed behaviors, a second rater coded 15% of the videotapes,
and generalizability coefficients using repeated measures analyses of vari-
ance were calculated (Fleiss, 1986). This method is recommended for
studies using continuous, behavioral observational data and has the advan-
tage of evaluating both the consistency across participants for each rater
(absolute) and the rater variance within participants (relative) for those
variables used in the analyses (Frick & Semmel, 1978). Coefficients above
.50 indicate adequate reliability (Mitchell, 1979). Generalizability coeffi-
cients for the maternal behaviors were as follows: contingent responsive-
ness, r  .74; attention maintaining, r  .81; attention redirecting, r  .77;
verbal scaffolding, r  .64; verbal encouragement, r  .78; positive affect,
r  .74; warm sensitivity, r  .74; physical intrusiveness, r  .45;
restrictiveness, r  .75; harshness of voice tone, r  .70; label one object,
r  .77; label greater than one object, r  .77; label one action, r  .70;
label greater than one action, r  .75. Generalizability coefficients all were
within adequate ranges (.50), with the exception of physical intrusiveness,
which may have been less reliable because of its low incidence.
Generalizability coefficients for infant behaviors when interacting with
their mothers and examiner were as follows for mothers and examiners,
respectively: words, rs  .68 and .76; cooperation, rs  .62 and .75;
positive affect, rs  .85 and .84; negative affect, rs  .84 and .76. The
generalizability coefficient for infant independent play behavior was r 
.75. In general, reliabilities for the infant behaviors were higher when
interacting with the examiner versus mothers. This was most likely due to
the degree of structure provided by the scripted nature of this task.
Results
Objectives 1 and 2: Determine Whether Changes in a
Range of Maternal Responsiveness Behaviors Result in
Increases in Infant Skills and Whether This Is Differential
for Infants of Varying Characteristics
Choice of data analysis approach.
Growth curve modeling
(GCM) procedures were chosen to address Objectives 1 and 2
because these yield individual growth curves for each mother and
infant with multiple growth parameters (i.e., intercept, slope, cur-
vature). This allows for evaluation of differences between study
conditions at the end of the intervention (i.e., level) and in the rate
of change across the intervention period. Unlike traditional re-
631
RESPONSIVE PARENTING

peated measures approaches, GCM allows the inclusion of data for
all families that had at least two assessments, variability in age of
assessment, and examination of predictors for individual patterns
of growth. With GCM, parameters were allowed to be random
when there was individual variation across participants for that
parameter but fixed when there was minimal to no variation or
when variation was limited to group differences (Bryk & Rauden-
bush, 1992). Whether parameters were random or fixed in each
model is included in the tables summarizing the data analyses.
GCM requires that an age point be selected to set as the
intercept. Because our main objective was to evaluate the inter-
vention effectiveness, the intercept was set at the 12-month age
point in order to evaluate for differences between the two study
conditions at the end of the intervention. Examining for differences
in slope and curvature parameters between the two conditions also
directly addressed Objectives 1 and 2. Significant differences on
the slope parameter provide information regarding the rates of
linear change between the intervention conditions, and differences
in curvature parameters indicate that the groups differ in nonlinear
change. For example, if the two study conditions (PALS vs. DAS)
are comparable at preassessment, a significant 12-month intercept
difference demonstrates a condition effect. In the presence of
results supporting the effectiveness of the intervention, level and
slope differences provide evidence that treatment effects were
maintained during the no-treatment follow-up period.
Mother and infant behaviors at preassessment did not differ
across intervention groups except for mothers’ use of redirecting,
F(1, 475)  4.59, p  .04, where the effect size was small (d 
0.11). Because the pretest data are included in growth modeling
analyses, any differences in the study conditions prior to the
intervention are taken into account in the change over time esti-
mates. Although significant differences were found between the
two study conditions on infant gender, when this was included in
the models, results did not change and therefore model results
without gender are reported.
Matching analyses to distribution of variables.
All variables
were analyzed using one of two mixed models: (a) linear mixed
model analyses that required data with a normal distribution or (b)
nonlinear mixed model analyses that were appropriate for posi-
tively skewed distributions. As several of our maternal variables
showed a negatively skewed distribution, they were reversed
scored in order to shift their distribution to one that was positively
skewed. Thus, for these variables (i.e., contingent responsiveness,
warmth, positive affect), lower parameter estimates indicate a
more optimal change in the tables summarizing the data analyses.
In addition, for ease of interpretation, these three variables are
illustrated in the figures using the original 1–5-point scale, with
high scores showing more positive behavior. The variables ana-
lyzed using a linear mixed model analyses included (a) maintain-
ing, redirecting, labeling, physical intrusiveness, and voice tone for
mother; (b) cooperation for infant with mother; and (c) use of
words for infant with examiner; and (d) independent toy play for
infant (SAS PROC MIXED; SAS Institute, 1999). The following
variables were analyzed with the nonlinear mixed model approach:
(a) warmth, contingent responsiveness, positive affect, scaffolding,
verbal encouragement, and restrictiveness for mother; (b) words,
positive and negative affect for infant with mother; and (c) coop-
eration, negative affect for infant with examiner (SAS Macro
GLIMMIX; SAS Institute, 1999). Because it was necessary to use
different types of mixed models, comparison of parameter esti-
mates should not be made because they are not equivalent. For this
reason, to evaluate the magnitude of importance, one can use the
effect size, a measure that is not unit dependent, to interpret the
significance of results.
Approach used for testing effects of biological risk and context
(Objective 2).
The next step was to determine whether the
growth parameters varied by the three between-groups factors used
to predict change in mother and infant behaviors: study condition
(PALS vs. DAS); infant risk group (term, low risk–VLBW, high
risk–VLBW); context (toy play, daily activities); and the Interven-
tion  Risk Group, Intervention  Context, Risk Level  Con-
text, and Intervention  Risk Level  Context interactions. Con-
text was included in the models to determine whether the results
were consistent across situations in which the mother and infant
interacted. Because our study objectives did not include hypothe-
ses regarding the main effects for risk and context, these main
effects and their interaction are not reported. However, significant
interactions of these variables with intervention condition are
included. To simplify models, we eliminated nonsignificant inter-
actions and reexamined the model.
Assessment of clinical significance.
To evaluate the clinical
significance of the intervention effects, we report effect sizes as
Cohen’s d (Cohen, 1988). This statistic is determined by obtaining
the differences between groups divided by the square root of the
random variance parameter and has the advantage of not depend-
ing on the degrees of freedom for the model (Raudenbush & Liu,
2001). When the random variance for the slope was not significant
(e.g., maternal physical intrusiveness, infant independent goal-
directed play skills), a traditional effect size could not be obtained.
In these cases, an approximation was obtained by comparing the
change over 6–12 months with the variability in the parameter
estimate size in order to provide information regarding the mag-
nitude of change relative to the level of the variable. The practical
significance of changes of d  0.20 are considered small, the
practical significance of changes of d  0.50 are considered
moderate, and the practical significance of changes of d  0.80 are
considered large.
Evidence of the Intervention Effectiveness (Objectives 1
and 2)
Data analyses for maternal behaviors are summarized in Table 2
and for infant behaviors in Table 3. The test of the omnibus effect,
F test, that evaluates for differences between conditions are pro-
vided in these two tables. When the results of t tests are compa-
rable with the omnibus test (i.e., there is only one degree of
freedom), these are not reported. However, when the omnibus test
for interactions between the parameter estimates and risk are
significant, t tests are reported, as they provide unique information.
Change in maternal behaviors.
Because the intervention was
expected to result in more optimal changes for a range of maternal
behaviors associated with responsiveness in the literature, we first
evaluated for changes in individual behaviors within each of the
four aspects of responsiveness (Hypothesis 1a). Mothers’ behav-
iors within all aspects of responsiveness in the intervention group
changed more than in the comparison group and, generally, this
was true across risk groups and social context.

RESPONSIVE PARENTING

Contingent responsiveness.
As illustrated in Figure 1, re-
sponses to children’s signals and learning needs that were prompt,
contingent, and appropriate were different across intervention ver-
sus comparison mothers. Mothers in the PALS condition showed
significantly higher levels at the end of the intervention (d  0.93)
as well as greater increases (d  0.85) in their use of contingent
responsiveness when interacting with their infants when compared
with mothers in the DAS condition.
Emotional–affective support.
Higher levels of warm sensitiv-
ity were found for mothers in the PALS compared with the DAS
condition (d  0.49). Higher levels, t(1434)  2.54, p  .01, d 
0.83, and greater increases, t(1434)  2.51, p  .01, d  0.22, in
positive affect also were found for mothers in the PALS versus
DAS conditions but only for those parenting infants who were
born low risk–VLBW. Contrary to expectations, mothers of infants
born high risk–VLBW in the DAS condition displayed higher
levels of smiling and laughing with their infants, t(1434)  2.85,
p  .01, d  0.55, than those in the PALS condition.
The intervention also had positive effects on how frequently
mothers used negative interactive behaviors, as mothers in the

DAS versus the PALS condition showed significantly higher lev-
els of a harsh voice tone (d  0.28) and lower levels of physical
intrusiveness (d  0.50). Less of an increase in physical intrusive-
ness also was found, but this was most apparent for mothers in the
PALS condition parenting infants born high risk–VLBW,
t(1439)  2.44, p  .02, d  0.45, or at term, t(1439)  2.23, p 
.03, d  0.33, compared with those parenting infants born low
risk–VLBW.
A significant Intervention  Biological Risk interaction was
found for level and rate of change in the use of restricting behav-
iors. Mothers in the PALS compared with the DAS condition with
infants born high risk–VLBW used this behavior at significantly
lower levels, t(1264)  3.23, p  .001, d  1.23, and showed
significantly slower rates of increases, t(1264)  2.34, p  .02,
d  1.34. Contrary to expectations, mothers of infants born at term
in the PALS condition used restricting behaviors at a significantly
higher level than those in the DAS condition, t(1264)  2.12, p 
.03, d  0.65.
Support of infant foci of attention.
Mothers in the PALS com-
pared with the DAS condition showed significantly higher levels
of maintaining at the intervention completion (d  0.36) as well as
greater increases (d  0.65; see Figure 1). Redirecting, a behavior
unresponsive to children’s signals, was used at significantly lower
levels by mothers in the PALS compared with the DAS condition
(d  1.31). Mothers in the PALS condition also showed a greater
decline in this behavior (d  0.66).
Quality of language input.
Significant intervention effects
were found for all language variables (see Figure 1). Mothers in
the PALS compared with the DAS conditions used higher levels of
verbal scaffolding (d  0.79). Although mothers in the PALS
condition showed a greater deceleration in this behavior by the
final assessment, their use of verbal scaffolding at 12 months
remained almost twice that of those in the DAS condition. Mothers
in the PALS condition also used significantly higher levels in their
labeling of objects (d  0.71) and a trend for greater increases
(d  0.43). Mothers in the PALS condition also showed higher

levels of labeling actions (d  0.63). In spite of greater decelera-
tion for mothers in the PALS condition, their use of action labels
remained significantly greater. The intervention also influenced
verbal encouragement, as mothers in the PALS condition showed
higher levels than those in the DAS condition (d  0.71).
Change in infant behaviors with mothers.
A major objective of
this study was to determine whether there was evidence for a
causal influence of responsiveness behaviors on infant develop-
ment (Hypothesis 1b; see Table 3 and Figure 2). In light of greater
changes for the target in contrast to the comparison mothers’
responsiveness behaviors, we could evaluate this hypothesis by
examining whether the target infant skills showed greater improve-
ments when contrasted to the comparison infants. Analyses ad-
dressing the extent to which responsiveness behaviors differen-
tially
impacted
the
development
of
infants
of
varying
characteristics also were evaluated (Hypothesis 2). In general,
greater changes were found in infant behaviors for those with
mothers in the PALS versus DAS condition across skill domains,
measured from mother–infant interactions. The intervention
showed differential effects related to risk status but only for
decreased expression of negative affect for the high risk–VLBW
infants. The changes for each of the four developmental domains
are described below.
Early communication.
Infants whose mothers were in the PALS
compared with the DAS condition demonstrated significantly greater
increases in their use of words (d  0.75). Although the rate of
increase was decelerating more for these infants than those in the
DAS condition, they remained significantly higher in word usage.
Social cooperation.
Infants of mothers in the PALS versus
DAS condition showed a trend for higher levels (d  0.39) and
greater increases (d  0.50) in their cooperation, and these trends
were apparent across both contexts.

Affect.
When infants interacted with their mothers, negative
affect was significantly lower at the end of the intervention, but
this was particularly apparent for the infants born high risk–
VLBW whose mothers were in the PALS condition compared with
those born high risk–VLBW whose mothers were in the DAS
condition, t(395)  3.34, p  .001, d  0.91, and only in the toy
play context.
Generalization of increased infant skills with a novel adult.
In
order to determine whether the target versus comparison infants
also could show more optimal skills in interactions with responsive
adults other than their mother, we evaluated their growth in skills
when interacting with a novel adult (Hypothesis 1c; see Table 3
and Figure 2). Positive findings would support the notion that
increased responsiveness provides a secure foundation for infants
to begin to develop skills to regulate their own behavior outside of
mothers’ presence. As predicted, infants with mothers in the PALS
compared with the DAS condition showed higher levels or greater
gains in skills in this situation (Hypothesis 1c). A differential impact
of the intervention for generalization with a novel adult by infant risk
group was only found for social cooperation (Hypothesis 2).
Early communication.
Infants with mothers in the PALS com-
pared with the DAS condition showed a significantly greater
increase in the use of words in interactions with the examiner, and
this was true across risk groups (d  0.22).
Social cooperation.
A significant Intervention  Infant Risk
Group interaction for cooperation was found for level and slope.
These analyses revealed that the infants born low risk–VLBW with
mothers in the PALS condition had a higher level of cooperation

Affect.
Greater gains for infants with mothers in the PALS
versus DAS conditions were apparent. Infants with mothers in the
DAS condition displayed higher levels of negative affect in the
interaction with the examiner (d  0.70).
Change in infant independent problem solving (Hypothesis 1d).
A second situation that evaluated for differences in infants’ skills
across the two study conditions when they were not interacting with
their mothers was an independent goal-directed play activity (see
Table 3). Using a range of toys, infants whose mothers were in the
PALS condition showed greater increases in more complex play skills
than those with mothers in the DAS condition (d  0.47).
Objective 3: Evaluate Whether Different Aspects of
Responsiveness Mediate the Intervention Impact on
Domains of Infant Development
Before determining whether different aspects of responsiveness
mediated the effectiveness of the intervention on different infant
skills, we conducted an exploratory principle-axes factor analyses
with a Promax oblique rotation. This approach examines for un-
derlying factors of a construct when inadequate information is
available to confirm a hypothesized structure (Preacher & Mac-
Callum, 2003). Correlational analyses were then conducted to
determine the extent of the relation among the factors identified in
order to determine whether there was support for the factors being
part of a responsiveness construct.
Once empirical support was found for the presence of different
behaviors contributing to the construct of responsiveness, the next
step was to determine whether different aspects of responsiveness
promoted gains in infant skills (Hypothesis 3a). The presence of
significant mediation effects provides additional support for the
causal influence of increases in responsiveness on gains in infant
development. To demonstrate a mediating effect, we met two
criteria: (a) the intervention condition had expected effects on
changes in the selected maternal behaviors and infant outcomes,
and (b) the significance and parameter estimates (i.e., intercept,
Intervention  Slope) of the intervention condition are reduced
when the maternal behaviors are included as time-varying covari-
ates in the model (Baron & Kenny, 1986).
To determine which maternal behaviors would be included in
the mediation models for each of the three infant skills, we
examined a pooled estimate of regression coefficients across the
four time points to determine for significance between maternal
variables and infant outcomes. Only those maternal variables that
significantly related to the infant behavior at p  .05 were included
in the mediation models. In order to determine whether VLBW
status moderated the mediational effects, we included infant risk
status as a potential moderator in the analyses (Hypothesis 3b).
Empirical support for four aspects of responsiveness.
In gen-
eral, stability for the factor structure summarized in Table 4 was
found for both contexts (daily activities, toy play). The estimate of
the total common variance across the 12 variables was 51.4% in
the daily activities context and 54.4% in toy play, and the results
revealed consistency in factor structure across pre- to follow-up
assessments. Results revealed four factors that correspond to four
aspects of responsiveness described in conceptual frameworks in
the literature: (a) contingent responsiveness–lack of negative emo-
tionality, (b) positive emotional support, (c) responses to infant
foci of attention, and (d) quality of language input. A difference in
factor structure across contexts was found for behaviors represent-
ing mothers’ contingent responsiveness. In daily activities, it
loaded with negative emotionality, whereas in toy play, it loaded
with redirecting. Also, verbal encouragement loaded on a separate
factor in toy play but loaded with positive response to infant foci
of attention (maintaining) in daily activities.
Examination of the relations among the factors revealed small to
high correlations (see Table 5), providing some support for the
factors to be considered part of an overarching responsiveness
construct. For example, the factor involving negative responses to
the infant foci of attention (redirecting) in the daily activities
context demonstrated moderate intercorrelations with all other
factors (range: r  .31 to .47). One factor less related to the
other factors was positive response to infant foci of attention
(maintaining), but this was only true in the toy play context.
The link between maternal responsiveness and infant develop-
ment.
The mediating effect of maternal behaviors on gains in the
three infant skills that showed positive change in interactions with
mother were examined: social (infant cooperation), early commu-
nication (word use), and negative affect. For infant cooperation,
significant relations were found among contingent responsiveness,
maintaining, redirecting, labeling objects, verbal scaffolding, ver-
bal encouragement, restrictiveness, and warmth. However, only
contingent responsiveness, F(1, 1194)  15.17, p  .0001, verbal
encouragement, F(1, 1194)  54.76, p  .0001, and restrictive-
ness, F(1, 1194)  6.33, p  .02, were significant mediators when
the intervention condition was included in the model. Given that
the intervention effect was no longer significant for the level or the
637
RESPONSIVE PARENTING

degree of growth in cooperation, complete mediation was found.
The intercept estimate for the intervention was reduced by 110%
and for the slope by 62%. Biological risk did not moderate this
mediation effect.
Significant relations between maternal behaviors and infants’
growth in use of words were found for contingent responsiveness,
maintaining, labeling objects, scaffolding, and warmth. However,
only maintaining, F(1, 365)  23.21, p  .0001, and labeling, F(1,
367)  3.58, p  .05, remained predictive of growth in word use
when the intervention condition was included in the model. With
the two responsive behaviors included in the model, the interven-
tion effect was decreased by 29%, indicating a partially mediated
effect. The mediation effect of maintaining on growth in word use
was moderated by infant birth status, with the relation stronger for
infants born at term compared with infants born at VLBW,
t(1257)  2.45, p  .02.
Significant relations between infant affect and maternal behav-
iors included contingent responsiveness, maintaining, redirecting,
verbal scaffolding, verbal encouragement, physical intrusiveness,
restrictiveness, warmth, and harshness of voice tone. However,
when these were entered into a model with the intervention con-
dition, they did not remain significant.
Discussion
Responsive parenting has long been considered critically im-
portant for promoting a broad range of infant skills. However, its
importance, to date, is based on descriptive studies, and thus
evidence for a causal role of responsiveness in promoting more
optimal child development is limited. A major study objective was
to provide support for this causal role with an experimental ap-
proach evaluating changes in a range of maternal responsive

behaviors with growth in infant skills. It also sought to determine
whether infants who varied in biological risk benefited in compa-
rable ways. This would provide support for the effectiveness of
responsive parenting to be due, in part, to its sensitivity to indi-
vidual needs. However, the strongest test of a causal influence was
expected to come from the demonstration that aspects of maternal
responsiveness mediated the intervention effect on infant behav-
iors. For this final objective, we were particularly interested in
whether the multiple aspects of responsiveness described in the
literature could be identified empirically and together would sup-
port different domains of infant development.
Objective 1: Determine Whether Changes in a Range of
Maternal Responsiveness Behaviors Result in Increases in
Infant Skills
The intervention facilitated target mothers’ ability to increase
their use of the range of behaviors identified in the literature as
associated with responsive parenting (Hypothesis 1a). Four aspects
of responsiveness were targeted with these mothers who, together,
were found to support greater increases in their infants’ social,
communicative, and affective skills with moderate to strong effect
sizes (Hypothesis 1b). Increased infant competence was thought to
occur because of the steady increases the target mothers showed in
their responses that were prompt, sensitive, and contingent to their
infants’ signals as well as in their use of rich language input. Such
changes suggest that target mothers were appreciating their in-
fants’ positive and negative signals as communication of specific
needs and interests. In contrast, the infants of comparison mothers
experienced decreases in contingent responsiveness, increases in
intrusiveness, restrictions, and harsher voice tones, and more lim-
ited language input, and their infants showed less growth in their
skill development.
Increases in responsive language input from lower educated
mothers is an encouraging finding, as changing this behavior may
not be consistent with their cultural and community backgrounds
(e.g., Heath, 1989). Across this early period of emerging language,
the target infants across all risk groups showed greater growth in
their use of words, whereas the comparison infants’ developmental
trajectory was less steep (see Figure 2). This type of language input
infrequently occurs in families of low education (Hart & Risley,
1995), and initially many target mothers said that they did not
understand the importance of talking to their infants and had
difficulty in knowing what to say when infants did not talk back to
them.
Increases in target versus comparison infants’ cooperation, an
early social skill, paralleled mothers’ increases in responsive care-
giving (e.g., contingent responsiveness, warmth, decreased nega-
tivity). In contrast, with less attention to infant signals, poorer
language input, and less emotional support, the comparison in-
fants’ cooperation leveled off across the study period. This is
consistent with research demonstrating children’s greater willing-
ness to cooperate in the presence of caregiving styles that promote
give and take and sharing of control (Grusec & Goodnow, 1994;
Parpal & Maccoby, 1985). The process that underlies the effec-
tiveness of responsiveness includes allowing children some control
that, in turn, is thought to enhance a positive mood and greater
cooperative behavior.
Together, the pattern of changes in this experimental study for
the target in contrast to the comparison mothers indicated a shift in
the range of behaviors thought to be reflective of responsiveness.
The growth in the target infants’ skills appeared to mirror this shift
and thus provides support for a causal role for responsiveness on
infant development. In contrast, the lower levels and/or slower
rates of growth of the comparison infants are attributed to the
minimal or negative change in responsiveness by their mothers.
Evidence for Enhanced Infant Skills to Generalize
The provision of responsive caregiving is not only thought to
support infant skill development when infants are interacting with
their caregivers but also to assist infants’ ability to develop the
resources necessary to cope with stress and novelty. This is ex-
pected to occur through the process of internalization in which
infants begin to learn to regulate their own behaviors without the
direct responsive support of their caregivers (Ainsworth et al.,
1978; Bornstein & Tamis-LeMonda, 1989). Our study directly
tested for evidence of internalization in two ways: through infants
interacting with a novel adult, a situation expected to be more
stressful than with their mothers, and the ability to independently
organize their behaviors with toys. All infants with mothers in the
target condition demonstrated greater increases in their use of
words and strong changes in their regulation of affect with the
examiner (Hypotheses 1c and d). However, changes with the
examiner were often smaller or only evident for a specific risk
group. The greater support the target infants received from their
mothers for their immature attentional and regulatory skills may
have facilitated better behavioral organization so that they could
respond without high degrees of negative affect.
Evidence for infants’ ability to internalize newly developed
skills also was found in the target infants’ greater ability to
independently use toys in goal-directed and functional ways. As
the two groups of infants were comparable in their exploratory
play skills on the initial evaluation, the target infants’ greater skill
when solving problems may have its origin in shared engagement
that involves higher levels of responsiveness (Vygotsky, 1978).
These results support theories suggesting that increasing compe-
tence in the presence of supportive others provides a foundation
for learning in independent problem-solving situations (Bruner,
1972; Wertsch, 1979).
Objective 2: Determine Whether There Is Differential
Effectiveness of Responsiveness for Varying Infant
Characteristics
Given the special needs of children born at VLBW, particularly
in infancy, our findings highlight an important aspect of respon-
siveness concerning its attention and support for meeting infants’
individual needs. In general, all aspects of the target mothers’
responsiveness supported the development of infants born at
VLBW to the same or greater extent as those born at term (Hy-
pothesis 2). In one domain, negative affect, the infants born at
VLBW with more severe neonatal complications were more likely
than the other two infant groups to display a greater reduction in
behaviors such as crying and fussing if their mothers were in the
target condition. This may have occurred, in part, because the
maternal support provided was particularly helpful to the affective
639
RESPONSIVE PARENTING

regulation for these more vulnerable infants who are frequently
reported to show higher levels of negative affect and behavioral
dysregulation (Goldberg et al., 1989). It is further encouraging that
in the presence of a novel adult, the infants born at VLBW in the
target group were just as likely to show positive changes as the
healthy, term infants in this group.
Objective 3: Evaluate Whether Different Aspects of
Responsiveness Mediate the Intervention Impact on
Domains of Infant Development
Support for four aspects of responsiveness.
Empirical support
was found for four related factors that correspond to the four
aspects of responsiveness identified in conceptual frameworks in
the literature that were stable over time and, in general, across
contexts. The significant correlations among the factors in the
daily activities context provided evidence that although there are
unique aspects of responsiveness, they share common variance and
thus might be considered as part of a general responsiveness
construct. As expected, the factor structure revealed that respon-
sive behaviors, typically described within a theoretical framework,
were in the same factor, although those described as being in
different frameworks were rarely found on the same factor. For
example, contingent responsiveness, although attentive and sup-
portive of infant signals, was found to be distinct from maintaining
infant foci of interest, and this may be related to their different
hypothesized mechanisms of influence described in the attachment
and sociocultural frameworks. Warmth and positive affect also
compromised a distinct factor from that of the lack of negative
affect and contingent responsiveness, supporting previous theoret-
ical perspectives (e.g., MacDonald, 1992). Negative emotionality
often is associated with secure attachment, which emphasizes
acceptance and responsiveness to distress signals, although
warmth has different biological origins and is often found to
support positive engagement (Maccoby & Martin, 1983).
The link between maternal responsiveness and infant develop-
ment.
Further support for a causal role of the responsiveness
behaviors was found through the results of the mediation models
for two of three infant outcome domains: cooperation and use of
words (Hypothesis 3a), with use of words moderated by birth
status (Hypothesis 3b). For cooperation, the picture that emerged
was the need for aspects of responsiveness that cut across theo-
retical frameworks and thus provided different types of support, in
order to support this early social skill. Feedback that is contingent
on infant signals in sensitive ways, verbal encouragement that
provides feedback about the infants’ behavior, and decreased re-
stricting of infant endeavors all were needed to fully explain
growth in cooperation. The importance of these behaviors for
cooperation has been described by parent socialization researchers
(e.g., Parpal & Maccoby, 1985). However, the ability of the three
behaviors to completely explain the intervention effect on coop-
eration advances researchers’ understanding of early social devel-
opment by highlighting the importance of the infants’ need for
multiple aspects of responsive caregiving.
When we examined the effects of responsiveness on infants’
words, a different picture emerged. Two behaviors consistently
reported to influence children’s word use, maintaining and label-
ing, partially mediated the intervention influence. Although
warmth showed relations with this infant outcome, it did not
remain significant when the effect of the intervention was added.
The behaviors that were most important for understanding growth
in word use were consistent with behaviors associated with the
sociocultural framework, emphasizing the importance of the scaf-
folding of children’s individual developmental needs.
Although the intervention appeared to be comparable in sup-
porting the development of infants’ word use irrespective of bio-
logical risk status, risk moderated the mediational effect of main-
taining on word use, with maintaining being a stronger mediator
for infants born at term versus infants born at VLBW. A number
of descriptive studies with infants born at term reported a similar
relation (Akhtar et al., 1991; Tomasello & Farrar, 1986), but less
is known about maintaining and word use for infants born at
VLBW. As infants born at VLBW have less clear signals (Gold-
berg et al., 1989) and fewer shifts in looking at aspects of their
environment (Landry & Chapieski, 1988), it may be that mothers’
attempts to use this strategy to support these infants’ word use is
less effective at this early age.
Study Limitations
When we considered study limitations, two differences were
found across conditions: a greater proportion of female infants in
the intervention versus the comparison group (M  7%) and a
longer duration of the intervention condition (M  1 week). As
gender was not found to moderate the intervention effects, it is
unlikely that this difference explains the positive intervention
findings. The longer duration of PALS versus DAS, due to sched-
uling of home visits with an alternate caregiver, may have resulted
in PALS mothers having more time to practice the targeted be-
haviors. However, all mothers received the same number of visits
in their homes and thus there was not a difference in the amount of
attention given to mothers. Additionally, although there was a
higher attrition rate for African American and other ethnicities, this
was true across both study conditions. This differential attrition
may be explained by a greater mobility of African American
families, as that was the reason why most families left the study.
Although the study demonstrates the potential impact of a respon-
sive style on infant development in a socially high-risk population,
the intervention was not developed as a comprehensive, multifac-
eted approach that may be required for families of the highest
social risk (e.g., drug abuse, teenage mothers).
Conclusions
Given support for the causal influence documented in this study
for the importance of responsiveness for infant development, the
results have implications for parenting interventions. The influence
of behaviors across four aspects of responsiveness on both cogni-
tive and social–emotional outcomes also is consistent with con-
ceptual frameworks defining responsiveness as a broad, rather than
a narrow, construct. For parenting programs targeting either emo-
tional nurturance of children’s needs or stimulation of cognitive
and language skills, these results indicate the need to incorporate
a broader range of responsive behaviors into parent–infant inter-
actions. It is recognized that the ultimate test of the influence of
responsiveness on development would require evaluation of these
infants into later ages to determine whether the positive influence
persists. The positive effect of the intervention on rates of infant
640
LANDRY, SMITH, AND SWANK

growth suggests that infant development across the two groups
may become more divergent over time with a continued advantage
for the target condition.
