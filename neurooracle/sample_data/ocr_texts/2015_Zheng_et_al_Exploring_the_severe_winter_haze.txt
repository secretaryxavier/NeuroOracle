Abstract. Extreme haze episodes repeatedly shrouded Bei-
jing during the winter of 2012–2013, causing major envi-
ronmental and health problems. To better understand these
extreme events, we performed a model-assisted analysis of
the hourly observation data of PM2.5 and its major chemical
compositions. The synthetic analysis shows that (1) the se-
vere winter haze was driven by stable synoptic meteorologi-
cal conditions over northeastern China, and not by an abrupt
increase in anthropogenic emissions. (2) Secondary species,
including organics, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium, were the
major constituents of PM2.5 during this period. (3) Due to the
dimming effect of high loading of aerosol particles, gaseous
oxidant concentrations decreased signiﬁcantly, suggesting a
reduced production of secondary aerosols through gas-phase
reactions. Surprisingly, the observational data reveals an en-
hanced production rate of secondary aerosols, suggesting an
important contribution from other formation pathways, most
likely heterogeneous reactions. These reactions appeared to
be more efﬁcient in producing secondary inorganics aerosols
than organic aerosols resulting in a strongly elevated fraction
of inorganics during heavily polluted periods. (4) Moreover,
we found that high aerosol concentration was a regional phe-
nomenon. The accumulation process of aerosol particles oc-
curred successively from cities southeast of Beijing. The ap-
parent sharp increase in PM2.5 concentration of up to several
hundred µg m−3 per hour recorded in Beijing represented
rapid recovery from an interruption to the continuous pol-
lution accumulation over the region, rather than purely local
chemical production. This suggests that regional transport of
pollutants played an important role during these severe pol-
lution events.

Introduction
Severe haze episodes in the winter of 2012–2013 engulfed
Beijing, as well as other cities in southeastern China, caus-
ing one of the worst atmospheric pollution events in his-
tory. With hourly ﬁne particle (PM2.5) concentrations up to
∼900 µg m−3, outdoor exposure caused adverse health ef-
fects (Nel, 2005; Pöschl, 2005; Peplow, 2014), including se-
vere respiratory system related symptoms and deceases (Cao
et al., 2014; Ouyang, 2013). Meanwhile the visibility was
reduced down to 100 m, which disrupted trafﬁc with can-

celed ﬂights and closed highways. The government had to
adopt emergency response measures to deal with these pol-
lution episodes (http://english.sina.com/china/p/2013/0113/
548263.html). In addition to massive amounts of primary
particulate matter, high emissions in China provided plenty
of gas pollutants to serve as precursors for secondary aerosols
(Zhang et al., 2009). Densely distributed mega-cities (i.e.,
city clusters) have worsened this situation, contributing to
regional air pollution. Once the regional pollution is formed,
the advection becomes less effective in scavenging local pol-
lutants (no clean air from upwind). Thus, the regional pol-
lution is more persistent compared with air pollution within
a speciﬁc city. Moreover, cities within this region could not
eliminate their pollution solely by reducing local emissions
(Chan and Yao, 2008; Cheng et al., 2008a).
These extreme haze episodes attracted great scientiﬁc in-
terest. The visibility impairment has been attributed to scat-
tering and absorption of solar radiation by aerosol particles
(mostly PM2.5) and their hygroscopic growth under high rel-
ative humidity (Cheng et al., 2006, 2008b, c). Regional trans-
port of pollutants was found to contribute considerably to
concentrations of PM2.5 (Z. Wang et al., 2014; L. T. Wang
et al., 2014), dust (Yang et al., 2013; Y. Wang et al., 2014),
and SO2 (Yang et al., 2013) in Beijing. Atmospheric dy-
namic processes during hazy conditions were different from
clean conditions, with a signiﬁcant two-way feedback be-
tween PM2.5 and boundary layer evolution (Z. Wang et al.,
2014). Secondary inorganic aerosol species were suggested
to be the major contributor to severe haze, based on ofﬂine
PM2.5 analysis (Quan et al., 2014), and online non-refractory
PM1 analysis by an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor
(Sun et al., 2014). In addition, some studies described un-
usual atmospheric phenomena taking place under heavily
polluted conditions, such as extremely low ozone concen-
tration (less than 5 ppb) in the absence of diurnal variation
(Zhao et al., 2013) and the synergistic oxidation of SO2 and
NO2 (He et al., 2014). These ﬁndings suggest need for a bet-
ter understanding on the haze formation mechanisms.
In this study, we address the following questions for the
winter haze episodes aforementioned: (1) the relative im-
portance of enhanced emission versus meteorology; (2) the
cause of the sharp PM2.5 increase during the haze episodes in
Beijing, whether it was mainly driven by an extremely rapid
local chemical production or by regional transport; and (3)
the dominant chemical mechanisms of haze formation.

Experimental methods
Online ambient observation was conducted from 1–31 Jan-
uary 2013 on the campus of Tsinghua University. The ob-
servation site is situated on the rooftop of the Environmen-
tal Science Building (40◦00′17′′ N, 116◦19′34′′ E), approxi-
mately 10 m above ground. Tsinghua University is located in
the northwest part of urban Beijing, close to the North 4th
Ring Road, without any major pollution sources nearby. All
observation data are hourly uniﬁed data.

based on the β-ray absorption method by a PM-712 Monitor
(Kimoto Electric Co., Ltd., Japan), which was equipped
with a US-EPA PM10 inlet and a PM2.5 virtual impactor
(Kimoto Electric Co., Ltd., 2012; Kaneyasu et al., 2014).
Dehumidiﬁcation was achieved with the hygroscopic growth
correction formula:

where the 0.010 and 6.000 are localized coefﬁcients, and RH
is relative humidity in %. All PM2.5 hereinafter refer to the
dehumidiﬁed PM2.5 data.
A Sunset Model 4 Semi-Continuous Carbon Analyzer
(Beaverton, OR, USA) was used to measure hourly organic
carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) concentrations in
PM2.5. A NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health) temperature protocol was used and the calcula-
tion discrepancy under high ambient concentrations was cor-
rected accordingly (G.J. Zheng et al., 2014). Organic mat-
ter (OM) was estimated as 1.6·OC, based on previous re-
sults (Zhang et al., 2014; Xing et al., 2013). The use of
ﬁxed OM / OC ratio requires caveats because the ratio might
change due to the variable oxidation degree of OM under dif-
ferent conditions.
Hourly sulfate and nitrate concentrations in PM2.5 were
measured using an ACSA-08 Monitor (Kimoto Electric Co.,
Ltd., Japan). The ACSA-08 Monitor measured nitrates us-
ing an ultraviolet spectrophotometric method, and quantiﬁed
sulfates with the BaSO4-based turbidimetric method after ad-
dition of BaCl2 dissolved in polyvinyl pyrrolidone solution
(Kimoto et al., 2013). Ammonium was predicted under the
assumption that it existed as NH4NO3 and (NH4)2SO4 (He
et al., 2012), which might be an overestimation based on the
non-refractory PM1 results (Sun et al., 2014). Thus the pre-
dicted ammonium given here should be regarded as an upper
limit.
An automatic meteorological observation instrument (Mi-
los520, VAISALA Inc., Finland) was used to obtain mete-
orological parameters, including atmospheric pressure, tem-
perature, RH, wind speed, and wind direction. Speciﬁc hu-
midity was calculated from these measured parameters (http:
//www.srh.noaa.gov/epz/?n=wxcalc).
SO2 and NO2 concentrations in Beijing, and PM2.5 con-
centrations in other cities were acquired from the At-
mospheric Environment Monitoring Network (Tang et al.,
2012). Daily averaged solar radiation reaching ground data
were downloaded from the China Meteorological Data
Sharing Service System (http://cdc.cma.gov.cn). Planetary
boundary layer (PBL) height was simulated with the Weather

General characteristics of Beijing winter haze
Primary atmospheric pollutant in Beijing during the win-
ter of 2012–2013 was PM2.5, which constituted about 70 %
of PM10. This ratio increased when PM2.5 pollution be-
came worse (Fig. 1b). Monthly average PM2.5 concentration
reached 121.0 µg m−3 in January 2013, and hourly PM2.5
concentrations peaked at 855.10 µg m−3, which was the high-
est ever reported in Beijing (Zhao et al., 2009, 2011, 2013;
Zhang et al., 2014). The severe PM2.5 pollution lasted nearly
the whole month, characterized by frequent and long-lasting
pollution episodes. Here, we deﬁne an episode as a set
of continuous days with daily PM2.5 averages exceeding
75 µg m−3. In total, four episodes were identiﬁed in Jan-
uary 2013 (Fig. 1a): 4–8 January (Episode I), 10–16 January
(Episode II), 18–23 January (Episode III), and 25–31 Jan-
uary (Episode IV). Maximum episode-averaged PM2.5 con-
centrations reached 245.4 µg m−3 in Episode II (see Table 1
for comparative information on Episodes I to III; Episode
IV was not included because of missing data). In addition
to the high average concentrations, these episodes were fre-
quent (intervals between episodes were all ∼1 day) and long-
lasting (5–7 days) compared with typical durations (5 days)
and frequencies (1–3 days) of previous Beijing winter haze
episodes (Jia et al., 2008).
Another unique feature of the PM2.5 mass concentrations
during this winter haze period was their dramatic hourly ﬂuc-
tuation. The maximum daily variation was 778.6 µg m−3 on
12 January. Hourly PM2.5 changes of over 100 µg m−3 (in-
creases or decreases) were observed over 40 times during
this haze period. Hourly increases or decreases could reach
up to 351.8 µg m−3 and −217.7 µg m−3, respectively. Causes
of these sharp transitions are discussed in Sect. 5.
The variation of chemical composition with PM2.5 pollu-
tion level, and among episodes, was also explored. We classi-
ﬁed PM2.5 pollution into four categories according to the Air
Quality Index (http://kjs.mep.gov.cn/hjbhbz/bzwb/dqhjbh/
jcgfffbz/201203/t20120302_224166.htm?COLLCC=

(Fig.
1b):

(PM2.5 ≤35 µgm−3),
slightly
polluted
(35 < PM2.5 ≤115 µgm−3),
polluted
(115 < PM2.5 ≤350 µgm−3),
and
heavily
polluted
(PM2.5>350 µg m−3), where PM2.5 refers to the hourly
concentration. Under this classiﬁcation, the slightly polluted,
polluted, and heavily polluted levels generally correspond
to small, moderate, and large PM2.5 peaks in Fig. 1b. Mean
percentile compositions of major components in PM2.5
under different pollution levels were shown in Fig. 2a. With
increasing pollution level, the EC fraction decreased slightly,
OC fraction decreased signiﬁcantly, while sulfate and nitrate
contributions increased sharply (Fig. 2a). It suggests that
secondary inorganic aerosol species become more important
during polluted periods concerning their contribution to the
PM2.5. A similar trend was observed for NR-PM1 (Sun et
al., 2014) and off-line samples (Cheng et al., 2015). On
average, OC, EC, nitrate, and sulfate comprised 21, 3, 19
and 22 % of PM2.5 (Fig. 2b). Good correlations with PM2.5
were observed for OC, EC and nitrate (R2>0.8 for these
three species) for all data in January 2013, while for sulfate
the correlation became weaker, reﬂecting larger episodic
variations (Fig. 2b). In Episode III, NO2 exceeded SO2
by 50 % (Table 1), generally in accordance with previous
studies (Meng et al., 2009). In contrast, concentration of
SO2 exceeded NO2 in Episodes I and II. Compared with
Episode II, Episode I was much drier, which is unfavorable
to the sulfate formation. The relatively high SO2 but low
NO2 concentrations in Episodes I and II may indicate the
signiﬁcance of stationary sources (coal combustion, etc.) in
local emissions or regional SO2-rich air masses transported
to Beijing.

Emission enhancement vs. synoptic conditions
Haze episodes were much more severe and frequent in win-
ter 2013 than in 2012. One possible explanation is that there
was an abrupt emission enhancement during 2013. How-
ever, we didn’t ﬁnd such change in the emission inventory
(http://www.meicmodel.org/). Annual average emissions of
primary PM2.5, SO2 and NOx show slight differences be-
tween 2013 and 2012 (1.2, −1.3 and 0.8 %, respectively) for
the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. The changes of monthly
averaged emissions in January were higher than the annual
average changes in rates, i.e., 2.1, 1.5 and 2.5 % for primary
PM2.5, SO2, and NOx, respectively; but they are still not sig-
niﬁcant compared to the changes in pollutant concentrations.
Thus, we suspect that these haze episodes arose from the un-
favorable synoptic conditions in January 2013.
The relative importance of enhanced emission versus un-
favorable meteorology in PM2.5 concentration of January
2013 was estimated by model simulations with three scenar-
ios (Fig. 3). Base scenario (a) was designed to simulate the
actual situation, i.e., with both input emission inventory and
meteorology for January 2013. In scenarios (b) and (c), Jan-
uary 2012 meteorology and January 2012 emission inventory
data were used, respectively. Since the original WRF-CMAQ
(Weather Research and Forecasting – Community Multiscale
Air Quality) modeling system cannot reproduce the observed
concentrations under heavily polluted conditions (B. Zheng
et al., 2014), a revised WRF-CMAQ system with enhanced
heterogeneous reactions (Wang et al., 2012) was adopted to
improve the model performance. The revised model could ef-
fectively capture the measured concentrations of total PM2.5
(with normalized mean biases (NMBs) being 0.4 %) and its
different chemical compositions for both clean and heavily
polluted haze days (B. Zheng et al., 2014). Details of the

As expected, the inﬂuence of emission difference was neg-
ligible (Fig. 3a and 3c). For the whole simulation domain
of the North China Plain (NCP), both simulation with Jan-
uary 2012 meteorology (Scenario (c) and January 2013 me-
teorology (Scenario (a) resulted in similar PM2.5 concen-
tration ranges (∼50 to ∼500 µg m−3 ) and spatial distri-
butions. Difference of PM2.5 concentration at any site was
within ±10 µg m−3 (Fig. 3e). Simulation results of Scenario
(a) and (c) were not only similar in average concentration
levels, but also in temporal variations. For example, in Bei-
jing, simulated hourly PM2.5 concentration results under this
two scenarios presented not only similar concentration (be-
ing 279.1 ± 170.2 µg m−3 and 278.8 ± 168.9 µg m−3, respec-
tively) but also excellent correlation with R2 reaching 0.97.
In contrast, stable synoptic conditions in January 2013,
which favored accumulation of emitted pollutants, were es-

sential to the formation of the severe regional haze. Under
the same emission level, changing the meteorological con-
ditions from 2012 to 2013 resulted in a monthly average
PM2.5 increase of 10–40 µg m−3 in the Beijing area, and up
to 120 µg m−3 over the whole NCP (Fig. 3a, b, d). This sug-
gests that the severe haze episodes in January 2013 were
most likely due to unfavorable meteorology, rather than an
abrupt increase in emissions (Fig. 3d, e).

region during Episodes II to IV and their corresponding

the regional pollution covered most of the Hebei and north-
ern Henan provinces. In general, Shandong Province was
less polluted, except during Episode IV. Beijing borders this
polluted region with mountains to the northwest. Surface
weather maps from polluted periods were generally char-

acterized by a weak high-pressure center (1034–1037 hPa)
northeast of Beijing, which could result in low surface wind
speed and prevent the inﬂux of northwest clean air (Xu et al.,
2011; Zhao et al., 2013). During the peak hours of Episode
II, Beijing was located near a low-pressure trough, where
air masses from south, west and northeast converged. Dur-
ing Episode III, Beijing was located in a saddle between two
pairs of high- and low-pressure centers, which also led to en-
hanced stability. In contrast, weather patterns for the clean
hours were characterized by strong high-pressure centers (up
to 1046 hPa) northwest of Beijing, i.e., the Siberian anticy-
clone. With sharp pressure gradient, synoptic conditions pro-
duce effective convection and strong northerly winds, bring-
ing dry and clean air masses into Beijing.
Local meteorology, controlled by synoptic conditions,
could have “deterministic impacts” on air pollution levels
(Xu et al., 2011). Compared with the clean periods, the pol-
luted periods were associated with signiﬁcantly lower wind
speed and PBL, and higher temperature and RH (Fig. 5). Be-
sides changes in the average level, diurnal pattern of temper-
ature in polluted periods could also differ from clean periods,
with diminished overnight (00:00 to 06:00 a.m.) temperature
drop.

Local chemical production vs. regional transport
As shown in Fig. 6, Episode II consists of several sharp-
increase events, in which PM2.5 concentrations increased by
over 400 µg m−3 within 1–3 hours (maximum mass growth
rate up to 351.8 µg m−3 h−1). Earlier studies have attributed
this dramatic rate of increase to fast local chemical produc-
tion (Y. Wang et al., 2014). However, we found that the ap-
parent rapid changes are more likely to be caused by the re-
gional transport of clean/polluted air masses. In winter, the
Siberian anticyclone could bring clean air masses into NCP
(Jia et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2013) while southerly winds
reﬁll the areas with polluted air masses. The transition be-
tween clean and polluted air masses may result in an appar-
ent sharp build-up of particle concentrations. In other words,
these events reﬂected interruption and rapid recovery of pol-
lution from adjacent areas, rather than merely local chemical
production.
The impact of transport is supported by the temporal vari-
ations in the regional distribution of PM2.5 concentrations,
the surface weather maps, and the speciﬁc humidity (Fig. 6
and 7). The ﬁrst evidence is that these sharp PM2.5 build-
up events were unique to Beijing among all the eight cities
around/in the NCP (Fig. 6). Chengde and Zhangjiakou are
situated to the north of NCP with mountains in between
(Fig. 6a). Among the NCP cities, Beijing is located at the
northern tip, with mountains to the north and west shielding
the city (Fig. 6(a2)). When conditions favor transport of clean
air from north or northwest (i.e., with the advent of a cold
air current), Beijing is the ﬁrst one among NCP cities to be
scavenged, which resulted in a sharp drop of PM2.5 concen-
trations. In this case, PM2.5 levels in Beijing became similar
to the upwind cities, i.e., Chengde and Zhangjiakou (yellow
solid circles; Fig. 6(b1)). However, these cold air currents
were too weak to go further, leaving the rest NCP cities un-
affected. Not surprisingly, the inﬂuence of these weak cold
air currents soon receded and the polluted air parcels were
transported back to Beijing, which lead to a sharp increase
in the PM2.5 level similar as the rest NCP cities (e.g., Shiji-
azhuang, Baoding, Tianjin, Langfang, and Tangshan) (yellow
solid circles; Fig. 6(b2 and b3)).
In accordance with the above description, surface weather
maps showed that the sharp PM2.5 increase/decrease events
in Beijing during January 2013 were always accompanied
with quick transition between low/high pressure systems. As
shown in Fig. 7b, the two sharp drops in PM2.5 concentra-
tion on 11 and 12 January corresponded to a weak high-
pressure system developed in the mountains northwest of

Beijing, which brought clean air mass into the city. When
the high-pressure systems diminished, a low-pressure system
developed southwest of Beijing, and the air mass in Beijing
was again affected by the regional background pollution, re-
sulting in a sharp increase in PM2.5 concentration.
The observed variation of the speciﬁc humidity, an indi-
cator for the origin of air masses (Jia et al., 2008), also sup-
ports our explanation (Fig. 7a). Air masses from the south
were usually warmer and wetter than the northern air masses,
thus possessing a higher speciﬁc humidity. During the rapid
changes of PM2.5, the trend of speciﬁc humidity nicely fol-
lowed the variations of PM2.5 (Fig. 7a, pink and yellow
rectangles marked periods), which reﬂected the quick tran-
sition of air parcel origins. It has been suggested that the
decrease of PBL height will compress air pollutants into a
shallow layer, resulting in elevated pollution levels (Liu et

al., 2013). However, our results indicated that the compres-
sion was not really happening. Rather, the decrease of PBL
height hindered the vertical mixing of pollutants, resulting in
a faster accumulation and higher concentrations. As shown
in Fig. 7a, the time lag between variations in PBL and its ef-
fects on PM2.5 concentration is a clear evidence demonstrat-
ing that the PBL was not “compressing” air pollutants into
a shallower layer. Otherwise, concurrent increase in PM2.5
will be found during the decrease of PBL height.

Formation of secondary aerosols
Compared with clean conditions, the hazy days are character-
istic of weaker radiation and higher RH. The RH depends on
the synoptic conditions while the radiation reduction is due
to the direct radiative effects of aerosol particles (Crutzen
and Birks, 1982; Ramanathan and Carmichael, 2008; Ra-
manathan et al., 2001; Cheng et al., 2008b; Wendisch et al.,
2008). Secondary aerosols (inorganic and organic) are major
components in ﬁne particles in China (Yang et al., 2011). In
this section, we will evaluate the impact of changes in radia-
tion and RH on the formation of secondary aerosols.
To evaluate the role of chemical productions, we analyzed
the EC-scaled concentrations for individual compounds. The
purpose of using EC-scaled concentration is to eliminate the
inﬂuence of different dilution/mixing conditions on the varia-
tion of observed pollutant concentrations. The observed vari-
ations of pollutant concentrations are not only controlled by
the chemical reactions but are also subject to the inﬂuence

of boundary layer developments. For the same emission rate
and chemical production rate, different mixing conditions
will result in different levels of air pollutants. It is thus highly
uncertain to conclude a stronger/weaker chemical production
based on purely concentration data without considering the
boundary layer effect. Since EC is an aerosol species com-
ing from only primary emission and quite inertial to chem-
ical reactions, its variations well reﬂect the inﬂuence of at-
mospheric physical processes (dilution/mixing effect). The
ratio of other species to EC will to a large extent eliminate
the variations due to mixing/dilution and better represent the
contribution from chemical reactions.
6.1
Weakened importance of photochemistry
The radiative reduction imposed by aerosol particles is
particularly strong during haze episodes because of ex-
tremely high particle concentrations. Take Beijing for ex-
ample: during haze episodes, the amount of solar radiation
reaching the ground was signiﬁcantly lower (e.g., down to
2.77 MJ m−2 d−1, 13 January) than it was on clean days (av-
eraging 9.36 ± 0.60 MJ m−2 d−1 for all the 6 clean days),
rendering high photochemical activity impossible. The re-
duction of radiation intensities will change the atmospheric
photochemistry and oxidant concentrations (hydroxyl radical
(OH) and ozone (O3)), which will consequently change the
production and aging of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs)
(Hallquist et al., 2009; Jimenez et al., 2009).
As the haze pollution spread over most of the NCP, a
weakening of photochemistry was expected on the regional
scale, which is conﬁrmed by both observations and model
simulations. Extremely low ozone concentration (less than
10 ppb) in the absence of diurnal variation was observed dur-
ing heavy pollution episodes for all of the three major cities
in Jing–Jin–Ji Area (i.e., Beijing, Tianjin and Shijiazhuang)
in January 2013 (Y. Wang et al., 2014). Similar phenomenon
was observed before in another heavy pollution episode in
winter Beijing (Zhao et al., 2013). In accordance with the
observed low ozone concentration, model simulations also
showed a regional-scale reduction in the concentrations of
ozone and OH (Fig. 8). Average daytime concentrations of
oxidants were signiﬁcantly lower during polluted periods
than clean periods. For most areas in the NCP, O3 and OH
dropped from 12∼44 ppbV and 0.004 ∼0.020 pptV to less
than 12 ppbV and 0.004 pptV, respectively, as the air qual-
ity changed from clean to heavily polluted conditions. This
regional drop in oxidant concentrations demonstrates the im-
pact of air pollution on the photochemistry.
Ozone and OH radicals are known as crucial oxidants
in the formation of secondary organics aerosols (SOAs)
(Jimenez et al. 2009). Weakened photochemistry is therefore
expected to reduce the SOA production and concentrations.
To have a semi-quantitative estimation on the contribution of
photochemistry, secondary organic carbon (SOC) was esti-
mated (Fig. 9a) using the EC-tracer method (Lim and Turpin,
2002). Brieﬂy, SOC was estimated using these formulae:
Primary OC = EC · (OC/EC)pri + N
(2)
SOC = OC −Primary OC
(3)
The basic assumptions and underlying principles of this
method are discussed in Lim and Turpin (2002) and Lin
et al. (2009). Only daytime (07:00–18:00) carbonaceous
aerosol data were used here to exclude possible interference
from day–night source variations (such as the heavy-duty
diesel truck trafﬁc which is allowed only during nighttime
in Beijing). In our study, data pairs with the lowest 10 % per-
centile of ambient OC/EC ratios were used to estimate the
primary OC/EC ratio (Fig. 9a). York regression (York et al.,
2004) was used to estimate the intercept N and the slope,
i.e., values of (OC/EC) pri, according to Saylor et al. (2006).
Our analysis shows that SOC constituted ∼28 % of total OC,
consistent with earlier studies in the winter of 2009-2012
(∼30 %, Cheng et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2013b).
High concentration of aerosol particles can reduce solar
radiation and atmospheric photochemistry. Since SOC is a
product of photochemical reactions, we would expect a re-
duced SOC production rate under heavily polluted condi-
tions. This is conﬁrmed by the measured SOC concentra-
tions shown in Fig. 9. Here again the EC-scaled SOC was
used to account for the different boundary layer effect (di-
lution/mixing) on the aerosol concentrations. Both SOC/EC
and the accumulated SOC/EC (afternoon – morning values)
decrease when it changed from clean to heavily polluted pe-
riods. The accumulated SOC/EC is used to better represent
the production during the daytime.
Reduction in photochemistry-related PM2.5 production is
further supported by model simulation results. In our model
conﬁgurations, the photolysis rate is calculated online using
simulated aerosols and ozone concentrations (B. Zheng et al.,
2014). As a result, with the enhanced PM2.5 concentration,
the photolysis rate will be reduced, and so will the concen-
trations of photochemical oxidants (Fig. 8) and secondary
aerosol particles. During the haze events, this effect can be
counteracted by the enhanced heterogeneous reactions and it
is difﬁcult to unravel them from the measurement data.
In order to demonstrate the inﬂuence of reduced photo-
chemistry, we adopted the original WRF-CMAQ model setup
and excluded the enhanced heterogeneous reactions. In this
case, only gas-phase oxidations are counted for the forma-
tion of sulfate and organics (aqueous-phase reactions in the
original WRF-CMAQ only happen in clouds and don’t ap-
ply for the aerosol phase) (B. Zheng et al., 2014) and their
simulated concentrations will directly reﬂect the inﬂuence of
reduced photochemistry. As shown in Table S1, the simu-
lated PM2.5/EC ratios decreased from 16.05 to 11.72 when
the pollution level changed from the clean to the heavily pol-
luted case, reﬂecting the reduced gas-phase photochemical
production. Note that PM2.5 concentration is normalized by
EC to counteract the inﬂuence of reduced boundary layer.

(pptV) at different pollution level.
Otherwise, the reduced boundary layer itself could lead to
a tremendous increase in the pollutant concentration under
heavily polluted conditions, and thus cover the real effect of
reduced photochemistry.
The simulated individual components of PM2.5 also re-
ﬂected the inﬂuence of photochemistry. As shown in Table
S1, although primary organic matter (POM) to EC ratios kept
nearly constant during all pollution levels, the normalized
secondary species all showed a decreasing trend, reﬂecting
the reduced photochemical production. SOA/EC, SO2−
4 /EC,
and NO−
3 / EC ratios decreased by 53.3, 51.9 and 28.6 %, re-
spectively from clean to heavily polluted periods. For the for-
mation of NO−
3 , two heterogeneous reactions have been in-
cluded in the original WRF-CMAQ model and therefore the
NO−
3 / EC shows relatively less reduction than SOA/EC and
SO2−
4 /EC.
6.2
Enhanced heterogeneous chemistry
Unlike OM, relative contributions of sulfate and nitrate to
PM2.5 were increasing during the haze events (Fig. 2). Again,
we used their ratios to EC to account for the boundary layer
effect. An increasing trend of SO2−
4 /EC and NO−
3 / EC ratios
was found (Column 1 in Fig. 10) from clean periods (3.03
and 3.33, respectively) to heavily polluted periods (6.35 and
5.89, respectively), suggesting enhanced chemical produc-
tions. The SOR and NOR (molar ratio of sulfate or nitrate to
sum of sulfate and SO2 or nitrate and NO2) have been used
as indicators of secondary transformation (Sun et al., 2006).
The fact that SOR and NOR increased much more rapidly
than SO2 and NO2 as pollution events became more severe
(Column 4 in Fig. 10) is further evidence of elevated sec-
ondary formations of sulfate and nitrate during severe haze
events.
Both gas-phase and heterogeneous reactions could con-
tribute to the formation of sulfate and nitrate from SO2 and
NO2, thus elevating the SOR and NOR. Sulfate is formed
through oxidation of SO2 by gas-phase reactions with OH
(Stockwell and Calvert, 1983; Blitz et al., 2003) and sta-
bilized Criegee intermediate (which is formed by O3 and
alkenes) (Mauldin et al., 2012), and by heterogeneous re-
actions with dissolved H2O2 or with O2 under the catal-
ysis of transition metal (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006). Ni-
trate formation is dominated by the gas-phase reaction of
NO2 with OH during daylight, and the heterogeneous re-
actions of nitrate radical (NO3) during nighttime (Seinfeld
and Pandis, 2006). Since gas-phase production of secondary
aerosols is expected to decrease under heavily polluted peri-
ods (Sect. 6.1), the increase of SO2−
4 /EC and NO−
3 / EC ratios
is a clear evidence for the dominant contribution from other
pathways, most probably from the heterogeneous reactions.
If we assume heterogeneous chemistry to be the answer to
the high SO2−
4
and NO−
3 concentrations, there is a problem
because heterogeneous chemistry still requires oxidation by
oxidizing agents, e.g., OH, O3, etc., which were indeed sig-
niﬁcantly reduced (Sect. 6.1). Our explanation for this puz-
zle is that despite reduced oxidant concentrations, the aerosol
volume/surface increases so much (due to elevated aerosol

concentration and the accompanied high RH, Fig. 1) that it is
enough to compensate its inﬂuence, and moreover, leads to a
net increase in the formation of secondary aerosols.
A simpliﬁed case study could show how aerosol vol-
ume/surface increases could compensate the effect of oxidant
reduction, and even lead to a net increase in the formation of
secondary aerosols. Take sulfate for example: the production
rate of sulfate (S(VI)) through heterogeneous reactions can
be estimated by
dCS(VI)/dt ≈k[S(IV)(aq)] · [oxidants (aq)] · Vaerosol,
(4)
in which CS(VI) is the sulfate concentration, k is the effective
rate coefﬁcient, [S(IV)(aq)] is the S(IV) concentration in the
aqueous phase of aerosols, [oxidants (aq)] is the concentra-
tion of oxidants in the aqueous phase of aerosols, and Vaerosol
is the volume concentration of humidiﬁed aerosol at ambient
RH.
Equation (4) shows that the oxidants and Vaerosol are both
essential for the heterogeneous reactions. From the clean to
the heavily polluted case, O3 is reduced by 80 %, dropping
from > 50 µg m3 < 10 µg m−3 (Y. Wang et al., 2014). Based
on our model simulation results, H2O2 concentration also

Normalized X in Column 4 refers to the average concentration of
X in any pollution level, scaled by its average concentration dur-
ing clean periods. In the box-whisker plots, the boxes and whiskers

dropped signiﬁcantly from ∼78 ppbV to ∼11 ppbV. Thus
we assume an upper limit of 90 % reduction in [oxidants
(aq)]. Vaerosol depends on the dry aerosol concentrations Vdry
and its hygroscopic growth factor (GF) of particle size, which
is a function of RH. Assuming a constant aerosol dry den-
sity, Vdry is proportional to the mass concentration. From
the clean case to the heavily polluted case, average PM2.5
mass concentration increased by 25 time, changing from
18 µg m−3 to 450 µg m−3 while average RH increased from
dry (∼20 %) to ∼70 %. Thus we have

where HP and Clean indicate heavily polluted and clean peri-
ods, respectively. A GF of 1.1 was taken from previous mea-
surements in Beijing (Meier et al., 2009).
Equation (2) shows that the increase of aerosol volume
concentrations could sufﬁciently compensate the effect of
oxidant reduction, resulting in a net increase of sulfate pro-
duction.
Similarly, for NO−
3 , the inﬂuence of oxidant reduction
could also be compensated by the increase of aerosol vol-
ume concentrations. There might be other oxidants associ-
ated with heterogeneous reactions, such as O2 (especially
under the catalysis of mineral metals) and other oxidants ex-
isted in aerosol phase such as organic peroxides (Seinfeld et
al., 2006).
In accordance with above discussions, both observation
and model simulation supported the importance of hetero-
geneous reactions. Observed SOR and NOR showed an ob-
vious dependence on RH (Fig. 11). Both SOR and NOR
were constant under dry conditions (RH < 50 %) (Fig. 11a,

b); however, started increasing when RH > 50 %, resulting in
average values around 0.34 and 0.28 at RH 70–80 %, respec-
tively. This suggests important contributions from heteroge-
neous reactions with abundant aerosol water under wet con-
ditions (Sun et al., 2013a). The observed SOR value was high
compared with previously reported values of 0.24 (Wang et
al., 2006) and 0.29 (Zhao et al., 2013) during hazy days in
Beijing. The NOR value for this study was higher than for
spring hazy days in 2001–2004 (0.22; Wang et al., 2006), but
signiﬁcantly lower than for the hazy episode in January 2010
(0.51; Zhao et al., 2013). Our model simulation results (B.
Zheng et al., 2014) also supported the importance of hetero-
geneous chemistry in sulfate and nitrate productions (Figure
R1). With the addition of the heterogeneous reactions, the
revised CMAQ showed much better performance in the pol-
luted periods (B. Zheng et al., 2014), which demonstrated
the importance of heterogeneous reaction in the production
of secondary aerosols.
Concerning the SOA formation, the contribution of hetero-
geneous reactions might be possible, but it should be much
less signiﬁcant than for sulfate and nitrate. For RH > 50 %,
SO2−
4 /EC and NO−
3 / EC ratios rose signiﬁcantly (Fig. 11d)
while SOC/EC ratios remained constant (Fig. 9b). By using
HOA (hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol) instead of EC, Sun
et al. (2013a) found similar phenomena. Apparently, SOC
doesn’t have a heterogeneous formation pathway as effective
as those of sulfate and nitrate.

Conclusions
The severe haze pollution during January 2013 was not
a Beijing-localized phenomenon. Rather, it was the result
of local pollutants superposed on background regional pol-
lution, which affected the whole NCP. Although pollutant
emissions were high, there was no abrupt enhancement in
2013. The occurrence of the severe winter haze resulted from
stable synoptic meteorological conditions over a large area of
northeastern China. Surface weather maps from hazy periods
were characterized by a weak high-pressure center northeast
of Beijing, while the termination of a haze episode was al-
ways accompanied by the Siberian anticyclone (Xu et al.,
2011; Jia et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2013). Atmospheric chem-
istry and physics during severe haze pollution events are il-
lustrated in a conceptual model (Fig. 12). With the onset of
stable synoptic conditions, RH rises, primary pollutants be-
gin to accumulate and regional pollution begins to form. If
the stable conditions last long enough, PM2.5 build-up oc-
curs, and as a consequence, solar radiation is reduced at the
ground level. This inhibits surface temperature ﬂuctuation,
making the formation of the inversed layer easier and rend-
ing the atmosphere into a more stable condition. Meanwhile,
photochemical activity is weakened under low solar radia-
tion, and secondary aerosol formation via this pathway be-
comes less important. However, under high RH, heteroge-
neous reactions may play a more important role, especially
those associated with the aerosol aqueous phase. This results
in the rapid build-up of secondary aerosols, especially sul-
fates and nitrates, enhancing PM2.5 pollution. The accumu-
lation of aerosol particles terminates with the incursion of a
strong cold front, usually the Siberian anticyclone.

Our analysis also reveals that the regional transport can be
a key process controlling the variations of local air pollutant
concentrations. Take the sharp increases of aerosol concen-
trations on 11–13 January for example: Beijing pollution was
temporarily ﬂushed away by strong winds associated with the
arrival of a weak cold air current; as its inﬂuence weakened,
the polluted regional air mass readily reoccupied the Beijing
area, resulting in an apparent rapid build-up of PM2.5. This
was supported by data on the PM2.5 levels around Beijing,
speciﬁc humidity and PBL height, as well as surface weather
maps. Our results reveal that the apparent formation rate (the
rate of change in PM2.5 or other air pollutants) is not only
due to chemical reactions but also controlled by the regional
transport along with other processes. It requires caveats to
derive a real chemical production rate based on a single-site
measurement. Our results also show a clear impact of re-
gional transport on the local air pollution, suggesting the im-
portance of regional-scale emission control measures in the
local air quality management of Beijing.
