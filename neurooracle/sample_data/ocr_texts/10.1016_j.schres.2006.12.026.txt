Abstract
There is much interest, derived from current neurochemical, genetic, and therapeutic research, in the
role of brain neurotrophins in schizophrenia. Neurotrophins play key roles in neuronal development
and differentiation (i.e., promoting dendritogenesis and synaptogenesis), and in orchestrating the
neuronal response to stress/noxious stimuli. Additionally, neurotrophins are modulators across
monominergic (dopamine and serotonin), gabaergic and cholinergic systems. These roles focus on
important areas of the etiopathophysiology of schizophrenia. Clinical studies show reductions in
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NFG) in schizophrenic patients
as compared to normal control subjects, as well as differences in patients receiving first-generation
antipsychotics (FGAs) or second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs). We now report on BDNF levels
in subjects with first-episode psychosis in comparison with normal healthy controls. Compared to
normal controls (N = 14; 290.5 + 38.81 pg/ml), first-episode psychotic patients showed significant
reduction (N = 15; 135 + 21.77 pg/ml; P = 0.001; f = 12.873) in plasma BDNF. Additionally, plasma
BDNF levels showed a significant negative correlation (N=13' r=0.584, p=0.0362) only with positive
symptom scores at base line and no significant correlations were found with any of the cognitive
performance test battery or motor function test scores. Low BDNF levels at the onset of psychosis
suggest that it may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and perhaps could be a helpful
neurobiological marker for possible early treatment intervention.

1. Introduction
The study of First-episode psychosis (FEP) is particularly advantageous in understanding the
neurobiology of schizophrenia, in part because of the opportunity to minimize the potential
impact of confounds such as illness duration, medication effects, and the psychiatric and
medical comorbidities that are associated with chronicity of illness (Buckley and Evans,
2006). Studies of brain structure in FEP reveal a widespread pattern of cortical tissue loss
(Thompson et al, 2001; Vita et al, 2006;Narr et al, 2006;Hao et al, 2006). Although findings
of whole brain tissue loss, venticular enlargement, and selective (fronto-temporal) loss may

appear less pronounced in FEP samples than in more chronic patient groups, it is nevertheless
salutary that such changes are evident even at first presentation of illness. Indeed, there is
evidence, although less substantial in amount and less robust in content, to suggest that
anatomical brain changes may well antedate the onset of florid psychosis. Recently, Lappin
and colleagues (2006) have reported that the longer duration of untreated psychosis in a British
FEP sample was associated with greater gray matter tissue loss, with a predeliction for the left
temporal lobe. In an earlier account of a high risk cohort, Pantelis and colleagues (2003)
reported a reduction in medical temporal lobe volume in high risk patients after they were
scanned following the onset of frank psychosis. This was an important finding, suggesting
brain changes associated with the evolution of psychosis itself. In a more recent and extended
analysis (Velakoulis et al, 2006), high risk subjects were compared with first episode chronic
schizophrenia and normal control groups according to hippocampal and amygdala volumes at
baseline. The results show no difference in MRI volumes between the high risk subjects and
normal controls, irrespective of whether the at-risk patients did or did not progress to overt
psychosis. First episode schizophrenia (but not other psychoses) groups had reduced (left)
hippocampal volume. The implication that the changes occur in concert with the transition is
intriguing and accords well with the notion of psychosis as a biologically toxic event in itself.
Additionally, it has been found that second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) lead to less tissue
loss than first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs) over the course of treatment, perhaps
reflecting greater clinical stability with SGAs (Chakos et al, 2005;Lieberman et al, 2005).
While the factors(s) and mechanisms underlying such observations remain to be elucidated,
one reasonable summation is that fundamental processes in the brain have already been affected
to produce the extent of structural changes that are evident on MRI in FEP. Amidst a growing
appreciation of the developmental neurobiology of schizophrenia — as well as the propensity
for progressive brain changes among patients with an unfavorable illness course — there is
emergent information on abnormalities in the expression of neurotrophins in schizophrenia.
Our own group has also focused on brain neurotrophins as one potential mediator of the
neurobiology of schizophrenia and we have previously produced evidence that nerve growth
factor — a prominent neurotrophin — is reduced in FEP (Parikh et al, 2003).
Neurotrophins have been extensively studied and their role has been established in neuronal
development, in promoting synaptogenesis, and in orchestrating the neuronal response to
stress/anxious stimuli. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is the most ubiquitous and
most comprehensively studied of these neurotrophins. BDNF is found all over the cortex but
is located predominantly in the hippocampus. BDNF has been found to promote survival of a
wide range of neuronal cells and is known to modulate dopamine, gabaergic, and serotonergic
receptors (Shoval and Weizman, 2005).
As mentioned above, an earlier study from our group (Parikh et al, 2003) measured NGF levels
in drug naive and medicated patients. Compared with normal controls, plasma NGF levels were
lower in both patient groups. Interestingly, however, NGF levels were higher overall in the
medicated chronic schizophrenia sample than in the first episode schizophrenia sample.
Furthermore, significantly higher levels of NGF were seen in patients on treatment with SGAs
than in patients who were receiving FGAs. Thus, there is evidence both that neurotrophins (in
the latter instance, NGF) may be reduced in FEP and that (subsequent) treatment with
antipsychotics can influence the pattern of neurotrophins. The present study adds to this
emergent profile of the neurobiology of FEP. Specifically, in this study we have examined
plasma levels of BDNF in patients during their first episode of schizophrenia in comparison
with BDNF from healthy control subjects.

2. Methods and Materials
2.1. Subjects
The patient and normal subjects were from our earlier studies and were described extensively
before (Evans et al, 2003; Khan et al, 2002; Parikh et al, 2003). Briefly, never-medicated FEP
patients (N = 15; male/female = 8/7) were enrolled at the Department of Psychiatry, Dwight
David Eisenhower Army Medical Center (DDEAMC), Fort Gordon, GA and from the Medical
College of Georgia (MCG), Augusta, GA. The patients were diagnosed as schizophrenia or
schizophreniform disorder after follow-up during subsequent 6 months of hospitalization. The
clinical state of the patients was evaluated independently by two of the authors at baseline and
findings were recorded on an anchored brief psychiatry rating scale (BPRS) (Overall and
Gorham, 1962), and PANSS-positive (PSS) and PANSS-negative (NSS) symptom scores (Kay
et al., 1987). The patients were of mean age 21 + 8.83SD years and had a mean duration of
illness of 2.1 + 2.75 years. Controls (N= 14; male/female = 9/5) with mean age of 25 + 5.72SD
years consisted of the healthy volunteers recruited via advertisements at the Medical College
of Georgia, VAMC and DDEAMC. Control subjects were matched for gender and age with
first-episode schizophrenia patients. Institutional review boards of both DDEAMC and MCG
had approved the research protocol, and all the subjects signed the consent forms.
2.2. Preparation of plasma and storage
The fasting blood from each subject was drawn early in the morming between 8:00 AM and
10:00 AM in lavender vacutainer-containing EDTA. The blood was centrifuged at 2500 rpm
for 10 min at 5°C. The plasma was carefully separated, supplemented with 20ug/ml aprotinin
and stored at - 70°C until analyzed.
2.3. Plasma BDNF ELISA
All samples were available as plasma since our earlier published studies were primarily focused
on RBC and plasma. Although, fresh serum samples may yield slightly higher levels of
neurotrophins due to release from platelets, since our samples were frozen and thawed such
neurotrophins should have released from the platelets. A double antibody sandwich ELISA
was developed to quantitate human plasma BDNF and all the measurements were performed
in duplicate. Ninety-six well immunoplates were coated overnight at 4°C with 100ul of 1ug/
ml monoclonal antihuman B-BDNEF antibody (R&D systems). After blocking with 1% BSA,
wells were incubated with 100 ul of sample for 2 h at room temperature. Wells were then
incubated with 100 ul of 100 ng/ml biotinylated human B-BDNF polyclonal antibody (R&D
Systems) for 2 h followed by incubation with 100ul of streptavidin-HRP for 20 min. Reaction
was initiated by incubating the wells with 100 ul of TMB substrate solution in dark for 20 min
and stopped by adding 50 wl of 1 M sulfuric acid. The absorbance was measured at 450 nm
with Multiskan microplate reader (Flow Labs, McLean, VA USA). Standard curve was
obtained by fitting the absorbance to different concentrations of human B-BDNF (R&D
systems). The sensitivity of the assay was 4 pg/ml. All the samples were analyzed in duplicated
in one session by an investigator blind to experimental set up. All assays were carried out in
duplicate, and values were presented as means + S.E.M.
2.4. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was done using Sigma Stat software. Student's t-test with a two-tailed
variance was used to determine significant differences in BDNF levels between the groups.
Correlations between plasma BDNF contents and psychopathology scores were examined
using Pearson's product moment test.

3. Results
Patients and control groups were matched with respect to age and gender, although the first
episode patients were younger. (This was not significant.) (Table 1). BDNF contents were
markedly lower in plasma of never-medicated FEP (N = 14, 17.0 + 3.0 pg/ml, P < 0.001) as
compared to normal subjects (N = 15, 49.1 + 6.7 pg/ml) (Fig. 1). Correlations were examined
between plasma contents of BDNF and psychopathology scores. A highly significant negative
correlation (N=13' r=0.584, p=0.0362) was found between plasma BDNF and scores of the
baseline PANSS-Positive Symptom subscales (Figure 2). However, no correlations were found
with other PANSS symptom or cognitive performance scores.
4. Discussion
The present study reports markedly reduced BDNF levels in the plasma of FEP patients in
comparison with healthy control subjects. The present study also extends our earlier
comparative study of NGF in first episode patients, wherein lower NGF was observed in FEP
patients (Parikh et al, 2003). These findings are consistent with an emergent literature that
points to the abnormality in the physiology of BDNF in the brains of patients with schizophrenia
(Shoval and Weizman, 2005;Buckley et al, submitted for publication), Reductions both with
BDNF and in TrK B expression were found in the brains of patients with schizophrenia from
the NIMH group (Weickert et al, 2003;2005). In an analysis of MRI data from the Hillside first
episode study, Szesko and colleagues (2005) found that the functional polymorphism of BDNF
confers greater susceptibility to hippocampal tissue loss in schizophrenia. The effect of Val/
Met heterozygosity on hippocampal volume was observed in both normal subjects and patients
with schizophrenia but it was more pronounced in the patient group (Szesko et al, 2005).
Wassink and colleagues (1999) also found a similar effect of BDNF genotype on brain imaging
in schizophrenia. Other studies have focused on the impact of this Val/Met BDNF gene
polymorphism on treatment response in schizophrenia. Anttilo and colleagues (2005) did not
find any impact of BDNF polymorphisms on treatment response in a sample of 14 patients
with schizophrenia who were treated with first generation antipsychotics. Liou and colleagues
(2004) reported a relationship between Val/Met heterozygosity and severity of tardive
dyskinesia in a sample of over 200 patients with schizophrenia. In another study (Ten et al,
2005) of BDNF levels among 80 patients with tardive dyskinesia (TD), patients with TD had
lower BDNF levels than patients without TD or normal controls.
Toyooka and colleagues (2002) reported BDNF reductions in the serum of patients with
schizophrenia. Shimizu and colleagues also reported a trend (not statistically significant) for
lower BDNF levels in the serum in a sample of 15 drug naive patients compared with medicated
patients and normal subjects. Huang and Lee (2005) did not find overall patient — control
differences, but rather reported higher BDNF levels in patients with paranoid and residual
subtypes of schizophrenia. Earlier studies discussed and the present report support that
neurotrophins may be associated with the expression of active psychotic symptoms.
Particularly, the significant correlation between plasma BDNF and PANSS-PSS at baseline
may indicate that BDNF may be a neurobiological predictor for change in psychopathology
status, remission or exacerbation. Earlier, we reported correlation between NGF and the
PANSS-NSS (Parikh et al, 2003). Earlier data that NGF levels were higher in patients
medicated with SGAs vs FGAs (Parikh et al, 2003) and our extensive work on the brain NGF
and BDMF in brain in rats treated with FGAs or SGAs, collectively suggest that plasma NGF
and BDNF may be candidate biological markers for the differential actions of antipsychotics
and the relationship between neurobiological events and clinical relapse.
