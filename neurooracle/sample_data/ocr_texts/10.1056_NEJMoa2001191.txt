Summary
An outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in Wuhan, China, has 
spread rapidly, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries. We report the first 
case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the United States and describe the iden-
tification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the 
patient’s initial mild symptoms at presentation with progression to pneumonia on 
day 9 of illness. This case highlights the importance of close coordination between 
clinicians and public health authorities at the local, state, and federal levels, as 
well as the need for rapid dissemination of clinical information related to the care 
of patients with this emerging infection.
O
n December 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneu-
monia in people associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in 
Wuhan, Hubei Province.1 On January 7, 2020, Chinese health authorities 
confirmed that this cluster was associated with a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV.2 
Although cases were originally reported to be associated with exposure to the sea-
food market in Wuhan, current epidemiologic data indicate that person-to-person 
transmission of 2019-nCoV is occurring.3-6 As of January 30, 2020, a total of 9976 
cases had been reported in at least 21 countries,7 including the first confirmed 
case of 2019-nCoV infection in the United States, reported on January 20, 2020. 
Investigations are under way worldwide to better understand transmission dynam-
ics and the spectrum of clinical illness. This report describes the epidemiologic 
and clinical features of the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the 
United States.
Case Report
On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohom-
ish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On check-
ing into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting 
approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent 
evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State 
on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated

that he had seen a health alert from the U.S. 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and, 
because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided 
to see a health care provider.
Apart from a history of hypertriglyceridemia, 
the patient was an otherwise healthy nonsmoker. 
The physical examination revealed a body tempera-
ture of 37.2°C, blood pressure of 134/87 mm Hg, 
pulse of 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 
16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 
96% while the patient was breathing ambient air. 
Lung auscultation revealed rhonchi, and chest 
radiography was performed, which was reported 
as showing no abnormalities (Fig.  1). A rapid 
nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for influ-
enza A and B was negative. A nasopharyngeal 
swab specimen was obtained and sent for detec-
tion of viral respiratory pathogens by NAAT; this 
was reported back within 48 hours as negative 
for all pathogens tested, including influenza A 
and B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, 
rhinovirus, adenovirus, and four common corona-
virus strains known to cause illness in humans 
(HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43).
Given the patient’s travel history, the local and 
state health departments were immediately noti-
fied. Together with the urgent care clinician, 
the Washington Department of Health noti-
fied the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Al-
though the patient reported that he had not 
spent time at the Huanan seafood market and 
reported no known contact with ill persons dur-
ing his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with 
the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the 
basis of current CDC “persons under investigation” 
case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in 
accordance with CDC guidance and included se-
rum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab 
specimens. After specimen collection, the patient 
was discharged to home isolation with active 
monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that 
the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal 
swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time 
reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction 
(rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC sub-
ject-matter experts, state and local health offi-
cials, emergency medical services, and hospital 
leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to 
an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Region-
al Medical Center for clinical observation, with 
health care workers following CDC recommen-
dations for contact, droplet, and airborne pre-
cautions with eye protection.9
On admission, the patient reported persistent 
dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vom-
iting; he reported that he had no shortness of 
breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within nor-
mal ranges. On physical examination, the patient 
was found to have dry mucous membranes. The 
remainder of the examination was generally un-
remarkable. After admission, the patient received 
supportive care, including 2 liters of normal sa-
line and ondansetron for nausea.
On days 2 through 5 of hospitalization (days

n engl j med 382;10 nejm.org March 5, 2020

Brief Report
6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs 
remained largely stable, apart from the develop-
ment of intermittent fevers accompanied by pe-
riods of tachycardia (Fig. 2). The patient contin-
ued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared 
fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the 
patient passed a loose bowel movement and re-
ported abdominal discomfort. A second episode 
of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample 
of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing, 
along with additional respiratory specimens (na-
sopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The 
stool and both respiratory specimens later tested 
positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the 
serum remained negative.
Treatment during this time was largely sup-
portive. For symptom management, the patient 
received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting 
of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and 
600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also re-
ceived 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued 
cough and approximately 6 liters of normal sa-
line over the first 6 days of hospitalization.
The nature of the patient isolation unit per-
mitted only point-of-care laboratory testing ini-
tially; complete blood counts and serum chemi-
cal studies were available starting on hospital 
day 3. Laboratory results on hospital days 3 and 5 
(illness days 7 and 9) reflected leukopenia, mild 
thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of creatine 
kinase (Table 1). In addition, there were alterations 
in hepatic function measures: levels of alkaline 
phosphatase (68 U per liter), alanine aminotrans-
ferase (105 U per liter), aspartate aminotransferase 
(77 U per liter), and lactate dehydrogenase (465 U 
per liter) were all elevated on day 5 of hospital-
ization. Given the patient’s recurrent fevers, blood 
cultures were obtained on day 4; these have 
shown no growth to date.
A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3 
(illness day 7) was reported as showing no evi-
dence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Fig. 3). How-
ever, a second chest radiograph from the night of 
hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of 
pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung 
(Fig. 4). These radiographic findings coincided 
with a change in respiratory status starting on 
the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s 
oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse 
oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was 
breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was 
started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by na-
sal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the 
changing clinical presentation and concern about 
hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with 
vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed

Brief Report
by 1 g administered intravenously every 8 hours) 
and cefepime (administered intravenously every 
8 hours) was initiated.
On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth 
chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities 
in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical 
pneumonia (Fig. 5), and rales were noted in both 
lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic 
findings, the decision to administer oxygen sup-
plementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the 
persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple 
sites, and published reports of the development 
of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with 
the development of radiographic pneumonia in 
this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate 
use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treat-
ment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleo-
tide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was 
initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse 
events were observed in association with the 
infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the 
evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued 
on the following day, after serial negative pro-
calcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing 
for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s 
clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxy-
gen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation 
values improved to 94 to 96% while he was 
breathing ambient air. The previous bilateral 
lower-lobe rales were no longer present. His ap-
petite improved, and he was asymptomatic aside 
from intermittent dry cough and rhinorrhea. As 
of January 30, 2020, the patient remains hospi-
talized. He is afebrile, and all symptoms have re-
solved with the exception of his cough, which is 
decreasing in severity.

Methods
Specimen Collection
Clinical specimens for 2019-nCoV diagnostic 
testing were obtained in accordance with CDC 
guidelines.12 Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal 
swab specimens were collected with synthetic 
fiber swabs; each swab was inserted into a sepa-
rate sterile tube containing 2 to 3 ml of viral 
transport medium. Serum was collected in a 
serum separator tube and then centrifuged in 
accordance with CDC guidelines. The urine and 
stool specimens were each collected in sterile 
specimen containers. Specimens were stored 
between 2°C and 8°C until ready for shipment to 
the CDC. Specimens for repeat 2019-nCoV test-
ing were collected on illness days 7, 11, and 12 
and included nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal 
swabs, serum, and urine and stool samples.
Diagnostic Testing for 2019-nCoV
Clinical specimens were tested with an rRT-PCR 
assay that was developed from the publicly released 
virus sequence. Similar to previous diagnostic as-
says for severe acute respiratory syndrome coro-
navirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), it has three 
nucleocapsid gene targets and a positive control 
target. A description of this assay13 and sequence 
information for the rRT-PCR panel primers and 
probes14 are available on the CDC Laboratory 
Information website for 2019-nCoV.15
Genetic Sequencing
On January 7, 2020, Chinese researchers shared 
the full genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV through 
the National Institutes of Health GenBank data-
base16 and the Global Initiative on Sharing All 
Influenza Data (GISAID)17 database; a report about 
the isolation of 2019-nCoV was later published.18 
Nucleic acid was extracted from rRT-PCR–positive 
specimens (oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal) 
and used for whole-genome sequencing on both 
Sanger and next-generation sequencing plat-
forms (Illumina and MinIon). Sequence assem-
bly was completed with the use of Sequencher 
software, version 5.4.6 (Sanger); minimap soft-
ware, version 2.17 (MinIon); and freebayes soft-
ware, version 1.3.1 (MiSeq). Complete genomes 
were compared with the available 2019-nCoV 
reference sequence (GenBank accession number 
NC_045512.2).
Results
Specimen Testing for 2019-nCoV
The initial respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal 
and oropharyngeal swabs) obtained from this 
patient on day 4 of his illness were positive for 
2019-nCoV (Table  2). The low cycle threshold 
(Ct) values (18 to 20 in nasopharyngeal speci-
mens and 21 to 22 in oropharyngeal specimens) 
on illness day 4 suggest high levels of virus in 
these specimens, despite the patient’s initial mild 
symptom presentation. Both upper respiratory

Brief Report
specimens obtained on illness day 7 remained 
positive for 2019-nCoV, including persistent high 
levels in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen (Ct val-
ues, 23 to 24). Stool obtained on illness day 7 
was also positive for 2019-nCoV (Ct values, 36 to 
38). Serum specimens for both collection dates 
were negative for 2019-nCoV. Nasopharyngeal 
and oropharyngeal specimens obtained on ill-
ness days 11 and 12 showed a trend toward de-
creasing levels of virus. The oropharyngeal spec-
imen tested negative for 2019-nCoV on illness 
day 12. The rRT-PCR results for serum obtained 
on these dates are still pending.
Genetic Sequencing
The full genome sequences from oropharyngeal 
and nasopharyngeal specimens were identical to 
one another and were nearly identical to other 
available 2019-nCoV sequences. There were only 
3 nucleotides and 1 amino acid that differed at 
open reading frame 8 between this patient’s 
virus and the 2019-nCoV reference sequence 
(NC_045512.2). The sequence is available through 
GenBank (accession number MN985325).16
Discussion
Our report of the first confirmed case of 2019-
nCoV in the United States illustrates several as-
pects of this emerging outbreak that are not yet 
fully understood, including transmission dynam-
ics and the full spectrum of clinical illness. Our 
case patient had traveled to Wuhan, China, but 
reported that he had not visited the wholesale 
seafood market or health care facilities or had 
any sick contacts during his stay in Wuhan. Al-
though the source of his 2019-nCoV infection is 
unknown, evidence of person-to-person trans-
mission has been published. Through January 
30, 2020, no secondary cases of 2019-nCoV re-
lated to this case have been identified, but 
monitoring of close contacts continues.19
Detection of 2019-nCoV RNA in specimens 
from the upper respiratory tract with low Ct 
values on day 4 and day 7 of illness is suggestive 
of high viral loads and potential for transmissi-
bility. It is notable that we also detected 2019-
nCoV RNA in a stool specimen collected on day 
7 of the patient’s illness. Although serum speci-
mens from our case patient were repeatedly 
negative for 2019-nCoV, viral RNA has been de-
tected in blood in severely ill patients in China.4 
However, extrapulmonary detection of viral RNA 
does not necessarily mean that infectious virus 
is present, and the clinical significance of the 
detection of viral RNA outside the respiratory 
tract is unknown at this time.
Currently, our understanding of the clinical 
spectrum of 2019-nCoV infection is very limited. 
Complications such as severe pneumonia, respi-
ratory failure, acute respiratory distress syn-
drome (ARDS), and cardiac injury, including fa-
tal outcomes, have been reported in China.4,18,20 
However, it is important to note that these cases 
were identified on the basis of their pneumonia 
diagnosis and thus may bias reporting toward 
more severe outcomes.
Our case patient initially presented with mild 
cough and low-grade intermittent fevers, with-
out evidence of pneumonia on chest radiography 
on day 4 of his illness, before having progres-
sion to pneumonia by illness day 9. These non-
specific signs and symptoms of mild illness 
early in the clinical course of 2019-nCoV infec-
tion may be indistinguishable clinically from 
many other common infectious diseases, particu-
larly during the winter respiratory virus season.

Brief Report
In addition, the timing of our case patient’s 
progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness is 
consistent with later onset of dyspnea (at a me-
dian of 8 days from onset) reported in a recent 
publication.4 Although a decision to administer 
remdesivir for compassionate use was based on 
the case patient’s worsening clinical status, ran-
domized controlled trials are needed to deter-
mine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir and 
any other investigational agents for treatment of 
patients with 2019-nCoV infection.
We report the clinical features of the first 
reported patient with 2019-nCoV infection in the 
United States. Key aspects of this case included 
the decision made by the patient to seek medical 
attention after reading public health warnings 
about the outbreak; recognition of the patient’s 
recent travel history to Wuhan by local providers, 
with subsequent coordination among local, state, 
and federal public health officials; and identifica-
tion of possible 2019-nCoV infection, which al-
lowed for prompt isolation of the patient and sub-
sequent laboratory confirmation of 2019-nCoV, as 
well as for admission of the patient for further 
evaluation and management. This case report 
highlights the importance of clinicians eliciting 
a recent history of travel or exposure to sick con-
tacts in any patient presenting for medical care 
with acute illness symptoms, in order to ensure 
appropriate identification and prompt isolation 
of patients who may be at risk for 2019-nCoV 
infection and to help reduce further transmis-
sion. Finally, this report highlights the need to 
determine the full spectrum and natural history 
of clinical disease, pathogenesis, and duration of 
viral shedding associated with 2019-nCoV infec-
tion to inform clinical management and public 
health decision making.

We thank the patient; the nurses and clinical staff who are 
providing care for the patient; staff at the local and state health 
departments; staff at the Washington State Department of 
Health Public Health Laboratories and at the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC) Division of Viral Disease 
Laboratory; CDC staff at the Emergency Operations Center; and 
members of the 2019-nCoV response teams at the local, state, 
and national levels.
