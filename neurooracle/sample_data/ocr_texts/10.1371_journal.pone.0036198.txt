Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), is the leading cause of death due to bacterial infections in
mankind, and BCG, an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis, is an approved vaccine. BCG sequesters in immature
phagosomes of antigen presenting cells (APCs), which do not fuse with lysosomes, leading to decreased antigen processing
and reduced Th1 responses. However, an Mtb derived DfbpA attenuated mutant underwent limited phagosome maturation,
enhanced immunogenicity and was as effective as BCG in protecting mice against TB. To facilitate phagosome maturation
of DfbpA, we disrupted an additional gene sapM, which encodes for an acid phosphatase. Compared to the wild type Mtb,
the DfbpADsapM (double knock out; DKO) strain was attenuated for growth in mouse macrophages and PMA activated
human THP1 macrophages. Attenuation correlated with increased oxidants in macrophages in response to DKO infection
and enhanced labeling of lysosomal markers (CD63 and rab7) on DKO phagosomes. An in vitro Antigen 85B peptide
presentation assay was used to determine antigen presentation to T cells by APCs infected with DKO or other mycobacterial
strains. This revealed that DKO infected APCs showed the strongest ability to present Ag85B to T cells (.2500 pgs/mL in
4 hrs) as compared to APCs infected with wild type Mtb or DfbpA or DsapM strain (,1000 pgs/mL in 4 hrs), indicating that
DKO strain has enhanced immunogenicity than other strains. The ability of DKO to undergo lysosomal fusion and vacuolar
acidification correlated with antigen presentation since bafilomycin, that inhibits acidification in APCs, reduced antigen
presentation. Finally, the DKO vaccine elicited a better Th1 response in mice after subcutaneous vaccination than either
DfbpA or DsapM. Since DfbpA has been used in mice as a candidate vaccine and the DKO (DfbpADsapM) mutant is more
immunogenic than DfbpA, we propose the DKO is a potential anti-tuberculosis vaccine.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB), a major disease due to Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb), kills about 1.8 million people and is the cause
of latent infection in about a third of the human population.
Control of tuberculosis has become more complicated due to
multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR)
Mtb strains and AIDS. The attenuated Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus
Calmette-Gue´rin (BCG) vaccine, administered for fifty years to
over a billion people, does not protect against adult TB, while it
affords variable protection against childhood TB and tuberculous
meningitis [1,2].
During the last decade, many novel vaccines have been tested in
mouse or guinea pig models including DNA, subunit proteins,
recombinant BCG and attenuated strains of Mtb [3,4,5]. Most
DNA or subunit vaccines are based on immuno-dominant Mtb
proteins like MPT32, Phos, DnaK, GroES, MPT46, MPT53,
MPT63, 19 kDa lipoprotein, Antigen 85 (Ag85) complex (Ag 85A,
Ag85B and Ag85C), RD1 encoded proteins like early secretory
antigen target-6 (ESAT-6), culture filtrate protein 10 (CFP10), and
antigen TB10.4 [5]. Some have been tested as combinations and
others as fusion vaccines. Hybrid 1 (H-1) and HyVac-1 consisting
of Ag85B-ESAT-6, and Ag85B-TB10.4 [6,7] are some examples.
Most DNA and subunit vaccines show efficacy more or less similar
to BCG. However, recombinant BCG strains like BCG30 that
overexpresses Ag85B [8], BCG::RD1-2F9 that has RD1 region
integrated with chromosome to express ESAT-6 and related
proteins [9] and rBCG: DureC-Hly that expresses listeriolysin are
more effective than BCG in animal models [10,11]. Some of these
are in phase I and II clinical trials [5,12].
Since the RD1 region encoded major antigens ESAT-6 and
CFP-10 are deleted in BCG, efforts have been made to examine
whether attenuated mutants of wild type Mtb could serve as
candidate vaccines. We reported first that the fbpA gene disrupted
mutant (DfbpA) from wild type Mtb was attenuated for growth
within macrophages [13] and was an effective vaccine in mice
against tuberculosis [14]. Purine [15], leucine [16], proline/
tryptophan
[17]
and

described earlier as being attenuated in mice as well as protective
against tuberculosis in mice. The pantothenate auxotroph vaccine
followed these mutants [19,20,21,22,23,24] and set the trend for
multiple candidate vaccines derived from Mtb. The latter now
include Mtb fad26 [25], mec-2/mec-3 [26], RD1/panCD [21], phoP
[27,28,29], 19 kDa [30], sigE [31] and secA2/lysA [32]. Despite
inducing
better protection in animal models, Mtb derived
candidates are still far from human application due to safety
concerns. More importantly, there seems to be a decreased
understanding of the molecular basis of vaccine induced protection
in comparing BCG vs. Mtb derived vaccines.
Protective Th1 immune response against TB depends on CD4
T cells secreting IFN-c, IL-2 and TNF-a, and CD8 T cells
secreting similar cytokines and producing perforin and granulysin
[33,34,35]. CD4 and CD8 T cells are in turn, primed through
MHC-II and MHC-I dependent pathways of peptide presentation
by mycobacteria infected APCs. Furthermore, peptides are usually
generated by lysosomal proteases, which mean that mycobacteria
like Mtb or BCG vaccine need to be delivered into lysosomes for
efficient peptide production. Paradoxically, it is a well-established
fact that wild type Mtb and even BCG vaccine avoid phago-
lysosomal fusion [36,37,38,39,40,41].
It is becoming apparent that the inability of BCG vaccine to fuse
with lysosomes affects its efficacy. Initially, Pancholi et al. found
BCG growing in human monocytes sequestered from CD4 T cells
[42]. We reported that the presence of BCG in near neutral pH
phagosomes of macrophages leads to a reduced ability of
macrophages to present the immune-dominant antigen 85B
[43]. We also showed that Cathepsin-D was an important protease
that produced Ag85B and was not activated in neutral pH of the
phagosomes. Others reported that macrophages infected with
recombinant BCG expressing Cathepsin-S protease were able to
present Ag85B better since the novel BCG bypassed the need for
lysosomal fusion [44]. Finally, we reported that enhanced delivery
of BCG over-expressing Ag85B to lysosomes through autophagy
increased antigen presentation in vitro and vaccine efficacy in mice
[45]. Since Ag85B is a major component of anti-tuberculosis
vaccines, and anti-tuberculosis vaccines need to be processed
through the lysosomes to produce MHC-II dependent peptides,
we have proposed the ability of APCs to present Ag85B as a good
in vitro surrogate marker for vaccine efficacy.
In this context, very few attempts have been made to examine
Mtb derived vaccines for their ability to undergo PL fusion. Our
initial reports showed that Mtb derived attenuated DfbpA mutant
that lacks Ag85A of the Ag85 complex is immunogenic in mice,
partially phagosome maturation competent [13,14,46], protects
against tuberculosis, and is capable of priming T cells more
effectively than BCG. In this study, we examined the effect of
deleting another gene in DfbpA mutant to render it more
competent for PL fusion, presumably rendering it a better vaccine
candidate. We hypothesized that deletion of sapM gene in Mtb
DfbpA strain would further enhance the ability to undergo PL
fusion. The gene sapM codes for an acid phosphatase [47], which
plays a critical role during phagosome maturation by interfering
with the levels of phosphotidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) on the
phagosomes [48]. PI3P is a lipid component required for docking
of rab and rab effector proteins which regulate endosome
trafficking and eventual acquisition of lysosomal constituents by
phagosomes. Mtb sapM has been shown to hydrolyze (aka.depho-
sophorylation) PI3P to avoid maturation of Mtb containing
phagosomes [48]. We demonstrate here that the DfbpADsapM
double knock out (DKO) mutant is not only more attenuated than
DfbpA, but is also PL fusion competent and consequently, more
immunogenic in macrophages and mice.
Results
Generation of DfbpADsapM Double Knockout (DKO)
Strain
The creation of Mtb DfbpA strain and its characterization in
macrophages and mice have already been described [13,14,46].
To generate an additional sapM gene deletion in DfbpA, the
plasmid construct pTBSAPM5 was electroporated into this strain
and cultures were plated initially on 7H10-TW-OADC agar with
hygromycin and X-gal to obtain hygromycin resistant blue
colonies. This selection resulted in several blue colonies out of
which one colony designated as DKO/C was subjected to further
screening to obtain sucrose resistant colonies lacking b-galactosi-
dase activity. This screening resulted in three white colonies
namely DKO/C1, DKO/C2 and DKO/C7. To verify if deletion
of sapM gene had occurred in these colonies, a Southern blot was
made with genomic DNA from these strains and also with Mtb
H37Rv and Mtb DfbpA. Upon hybridization with 3.3 kb radiola-
beled DNA probe containing sapM region, and subsequent
autoradiography, the blot showed two signals (2.1 and 2.9 kb)
for Mtb H37Rv and Mtb DfbpA strains and only one signal (4.4 kb)
for DKO strains (DKO/C1 is shown here) (Fig. 1a). These signals
were on the predicted line, based on restriction sites in this region
of the genome (Fig. S1), and indicate that sapM gene is deleted by
allelic replacement in DKO strain. To further confirm the deletion
of sapM in DKO strain, we also performed PCR using primers
specific for this region (please see Fig. S1 for the location of the
primers). While primers located at the 59end (RV3310EX1) and 39
end (RV3310EX2) of the sapM gene yielded the expected sizes of
900 bp and 165 bp DNA, respectively for the Mtb H37Rv and
DKO strain (Fig. 1b), an internal primer RV3310RT2 with the
primer at the 59end of sapM (RV3310EX1) failed to amplify a
530 bp product in the DKO strain (Fig. 1c), again reinforcing the
deletion of sapM gene in this strain. Finally, we determined
whether the deletion of sapM gene in DKO strain led to the
disruption of the expression of this gene by RT-PCR, using the
internal primers RV3310RT1 and RV3310RT2. This revealed
that only cDNA obtained from Mtb H37Rv and Mtb DfbpA strain
only yielded the expected size DNA fragment (350 bp) but not the
DKO strain (Fig. 1d), thus confirming the absence of sapM
expression in DKO strain. This concluded the generation of Mtb
fbpA/sapM double knockout (DKO) strain.
DfbpADsapM DKO Strain is Attenuated in Macrophages
The ability of mycobacterial strains to grow inside macrophages
is a virulence trait, and macrophages are routinely used to
determine their virulence [14,46]. Fig. 2a & d illustrate the
growth of strains within mouse bone-marrow derived macrophag-
es (BMs) and human THP1 macrophages. The DKO strain was
relatively attenuated in both BMs and THP1 macrophages,
compared to DfbpA and DsapM mutants or the wild type Mtb
H37Rv (Fig. 2a,d). To determine if the enhanced attenuation of
DKO was due to sapM, we complemented the DKO mutant strain
with sapM gene and named the strain as DKOcom. BMs infected
with the DKOcom showed a growth curve similar to that of its
parental strain DfbpA (Fig. S2), indicating that the increased
attenuation of DKO was due to deletion of sapM.
Since, the intracellular death of mycobacteria is partly due to
oxidative radicals like reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide
(NO), macrophages and culture supernatants were evaluated
respectively for ROS using a fluorescent probe and NO derived
nitrite with Griess reagent. The BMs showed no significant
differences in ROS responses but a marginally elevated NO
response was induced by the DKO strain (Fig. 2b,c). In contrast,

the ROS response was elevated for THP1 macrophages infected
with DKO compared to other strains (Fig. 2e). There was no
significant NO response observed among THP1 macrophages
infected with either wild type or mutants (not shown). This
observation was consistent with the notion that human macrophages
produce barely detectable NO during mycobacterial infection [49].
ROS cascade begins with the generation of superoxide by
phagocyte oxidase [43]. Superoxide and inducible nitric oxide
synthase derived NO have bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity,
respectively against mycobacteria. To confirm the susceptibility of
DKO to oxidants, the superoxide and NO donor, 3-morpholino-
sydnonimine (SIN-1) was used to treat a highly viable culture of
wild type and mutants in broth culture. Fig. 2f shows that DKO
strain was again more susceptible to oxidants compared to others.
These data suggest that the decreased growth of DKO was
attributable in part to elevated oxidant responses in macrophages.
Similar studies were done using macrophages infected with DKO,
although it was difficult to rule out artifacts arising due to the dose-
dependent toxic effects of oxidants on macrophages.
DfbpADsapM DKO Strain is Processed Efficiently Through
Phago-lysosomal Fusion
Although Mtb H37Rv resists phago-lysosomal fusion [37,41,50],
certain mutant Mtb strains have a decreased ability to prevent PL
fusion,
and
this
decreased
ability
correlates
with
reduced
intracellular viability for these mutants [46,51]. Since lysosomes
present an acidified hostile environment, and the parent DfbpA
mutant was partially PL fusion competent, we reasoned that PL
fusion is one additional mechanism through which, intracellular
viability of DKO strain could be reduced. To test this hypothesis,
BMs and THP1 macrophages were infected with either GFP
tagged Mtb wild type (H37Rv) or Oregon green stained mutants
(DfbpA, DsapM and DKO).The PL fusion was monitored using
microscopic colocalization of lysosomal markers like CD63 and
rab7 (Fig. 3a). An antibody to lysosome associated membrane
protein-1 (LAMP-1), was used as a positive control since LAMP-1
is present on all mycobacterial phagosomes but at varying levels
between virulent and avirulent bacteria [46]. The DKO strain
extensively colocalized with LAMP-1 followed by DsapM, DfbpA
and H37Rv (Table, Fig. 3b). Significantly, CD63 and rab7 were
found to be more enriched on DKO phagosomes compared to
either DsapM or DfbpA or H37Rv. Since CD63 and rab7 are
definitive markers of lysosomes, and LAMP1 is present both on
late endosomes and lysosomes, these data indicated that DKO
phagosomes are lysosome fusion competent. It was also significant
to note that DsapM and DfbpA stained for CD63 and rab7 more
densely than wild type H37Rv, indicating that deletion of either
fbpA or sapM renders these mutants comparatively more lysosome
fusion competent than wild type H37Rv (Fig. 3b).

DfbpADsapM DKO Strain is More Immunogenic in
Macrophages and in Mice
Since DKO strain showed increased PL fusion and enhanced
susceptibility to killing within macrophages, we hypothesized that
DKO could be more immunogenic since PL fusion leads to
degradation of mycobacterial antigens facilitating their presenta-
tion through the MHC-II pathway. When mycobacteria infect
macrophages, an Ag85B derived peptide-25 epitope is rapidly
presented to T cells [52]. We demonstrated that, in vitro
presentation of Ag85B is a measure of immunogenicity of
mycobacteria in macrophages [43] and PL fusion of mycobacteria
within macrophages enhances Ag85B production predicting
vaccine
efficacy
against
tuberculosis
[45].
In
vitro
antigen
presentation using dendritic cells and macrophages, indicated that
the DKO strain was more efficiently processed since overlaid T
cells secreted more IL-2 (.2500 pgs/mL in 4 hrs) than either
DsapM (1000 pgs/mL) or DfbpA (950 pgs/mL) infected APCs
(Fig. 4a).
Finally, in vitro immunogenicity was correlated with the ability of
DKO to prime Th1 immunity in vivo. Mice were vaccinated
subcutaneously with 106 CFU of mutants and analyzed for Ag85B
specific T cells using Elispot. The DKO strain again induced an
increase in the number of Ag85B specific T cells in mouse spleens
(Fig. 4b). These data indicate that the DKO (DfbpADsapM) has a
highly immunogenic phenotype in macrophages and DCs as well
as in mice. It may be noted that the numbers of spot forming cells
(SFU) increased over 14 days followed by a decline. This is
consistent with the splenic immune response following mycobac-
terial vaccines. For example, SFUs for Ag85B increase after a
single vaccination with BCG over 2 weeks, and then decline [45].
Discussion
The use of BCG as a vaccine against tuberculosis is mainly due
to its genetic identity (over 90%) with Mtb, including genes
encoding immunodominant antigens. However, comparison of
genome sequences of M. bovis BCG with that of Mtb in late 90s
raised several new issues. It was noticed that M. bovis, the parent
strain of BCG, lacked approximately 120 ORFs in comparison
with Mtb genome, which includes sequences that code for some
regulatory proteins [53,54]. In addition, BCG lacked the RD1
region that encodes the major immunogens ESAT-6 and CFP-10
[55,56]. These differences indirectly implied that the antigenic
profiles of BCG vaccine would vary considerably from Mtb, and
BCG might not fully protect against tuberculosis. Attenuated
mutants from wild type Mtb were therefore generated to be used as
vaccines against tuberculosis [23]. Although the attenuated Mtb
mutants reported so far have been found to be variably effective
against experimental tuberculosis, some candidates have shown
better efficacy against tuberculosis in mice compared to BCG
vaccine. The selection of these vaccines was based primarily on the
growth attenuation within macrophages [21,23,24], although
some induced better levels of IFN-c secreting T cells in mice
Figure 2. The DfbpADsapM double knockout (DKO) strain is attenuated in macrophages and induces stronger oxidant responses
that reduce its viability: Macrophages from C57Bl/6 mouse bone marrow (BMs) and human THP1 macrophages (pre-activated with phorbol ester)
were infected with mycobacteria (MOI 1:1), washed, incubated, lysed and plated for viable colony counts (CFUs). a). The DKO strain is more
attenuated compared to wild type Mtb in BMs. b-c) Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) were measured respectively
using dihydro-dichloro-fluorescein acetate (DCFDA) fluorescent probe and Greiss reagent. DKO induced elevated NO responses (p value by t test;
panel c) but not ROS (panel b). d-e) DKO was attenuated in THP1 macrophages compared to DfbpA, DsapM or wild type H37Rv in BMs (p,0.01) that
correlated with increased ROS responses (panel e). Nitric oxide responses of THP1 were not detectable (not shown). f). Mycobacteria (105 CFU/mL;
baseline shown as dotted line) were exposed to the bactericidal action of the superoxide and NO donor 3-morpholinosydnonimine (10 mM; SIN-1) in
7H9 broth and viable counts determined at intervals (24 and 72 hr post treatment) by plating on 7H11 agar. DKO is markedly susceptible by 72 hrs in
vitro to the oxidants released by SIN-1 (p value by t test).

compared to BCG. Nevertheless, there are no striking differences
in modulation of host immune system by these vaccines and the
parameters of Mtb-derived vaccine induced immunogenicity
continue to be unclear. We sought to develop a novel DKO
strain that is both attenuated and immunogenic.
The criteria for defining immunogenicity of a vaccine have
remained diffuse and a surrogate marker has not been available to
predict vaccine efficacy. Our initial studies proposed an in vitro
Ag85B presentation as a surrogate marker to predict the
immunogenicity of genetically altered BCG vaccine strains and
mutants from wild type Mtb. Initially described by Harding’s
group, this assay depends on the rapid processing and presentation
of the immuno-dominant Ag85B by APCs to T cells that secrete
IL-2 upon antigen recognition. This assay has also been used by
others to monitor antigen processing within APCs [57]. We found
that the ability of mycobacterial vaccines to produce Ag85B
epitope within APCs generally correlated with the ability to
protect against tuberculosis in mice [43,44,45,58]. In this study, we
therefore used the ability of APCs to process Ag85B as a marker
for determining the immunogenicity of DKO. This seemed to be a
valid approach since MHC-II-bound peptides drive CD4-depen-
dent anti-tuberculosis TH1 response, and CD4 T cell deficient
human HIV-1 infected patients rapidly succumb due to tubercu-
losis [59].
We
propose
that
the
increased
processing
of DKO
in
macrophages that led to enhanced in vitro antigen presentation,
was due to an increased delivery of DKO to the lysosomes, which
in turn, was due to the double-gene deletions. In our earlier
studies, we found that DfbpA phagosomes fused readily with late
endosomes but still avoided lysosomes [46]. This was presumably
due to the phosphatase like activity of fbpA enzyme (unpublished
observations).
By
deleting
sapM
encoded
phosphatase,
we
enhanced the ability of DKO to bypass maturation inhibition
and DKO showed enhanced lysosomal localization in macro-
phages (Fig. 3). Thus, our intended plan to disrupt sapM and alter
trafficking of DKO succeeded.
It should be noted however that, a previous attempt to disrupt
sapM, only marginally affected the phenotype of BCG vaccine
[60]. In this regard, we propose following explanations. First, sapM
presumably needs to be released out of the phagosomes to cause
dephosphorylation of PI3P, and BCG phagosome membrane is
not known to be easily permeable. Cloning of listeriolysin into
BCG for example, enhances antigen release from phagosomes of
BCG and better CD8 T cell responses [10]. Secondly, we
disrupted sapM within DfbpA which is known to mature better than
wild type Mtb H37Rv and deletion of sapM had a complementing
effect on its ability to fuse with lysosomes [46]. On the other hand,
reconstitution of sapM increased the growth within macrophages of
the complemented DKOcom strain.
We therefore propose a novel concept that, the immunogenicity
of mycobacterial vaccine candidates can be enhanced by rational
deletion of mycobacterial genes that adversely regulate phagosome
traffic. This approach is in contrast with earlier approaches, where
the immunogenicity of candidate vaccines was enhanced by
adding more genes through recombinant DNA technology
[8,9,10].
Enhanced delivery to lysosomes and the apparent susceptibility
of DKO to oxidants rendered the mutant more attenuated for
growth in macrophages. This may be a benefit since candidate
vaccines need to be safer in animal models and humans. In
summary,
our
study
suggests
that
Mtb
derived
candidates
developed with emphasis on enhanced antigen processing are
more likely to be useful vaccines against tuberculosis, and DKO
mutant appears to be a potential vaccine candidate.

Ethics Statement
This study was carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations of the Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health. The
protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal care and Use
Committee of the University of Texas Health Science Center,
Houston (Protocol number AWC-09-175 under Animal Welfare
Assurance Number A3413-01).
Figure 4. The DfbpADsapM double knockout (DKO) strain is
more immunogenic in mouse macrophages and elicits stronger
immune responses in mice: a) BMs and DCs from C57Bl/6 mice were
infected with mycobacteria (MOI 1:1), washed and overlaid with
Antigen 85B specific BB7 hybridoma T cells (1:20 ratio). After 4 hrs,
the supernatants collected were tested for IL-2 using sandwich ELISA.
DKO induces BMs and DCs to prime T cells to secrete larger amounts of
IL-2, indicating a better processing of DKO for Ag85B (4 experiments,
SEM, * ,0.009 vs. DfbpA or DsapM; by t test). b). C57Bl/6 mice (3 per
group) were vaccinated with mycobacterial strains at 106 CFU per
mouse given once subcutaneously. At time intervals, the spleen derived
T cells were tested for Ag85B responsive T cells using IFN-c coated
plates and Elispot assay. DKO vaccination leads to a larger expansion of
Ag85B specific T cells. All Elispot numbers represent Ag85B stimulated
numbers subtracted from KLH protein stimulated T cells. T cells from
naı¨ve mice were stimulated with KLH alone (3 separate experiments, 3
mice per group per time point).

from ATCC. M. tuberculosis DfbpA strain is a derivative of H37Rv,
which we published earlier [13]. M. tuberculosis DsapM strain was
from NIH TB resources Center at Colorado State University
(currently
BEI,
ATCC).
Middlebrook

broth
medium
containing OADC (10%) and Tween (0.05%) (7H9 broth), or
Middlebrook 7H10 agar medium containing OADC (10%) and
Tween (0.05%) (7H10 Agar) or Middlebrook 7H11 agar medium
containing OADC (10%) (7H11 Agar) was used to grow M.
tuberculosis strains. Kanamycin (25 mg/mL) or hygromycin (50 mg/
mL) was added to the Middlebrook media to grow M. tuberculosis
strains harboring plasmids.
Disruption Plasmid for M. tuberculosis sapM
To disrupt sapM (Rv3310) gene in Mtb DfbpA strain, we first
downloaded the DNA sequences of sapM gene and its adjacent
region from NCBI databases. Based on the sequences, we
synthesized four oligonucleotide primers namely RV3310A,
RV3310B, RV3310C and RV3310D (Table 1). Synthesis of
oligonucleotide primers were performed at the Center for DNA
Technology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San
Antonio. While the primers RV3310A, RV3310B were designed
to amplify the 59 prime region of sapM and its upstream 1306 bp
fragment (Frag I), primers RV3310C and RV3310D were
designed to amplify the 39 region of sapM and its downstream
934 bp fragment (Frag II). Also primers Rv3310B and RV3310C
were engineered to have StuI sites in them. Using these primers
and Mtb H37Rv DNA, we amplified fragments I and II in PCR
and these fragments were cloned into pCR2.1 Vector (Invitrogen)
to create plasmids pTBSAPM1 and pTBSAPM2, respectively.
The fragment II from plasmid pTBSAPM2 was released by
cutting with StuI and BamHI and cloned into the pTBSAPM1 cut
with
the
same
restriction
enzymes.
The
resulting
plasmid
pTBSAPM3 has a DNA fragment, which has upstream and
downstream regions of sapM but with substantial deletion in sapM
coding region (Fig. S1). The DNA fragment in pTBSAPM3 was
released from the plasmid by digesting the plasmid with restriction
enzymes HindIII and NotI and the released fragment cloned into
p1NIL to create plasmid pTBSAPM4. A 7939 bp PacI fragment,
that contains sacB and lacZ genes and a gene for hygromycin
resistance, was then isolated from the plasmid pGOAL19 [61] and
cloned into the PacI site of the plasmid pTBSAPM4. The resulting
plasmid pTBSAPM5 was used to generate a markerless sapM
mutant in Mtb DfbpA strain. Plasmid DNA from E. coli was isolated
by using a Qiaperp kit (Qiagen Inc.,Valencia, Calif.).
Electroporation and Screening for the DfbpADsapM
Mutant
To obtain DfbpADsapM double mutant, we used DfbpA strain
reported earlier [13]. This mutant strain was grown to mid-
logarithmic phase (OD600 = 0.8–1.0) in 7H9 broth and competent
cells prepared according to Jacobs et al. [62]. Four hundred
microliter of Dfbp cells were mixed with 5 mg pTBSAPM5 DNA,
linearized with NaOH treatment, in 0.2 mm cuvettes (BioRad)
and electroporated using standard protocols. After electroporation,
1 mL 7H9 medium without any antibiotic was added to each
cuvette and left overnight at 37uC. Then, the cell suspension from
the cuvettes was plated on 7H10 agar plates containing the
antibiotic hygromycin (50 mg/mL) and X-gal (40 mg/mL). Trans-
formants showing blue color, resulting from single crossover event,
were selected after three weeks of incubation at 37uC. Further
screening of the transformants for the deletion of sapM region was
performed by a two-step selection method [61]. First, the blue
colonies were streaked onto 7H10 agar plates containing no
antibiotics. Following growth, a loop-full of cells were resuspended
into liquid medium, diluted serially to several folds and plated onto
7H10- agar plates containing 2% sucrose. Sucrose resistant
colonies resulting from double crossover event were streaked onto
plates with or without hygromycin. Colonies showing no resistance
to hygromycin were finally streaked onto plates containing
kanamycin, since fbpA mutant is kanamycin resistant. The DNA
from these colonies were further examined in Southern and PCR
to confirm the deletion of sapM region.
Complementation of DKO Strain
To
complement
the
DKO
strain
with
sapM
gene,
we
constructed an integration plasmid carrying sapM gene as follows.
First, we amplified the whole sapM gene and its upstream
promoter region (2116 bp) by PCR using primers RV3310A
and RV3310EX2 (Table 1) and Mtb H37Rv genomic DNA. The
fragment was cloned in pCR2.1 vector to result in plasmid
pTBSAPMA. This plasmid was digested with KpnI and XbaI to
release the fragment which was cloned in KpnI and XbaI digested
pMV306H, a derivative of pMV306 in which kanamycin resistant
marker is replaced with hygromycin marker, to get plasmid
pM306SAPMA. This plasmid was transformed into DKO/C1
(DfbpA/DsapM double mutant) strain by electroporation. The
colonies were selected in 7H10 hygromycin plates and the
integration of the plasmid was confirmed by Southern blot (data
not shown). The resulting strain was named as DKOcom.
Southern and PCR Analysis
To confirm the deletion of sapM gene in Mtb DfbpA strain, we
performed Southern analysis [63]. We isolated chromosomal
DNA from Mtb H37Rv, Mtb DfbpA and Mtb DfbpADsapM strains
using CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) method [64] and
3 mg of each DNA was digested with NdeI and BamHI. The
digested fragments were separated on 1% agarose gel and
Southern transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (BioRad). The
blot was hybridized with a [a-32P]dCTP labeled probe generated
by random primer method using the 3300 bp DNA fragment
(generated by primers Rv3310A and Rv3310D) as template.
Southern hybridization and final washing of the blot were
performed at 68uC. In addition to Southern, we also carried out
Table 1. Oligonucleotide primers used in this study.

PCR to confirm the deletion of sapM region in Mtb DfbpADsapM
strain using standard protocol [63] with Taq polymerase (Perkin-
Elmer, Foster City, Calif.). We used primers Rv3310EX1,
Rv3310EX2 and Rv3310RT2 (Table 1) for this analysis.
RNA Isolation and RT-PCR
Total RNA from Mtb strains was isolated using Tri reagent as
described previously [65]. cDNA from total RNA was synthesized
using Superscript (Invitrogen) and random hexamers. PCR
analysis
was
performed
with
primers
RV3310RT1
and
RV3310RT2 (Table 1) and using the cDNA from the previous
step as the template for the reaction.
Macrophages and T Cells
Bone marrows from C57BL/6 (4–8 weeks) mice were cultured
for 7–10 days in Iscove’s modification of Dulbecco’s modified
Eagles medium (IDMEM) with 10% FBS and 10 ng/mL GM-
CSF (Cell Sciences, USA). The macrophages (BMs) and dendritic
cells (DCs) were purified using CD11c bead fractionation kit
(Miltenyi Inc, USA) yielding .95% pure DCs and .95%
adherent BMs (effluent of bead fractionation) [46]. They were
plated onto 24 well plates (for colony counts, oxidant measure-
ment) or 8-well slide chambers (for antibody stains) and were
rested in IDMEM without GM-CSF before infections. In addition
to mouse derived cells, phorbol mystyl acetate (PMA) (10 nM)
activated human THP1 cells were used to test the intracellular
growth of mycobacteria. The T cell hybridoma (BB7) cell line
specific for an epitope (241–256) of Ag85B of Mtb was used in
antigen presentation assays (kindly provided by Dr. C. Harding,
Case Western University, Cleveland, OH). The culture of these
cell lines were described earlier [43,46].
Determination of Intracellular Growth or Survival of Mtb
Strains
To determine the growth curves in macrophages, the wild type
and mutants were used to infect (MOI of 10) naı¨ve BMs and PMA
activated
THP1
cells
using
procedures
described
earlier
[14,43,46]. Phagocytosis was allowed to take place for 4 h, after
which the monolayers were washed to remove the non-phagocy-
tosed bacteria. One mL of fresh IDMEM medium was added to
each well and the culture plates were incubated at 37uC in the
presence of 5% CO2. After each time point, macrophages were
harvested and lysed with 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for
15 min at room temperature. Tenfold dilutions of the lysed
macrophage suspensions were made in PBS and 100 mL of each
dilution was examined for Mtb growth on triplicate 7H11 agar
plates that were incubated for 3 weeks at 37uC. Each Mtb strain
was examined in quadruplicate wells and three independent
experiments were performed.
Oxidant Assay and Oxidant Susceptibility of
Mycobacteria in Macrophages
BMs and THP1 macrophages infected with mycobacteria were
tested for ROS using the fluorescent probe H2-dichlorodihydro-
fluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA)(Invitrogen, USA) that is cleaved
within the cells by esterases and oxidized into fluorescent DCF
reactive
oxygen
species
(ROS)
induced
by
infection
[43].
Fluorescent DCF was measured by reading BMs or THPs of 24
well plates using in Ascent fluoroscan at 485 nm/530 nm.
Triplicate wells of macrophages were read for each mutant at
different time intervals in two separate experiments and plotted as
average fluorescence units (AFU). The enzyme inducible nitric
oxide synthase generated nitric oxide (NO) was measured in the
supernatants of similar cultures using Griess reagent and expressed
as mM nitrite in the medium. The susceptibility of mycobacteria to
superoxide and NO released by the donor 3-morpholinosydnoni-
mine N-ethylcarbamide (SIN-1)(Invitrogen, USA) was determined
by incubating 105 CFU/mL of mycobacteria in a broth culture
with 10 mM of SIN-1 for 24 and 72 hrs and plating organisms on
7H11 agar for viable counts.
Phago-lysosomal Localization of Mtb Strains
Macrophages were infected with GFP expressing Mtb H37Rv
and Oregon green stained DfbpA, DsapM and DKO (DfbpADsapM)
strains. These strains were sonicated slightly to disperse the
bacteria, centrifuged at 500 rpm and the supernatant containing
the single CFUs were used for infection. BMs of slide chambers
were infected with Mtb strains (MOI, 1) for 4 h at 37uC in the
presence of 5% CO2, washed, and incubated with fresh medium
up to 72 h. Washing, fixing of the cells, staining for different
markers and mounting of the slides were performed as reported
earlier
[66].
Texas
red
conjugated
antibodies
to
primary
antibodies were from Jackson Immunochemicals (West Grove,
PA). Colocalization was examined and scored using a Nikon
fluorescence microscope equipped with a Metaview deconvolution
software as described [67].
In vitro Antigen 85B Presentation Assay
Monolayers of BMs were infected with Mtb strains for 4 hrs,
(MOI 1:5) washed and overlaid with Ag85B specific BB7 T cells
(1:20 ratio) as described earlier [43]. Four or 18 hrs later the
supernatant was assayed for IL-2 using a sandwich ELISA kit (R
and D systems, CA) and expressed as pg/mL/106 T cells. This
assay has been validated earlier by the lack of antigen presentation
when macrophages are infected with Mtb strains deleted for
Ag85B antigen (DfbpB) or when MHC class II deficient PMJ2-R
macrophages are used as antigen presenting cells [43]. Two or
four separate experiments were performed for each Mtb strain
using triplicate wells for each assay and the data were averaged for
p value calculations.
Elispot Assay
C57Bl/6 mice (3 per group per time point per strain) were
immunized s.c. with 106 CFU of Mtb strains once and after 7,14
and 21 days, the splenic cells were depleted of non-T cells using a
pan-T cell kit (Miltenyi Inc). A 96 well plate coated with anti-
mouse IFNc (Elispot kit, Ebiosciences) was washed and overlaid
with 105 enriched T cells from spleens of mice along with T cells
from naı¨ve mice. The wells were added with 100 ng of Ag85B
purified protein per well (BEI,ATCC). Control wells received
100 ng/mL of KLH protein and Elispots from this control were
subtracted from those induced by Ag85B restimulation and
expressed as spot forming cells per 105 T cells. Three separate
experiments were performed and data averaged.
