Mycobacteria are well known for their taxonomic diversity, their impact on global health,
and for their atypical cell wall and envelope. In addition to a cytoplasmic membrane and
a peptidoglycan layer, the cell envelope of members of the order Corynebacteriales,
which include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, also have an arabinogalactan layer
connecting the peptidoglycan to an outer membrane, the so-called “mycomembrane.”
This unusual cell envelope composition of mycobacteria is of prime importance for
several physiological processes such as protection from external stresses and for
virulence. Although there have been recent breakthroughs in the elucidation of the
composition and organization of this cell envelope, its evolutionary origin remains
a mystery. In this perspectives article, the characteristics of the cell envelope of
mycobacteria with respect to other actinobacteria will be dissected through a molecular
evolution framework in order to provide a panoramic view of the evolutionary pathways
that appear to be at the origin of this unique cell envelope. In combination with a robust
molecular phylogeny, we have assembled a gene matrix based on the presence or
absence of key determinants of cell envelope biogenesis in the Actinobacteria phylum.
We present several evolutionary scenarios regarding the origin of the mycomembrane. In
light of the data presented here, we also propose a novel alternative hypothesis whereby
the stepwise acquisition of core enzymatic functions may have allowed the sequential
remodeling of the external cell membrane during the evolution of Actinobacteria and has
led to the unique mycomembrane of slow-growing mycobacteria as we know it today.

INTRODUCTION
The Actinobacteria phylum of Gram-positive bacteria forms an extremely diverse group that
includes several species that have evolved speciﬁc symbioses (commensal or parasitic) with a
wide range of hosts including numerous mammals. For example, certain species from the genera
Mycobacterium and Nocardia are pathogenic while others, belonging to the genus Biﬁdobacterium,
are part of the normal gut microbial ﬂora and are known to have a beneﬁcial and important eﬀect
on human health (Barka et al., 2016; O’Callaghan and van Sinderen, 2016). Several Actinobacteria

Mycobacterial Cell Envelope Evolution
GRAPHICAL ABSTRACT | The different theories on the evolutionary origin of the mycobacterial cell envelope.
are also involved in the production of antibiotic compounds
(e.g., Streptomyces sp.), amino acids (e.g., Corynebacterium sp.),
biofuels, and other bioproducts (Becker and Wittmann, 2016;
Lewin et al., 2016).
One of the most studied bacteria from the Actinobacteria
phylum is Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent of
tuberculosis, a disease that causes signiﬁcant morbidity and
mortality. It is a leading cause of death worldwide making
its control a top priority for the World Health Organization
(Pai et al., 2016; Friedrich, 2017). Several bacteria from the
Corynebacteriales order, that includes M. tuberculosis, are studied
for having an atypical structural characteristic: the presence
of a so-called “mycomembrane” that, in an organizational
sense, is believed to resemble the outer membrane of typical
Gram-negative bacteria (Zuber et al., 2008; Touchette and
Seeliger, 2017; Figure 1). This mycomembrane is limited to
members of the Corynebacteriales with some species-speciﬁc
variation (Goodfellow and Jones, 2015; Mohammadipanah and
Dehhaghi, 2017). Besides the components common to other
Gram-positive bacteria, Corynebacteriales also have a layer of
arabinogalactan attached to the peptidoglycan layer and to the
inner leaﬂet of the mycolic-acid containing mycomembrane.
This unusual structure, along with some phylogenetic ambiguity,
have led certain authors to suggest that M. tuberculosis has
more in common with Gram-negative bacteria than with
their Gram-positive relatives (Fu and Fu-Liu, 2002). In the
1970s, two distinct cell envelope cleavage planes were recorded
for freeze-etched mycobacteria (Barksdale and Kim, 1977).
These ﬁndings contributed to the original proposal for a
mycobacterial outer membrane. Further unequivocal evidence
was provided by labeling with selective ﬂuorescent probes
(Christensen et al., 1999). In fact, the debate about the existence
and composition of the mycomembrane was partially resolved
only 10 years ago when it was visualized by cryo-electron
microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS) (Hoﬀmann et al.,
2008; Zuber et al., 2008). The reasons for the evolution of
this membrane are still not totally clear, although we know
that it is important for several aspects of the virulence and
intrinsic antibiotic resistance of pathogenic species such as
M. tuberculosis (Forrellad et al., 2013; Becker and Sander,
2016). In addition, as this membrane (along with the rest
of the cell envelope) is at the frontline of environmental
interactions, it is expected that diﬀerences in the constitution
of the mycomembrane are associated with adaptation to
speciﬁc environments or ecological niches (Veyrier et al.,
2009).
In this era of large-scale DNA sequencing (Vincent et al.,
2017), we can now investigate and compare the genomic
sequences of bacteria at an unprecedented rate (Land et al., 2015)
and infer the key steps that have led to the development and
modiﬁcation of the various subcomponents of bacterial cells.
In recent years, numerous actinobacterial genomes have been
sequenced including a broad representation of each genus. As
expected, analysis of these data revealed a great heterogeneity
in terms of the many biological functions associated with these
bacteria (Ventura et al., 2007; Gomez-Escribano et al., 2016).
Based on this large amount of sequence information, it is
now possible to carry out an evolutionary analysis of the cell
envelope in order to dissect the genetic events that have led
to its development. Here, we describe the diﬀerent layers of
the cell envelope for the Actinobacteria phylum with a speciﬁc
emphasis on species that harbor the mycomembrane. Although
a number of mysteries still remain, our goal for this article is to
provide new perspectives on the evolutionary path and beneﬁts
surrounding the unique membrane features of this important
group of bacteria.

ACTINOBACTERIAL CELL ENVELOPE
LAYERS
Granular Layer
By using CEMOVIS, it is possible to visualize a “granular layer”
in between the plasma membrane and the peptidoglycan layer
of Mycobacterium bovis BCG, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and
Corynebacterium glutamicum (Zuber et al., 2008). A previous
study made on other Gram-positive bacteria has shown that
the granular layer is possibly linked to the plasma membrane
and composed of penicillin-binding proteins, lipoproteins, and
lipoteichoic acids (or teichuronic acid in some species; for
review see Tul’skaya et al., 2011) (Zuber et al., 2006). Although,
it seems this structure is common to several Gram-positive
bacteria, the function and its precise composition are poorly
characterized.
Layer I: Peptidoglycan
The cell envelope of Actinobacteria is composed of a layer
of peptidoglycan that provides essential functions such as
rigidity and helps to maintain an optimal osmotic stability
(Vollmer
et
al.,
2008;
Jankute
et
al.,
2015).
Although
peptidoglycan is common amongst bacteria, there are many
subtle diﬀerences in its composition that have been used in
the past as a way to identify distinct species in the context
of
chemotaxonomy
(Lechevalier
and
Lechevalier,
1970).
The standard peptidoglycan consists of short peptides and
glycan strands that are composed of N-acetylglucosamine
(GlcNAc)
and
N-acetylmuramic
acid
(MurNAc)
residues
linked byβ-1→4 bonds. The third amino acid in the peptide
stem is usually meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP) for
Gram-negative and L-lysine for Gram-positive bacteria (Egan
et al., 2017). In Actinobacteria, this amino acid is variable
with
numerous
species
(including
the
Corynebacteriales
order) that harbor meso-DAP. This property is potentially
due to the species-speciﬁc aﬃnity of the ligase MurE (UDP-
N-acetylmuramoylalanyl-D-glutamate-2,6-diaminopimelate
ligase) for meso-DAP (Hammes et al., 1977; Basavannacharya
et
al.,
2010).
Furthermore,
diﬀerences
in
these
third
amino-acids
were
used
as
a
marker
for
Actinobacteria
cell wall types II, III, and IV (Lechevalier and Lechevalier,
1970).
In addition to having meso-DAP, the peptidoglycan of
members of the Corynebacteriales order has another major
distinction: a portion of MurNAc molecules is oxidized
to
become
N-glycolylmuramic
acid
(MurNGlyc).
This
characteristic,
in
addition
to
playing
an
important
role
in the structure of peptidoglycan, has been suggested to
increase
resistance
to
lysozyme
and
β-lactam
antibiotics
(Raymond et al., 2005). The hydroxylase responsible for this
modiﬁcation is encoded by the gene namH (Rv3818; as per the
reference M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome) (Raymond et al., 2005;
Coulombe et al., 2009; Hansen et al., 2014). As expected, this
gene is found in several members of the Corynebacteriales order
(Figure 2). However, it appears to be absent from the genomes
of genera such as Hoyosella and in those that are the most
“basal” of the order: Corynebacterium, Turicella, Lawsonella,
Dietzia, and Segniliparus. Interestingly, a few other genera in
the Actinobacteria phylum, but not in the Corynebacteriales,
also have a putative namH homolog (Figure 2). This is the
case
for
Stackebrandtia
(Glycomycetales),
Micromonospora
(Micromonosporales), and Salinispora (Micromonosporales) that
form a discrete sub-lineage and have been described to harbor
a cell wall with MurNGlyc (Parte et al., 2012). As an exception,
a few scattered species (such as Catenulispora acidiphila and
Rubrobacter radiotolerans) possess a homologous copy of NamH,
although to the best of our knowledge there is no evidence for

FIGURE 2 | Distribution within the Actinobacteria phylum of genes involved in the synthesis of components of the cell envelope of M. tuberculosis. The 72 genome sequences ( Supplementary Table S1),
comprising at least one species per order, were annotated using PROKKA version 1.12 (Seemann, 2014). The phylogenetic tree was generated from 86 sequences inferred as orthologous by GET_HOMOLOGUES
version 20180313 (Contreras-Moreira and Vinuesa, 2013). The sequences were aligned using MAFFT version 7.397 (Katoh and Standley, 2013) and concatenated and partitioned using AMAS (Borowiec, 2016).
Finally, the best evolutionary model for each partition was found by IQ-TREE version 1.6.3 (Kalyaanamoorthy et al., 2017) and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis was also performed using IQ-TREE (Nguyen
et al., 2015) using 10,000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates (Hoang et al., 2018). Only bootstrap values under 100 are shown on the tree. Nodes that are discussed in the article are highlighted with a numbered black
circle. The green and black squares of the matrix highlight genes that are present or absent, respectively. Individual genes ( Supplementary Table S2) were considered to be present when they had a sequence
similarity ≥50% relative to M. tuberculosis [an e-value cut-off of 1e-10 has also been applied in TBLASTN version 2.7.1 (Altschul et al., 1997)]. The raw data, containing the similarity values, is presented in the
Supplementary Table S2 for clarity. The “∗” represent micro-evolution of speciﬁc strains (described in the corresponding sections of the article). Dashed lines represent delineation, described in the literature, of
the presence/absence of the speciﬁc layers also depicted at the right side of the ﬁgure. Of note, although the phylogenetic position of Gaiella sp. SCGC AG-212-M14 is expected for a member of the order
Gaiellales, the size of the assembly (<1 Mb) coming from a single cell ampliﬁed by WGA-X, suggests that the sequence of this strain is likely incomplete.

the presence of MurNGlyc in their peptidoglycan (Parte et al.,
2012).
Layer II: Arabinogalactan
In addition to its distinct composition, the peptidoglycan
of Corynebacteriales is also the point of attachment of
arabinogalactan,
a
highly
branched
heteropolysaccharide
composed of galactose and arabinose in a furanoid form
(Figure 1; McNeil et al., 1987). It is estimated that approximately
10% of the MurNAc residues of the peptidoglycan are
covalently linked to arabinogalactan [α-L-rhamnopyranose-
(1→3-α-D-GlycNAc-(1→P))] (McNeil et al., 1990). Although
this linkage is unique, it resembles the one that connects
cell wall teichoic acids to peptidoglycan in other Gram-
positive species. This similarity led to the discovery of a
phosphotransferase of the LytR-CpsA-Psr family, named Lcp1,
which is encoded by the Rv3267 gene and plays a leading role
in linking arabinogalactan to peptidoglycan in M. tuberculosis
(Baumgart et al., 2016; Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016; Harrison et al.,
2016).
In terms of its distribution within the Actinobacteria
phylum, arabinogalactan is produced exclusively by the members
of the Corynebacteriales order and in some species from
related orders such as Pseudonocardiales and Actinopolysporales
(Goodfellow et al., 1984) [with the exception of Actinosynnema
mirum (Hasegawa et al., 1978)]. These latter two orders
possess a typical type IV cell wall (Lechevalier and Lechevalier,
1970), although they lack mycolic acids (Ludwig et al.,
2015). The global distribution of genes implicated in the
synthesis and transport of arabinogalactan is well correlated
with the fact that these species produce arabinogalactan (see
Figure 2). Nevertheless, a deeper investigation of these latter
two orders will be required to exclude possible exceptions or
misinterpretation.
Layer III: Mycolic Acids
The inner leaﬂet of the external mycomembrane is homogeneous
and is mainly composed of mycolic acids (MAs) – long-chain
fatty acids that are exclusive to the order Corynebacteriales
(Bansal-Mutalik and Nikaido, 2014; Marrakchi et al., 2014). On
one hand, MAs form a barrier to hydrophilic molecules including
several antibiotics (Liu et al., 1995), while on the other hand,
they are also the target of some ﬁrst- and second-line anti-TB
drugs including isoniazid (Jackson et al., 2013; Marrakchi et al.,
2014). In an evolutionary context, MAs play a prominent role
in taxonomic diﬀerentiation within the Corynebacteriales order.
In this sense, there is a great diversity in the number of carbons
and functional groups comprising the MAs, thus making it
possible to use them as a chemotaxonomic marker to diﬀerentiate
between genera and also at the species level (Minnikin et al.,
1984; Barry et al., 1998; Song et al., 2009; Marrakchi et al.,
2014).
As reviewed elsewhere (Marrakchi et al., 2014), the raw
materials of MAs, fatty acids, are produced by the combination
of two fatty acid synthases (FAS-I and FAS-II). The ﬁrst, FAS-
I, is a eukaryotic-like protein narrowly distributed in bacteria
(Cabruja et al., 2017) and encoded by the fas gene (Rv2524c).
FAS-I produces acyl-CoAs with a bimodal distribution of C16-
C18 and C24-C26. FAS-II, on the other hand, is far more
common across bacterial species (Cabruja et al., 2017) and begins
with the formation of β-ketoacyl-ACP by Claisen condensation
of malonyl-ACP [produced from malonyl-CoA by MtFabD
(Rv2243)], with acyl-CoA (the product of FAS-I), through the
action of MtFabH (Rv0533). Other enzymes such as HadA
(Rv0635), HadB (Rv0636), HadC (Rv0637), InhA (Rv1484), KasA
(Rv2245), and KasB (Rv2246) are involved in the subsequent
steps of elongation and maturation of fatty acids by FAS-II.
The ﬁnal MA structure is produced though several crucial steps
that include, among others, activation (FadD32 and Rv3801c),
condensation (Pks13 and Rv3800c) and reduction (CmrA and
Rv2509).
Although the presence of MAs is well-conserved throughout
the Corynebacteriales, there are some exceptions. For example,
basal species of Corynebacteriales (such as Corynebacterium,
Dietzia, Lawsonella, and Turicella) that form a monophyletic
group, lack multiple genes conﬁrming the well described diversity
in length and composition of MA. It has already been reported
that some species of Corynebacterium possess two FAS-I genes
(such as C. glutamicum), while some do not have the genes
encoding for the typical FAS-II machinery (Radmacher et al.,
2005). Interestingly, Corynebacterium cannot elongate MAs
(Radmacher et al., 2005; Burkovski, 2013), which is consistent
with the lack of more than 50% of genes implicated in this
pathway.
Turicella otitidis possesses almost none of the genes involved
in MA biosynthesis (see “∗” in Figure 2). This species is clearly in
the order Corynebacteriales based on its genome sequence (Baek
et al., 2018). However, a recent study suggests that the genome of
T. otitidis has lost the key genes involved in MA synthesis (Baek
et al., 2018). This result corroborates the fact that this bacterium
does not produce MAs which is exceptional for a bacterium of
the order Corynebacteriales and this microevolution has made its
positioning within this order rather diﬃcult (Funke et al., 1994).
Interestingly, this species still produces arabinogalactan (Renaud
et al., 1996).
Layer IV: External Lipids
While the composition of the inner leaﬂet of the mycomembrane
is homogenous, the outer leaﬂet is highly heterogeneous and
consists of lipids, lipoglycans, and proteins (Chiaradia et al.,
2017). Due to its complexity and species-speciﬁc constitution, it
remains poorly characterized with the exception of the pathogen
M. tuberculosis and closely related slow-growing mycobacteria. In
these bacteria, several lipids are associated with the external leaﬂet
including – but not limited to – phthiocerol dimycocerosate
(PDIM), phenolic glycolipid (PGL, phenolphthiocerol-based
glycolipids that share a similar long-chain fatty acid backbone
with PDIM), and lipooligosaccharides (LOS). These components
seem to be important virulence factors (Reed et al., 2004;
Forrellad et al., 2013) and have been shown to be involved
in the infection of macrophages as well as in escape from
the immune system (Cambier et al., 2014). The PDIM and
PGL-associated genes (Rv2928 to Rv2963), are all co-located
within the same cluster of the chromosome (Goude and Parish,
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org
5
October 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 2341

Vincent et al.
Mycobacterial Cell Envelope Evolution
2008; Supplementary Table S2). LOS are common to several
slow growing mycobacteria (including “M. canettii” from the
M. tuberculosis complex) although they are not produced by
M. tuberculosis due to the loss of Pks5.1 and truncation of
PapA4. The remaining genes implicated in this pathway are
present (Figure 2) which suggests micro-evolution in this species
has led to the loss of LOS production (Boritsch et al., 2016;
Brennan, 2016). This apparent evolutionary change correlates
with a marked increase in whole cell hydrophobicity and
enhanced aerosol transmission of current TB strains (Jankute
et al., 2017).
The external layer of the mycomembrane also contains
trehalose monomycolate – TMM, and trehalose dimycolate –
TDM (also called “cord factor”) that also have crucial functions
in the regulation of the host-symbiont relationship (Hunter
et al., 2006). These molecules consist of glucose disaccharides
(α-D-glucopyranosyl-α-D-glucopyranoside)
esteriﬁed
with
MAs.
TMM
is
generated
in
the
cytoplasm,
whereupon
MmpL3
(Rv0206c)
subsequently
transports
this
molecule
to the periplasm (Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016). Finally, the
accepted model (for a review see Marrakchi et al., 2014) is
that TMM in the periplasm serves as the MA donor for the
mycolylation of arabinogalactan, and is also processed to
give TDM. Both reactions involve the Ag85 enzyme complex
(Belisle et al., 1997). Three genes (Rv3803c, Rv1886c, and
Rv0129c) encode for the Ag85 complex and they are only
present in the MA-positive species as seen in Figure 2. As
TMM and TDM rely on the presence of MAs and Ag85,
their
distribution
is
therefore
restricted
to
MA
positive
species. Indeed, they have been isolated from Mycobacterium,
Corynebacterium, Nocardia, and Rhodococcus (Noll et al., 1956;
Ioneda et al., 1970; Jean-Claude et al., 1976; Mompon et al.,
1978; Lopes Silva et al., 1979; Pommier and Michel, 1979;
Rapp et al., 1979; Batrakov et al., 1981). However, further
characterization is necessary for other MA-positive species (such
as Segniliparus).
WHAT IS THE EVOLUTIONARY ORIGIN
OF THE MYCOBACTERIAL CELL
ENVELOPE?
The biological functions and molecular mechanisms surrounding
the
biosynthesis
of
the
mycomembrane
present
in
the
Corynebacteriales are being uncovered slowly, but surely.
However, the precise origin of this feature that is unique
amongst members of the Actinobacteria (otherwise composed
essentially of monoderm bacteria) continues to be a mystery.
Two main theories can potentially explain the biogenesis of
the mycomembrane: (1) that it arose via the remodeling of an
already existing outer membrane, or (2) that it has a de novo
origin (Graphical Abstract).
The ﬁrst theory was proposed based on the observation that
a double membrane is generated as a byproduct of endospore
formation in bacteria (although endospores have not been found
in Actinobacteria) (Tocheva et al., 2011; Tocheva et al., 2013).
Assuming that the primordial cell was monoderm, a double
membraned cell could have appeared via the retention of the
second spore membrane, thus giving rise to a diderm common
ancestor of all bacteria. This theory implies a bottleneck that
selected for this ancestor but also that the current monoderm
species appeared by independent loss of the outer membrane. In
order to generate a mycomembrane, a signiﬁcant re-engineering
of the gene content (diﬃcult to assess due to gene erosion
over time) would have occurred in Corynebacteriales and could
account for the atypical envelope characteristics when compared
to other diderm species (Tocheva et al., 2016). This theory
remains an open question in the ﬁeld (Sutcliﬀe and Dover,
2016).
The second theory proposes that the double bacterial
membrane is a homoplastic character (i.e., a similar trait from
diﬀerent evolutionary origins) that has evolved several times
independently in a functionally convergent manner. With regard
to the Actinobacteria phylum, the double membrane could have
appeared “recently” by successive horizontal acquisition of genes
allowing a step-by-step construction of the cell envelope that is
present in Mycobacterium.
The distribution of the major genes implicated in the
synthesis of the diﬀerent layers of the mycomembrane is
presented for the Actinobacteria in Figure 2. This ﬁgure needs
to be interpreted carefully as the function of the diﬀerent
orthologous proteins has not been proven to be conserved
across all the listed species. Nevertheless, one can observe a
“phylogenetic gradient” in terms of the distribution of genes
involved in the construction of the cell-envelope from inside
to outside (Figure 2). In addition, one can observe a step-
wise distribution in the evolution of the layers comprising
the cell envelope. Both the gene content and the cell wall
characteristics are well correlated. When investigating the
genes involved in peptidoglycan synthesis throughout the
genomes of the Actinobacteria, it can be observed that they
are broadly distributed. On the other hand, arabinogalactan
(and the genes implicated in this pathway) are restricted to
bacteria that have diverged after the evolutionary node that
we called “Node 1” (Figure 2). The MAs are even more
narrowly distributed within bacteria that diverged after Node
2 (if we exclude the polyvalent FAS-II machinery). Finally,
the genes associated with synthesis of the external leaﬂet are
present in a sublineage-speciﬁc manner within the slow-growing
mycobacteria that diverged after Node 3. This step-wise gradient
of gene acquisition would support the theory in which the
sequential gain-of-function has led to the successive evolution
of the outer-membrane components in the ancestors of modern
M. tuberculosis. The ﬁrst step in this pathway appears to
be the ability to attach and produce arabinogalactan that, in
turn, supports the addition of the mycomembrane. Within
this scenario, the ﬁnal layer that corresponds to the external
leaﬂet would have evolved most recently in a species-speciﬁc
manner.
In this article, M. tuberculosis (and other slow growing
mycobacteria) are used as our end point as they are the
best characterized. However, we expect that with further
characterization of the cell envelope of other Corynebacteriales
and identiﬁcation of the genes involved in their synthesis,

Mycobacterial Cell Envelope Evolution
we will obtain a similar general pattern. This will be particularly
interesting for the highly heterogeneous outer leaﬂet. In fact,
Corynebacteriales colonize multiple ecological niches from
extreme and diverse habitats including soil and the human
microbiome (Ramakrishnan et al., 2013; Goodfellow and Jones,
2015). This diversity implies a speciﬁc adaptation for individual
species. This phenomenon would involve a distinctive selection of
cell envelope constituents and, more speciﬁcally, for the external
leaﬂet of the outer-membrane that is in immediate contact with
the environment. For example, Figure 2 shows that several genes
involved in PDIM formation are present in the genomes of
members of the Corynebacteriales order that are assumed to be
PDIM-negative. This is especially true for M. gilvum, which is a
rapid-growing mycobacterium (Wee et al., 2017). It is important
to note that a number of genes involved in PDIM and PGL
synthesis are polyketide synthases, which are versatile enzymes
involved in the production of various natural products (Quadri,
2014). The question remains whether these genes serve in the
production of molecules localized in the outer leaﬂet of “DIM-
negative” bacteria that may have a common origin with PDIM as
we know it in the pathogenic slow-growing mycobacteria.
CONCLUSION
Regardless of whether the double membrane of Corynebacteriales
represents a relict sharing a common origin with the double
membrane present in typical Gram-negative species, or is
the result of a more recent adaptation, it will undoubtedly
be interesting and informative to attempt to experimentally
reconstruct the double membrane of mycobacteria starting from
an Actinobacteria species possessing a single membrane (such
as Turicella sp.). This daring experiment will teach us more
about the mechanism of biogenesis of this double membrane
and, perhaps, even inform on its molecular evolution and the
natural selection of such an adaptation. In doing so, we could
mimic the putative evolutionary process that has led to the
Mycobacterium membrane as well as identify the functional
diﬀerences linked to possible species-speciﬁc adaptation of the
mycomembrane. This work may also highlight important enzyme
functions that can be speciﬁcally targeted in vaccination or
chemotherapeutic approaches aimed at killing pathogenic species
such as M. tuberculosis.
