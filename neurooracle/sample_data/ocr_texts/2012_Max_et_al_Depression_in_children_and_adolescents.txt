Abstract
The objective was to assess the nature, rate, predictive factors, and neuroimaging correlates of
novel (new-onset) depressive disorders, both definite and subclinical, after traumatic brain injury
(TBI). Children with TBI from consecutive admissions were enrolled and studied with psychiatric
interviews soon after injury (baseline), and again 6 months post-injury. Novel definite/subclinical

depressive disorders at 6-month follow up occurred in 11% (n=15) of the children and subsets of
children with non-anxious depression (n=9) and anxious depression (n=6) were identified. Novel
definite/subclinical depressive disorder was significantly associated with older age at the time of
injury, family history of anxiety disorder, left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) lesions, and right frontal
white matter lesions. Non-anxious depressions were associated with older age at injury, left IFG
and left temporal pole lesions. Anxious depressions were associated with family history of anxiety
disorder, Personality Change due to TBI, right frontal white matter lesions, and left parietal
lesions. These findings, which are similar to those reported after adult TBI, identify both
similarities and differences in non-anxious and anxious depression following childhood TBI with
respect to lesion laterality, genetic factors (in the form of family psychiatric history of anxiety
disorder), age at injury, and more generalized affective dysregulation.

1. Introduction
Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem (Langlois et al.,
2005). Preinjury psychiatric disorders are very common in children who sustain TBI, with
occurrence ranging from 33-50% in prospectively studied samples (Brown et al., 1981; Max
et al., 1997b). Psychiatric disorders with their onset after TBI are common and varied
(Brown et al., 1981; Max et al., 1997a). Depression in children and adolescents in the non-
TBI general population is an important problem and increases with age, such that the
prevalence rate in children is up to 2.5% and for adolescents is up to 8.3% (Birmaher et al.,
1996). Part of the morbidity of pediatric TBI is new-onset depressive symptomatology,
although this topic has previously received minimal systematic study. A retrospective
psychiatric interview study of severe TBI found that ongoing postinjury-onset depressive
disorder occurred in 25% of children with severe TBI and that 1/3 of the children had a
depressive disorder at some point after the injury (Max et al., 1998b). A prospective study
found that TBI increased the risk of depressive symptoms, recorded from child self-report
and parent questionnaires, especially among more socially disadvantaged children, and that
depressive symptoms were not strongly related to post-injury neurocognitive scores
(Kirkwood et al., 2000). A prospective psychiatric interview study suggested a link between
preinjury depressive disorder, family history of major depression and preinjury anxiety
disorder in cases of postinjury depressive disorder (Max, 2011). There have been no
published studies systematically examining lesions in relation to new-onset depressive
symptomatology in pediatric TBI.
In adults with TBI, new-onset depression has been studied more extensively. Prevalence
rates of new-onset psychiatric disorders in adults post TBI range from 18-50% with the most
common being depressive and anxiety disorders, which have a high rate of comorbidity
(Holsinger et al., 2002; Jorge et al., 2004; Bryant et al., 2010). Personal history of mood and
anxiety disorders are associated with postinjury major depression (Jorge et al., 1993a; Jorge
et al., 2004). Studies in adult TBI suggest that new-onset depression may be associated with
left hemisphere lesions, especially lesions in the left lateral frontal cortex. The investigators
found depression post TBI associated with decreased left frontal gray matter volumes,
specifically in the left inferior, middle and superior frontal gyri (Jorge et al., 2004), and
lesions in the left dorsolateral frontal cortex and left basal ganglia (Jorge et al., 1993b).
Furthermore, the investigators found that anxious depressions (depressive disorder comorbid
with an anxiety disorder) were associated with right-sided lesions (Jorge et al., 1993b).

Our goal was to study the demographic, psychosocial, and lesion predictors as well as the
occurrence and phenomenology of new-onset depressive symptomatology in children after
TBI. Based on the above review we hypothesized that new-onset depression
symptomatology post TBI would be positively associated with 1) demographic, 2)
psychiatric, and 3) injury variables as follows: 1) older age of injury; 2) family history of
depressive disorder, family history of anxiety disorder, preinjury anxiety, other symptoms of
affective dysregulation i.e., Personality Change due to TBI; and 3) lesion location and lesion
laterality (for the combined group of non-anxious and anxious depression we predicted
lesions of left and right frontal lobe; for those with non-anxious depression we predicted
lesions of the left frontal lobe; and for those with anxious depression we predicted right
frontal lesion location).
2. Materials and Methods
Participants in this study were 177 children aged 5-14 years who had a TBI from 1998-2003.
The children were recruited from consecutive admissions to 5 medical centers (3 in Texas, 1
in San Diego, and 1 in Toronto). Children with mild to severe TBI were enrolled from all
centers except San Diego where only those with “complicated mild” TBI (i.e., with
neuroimaging abnormalities) to severe TBI patients were recruited. Exclusion criteria
included pre-existing schizophrenia or autistic disorder, mental retardation, and injury due to
child abuse or penetrating missile injury. In San Diego only, children with pre-existing
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder were excluded. Data regarding the number of
children who were approached, the proportion who were eligible for recruitment, and
participation rate among those eligible is missing, due in part to the fact that children were
not required to answer eligibility questions prior to deciding whether to participate in the
study. Consistent with the requirements of the Institutional Review Boards, all legal
guardians signed informed consent and all children signed an assent form to participate.
Demographic, pre-injury psychosocial variables and injury indices for participants are
shown in Table 1.
2.1 Psychiatric Diagnoses
DSM-IV-TR psychiatric diagnoses (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) were based on
data using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children,
Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) (Kaufman et al., 1997) and the
Neuropsychiatric Rating Schedule (NPRS) (Max et al., 1998a). The K-SADS-PL and NPRS
were administered at baseline (after resolution of post-traumatic amnesia documented by
administration of the Children’s Orientation and Amnesia Scale) (Ewing-Cobbs et al., 1990)
to record pre-injury diagnoses and repeated 6 months after injury to record new-onset
diagnoses. The K-SADS-PL is a semi-structured diagnostic integrated parent-child interview
designed to generate diagnoses in children and adolescents based on DSM-IV-TR criteria.
The questions address present and lifetime symptoms and timing of the onset of psychiatric
symptoms in relation to TBI. The NPRS is structured similarly to the K-SADS-PL and
assesses specifically for Personality Change due to TBI.
The category of definite/subclinical depressive disorder consisted of children who met full
criteria or had a subclinical depressive disorder including: major depressive disorder
(MDD), depressive disorder not otherwise specified, dysthymia, or adjustment disorder with
depressed mood. A designation of subclinical depressive disorder was made in situations
where there was no clear functional impairment even though participants met or were one
symptom short of meeting criteria for a specific depressive disorder. Children with anxiety
were diagnosed with at least one of the following definite and/or subclinical disorders:
general anxiety disorder (GAD), post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), adjustment disorder
with anxious mood, separation anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD),
Max et al.

simple phobia, social phobia, or panic disorder. Children with an adjustment disorder with
depressed or anxious mood were considered subclinical cases in our classification because
although the DSM-IV-TR does not include the respective adjustment disorders under the
depressive or anxiety disorder classification, depressive symptoms or anxious symptoms are
specifically noted. We chose to investigate subclinical depression and anxiety because of the
compelling empirical data supporting the validity of these constructs and their relationship
with corresponding full clinical disorders with naturalistic follow up (Klein et al., 2009;
Shankman et al., 2009).
Definite/subclinical depressive disorders and definite/subclinical anxiety disorders were
further classified as “preinjury” or “novel”. Consistent with the pediatric TBI literature, we
use the term “novel” rather than “new” to draw a distinction from studies that exclude
children with preinjury psychiatric disorders from analysis in studies focused on postinjury
psychiatric disorders (Max et al., 1997b). Novel definite/subclinical disorders refer to new-
onset disorders that occurred within the first 6 months after TBI. Children with preinjury
MDD were ineligible to develop novel definite/subclinical depressive disorders because they
already had the most severe form of depressive disorder. However, children with preinjury
definite/subclinical depressive disorders who developed a more severe form of depressive
disorder (e.g., preinjury history of adjustment disorder with depressed mood who then
developed a postinjury MDD) were classified as having a novel definite/subclinical
depressive disorder. An example of a novel definite/subclinical anxiety disorder would be a
participant with no preinjury definite/subclinical anxiety disorder or with preinjury
separation anxiety disorder who then developed a different anxiety disorder such as panic
disorder after the injury.
Children identified as having a novel definite/subclinical depressive disorder were further
categorized as either having anxious depression, i.e., comorbid novel definite/subclinical
depressive disorder and novel definite/subclinical anxiety disorder, or non-anxious
depression, i.e., no comorbid definite/subclinical anxiety disorder.
Interviews were conducted by Ph.D. and Master’s level clinicians who were trained by the
first author in a pre-study workshop and a mid-study workshop. A child psychiatrist (4 sites)
or a child psychologist (1 site) supervised the assessments at each center. The next level of
supervision involved the first author reviewing written summaries composed by the
interviewer and discussion of cases at monthly teleconferences between the interviewers and
the first author. All disagreements about diagnosis were resolved through consensus among
the interviewer and the first author. This expert quality of interview and supervision is
necessary to minimize the potential of spurious diagnoses of depression considering that
brain injury, in the absence of a depressive disorder, can generate symptoms that overlap
with depressive disorder such as irritability, anhedonia, sleep disturbance, psychomotor
changes, fatigue, and concentration difficulties.
2.2 Family Psychiatric History
The Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria (Andreasen et al., 1977) interview was
administered by trained research assistants. At least one parent of each child was
interviewed regarding psychiatric disorders for every first-degree relative of the child with
TBI. Criteria were modified to conform to DSM-IV-TR. Family history of mood disorder
(MDD, dysthymia, mania, or cyclothymia) and family history of anxiety disorder was coded
present/absent depending if a first-degree relative met diagnostic criteria.

2.3 Adaptive Function
The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (Sparrow et al., 1984) was used to assess adaptive
function. The instrument is a nondirective interview conducted with the child’s primary
caretaker surveying behaviors that the child habitually demonstrates in the environment
giving an overall adaptive behavior composite score.
2.4 Family Function
An assessment of global family functioning was made using the Family Assessment Device
general functioning scale (Miller et al., 1985). The scale is a self-report questionnaire of 12
items with a four-point scale. The questionnaire is completed by the primary caretaker of
each child. Every response is given a number from a range of 1-4. Lower scores represent
better functioning.
2.5 Socioeconomic Status
The Four Factor Index (Hollingshead, 1975) was used to assess socioeconomic status (SES).
Scores take into account both the maternal and paternal educational and occupational levels.
The scores range from 8-66 with higher scores indicating higher SES.
2.6 Neurological Assessments
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was conducted 3 months after the injury, a timeframe
sufficient for the major aspects of trauma-related pathology to be expressed (Bigler et al.,
1997). The protocol included fluid attenuated-inversion recovery sequences (3mm slices)
and T1 volumetric spoiled gradient recalled echo (1.5mm slices), acquired in coronal and
sagittal planes according to a research protocol applied uniformly across sites. Of the 177
enrolled children, 162 (92%) returned to complete their research MRI. A study
neuroradiologist at each center coded each lesion from the multiple slice hard copy films.
Pathology (e.g., shearing, encephalomalacia, hemorrhage) was coded from a list.
Anatomical location was coded from a list of brain structures including cortical gray matter
(frontal, temporal, parietal, occipital), subcortical gray matter (basal ganglia, thalamus), and
white matter (Max et al., 2005). Specific coding of frontal lobe gyri was made only when
gray matter lesions were present in those gyri. Since lesion coding was by judgment of
expert neuroradiologists, and volumetric analyses were not conducted, there was no attempt
to register images or to segment tissue types.
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) (Teasdale and Jennett, 1974), recorded from clinical notes,
was used to classify the severity of TBI based on the lowest post-resuscitation score. Score
ranges for mild, moderate, and severe TBI are respectively 13-15, 9-12, and 3-8.
2.7 Statistical analyses
The outcome variables of interest were novel definite/subclinical depression (all), novel
definite/subclinical non-anxious depression, and novel definite/subclinical anxious
depression. These will be referred to hereafter as depression (all), non-anxious depression,
and anxious depression, respectively. The association of 6-month post-injury depression
(all), non-anxious depression, and anxious depression with the hypothesized predictive
variables was tested by independent sample t-tests for continuous variables and Fisher’s
exact Test and chi-square statistics for categorical variables. The hypothesized associated
variable analyzed with an independent sample t-test was age at injury. The hypothesized
associated variables analyzed with Fisher’s exact Test were family history of anxiety
disorder, family history of mood disorder, Personality Change due to TBI, pre-injury
definite/subclinical anxiety disorder, and neuroimaging lesions.

3. Results
One hundred forty one of the original 177 children (80%) returned for the 6-month
psychiatric assessment. The children who did not return were not significantly different from
the children who did with respect to age, gender, race, SES, or GCS score. The children who
returned had significantly higher pre-injury adaptive function measured by the Vineland
Adaptive Behavior Composite than those who did not return (95.6 +/− 14.6 versus 89.5 +/−
18.0; t=−2.02; df=163; p<.05). Children with basal ganglia lesions were more likely to be in
the group not returning versus those returning (4/20 versus 6/131; Fisher’s exact = .028),
however lesion distribution was not significantly different in the other 21 areas coded.
Participants in the 6-month psychiatric assessment had MRI lesions visualized in 34/63
(54%) of mild TBI cases, 12/17 (71%) of moderate TBI cases, and 48/51 (94%) of severe
TBI cases.
3.1 Incidence
Analyses were done on three different groups of subjects; (1) depression (all), which
included all subjects with a novel definite/subclinical depressive disorder, (2) non-anxious
depression, which consisted of those diagnosed with a novel definite/subclinical depressive
disorder but without a comorbid novel definite/subclinical anxiety disorder, and (3) anxious
depression, which included those with both a novel definite/subclinical anxiety and a novel
definite/subclinical depressive disorder. Three of the children returning for the 6-month
follow up had preinjury major depressive disorder (the most severe form of depressive
disorder) and were therefore ineligible to develop a novel definite/subclinical depressive
disorder. Fifteen (11%) of the remaining 138 subjects had a novel definite/subclinical
depressive disorder at 6 months following TBI of which 9 (60%) had novel definite/
subclinical non-anxious depression and 6 (40%) had novel definite/subclinical anxious
depression. Of the non-anxious depressed subjects 5 were diagnosed with adjustment
disorder depressed mood, 3 were diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD), and one
with subclinical dysthymia. Of the subjects with anxious depression 4 were diagnosed with
MDD (one subclinical diagnosis), 1 with adjustment disorder depressed mood and 1 with
depressive disorder not otherwise specified. The anxiety diagnoses for this group were as
follows (1 subject had 3 diagnoses); 2 with separation anxiety, 2 with adjustment disorder
anxious mood, 3 with PTSD (two of which were subclinical), and 1 with simple phobia.
Analyses of each of the depression groups (all; non-anxious; anxious) showed no significant
differences from children without depression regarding demographic variables (gender, race,
SES) and preinjury psychosocial variables (family function, adaptive function) as outlined in
Table 2. There were no significant between-group differences in injury severity between
those with and without novel definite/subclinical depressive disorder. The numbers of mild
and moderate/severe TBI in the respective depression groups (all; non-anxious; anxious)
were 7 and 8, 6 and 3, and 1 and 5.
3.2 Predictors of Depression (Table 3)
Age at injury was significantly greater in children with depression (all) versus no depression
and also in non-anxious depression versus no depression. The mean (SD) age in years of
children with depression (all) was 11.9 (2.2) while those without depression 9.9 (2.8) (t=
−2.55; df=136; p=.012). For example, there was a 5-fold increase in the rate of depression
for children with age of injury ≥ 12 years (18.2%) compared with age of injury < 9 years
(3.5%). The mean (SD) age in years of children with non-anxious depression was 12.7 (1.8)
while those without depression was 9.9 (2.8) (t=−4.25; df=11.2; p=.001). Similarly, the rate
of non-anxious depression in children with age of injury ≥ 12 years was 14% compared with
0% with age of injury < 9 years.

Family history of anxiety disorder significantly predicted novel depression (all) (Fisher’s
exact =.008) and novel anxious depression (Fisher’s exact = .006), but not novel non-
anxious depression. Family history of a mood disorder including depressive disorders was
not a predictor for novel depression (all), non-anxious depression or anxious depression.
Comorbid Personality Change due to TBI at 6 months post injury was significantly
correlated with novel anxious depression only (Fisher’s exact = .020). Preinjury anxiety did
not predict any category of novel depression.
3.3 Lesion Correlates (Table 3)
Depression (all) was significantly correlated with lesions in the left and right hemispheres
specifically in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) (lesion present in 5/15 versus 8/114
children with versus without depression; Fisher’s exact = .008) and right frontal lobe white
matter (lesion present in 5/15 versus 12/114 children with versus without depression;
Fisher’s exact = .029). There was a non-significant trend association between depression
(all) and lesions in the left temporal pole.
Non-anxious depression was significantly correlated with only left hemisphere lesions,
specifically lesions of the left IFG (lesion present in 4/9 versus 8/114 children with versus
without depression; Fisher’s exact = .005) and the left temporal pole (lesion present in 2/9
versus 2/114 children with versus without depression; Fisher’s exact = .027).
Anxious depression was significantly correlated with right frontal white matter lesions
(lesion present in 3/6 versus 12/114 children with versus without depression; Fisher’s exact
= .025) and with left parietal lesions (lesion present in 3/6 versus 10/114 children with
versus without depression; Fisher’s exact = .014).
3.4 Logistic Regression examining significant demographic, psychiatric, and lesion
correlates
The demographic, psychiatric, and lesion correlates of depression which were significant in
the univariate analyses were entered into logistic regression analyses to determine the
relative independence and significance of these variables in accounting for depression. In the
first logistic regression, depression (all) was the dependent variable and age at injury, family
history of anxiety disorder, left inferior frontal gyrus lesions, and right frontal white matter
lesions were the independent variables. The regression was significant (−2 log likelihood χ2
= 21.16, df=4, p=.0003) and correctly predicted 90% of cases. The significance was
accounted for independently by left inferior frontal gyrus lesions (Wald χ2 = 6.27, df=1, p=.
012), family history of anxiety (Wald χ2 = 4.24, df=1, p=.039), age at injury (Wald χ2 =
4.21, df=1, p=.040), but not by right frontal white matter lesions.
In the second logistic regression, non-anxious depression was the dependent variable and
age at injury, left inferior frontal gyrus lesions, and left temporal pole lesions were the
independent variables. The regression was significant (-2 log likelihood χ2 = 17.58, df=3, p
= .0005) and correctly predicted 95% of cases. The significance was accounted for
independently by left inferior frontal gyrus lesions (Wald χ2 = 6.13, df=1, p=.013), by age at
injury (Wald χ2 = 4.54, df=1, p=.033), but not by left temporal pole lesions.
In the third logistic regression, anxious depression was the dependent variable and right
frontal white matter lesions, left parietal lesions, Personality Change due to TBI, and family
history of anxiety were the independent variables. The regression was significant (-2 log
likelihood χ2 = 18.02, df=4, p = .0012) and correctly predicted 97% of cases. The
significance was accounted for independently by left parietal lesions (Wald χ2 = 4.33, df=1,
p=.038), by family history of anxiety disorder (Wald χ2 = 4.96, df=1, p=.026), but not by
right frontal white matter lesions or Personality Change due to TBI.

4. Discussion
This is the first prospective psychiatric interview study of pediatric TBI that investigated the
occurrence and phenomenology of new-onset depression and its demographic, psychiatric,
and lesion correlates. Our most important finding is that the pathophysiological mechanisms
of TBI-associated depression may be robust and common across the lifespan. We found
non-anxious depression to be associated with left inferior frontal gyrus and left temporal
pole lesions and anxious depression to be associated with right frontal white matter lesions
and left parietal lesions. These laterality distinctions and lesion-behavior correlates are
similar to the findings of depression studies of adult TBI (Jorge et al., 1993b; Jorge et al.,
2004).
The second important finding relates to the relationship between depressive and anxiety
disorders. Forty-percent of children with novel definite/subclinical depressive disorder had a
comorbid novel definite/subclinical anxiety disorder. This comorbidity is typical in children
and adolescents who have not been injured (Moffitt et al., 2007), as well as in adults with
depression post-TBI (Jorge et al., 2004). Research has shown that there are both similarities
and distinctions in the neural correlates of these disorders (Beesdo et al., 2009). It is not
surprising therefore that lesion correlates of depression vary depending on the presence of
comorbid anxiety because emotional reactivity is both a neurobiologic risk factor for, and
hallmark of, non-anxious depression as well as anxious depression (Pine et al., 2001). We
extend this observation with the new finding that emotional reactivity appears to be broader
in the case of anxious depression evidenced not merely by the presence of comorbid
depression and anxiety, but by its significant association with Personality Change due to
TBI. Personality Change due to TBI is the classic example of affective dysregulation after
TBI and most commonly is characterized by clinically significant irritability and anger (Max
et al., 2005; Max et al., 2006). Postinjury anxiety, we have found, is related to lesions of the
superior frontal gyrus, younger age at injury, and to other manifestations of affective
dysregulation including depression and Personality Change due to TBI (Max et al., 2011).
An additional new finding was that family history of anxiety disorder was significantly
related to new-onset depression (combined non-anxious and anxious depression), as well as
to anxious depression although not to non-anxious depression. Family history of mood
disorder was not related to new-onset depression. These findings again demonstrate that
there are similarities in the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety and that genetic
factors likely influence the expression of depression after pediatric TBI.
Older age at injury was significantly related to new onset depression (all) and to non-
anxious depression, but not to anxious depression, consistent with the pattern of increasing
rates of depression from childhood to adolescence (Birmaher et al., 1996). We have
previously shown that younger age at injury is associated with new-onset anxiety in this
cohort (Max et al., 2011) and this likely neutralized the influence of age at injury on anxious
depression.
Assessment of the relative importance of demographic (age at injury), psychiatric (family
history of anxiety disorder, Personality Change due to TBI), and lesion correlates (left IFG,
left temporal pole, right frontal white matter lesions, left parietal lesions) were instructive. In
adults with TBI, abnormal magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings in left temporal and
cingulate areas are related to mood disorder (Capizzano et al., 2010). It is likely that
disturbance of critical limbic areas and their relationship to emotional control underlie
important neuropathological determinants in the development of post-TBI depression
(Maller et al., 2010), especially given the commonness of frontotemperolimbic damage in
pediatric TBI (Bigler et al., 2010). The association of anxious depression with left parietal

lobe lesions was unexpected, however anxious depression in adults has been associated with
absence of frontal lesions (Jorge et al., 1993b).
Our findings must be appreciated within its limitations. Despite the fact that this is the
largest prospective psychiatric interview of pediatric TBI, the total number of children with
depression was small and subgroups of non-anxious and anxious depression were yet
smaller. As with almost all prospective studies, attrition is an important limitation and was
20% of the sample, although, to be sure, we identified few differences between participants
and non-participants. Specifically, children with lower preinjury adaptive function and
children with basal ganglia lesions were less likely to follow up. We might have expected a
higher rate of depression if not for this pattern of attrition. Another limitation relates to how
neuropathology was identified, i.e., coding of lesions from hard copy films from different
scanners. It is possible that even more insightful markers of neuropathology as it relates to
novel onset depressive disorder following TBI would be observed with advanced
neuroimaging analysis methods. The San Diego sample was different in terms of exclusion
of mild TBI participants with no lesions and exclusion of children with pre-injury ADHD.
However, the findings are unlikely to be skewed because the San Diego contingent was
relatively small accounting for 19/141 (13%) of 6-month follow up participants. Another
limitation was the lack of an injured control group which could provide a comparison of
new-onset depression in brain-injured versus orthopaedic injured children. However, a
control group would not be relevant to the important lesion findings.
In conclusion, non-anxious depression after pediatric TBI appears to be linked to specific
left-sided (IFG and temporal pole) lesions and anxious depression is related to different
specific left-sided lesions (parietal lobe) and right-sided lesions (frontal white matter). This
lesion-behavior relationship is similar to that occurring after adult TBI and suggests a
common pathophysiology despite that fact that depression is less common after pediatric
versus adult TBI. Older age at injury independently accounts for depression, probably
because of the increased incidence of depression noted between childhood and adolescence/
adulthood in the general population. Finally, familial factors in the form of family
psychiatric history of anxiety disorder, independently accounts for post-TBI depression.
