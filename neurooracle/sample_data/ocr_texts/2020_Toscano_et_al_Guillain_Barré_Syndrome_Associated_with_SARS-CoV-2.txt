Guillain–Barré Syndrome Associated with SARS-CoV-2
To the Editor: From February 28 through 
March 21, 2020, in three hospitals in northern 
Italy, we examined five patients who had Guil-
lain–Barré syndrome after the onset of coronavi-
rus disease 2019 (Covid-19), the disease caused 
by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavi-
rus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). During that period, an esti-
mated 1000 to 1200 patients with Covid-19 were 
admitted to these hospitals. Four of the patients 
in this series had a positive nasopharyngeal 
swab for SARS-CoV-2 at the onset of the neuro-
logic syndrome, and one had a negative naso-
pharyngeal swab and negative bronchoalveolar 
lavage but subsequently had a positive serologic 
test for the virus. Detailed case reports are pro-
vided in the Supplementary Appendix, available 
with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.
The first symptoms of Guillain–Barré syn-
drome were lower-limb weakness and paresthe-
sia in four patients and facial diplegia followed 
by ataxia and paresthesia in one patient (Ta-
ble 1). Generalized, flaccid tetraparesis or tetra-
plegia evolved over a period of 36 hours to 4 
days in four patients; three received mechanical 
ventilation. The interval between the onset of 
symptoms of Covid-19 and the first symptoms of 
Guillain–Barré syndrome ranged from 5 to 10 
days (Table 1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). None of the patients had dysauto-
nomic features.
On analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), 
two patients had a normal protein level and all 
the patients had a white-cell count of less than 
5 per cubic millimeter. Antiganglioside antibod-
ies were absent in the three patients who were 
tested. In all the patients, a real-time poly-
merase-chain-reaction assay of the CSF was 
negative for SARS-CoV-2. Results of electro-
physiological studies are shown in Table S1. 
Compound muscle action potential amplitudes 
were low but could be obtained; two patients 
had prolonged motor distal latencies. On elec-
tromyography, fibrillation potentials were pres-
ent in three patients initially; in another patient, 
they were absent initially but were present at 12 
days. The findings were generally consistent 
with an axonal variant of Guillain–Barré syn-
drome in three patients and with a demyelinat-
ing process in two patients.1 Magnetic resonance 
imaging, performed with the administration of 
gadolinium, showed enhancement of the caudal 
nerve roots in two patients, enhancement of the 
facial nerve in one patient, and no signal chang-
es in nerves in two patients. Additional labora-
tory findings are shown in Table S2.
All the patients were treated with intravenous 
immune globulin (IVIG); two received a second 
course of IVIG and one started plasma ex-
change. At 4 weeks after treatment, two patients 
remained in the intensive care unit and were 
receiving mechanical ventilation, two were un-
dergoing physical therapy because of flaccid 
paraplegia and had minimal upper-limb move-
ment, and one had been discharged and was 
able to walk independently.
The interval of 5 to 10 days between the onset 
of viral illness and the first symptoms of Guil-
lain–Barré syndrome is similar to the interval 
seen with Guillain–Barré syndrome that occurs 
during or after other infections.2 Although many 
infectious agents have been associated with 
Guillain–Barré syndrome, there may be a pro-
pensity for preceding infection with Campylo-
bacter jejuni, Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, 
and Zika virus. There have been reports of an 
association between Guillain–Barré syndrome 
and coronavirus infections.3,4
On the basis of this observational series in-
volving five patients, it is not possible to deter-
mine whether severe deficits and axonal involve-
ment are typical features of Covid-19–associated 
Guillain–Barré syndrome. We could not deter-
mine the effect of reduced vital capacity due to 
neuromuscular failure from Guillain–Barré syn-
drome in these patients, but such an effect 
might be considered if findings on chest imag-

ing are not commensurate with the severity of 
respiratory insufficiency. Guillain–Barré syn-
drome with Covid-19 should be distinguished 
from critical illness neuropathy and myopathy, 
which tend to appear later in the course of criti-
cal illness than Guillain–Barré syndrome.
