Tuberculosis remains a major global health problem that kills up
to 2 million people annually. Central to the success of Myco-
bacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) as a pathogen is its ability to evade
host immunity and to establish a chronic infection. Although its
primary intracellular niche is within macrophages, the underly-
ing molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show
that Rv2224c, a cell envelope-associated predicted protease, is
critical for Mtb virulence. Disruption of Rv2224c led to prolonged
survival of infected mice and highly reduced lung pathology.
Absence of Rv2224c enhanced host innate immune responses,
compromised the intracellular survival of Mtb in macrophages,
and increased its susceptibility to lysozyme. We provide insights
into the molecular basis for Rv2224c function by showing that
Rv2224c activity promotes processing and extracellular release
of the Mtb protein, GroEL2. Inhibition of Rv2224c and its
targets offers opportunities for therapeutic interventions and
immune-modulatory strategies.

ycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a highly successful human
pathogen that elicits strong innate and adaptive immune
responses. Tuberculosis (TB) is characterized by an inflammatory
response that leads to containment, but not eradication, of bacteria
within granulomas in the lung (1). The Th1-type response elicited
by Mtb contributes to the extensive immunopathology, tissue ne-
crosis, and lung damage associated with TB (2). Macrophages are
central immune cells linking innate and adaptive immunity by
promoting lymphocyte activation and recruitment (1). They also
serve as the primary niche in vivo, because Mtb actively replicates
within macrophages. Mtb inhibits fusion of phagosomes with lyso-
somes and interferes with antigen presentation, IFN--mediated
signaling pathways, and transcriptional responses (3). Thus, the
ability of Mtb to subvert macrophage microbicidal functions likely
contributes to the hallmark delayed T cell response in TB, but the
bacterial factors that mediate these processes are poorly understood
(2, 3). In recent genome-wide studies, we comprehensively identi-
fied the bacterial genes necessary for Mtb survival in vivo and in
macrophages (4, 5). Our data predicted that one of these genes,
Rv2224c, was required for both in vivo growth in mice and intra-
cellular replication in macrophages (4). In this study, we show that
Rv2224c is indeed critical for Mtb virulence in vivo, promotes
survival in macrophages, and modulates innate immune control of
infection.
Results
Rv2224c Is Associated with the Mycobacterial Cell Envelope. Rv2224c
is predicted to encode a lipoprotein based on an N-terminal type II
signal peptide and a cysteine lipoprotein anchor residue (Fig. 1A)
(6). Rv2224c contains a GXSXG consensus sequence surrounding
a putative serine active site (S228), which is characteristic of /
hydrolase-fold family members, namely proteases, esterases, and
lipases. Rv2224c is annotated as a tripeptidyl peptidase in the
MEROPS peptidase database, and its sequence shows high se-
quence similarity to the serine proteases SlpD and SlpE from
Streptomyces lividans, which are mycelium-associated lipoproteins
involved in cell growth (7). Refolded recombinant Rv2224c also has
been reported to display esterase activity in vitro (8). However, the
physiological substrate(s) of Rv2224c remains to be established.
Lipoproteins of Mtb typically associate with its complex lipid-rich
cell envelope (6, 9). We therefore tested whether Rv2224c was
present in mycobacterial cell wall and cell membrane fractions. We
expressed myc epitope-tagged Rv2224c in Mycobacterium bovis
bacillus Calmette–Gue´rin; separated protein extracts into whole-
cell, cell wall, cytoplasmic, and cell membrane fractions; and found
that Rv2224c is clearly enriched in cell wall and membrane fractions
(Fig. 1B). However, Rv2224c was not detected in culture superna-
tants and is thus not likely to be secreted extracellularly (data not
shown). As controls for fractionation, we show that cytoplasmic
heat-shock protein, GroEL1, is largely absent from cell envelope
fractions and that Ag85, a known cell wall-associated and extracel-
lular protein, is present in cell wall fractions (Fig. 1B) (9).
Rv2224c Is Required for Optimal Mtb Growth in Vivo. Many bacterial
cell envelope- and cell surface-exposed proteins have access to host
cellular compartments and modulate host responses (10). Thus, we
sought to study the function of Rv2224c during infection in vivo. We
isolated a transposon mutant disrupted in Rv2224c (Rv2224c::tn)
and monitored its ability to compete for growth with wild-type Mtb
in mice. We used mixed infections in a competition setting, because
this allowed us to directly compare the fitness of the mutant strain
relative to wild type within the same in vivo environment. We
infected C57BL/6 mice with a 1:1 ratio of Rv2224c::tn mutant to
wild type and monitored cfus of each strain from lungs and spleens
as described in Materials and Methods (Fig. 2A). Decreases in
mutant cfus were apparent by 28 days and continued to 56 days after
infection, indicating that Rv2224c is required for optimal growth of
Mtb in vivo. Both wild-type and mutant strains grew equally well in
vitro in 7H9 medium over an 8-day growth period (data not shown).
We next asked whether the mutant’s growth defect could be
complemented by expressing intact Rv2224c (Rv2224c::tn 
2224c). Mice were infected with wild-type Mtb mixed with either
the Rv2224c::tn strain or Rv2224c::tn  2224c (Fig. 2B). Lungs
were harvested at 28 days after infection and plated for cfus.
Data are represented as ratios of cfus of mutant/wild type.
Full-length Rv2224c protein led to partial complementation of
the growth defect after infection (Fig. 2B, black bars). We also
constructed a mutant Rv2224c::tn strain expressing both
Rv2224c and Rv2223c, which is present within a putative operon
with Rv2224c and shares 49% identity. However, this strain grew

very slowly in vitro relative to wild type and thus could not be
used in complementation studies in vivo. We then tested whether
expressing Rv2224c harboring a mutated serine active site
(S228A) could complement the growth defect. Competing wild
type with Rv2224c::tn  S228A resulted in a dramatically more
severe defect in growth than competition with Rv2224c::tn alone
(Fig. 2B, hatched bars), suggesting that Rv2224c enzymatic
activity is required. Moreover, the active site mutation may
disrupt the catalytic triad of Ser228–Asp463–His490 shared by
many / hydrolases and generate a dominant-negative protein
that either inhibits the activity of Rv2223c or some other related
hydrolase, leading to a more severe phenotype.
Disruption of Rv2224c Prolongs Survival and Reduces Immunopathol-
ogy of Infected Mice. To study how disruption of Rv2224c impacts
disease progression and survival of the host, we performed single
infections with either wild-type or mutant strains. These experi-
ments assess the ability of each individual strain to grow in vivo and
its direct impact on the host. The Rv2224c::tn mutant showed higher
bacterial burdens in spleens and lungs when infected singly relative
to when mixed with wild type, suggesting that Rv2224::tn may be
more susceptible to the immune response evoked by wild-type Mtb
(Fig. 3 A and B). Despite modest reductions in bacterial burdens,
however, mice infected with the mutant survived significantly
longer than wild-type-infected mice (median survival time of 336
versus 195 days; P  0.0001) with reduced lung pathology (Fig. 3C).
Wild-type-infected lungs showed large granulomatous nodules and
widespread tissue damage, with 80–90% of the tissue containing
cellular infiltrates (Fig. 3D Middle) of mostly foamy macrophages
and lymphocytes within the granulomatous lesions (Fig. 3D Bot-
tom). In contrast, lungs of mutant-infected mice contained small,
discrete foci of macrophage- and lymphocyte-rich lesions and
retained 80% of alveolar space (Fig. 3D Middle). Overall, al-
though the differences in bacterial burden between wild-type and
mutant strains were relatively mild, the significant extension of
survival and the less detrimental immunopathology suggest differ-
ential handling of the two strains by the host. Thus, absence of
Rv2224c attenuates the virulence of Mtb in vivo.
Rv2224c Impacts Host Innate Immune Responses. To evaluate the
contribution of innate versus adaptive immunity to this outcome,
we infected RAG/ mice, which lack T and B cells, by aerosol and
i.v. routes (Fig. 4 A and B). Immunodeficient RAG/ mice were
highly susceptible to Mtb, with as little as 10 cfus, and rapidly
succumbed to infection, which is consistent with the critical role of
T and B cells in controlling TB (11). Interestingly, infection with
Rv2224c::tn by either route significantly prolonged survival of
RAG/ mice (Fig. 4 A and B). The lungs of RAG/ mice infected
with wild type were infiltrated with numerous macrophages and
neutrophils; by 35 days after aerosol infection, these lesions occu-
pied 90% of the alveolar space (Fig. 4C). Much smaller lesions of
similar composition were observed in Rv2224c::tn-infected lungs
and resulted in milder pathology (Fig. 4C). Notably, fewer bacteria
were present within macrophages in lung sections, with a 10-fold
decrease in viable bacteria 12 and 35 days after infection in infected
lungs (Fig. 4 D and E). These results suggest that lung macrophages
control the growth of Rv2224c::tn in the innate phase and limit
intracellular growth. Interestingly, at the time of death, the numbers
of bacteria recovered from the lungs of wild-type or mutant-
infected mice were indistinguishable, as was the pathology (Fig. 4
D and E). Thus, mutant strains are not inherently defective in their
ability to replicate but fail to do so in the face of early innate
immune responses. However, they actively grow once innate im-
munity no longer controls growth. Taken together, these data
provide evidence for enhanced early control of the Rv2224c::tn
mutant burden by innate immune mechanisms.

Rv2224c is predicted to be a lipoprotein with an N-terminal type II signal
peptide. The N region has lysine and/or arginine, and the H region has
hydrophobic residues. Cysteine at amino acid residue 31 within the conserved
‘‘lipobox’’ sequence is the putative lipoprotein attachment site, where dig-
lyceride units are added by thioester linkage, followed by cleavage at a site
immediately preceding the lipidated cysteine, which becomes the N terminus
of the mature lipoprotein (6). Rv2224c contains the / hydrolase fold se-
quence and a catalytic triad typically present in serine proteases, esterases,
and lipases, consisting of the catalytic nucleophile serine active site (S228),
which associates with the proton carrier histidine (H490), and a charge relaying
aspartic acid (D463). (B) Cell fractionation of M. bovis bacillus Calmette–Gue´rin-

Rv2224c Modulates Host Macrophage Responses. Because our data
pointed to a role for Rv2224c in promoting survival within macro-
phages, we directly assessed the growth of Rv2224c::tn in primary
macrophages. Intracellular growth of wild-type Mtb increased
10-fold after 7 days, but the Rv2224c::tn mutant failed to continue
growing (Fig. 5A). Both wild-type and mutant strains grew equally
well during the early stages (Fig. 5A) and in vitro in culture medium
(data not shown). Thus, Mtb requires Rv2224c for sustained intra-
cellular growth in macrophages. To assess whether the macrophage
environment is altered upon infection with the mutant, we mea-
sured the levels of cytokines and chemokines secreted by infected
macrophages. Two days after infection, when the bacterial burden
of wild-type and of mutant strains were indistinguishable (data not
shown), we found that key proinflammatory cytokines TNF, IL1,
and IL6 were decreased in the absence of Rv2224c, as were
chemokines IL8, MIP1, and RANTES, which contribute to neu-
trophil and lymphocyte recruitment (Fig. 5B). This finding suggests
that a dampened inflammatory milieu may be generated by
Rv2224c::tn-infected macrophages in vivo.
We next wished to explore the basis for the apparent increased
susceptibility of Rv2224c::tn to the macrophage environment. One
possibility is increased sensitivity to antimicrobial agents produced
by macrophages that limit mutant growth. The antimicrobial agent
lysozyme is secreted abundantly by macrophages, neutrophils, and
lung epithelial cells (12). Most Gram-positive bacteria are highly
susceptible to lysozyme, which damages their cell walls by hydro-
lyzing glycosidic bonds in peptidoglycan or by displacing cell wall
autolytic enzymes that normally mediate remodeling during cell
division (12, 13). Mtb has an impermeable cell envelope and is
extremely resistant to lysozyme. Wild-type Mtb was resistant to
lysozyme at up to 2 mg/ml and showed decreased viability at 4 and
6 mg/ml (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the Rv2224::tn mutant was markedly

more susceptible to lysozyme at all three concentrations (Fig. 5C).
This finding suggests that the mutant cell envelope is more acces-
sible to lysozyme in macrophages, leading to decreased bacterial
viability.
Rv2224c Regulates the Processing of Mtb Stress-Induced Secreted
Protein GroEL2. To further dissect the biological function of
Rv2224c, we sought to identify its physiological targets. Because
Rv2224c is cell envelope-associated with predicted hydrolytic ac-
tivity, we hypothesized a role in facilitating extracellular release of
other Mtb cell envelope proteins that would be released into
mycobacterial culture supernatant. We examined electrophoreti-
cally separated cell-free supernatants from wild-type or mutant
short-term cultures and observed distinct banding patterns in the
wild type that were missing in Rv2224c::tn samples (data not
shown). We excised several bands and used mass spectrometric
analysis to identify proteins that were absent from mutant super-
natants. We focused on cell wall-associated heat-shock protein
GroEL2 (Rv0440, hsp65), which was differentially present in su-
pernatants from the two strains, and confirmed by Western blot
analysis that the extracellular release of GroEL2 was aberrant in
Rv2224c::tn (Fig. 6A). Whole-cell lysates from both wild-type and
mutant bacteria expressed comparable amounts of GroEL2, but, in
wild-type supernatants, a smaller form predominated (Fig. 6A).
Mutant supernatants retained mostly full-length GroEL2 and ap-
peared incapable of efficiently generating the smaller protein. This
observation suggests that the smaller version is produced by cleav-
age of full-length GroEL2. The closely related GroEL1 is absent in
supernatants from either strain, which is consistent with its known
cytoplasmic localization and role in chaperone activities (14). In
contrast, GroEL2 is present in cell wall fractions (Fig. 6B) and
extracellularly in culture supernatants (Fig. 6A) (15, 16). GroEL2
is induced by heat, nutrient starvation, hypoxia, phagocytosis, and
reactive oxygen radicals and is shown to modulate macrophage
cytokine responses (14, 17–20).
We sought to further delineate the role of Rv2224c in GroEL2
cleavage by structure-function analysis of the Rv2224c protein. We
introduced wild-type and mutated versions of Rv2224c into
Rv2224c::tn and tested their effects on GroEL2 processing in the
corresponding supernatants (Fig. 6C). Expression of the intact
Rv2224c protein complemented the defect, as seen by increased
amounts of the processed form of GroEL2. Mutations in the
putative serine active site of Rv2224c (S228A) failed to complement
the defect, indicating that enzymatic activity is required for GroEL2
cleavage (Fig. 6C). Mutations in the cysteine anchor residue also
failed to complement the defect, supporting the notion that posi-
tioning of Rv2224c in the cell wall is critical for its function. Finally,
expression of the operon (Rv2224c-Rv2223c), which contains the
closely related Rv2223c, fully restored GroEL2 processing to wild-
type levels (Fig. 6C). Thus, the extracellular release of GroEL2
depends on Rv2224c function. Whether GroEL2 processing is a
direct consequence of Rv2224c enzymatic activity or is an indirect

consequence of regulation of intermediate proteins is unclear and

Discussion
Innate immune responses are critical for controlling infection and
launching adaptive immunity. By avoiding macrophage microbici-
dal functions and by replicating intracellularly, Mtb interferes with
the initiation of adaptive immunity (1). In this article, we demon-
strate that Rv2224c is critical for Mtb disease progression and
intracellular survival and modulates innate immune responses.
Interestingly, aerosol infection of RAG/ mice shows that, in the
absence of Rv2224c, early control of Mtb replication is in fact
possible (Fig. 4) and maps to growth limitation in macrophages
(Fig. 5A). Although Rv2224c::tn mutant bacteria eventually over-
whelm host innate responses, this early control leads to significant
extension of survival. Thus, inhibiting Mtb factors such as Rv2224c
could enhance innate immunity to TB. Macrophages infected with
Rv2224c::tn also show dampened inflammatory milieu, and
Rv2224c::tn was more susceptible to cell wall damage by lysozyme
(Fig. 5 B and C). These results suggest that inhibition of Rv2224c
could help drive the immune response away from its detrimental
aspects and could simultaneously debilitate Mtb, resulting in more
favorable outcomes for the host.
Competition experiments showed that Rv2224c is required
for optimal growth in vivo (Fig. 2). Complementation with
intact Rv2224c did not fully restore the growth defect (Fig.
2C), suggesting that disruption of Rv2224c may affect the
function of the related Rv2223c. We can detect expression of
Rv2223c mRNA in the Rv2224c::tn (data not shown), and
therefore transcription of Rv2223c does not appear to be
compromised. However, Rv2224c may be involved in posttran-
scriptional regulation of Rv2223c, and the two proteins may
function in concert for optimal activity toward their targets.
Unfortunately, complementation of the in vivo growth defect
by expressing both Rv2224c and Rv2223c was not feasible
because ectopic expression of the operon resulted in slow
growth of the strain in vitro. Speculation that Rv2223c may in
fact work in conjunction with Rv2224c is supported by the
observation that expressing both genes results in better
complementation of the GroEL2-processing defect (Fig. 6C).
In addition, mutating the serine active site of Rv2224c resulted
in a more severe growth defect in vivo, suggesting that
disrupting Rv2224c activity may compromise Rv2223c func-
tion directly or indirectly by generating a dominant-negative
protein that interferes with the function of Rv2223c or other
related hydrolases.
We have uncovered a role for Rv2224c in extracellular GroEL2
release from the cell wall of Mtb. GroEL2 is a highly expressed,
immunodominant protein and induced by many physiological
stresses related to intracellular growth, including phagocytosis,
hypoxia, nutrient limitation, and reactive oxygen radicals (14, 21,
22). Recent purification of GroEL2 for crystallization studies
revealed that it eluted as both a full-length and smaller N-terminally
processed form, suggesting that physiological proteolysis might
occur (23). Thus, the cleaved GroEL2 protein may constitute the
functionally active form, whose release depends on Rv2224c activ-
ity. Whether or not GroEL2 is a direct substrate for Rv2224c
remains unclear and awaits further biochemical characterization.
Although it is unlikely to be the only target of Rv2224c, GroEL2 has
been implicated in modulating proinflammatory cytokine re-
sponses in macrophages, which is consistent with our observations
of dampened inflammatory milieu (Fig. 5C) (14, 19, 20). A detailed
analysis of Rv2224c enzymatic activity toward GroEL2 and addi-
tional physiological substrates should help elucidate the precise
biochemical function of Rv2224c.
Our results implicating Rv2224c in the processing of GroEL2 and
the resistance to lysozyme suggest that other cell envelope com-
ponents may be substrates for RV2224c activity. This idea also was
advanced in studies from Flores et al. (24), who isolated a trans-
poson mutant with insertions in Mycobacterium smegmatis expA, the
homolog of Mtb Rv2224c, in a screen designed to study hypersus-
ceptibility to -lactam antibiotics, which act on bacterial cell wall
peptidoglycan. Interestingly, M. smegmatis expA mutants showed
increased susceptibility to lysozyme and displayed elongated cell
morphology with swollen termini. The authors speculated that
expA and expB (the Rv2223c homolog) might be directly involved
in hydrolytic breakdown of cell wall components or indirectly
involved by regulating proteins involved in autolysis or cell wall
remodeling (24). Rv2224c is classified as an / hydrolase in a
family with both esterase and amidase members (25). Its closest
biochemically characterized homolog, the secreted SlpD triamin-
opeptidase from S. lividans, was identified by its activity against an
amide (7). Protease activity is consistent with the requirement of
Rv2224c for correct processing of GroEL2. However, several
proteins related by homology to Rv2224c are carboxyesterases and
lipases. Indeed, a recent study showed that refolded recombinant
Rv2224c can hydrolyze ester compounds, which suggests that cell
envelope lipids may be substrates (8). The chemical similarity of
ester and amide hydrolysis is such that most proteases also catalyze
the degradation of ester substrates, although the converse is not
typically true (26). These possibilities will be clarified when phys-
iological substrates of Rv2224c are established. Many Mtb proteins
are exported to the cell envelope; some of these are secreted
extracellularly by specialized secretion systems and in turn promote
interactions with host cells (27, 28). Our studies suggest that
cleavage of cell envelope proteins constitutes an additional mech-
anism by which Mtb can release critical extracellular factors. En-
zymatic regulation of their release in vivo would facilitate rapid
adaptation to changing immune environments.
In summary, we have shown that Rv2224c is a key determinant
of disease outcome in vivo. Rv2224c modulates innate immune
responses in macrophages and is required for extracellular release
of the Mtb stress-induced protein, GroEL2. The cell surface acces-
sibility of Rv2224c and its importance in host–pathogen interactions
make it a target for therapeutics and immune-modulatory
strategies.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Media. Mtb H37Rv strains and M. bovis bacillus Calmette–
Gue´rin Pasteur were grown at 37°C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth or 7H10 agar as
described in ref. 4. For the Rv2224c::tn mutant, 25 g/ml kanamycin (Sigma–
Aldrich)wasadded,and,forcomplementedstrains,50g/mlhygromycin(Roche)
wasadded.TheMtbtransposonlibraryhasbeendescribedindetailinref.29.The
Rv2224::tnmutantwasobtainedbysequencingmutantsfromthelibrarybyusing
arbitrary primers as described in ref. 4. The mutant was maintained in the
presence of 25 g/ml kanamycin throughout.
Construction of Plasmids and Strains. Toconstructmyc-taggedRv2224cdrivenby
its own promoter, the gene was ampliﬁed by 5-CCTCGGGCGATGGTCTAGATG-
CACCATGC-3 and 5-CGTTTCTTCGCCACTAGTGCACTTGGCG-3 cloned into the
XbaIandSpeIsitesofpMV762(hyg)withC-terminalc-myctag.TheC31Smutation
was made with site-directed mutagenesis by using 5-GTTCTTGTGGGCTCCATC-
CGCGTGGTC-3 and S228A 5-CTACCTGGGCTACGCGTACGGCACC-3. The
Rv2223c-2224c operon was cloned into the XbaI and SpeI sites of pMV762 (hyg)
by using 5-CCTCGGGCGATGGTCTAGATGCACCATGC-3 and 5-AAGGGGAGT-
GCGCGACTAGTCCAGGGCG-3.
Preparation of Protein Extracts and Western Blotting. Each Mtb strain was
grown to an OD600 of 0.8, pelleted, washed, and grown in Sautons’ medium
(30) plus 0.05% Tween 80 to an OD600 of 0.6, resuspended into Sautons’
medium minus Tween 80, and grown for 24 h at 37°C. Supernatants were
concentrated by using Centricon Plus-70 (Millipore). Each cell pellet was
resuspended in 50 mM Tris, 10 mM NaCl (pH 8.0), and glass beads (Bio101)
with bead beating for 45 s, was centrifuged at 16,000  g for 15 min at 4°C,
and 150 l was removed for protein estimation. Remaining extracts were
boiled with SDS protein-loading buffer for 20 min. Samples were separated
by a 200-V SDS/PAGE by using NuPage 10% [bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]tris
(hydroxymethyl)methane or 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-

cals], and HRP conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit serum (1:10,000; Kirkegaard
& Perry Laboratories) as a secondary antibody.
Fractionation of M. bovis Bacillus Calmette–Gue´ rin. Fractionation was per-
formed essentially as described in ref. 31. Fractions were loaded onto gels nor-
malized for cell numbers proportionally.
Macrophage Survival Assays and Cytokine Assays. Macrophages were derived
from bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice as described in ref. 4. Macrophages were
platedonto24-wellplates(2105 perwell).Eachstrainwasusedforinfection(in
triplicate per time point) at an moi of 1 as described in ref. 4. Cell-free superna-
tants from macrophage monolayers 48 h after infection (moi of 5 in triplicate)
wereassayedbyusingaLuminexELISAkitandwereanalyzedbyusingtheBioplex
200 Luminex system (Bio-Rad). Error bars represent standard deviation from the
mean.
Lysozyme Susceptibility Assays. These assays were developed in consultation
with M. Pavelka. We incorporated hen egg lysozyme (MP Biomedicals) directly
into 7H10 plates and plated serial dilutions of Mtb strains onto plates containing
0, 2, 4, or 6 mg/ml lysozyme. Plates were incubated for 4–5 weeks at 37°C and
scored for cfus.
Infection of Mice with Mtb. All animal experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Harvard University. For aerosol
infections, RAG/ mice (C67BL/6) were infected by using an aerosol apparatus
manufactured by the College of Engineering Shops at the University of Wiscon-
sin, Madison. The mice were then exposed for 40 min, resulting in 10 cfus per
mouse lung (determined by plating lungs on day 1 after infection; four mice per
group). For i.v. infections, mice were infected by tail-vein injection, with 5  105
cfus of each strain for mixed infections and 2  106 cfus for single infections (four
micepertimepoint).Organswerehomogenized,andserialdilutionswereplated
for cfus onto 7H10, 7H10 kanamycin (for the mutant Rv2224c::tn), or 7H10
kanamycin plus hygromycin (for Rv2224c::tn complemented).
Statistical Analysis. GraphPad Prizm software, Version 4.0, was used for all
analyses.
Histology and Staining of Tissue Sections. Organs were ﬁxed in 10% buffered
formalin and embedded in parafﬁn, and 6-m sections were stained with H&E.
For detecting Mtb in tissue sections, slides were baked at 60°C and washed twice
in xylenes; decreasing concentrations of ethanol were used to dehydrate tissue,
and slide sections were incubated in auramine–rhodamine at 37°C for 15 min,
washed in 1% HCl/70% EtOH, and counterstained by using Harris’ modiﬁed
haematoxylin.Excessstainwasremovedbysequentialwashinginacidicandbasic
solutions, rehydrated by reversing sequence in ethanol, and cleared in xylenes.
Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope by using a SPOT digital
camera.
