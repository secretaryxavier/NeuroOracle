Abstract
The Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome encodes 11 serine/threonine protein kinases (STPKs). A 
similar number of two-component systems are also present, indicating that these two signal 
transduction mechanisms are both important in the adaptation of this bacterial pathogen to its 
environment. The M. tuberculosis phosphoproteome includes hundreds of Ser- and Thr-
phosphorylated proteins that participate in all aspects of M. tuberculosis biology, supporting a 
critical role for the STPKs in regulating M. tuberculosis physiology. Nine of the STPKs are 
receptor type kinases, with an extracytoplasmic sensor domain and an intracellular kinase domain, 
indicating that these kinases transduce external signals. Two other STPKs are cytoplasmic and 
have regulatory domains that sense changes within the cell. Structural analysis of some of the 
STPKs has led to advances in our understanding of the mechanisms by which these STPKs are 
activated and regulated. Functional analysis has provided insights into the effects of 
phosphorylation on the activity of several proteins, but for most phosphoproteins the role of 
phosphorylation in regulating function is unknown. Major future challenges include characterizing 
the functional effects of phosphorylation for this large number of phosphoproteins, identifying the 
cognate STPKs for these phosphoproteins, and determining the signals that the STPKs sense. 
Ultimately, combining these STPK-regulated processes into larger, integrated regulatory networks 
will provide deeper insight into M. tuberculosis adaptive mechanisms that contribute to 
tuberculosis pathogenesis. Finally, the STPKs offer attractive targets for inhibitor development 
that may lead to new therapies for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant tuberculosis.
Signal transduction is an essential activity of all living cells. Broadly defined, signal 
transduction is the sensing of a signal or input and its conversion into an output or response 
that alters cell physiology. The sensor is the molecule or domain of a molecule (typically a 
protein) that senses the signal. The transducer is the molecule or domain that converts the 
signal into a response. Most commonly, signal transduction refers to the sensing of an 
extracellular signal that is transduced across the cytoplasmic membrane and converted into 
an intracellular response. Thus, signal transduction is critical for cellular adaptation to 
changes in the extracellular environment. In the case of bacterial pathogens, including 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, these adaptive responses allow growth and/or survival in the 
environments encountered by the pathogen during the course of infection in the human host.

The most widely distributed and intensively studied transmembrane signaling systems in 
bacteria are the two-component systems (1). In these systems the sensor and transducer 
(referred to as the response regulator) are separate proteins, in which the sensor protein 
spans the cytoplasmic membrane and the response regulator is a cytoplasmic protein, usually 
a transcription factor that is activated in response to this phosphorylation event. Two-
component systems are discussed in depth in reference 138. So-called one-component 
systems are cytoplasmic proteins that contain both a sensor domain and an output domain 
(2). The sensor domain typically senses intracellular signals via binding of small molecules, 
leading to effects on transcription by the output domain.
Another group of transcription regulators, the extracytoplasmic function (ECF), or group IV, 
sigma factors, has been referred to as the “third pillar” of bacterial signal transduction (3). 
The ECF sigma factors were originally described as sensing and/or regulating ECFs (4). 
Members of the ECF subfamily are often negatively regulated by direct interaction with an 
anti-sigma factor protein that serves as the sensor. Anti-sigma factors may be 
transmembrane proteins, e.g., M. tuberculosis RslA (the anti-sigma factor of SigL), or 
cytoplasmic proteins, e.g., M. tuberculosis RshA (anti-sigma factor of SigH), and thus may 
transduce either extra-cytoplasmic or intracellular signals (5, 6). Sigma factors and their 
regulatory mechanisms are discussed in depth in reference 139.
The other major mechanism of transmembrane signaling in M. tuberculosis is via the serine/
threonine protein kinases (STPKs), the focus of this review. Unlike two-component systems, 
which are a major signaling mechanism in nearly all phyla of bacteria, STPKs are less 
widely distributed among different groups of bacteria. STPKs are most abundant among 
Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria (which includes mycobacteria), some cyanobacteria, and one 
order of the Deltaproteobacteria (the Myxococcales, the first bacteria in which STPKs were 
identified) (7, 8). In contrast to many of the widely studied bacterial pathogens and model 
organisms that have few or no STPKs but many two-component systems, the M. 
tuberculosis genome encodes 11 STPKs and a similar number of two-component systems, 
indicating that these two mechanisms both play important roles in signal transduction in this 
organism.
Of the 11 M. tuberculosis STPKs, all but 2 have a single transmembrane domain with an 
extracellular sensor domain and an intracellular kinase domain (KD) (Fig. 1). These nine 
transmembrane proteins can thus be classified as receptor-type kinases, in which the 
extracellular sensor domain senses extracytoplasmic signals and transduces this information 
to the intracellular KD, leading to activation of the kinase and phosphorylation of Ser or Thr 
residues on substrate proteins. This phosphorylation may alter protein function directly or by 
affecting interactions between specific pairs of proteins or within multiprotein complexes. In 
contrast to two-component, one-component, and ECF sigma factor signal transduction, 
where the usual primary output is changes in transcription, the output of Ser/Thr 
phosphorylation is rarely direct regulation of transcription.
As will be discussed below, for several of the M. tuberculosis STPKs, at least some of the 
signals sensed and some of the proteins targeted are known. There remains a great deal to be 
learned, however, about the exact mechanisms and functions of the STPKs in regulating M.

tuberculosis physiology. In this article we highlight some of the major findings and current 
state of knowledge regarding the role of Ser/Thr and Tyr phosphorylation-mediated signal 
transduction in M. tuberculosis. The rapid expansion of the literature in this field, however, 
makes it impossible to note every observation regarding protein phosphorylation and its 
functional effects in mycobacteria.
SEQUENCE CHARACTERISTICS AND COMPARATIVE GENOMICS OF 
MYCOBACTERIAL STPKs
The M. tuberculosis STPKs were first described as “eukaryotic-like” protein kinases based 
on their sequence similarity to eukaryotic STPKs (9). The protein sequence similarity among 
the KDs of eukaryotic kinases led Hanks and Hunter in 1995 to identify a “superfamily” of 
protein kinases containing 11 subdomains (10). These subdomains contain conserved 
residues and motifs present in members of the superfamily, with specific functions 
attributable to each subdomain. With the massive expansion in the number of eukaryotic 
protein kinase sequences in the genomic era, this subdomain organization has remained 
valid, and sequence alignments have indicated the presence of many subfamilies of 
functionally and/or structurally related kinases. Subdomains 1 through 4 and part of 5 
comprise the N-terminal lobe of the KD (see below), responsible for ATP binding and 
alignment, while subdomains 5 through 11 are responsible for substrate binding and 
phosphate transfer. Comparison of the M. tuberculosis STPKs to eukaryotic protein kinases 
demonstrates that the M. tuberculosis proteins incorporate each of the 11 Hanks 
subdomains, despite relatively limited sequence identity (Fig. 2).
Sequence alignment of the M. tuberculosis STPK KDs shows that the 11 STPKs can be 
grouped into three clusters of three kinases and two KDs that are less similar to any of the 
nine clustered domains (Fig. 3). The unclustered outliers, PknG and PknK, are also the two 
kinases that lack a transmembrane domain. This observation suggests that the genes 
encoding the nine receptor-type kinases may be derived from a single common ancestral 
gene via gene duplication, whereas PknG and PknK may have been acquired separately. In 
contrast to the intracellular KDs, the extracellular domains of the nine transmembrane 
STPKs show no sequence similarity, indicating that they likely bind to and respond to 
distinct extracytoplasmic molecular signals. As discussed below for each kinase, motifs are 
present within the protein sequence of some of the extracellular domains and in the non-KD 
regions for PknG and PknK. For a few of the extracellular domains, candidate ligands have 
been identified.
As noted above, STPKs are not evenly distributed among different bacterial phyla. Within 
the mycobacteria and closely related actinomycetes, their distribution is also uneven. Table 
1, which compares the genomes of the pathogens M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium 
leprae, the opportunistic pathogens Mycobacterium avium and M. avium subspecies 
paratuberculosis, the nonpathogen Mycobacterium smegmatis, and the more distantly related 
nonpathogenic actinomycete Corynebacterium glutamicum, shows these differences in the 
distribution of the STPKs. The presence of PknA, PknB, PknG, and PknL in all species 
suggests that these kinases play important roles in regulating key aspects of mycobacterial 
physiology, though only PknA and PknB are essential in M. tuberculosis (11). The other

STPKs likely have more specialized regulatory roles corresponding to the niches occupied 
by these different species.
STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF STPK KINASE DOMAINS
Structures of three KDs from M. tuberculosis STPKs (PknB, PknE, and PknG) have been 
solved (Table 2). These structures have provided important insights into mechanisms by 
which the M. tuberculosis STPKs are activated and regulated. The PknB KD was the first 
bacterial kinase structure described and was published by two groups independently in 2003 
(12, 13). Though they were cocrystallized with different ATP analogs, the two PknB KD 
structures are virtually identical. As in other members of the eukaryotic protein kinase 
super-family, the PknB KD (as shown in the 1MRU crystal structure) has amino (N)- and 
carboxy (C)-terminal lobes with a nucleotide/Mg2+ binding site in the cleft between them 
(Fig. 4A) (13). The N-terminal lobe is mostly composed of β-sheets with a single long α-
helix, designated helix C. In contrast, the C-terminal lobe contains only α-helices. Even with 
very low sequence conservation, this structure closely matches the overall structure of 
eukaryotic KDs. For example, human Clk1 KD has less than 20% sequence identity with 
PknB KD but has extensive overlap in structure (Fig. 4B). The KDs from PknE and the 
more divergent PknG also share this highly conserved kinase fold (Fig. 4C).
The PknB KD structures have all of the common elements found in eukaryotic protein 
kinases, as was predicted from the PknB amino acid sequence (Fig. 2 and 4). Both PknB KD 
structures (1MRU and 1O6Y) appear to represent the active or “closed” conformation of the 
kinase (12, 13). In most protein kinases, the conserved C helix is farther from the nucleotide 
binding cleft in the “open” position, while it is shifted toward this site in the “closed” 
position. The close proximity of the C loop to the nucleotide binding cleft of PknB in the 
closed position is shown in Fig. 5. The apo-PknE KD, was crystallized in the open or 
inactive form (Fig. 5A) (14). Positioning of the C helix away from the active site in the open 
conformation causes unfavorable placement of the conserved Glu64 (Glu59 in PknB) (Fig. 
5A) (14). In contrast, in the PknB KD active conformation Glu59 is close enough to the 
invariant Lys-40 of the nucleotide binding domain to allow proper positioning toward the α 
and β phosphates of ATP (Fig. 5B).
Additional conserved features in the PknB structure are the Gly-rich P-loop present in the N-
terminal lobe, which interacts with ATP (and ATP analogs) and the highly conserved Asp-
Phe-Gly (DFG) residues at the amino-terminal boundary of the activation loop. In particular, 
Asp156 of the DFG triplet in PknB contributes to positioning of Mg2+ (Fig. 5B). In addition, 
two important residues in the catalytic loop, Asp138 (catalytic base) and Asn143, are 
properly paired in this active conformation structure for attack on the substrate (Thr or Ser) 
hydroxyl group and transfer of γ phosphate from ATP (Fig. 5B). The hydrophobic pocket 
that binds adenine is also structurally similar to those observed in eukaryotic kinases (12, 
13).
In addition to these conserved features, the PknB structure has interesting distinct 
characteristics. The activation loop sequence between the conserved DFG and APE (SPE in 
PknB) motifs (Fig. 2) is, surprisingly, disordered in both PknB structures (1MRU and 
1O6Y), although it is usually visible in structures of protein kinases in the active form. The

activation loop is also missing in the crystal structure of the inactive conformation of apo-
PknE KD, indicating that it is also disordered, as is typical in open KD structures (14). There 
are no reported crystal structures of any M. tuberculosis STPKs in complex with a substrate, 
but a working model for substrate binding by PknB involves a large portion of the activation 
loop that likely provides kinase speci-ficity (15). This loop was shown to be phosphorylated 
on at least four residues in PknB, two of which are important for kinase activation (T171 and 
T173), while two others may make minor contributions (Ser166 and Ser169) (13, 16). 
Activation loops of many eukaryotic kinases are phosphorylated in vivo, and most M. 
tuberculosis kinases have been shown to be autophosphorylated or trans-phosphorylated on 
activation loop residues in vitro (15, 17–20).
Although phosphorylation of the activation loop is required for PknB to be fully activated, 
“back-to-back” interaction of the unphosphorylated kinase is thought to be the first step in 
activation (21–24) (Fig. 6A). Although inferred previously from the PknB KD structural 
data (1MRU and 2FUM), this mechanism of M. tuberculosis kinase activation was first 
demonstrated in PknD KD fusion constructs that could be brought into proximity by 
rapamycin binding tags (23). Although PknD KD structures were not obtained, this study 
clearly showed that bringing KDs together stimulated auto- and transphosphorylation and 
that this activation depended on residues in a predicted dimer interface homologous to the 
interface observed in PknB KD crystal structures (13, 23, 25). Subsequent studies of PknB 
KD back-to-back dimerization provided additional insights into this activation mechanism 
(21, 22). Conserved residues at the interface of the back of the two N-terminal lobes 
adjacent to the C terminus of the C helix, such as the conserved Leu33 and the Arg10/Asp76 
salt bridge, were demonstrated to be essential for this allosteric activation. When those 
contact sites were mutated, monomeric structures were obtained in multiple conformational 
states showing greater flexibility in the N-terminal lobe and misplacement of the C helix and 
its essential Glu59, resulting in lower enzymatic activity (Fig. 6B,C) (21, 22). Though not 
typical of many eukaryotic kinases, examples of back-to-back dimerization-induced 
activation are well described, e.g., for the human kinase PKR (26). The PknE KD was also 
shown to form a dimer with a similar, although not identical, interface (14).
It is important to note that the dimers observed in the PknB crystal structures do not appear 
to be formed with high affinity in solution (22). Also, the PknB and PknE extracellular 
domains do not dimerize on their own, so ligand binding is likely required, directly or 
indirectly, to facilitate dimerization of the KDs (22, 27, 28).
To examine subsequent steps of PknB activation, structural analysis was performed on a 
form of the PknB KD with substitutions at two Met residues that allow the KD to 
accommodate the inhibitor Kt5720, plus a single mutation that prevents back-to-back 
dimerization. This structure revealed an asymmetric “front-to-front” dimer (3f69) (Fig. 7A) 
(21). The interface between the two PknB KD monomers in this structure was mostly 
comprised of conserved G helix contacts. The activation loop of one KD monomer was 
ordered and in contact with the second monomer, while this second monomer had only a 
partially ordered activation loop with a small portion entering the active site of the first 
monomer, demonstrating a mechanism for activation by transphosphorylation (Fig. 7A). 
Mutational analysis of G helix residues that provide the contact surface in the front-to-front

dimer showed their requirement for activation loop phosphorylation and demonstrated that 
they act synergistically with back-to-back contacts to allow full activation (21). Importantly, 
once activated by the allosteric conformational change to allow autophosphorylation, the 
primed KD with a fully phosphorylated activation loop can then remain active as a 
monomer, allowing continuing phosphorylation of substrate proteins even after the initial 
signal causing dimerization is gone (21–23).
In addition to the KD, the intracellular portion of PknB includes a short juxtamembrane 
linker that connects the KD to the membrane-spanning segment (Fig. 1). Crystallization of 
the complete intracellular region of PknB including this region has been unsuccessful, 
indicating that the linker is disordered. The linker has been found to be phosphorylated in 
several M. tuberculosis STPKs, however, suggesting that it may have a regulatory role (12, 
13, 15, 16, 18, 20).
The cytoplasmic protein kinase PknG is the only M. tuberculosis kinase that has been 
successfully crystallized as a nearly full-length protein (69 residues were removed from the 
N-terminus to allow crystallization) (Fig. 7B) (29). This construct includes both kinase and 
sensor domains: amino-terminal to the PknG KD is an iron binding rubredoxin domain, and 
carboxy-terminal to the KD is a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)–containing domain. TPRs are 
short repeats that are usually present in multiple copies and are involved in protein-protein 
interactions (Fig. 7B). The PknG dimer is formed through extensive contacts between the 
TPR domains of each monomer and not through N-lobe interactions, as was seen in the 
PknB KD and PknE KD dimer structures. Another difference compared to these other two 
kinases is that the PknG activation loop is ordered and stabilized, although not 
phosphorylated, suggesting a distinct mechanism of activation. Further, PknG is the only M. 
tuberculosis STPK that lacks Arg in front of the invariant Asp in the catalytic loop, and it 
was suggested that this difference results in the unique conformation of the activation loop 
in the absence of phosphorylation (Fig. 2) (29). PknG was found to be phosphorylated at the 
N-terminus in front of the rubredoxin domain, both in vivo and in vitro (15, 19). Although 
this modification is not required for PknG kinase activity, it was suggested that it might aid 
in substrate recognition (19). The rubredoxin domain, which contains two conserved Cys-X-
X-Cys-Gly iron binding motifs, was shown to interact with both N- and C-terminal lobes of 
the PknG KD. Importantly, mutational analysis of the Cys residues showed that they are 
required for PknG kinase activity, suggesting that rubredoxin might sense the redox status of 
the environment to regulate PknG function (29–31).
These structural data for PknB, PknE, and PknG have provided key insights into 
mechanisms of STPK activation and regulation. Structures of the extracellular regions of 
PknB, PknD, and PknH have also been determined and are discussed below in the sections 
for each of these individual kinases. Going forward, structures of these domains bound to 
ligands and structures of KDs interacting with substrates may provide further insights into 
kinase regulation and substrate specificity.

THE M. TUBERCULOSIS PHOSPHOPROTEOME
In eukaryotes, STPKs and Tyr protein kinases are highly abundant. The human genome 
encodes over 500 of these protein kinases, and it is currently estimated that over two-thirds 
of human proteins are modified by this posttranslational modification, often at multiple sites 
(32–34). In contrast, M. tuberculosis encodes 11 STPKs and no typical Tyr kinases, though 
a protein with Tyr kinase activity has been identified (35). The number of proteins that are 
phosphorylated within the mycobacterial cell is unknown. In 2010, Prisic et al. published a 
large-scale analysis of the M. tuberculosis phosphoproteome, identifying over 500 
phosphorylation sites in over 300 M. tuberculosis proteins using state-ofthe-art tandem 
mass-spectrometry methods (15). These data represent the minimal M. tuberculosis 
phosphoproteome, and many examples have been published of in vivo phosphorylation of 
additional M. tuberculosis proteins that were not identified in this phosphoproteomic study 
(Table 3), suggesting that the total M. tuberculosis phosphoproteome, when examined under 
multiple environmental conditions, is likely to include at least several hundred proteins.
Several interesting findings emerged from this work. First, in contrast to human Ser/Thr 
phosphorylation, where phosphorylation on Ser and Thr account for 90% and 10% of the 
identified phosphorylation sites on human proteins, respectively, in M. tuberculosis Thr 
phosphorylation is predominant, with a 60:40 ratio of phosphorylation on Thr versus Ser. 
Second, phosphor-ylation was identified on proteins involved in all aspects of M. 
tuberculosis physiology (Fig. 8). Third, based on in vitro phosphorylation of peptides 
corresponding to in vivo phosphorylation sites, a conserved Thr-centered phosphorylation 
motif was identified in which acidic residues are prominent amino-terminal to the 
phosphoacceptor, particularly at the −2 and −3 positions, and hydrophobic residues are 
dominant at the +3 and to a lesser extent at the +5 positions. The core components of this 
motif are shared by six of the M. tuberculosis STPKs (PknA, PknB, PknD, PknE, PknF, and 
PknH), with less prominent differences among the motifs of each STPK that may provide 
additional substrate specificity.
While these data have provided an important resource for further investigation, for most of 
these phosphoproteins the kinase(s) responsible for their phosphorylation and the effects of 
this posttranslational modification on protein function are not known. Identifying cognate 
kinase-substrate pairs and determining the functional effects of protein phosphorylation of 
individual protein substrates are essential for understanding the regulatory role of specific 
M. tuberculosis kinases. For M. tuberculosis STPKs, as for eukaryotic kinases, where well-
characterized kinase-substrate pairs have been characterized and functional effects of 
phosphorylation have been elucidated for only a tiny fraction of phosphoproteins, these 
goals are experimentally challenging. In the following sections, we will summarize the 
current state of knowledge for each of the M. tuberculosis STPKs, including candidate 
substrates and physiologic pathways potentially regulated by each kinase.
PknA AND PknB
These two STPKs are encoded by adjacent genes in an operon that includes genes for the 
cell wall synthesis enzyme PBPA and the cell-shape-determining protein RodA, as well as

the protein phosphatase PspA. Both pknA and pknB are essential for growth based on 
transposon mutagenesis experiments (11). Based on their linkage to rodA and pbpA, PknA 
and PknB were predicted to regulate cell shape and cell wall synthesis. An early study by 
Kang et al. confirmed this prediction, showing that overexpression of these kinases had 
marked effects on cell shape, including branching, elongation, and incomplete septation 
(17). Further support for the role of these kinases in cell wall synthesis and cell morphology 
were provided by the characterization of proteins involved in cell wall synthesis and its 
regulation that are likely substrates of one or both of these STPKs. Examples of these 
phosphoproteins include PBPA, a bifunctional penicillin binding protein that is a possible 
substrate of PknB; the DivIVA homologue Wag31, a substrate of PknA that has been shown 
to be required for peptidoglycan (PGN) synthesis in mycobacteria at the growing cell pole; 
and MviN, an essential protein required for late stages of PGN synthesis that is a likely 
substrate of PknB (17, 36, 37). In addition to these examples, several other proteins involved 
in PGN synthesis have been identified as phosphoproteins, in some cases with functional 
effects of phosphorylation shown (Table 3) (15). Further supporting a role for PknB in 
regulating cell division and cell wall synthesis, Mir et al. demonstrated that PknB is 
localized to the cell poles and the mid-cell, the sites of PGN turnover and assembly of the 
divisome (27). Consistent with PknB regulating cell wall synthesis during M. tuberculosis 
growth and with data showing 10-fold decreased expression of the pknA/pknB operon in 
stationary phase compared to log phase, a model was recently proposed in which PknB 
activity is decreased in hypoxia-induced stasis and PknB activity is required for oxygen-
induced re-growth (17, 38).
The sequence of the extracellular region of PknB also suggested a role for this kinase in 
regulating PGN turnover. This region comprises four penicillin binding protein and serine/
threonine kinase associated (PASTA) domains. These domains were first identified 
bioinformatically and predicted to bind PGN fragments (39). The incorporation of PASTA 
domains in some PBPs and in PknB-like STPKs led to the prediction that PknB and its 
homologues, which are widely distributed in Gram-positive bacteria, would regulate PGN 
synthesis. Evidence that the PASTA domains bind PGN fragments was first obtained in 
Bacillus subtilis, where spore germination was potently stimulated by muropeptides, PGN 
fragments derived from cell wall hydrolysis that contain a three- to five-residue stem peptide 
linked to the N-acetylglucosamine-N-acetymuramic acid disaccharide (40).
In M. tuberculosis, in vitro binding assays to the extracellular domain of PknB, using a 
comprehensive library of synthetic muropeptides, demonstrated that specific residues at the 
second and third positions of the stem peptide were required for binding (27). These 
residues, D-isoglutamine (versus D-isoglutamate) at position 2 and diaminopimelic acid 
(versus lysine) at position 3 are predominant in M. tuberculosis PGN, indicating that the 
PknB extracellular domain is adapted to recognize autologous muropeptides. A muropeptide 
that bound the M. tuberculosis PASTA domain in vitro was able to resuscitate dormant M. 
tuberculosis cells, albeit with less potency than spent medium, suggesting a link between 
PASTA binding, PknB activation, and cell growth.
Structural analysis of the PknB extracellular domain using nuclear magnetic resonance 
showed it to be an elongated structure, with rigid links between each of the four PASTA

domains (28). This structure suggests that the PASTA domains protrude from the external 
surface of the cytoplasmic membrane into the PGN layer, where they may encounter 
muropeptides produced by cell wall hydrolases. This finding led the authors to propose a 
model of how ligand binding might activate PknB, in which muropeptide binding serves to 
cross-link the extracellular domains of two PknB proteins, leading directly to PknB 
dimerization and activation. In an alternative model, binding of muropeptides to 
extracellular domains of individual PknB molecules localizes PknB to sites of cell wall 
turnover, i.e., the septum and cell poles, resulting in high local PknB concentrations 
allowing dimerization of the intracellular KDs and their activation (27). Data from B. 
subtilis PrkC show that the PASTA-containing extracellular region does not dimerize in 
vitro, whether or not muropeptides are present (41). This result, together with the 
demonstrated ability of the KDs alone to dimerize and activate, favors the latter model (21), 
though it is possible that additional proteins might play a role in dimerization of the extra-
cellular domain in a manner that would support the model of extracellular domain 
dimerization.
Though phosphorylation by PknA and PknB of several proteins involved in cell shape and 
cell wall synthesis has been shown or suggested (Table 3), here we will highlight two that 
play key roles in PGN synthesis and localization: Wag31 and MviN. Wag31, the M. 
tuberculosis homologue of the cell division protein DivIVA, was shown to be 
phosphorylated in M. tuberculosis cells and, through a combination of in vivo and in vitro 
experiments, to be phosphorylated by PknA (17). Subsequent analysis showed that Wag31 
localizes to the cell poles, with preference for the old cell pole, the site of new PGN 
synthesis in mycobacteria and other actinomycetes (42, 43). Depletion of Wag31 led to 
delocalized PGN synthesis, asymmetric bulging, and ultimately lysis of the cells, indicating 
a critical role for this protein in proper localization of PGN synthesis. Through the use of 
phosphomimetic (T73E) or phosphoablative (T73A) substitutions in Wag31, 
phosphorylation of Wag31 appears to positively affect growth rate, though no clear 
morphologic differences were observed with expression of the different alleles (42).
MviN, a widely conserved multipass membrane protein, has been shown in Escherichia coli 
to be the protein that flips the lipid-linked PGN precursor lipid II from the cytoplasm to the 
periplasmic space, where the muropeptide can be incorporated into PGN (44). The M. 
tuberculosis MviN homologue, Rv3910, has an essential amino-terminal domain similar to 
MviN proteins in other bacteria but also has a nonessential carboxy-terminal region with 
sequence similarities to protein kinases (37). In the M. tuberculosis phosphoproteome study, 
this protein was found to be phosphorylated on as many as five distinct residues, including 
one well-localized site at Thr947 in the kinase homology domain (15). Gee et al. 
demonstrated that although this domain folds and dimerizes in a manner similar to protein 
kinases such as PknB, it lacks critical residues and motifs required for enzyme activity and 
is a pseudokinase that lacks both ATP binding and catalytic activities (37). The Thr947 
residue was found to be phosphorylated in vitro by PknB and to a lesser extent by PknA, 
PknD, PknE, and PknH. Phosphorylated MviN was found to bind FhaA tightly; though the 
direct effect of this binding on MviN function was not shown, analysis of MviN and FhaA 
depletion strains suggested a model in which PknB phosphorylation of the kinase homology

domain of MviN recruits FhaA, leading to inhibition of the terminal steps of PGN synthesis. 
This negative regulation of PGN synthesis by phosphorylation of MviN, in contrast to 
positive regulation of cell growth by PknA-mediated phosphorylation of Wag31, suggests a 
complex regulatory role of phosphorylation, likely by multiple kinases, in controlling M. 
tuberculosis growth and PGN synthesis.
In addition to cell wall synthesis, PknA and PknB have been linked, directly or indirectly, to 
regulation of several additional cellular processes, including lipid synthesis, cell division, 
and transcription regulation, among others (Table 3). The regulation of multiple processes 
by these kinases suggests that they may function to broadly coordinate cell physiology with 
cell growth. Linking a specific kinase to a validated in vivo phosphorylation event is 
challenging, however, and in many cases more than one STPK may target the same protein 
substrate. For many of the phosphoproteins involved in the processes noted above, whether 
PknA and/or PknB is the primary cognate kinase is uncertain. In other cases, rather than 
starting from well-defined in vivo phosphorylation in mycobacteria, investigators have 
started with a protein (enzyme) of interest, demonstrated in vitro phosphorylation by one or 
more M. tuberculosis STPKs in vitro or in E. coli, and then characterized effects of 
phosphorylation on enzyme function in vitro. In some cases the role of phosphorylation of 
the protein of interest in vivo remains unknown, while in other cases, additional work was 
undertaken to demonstrate in vivo phosphorylation and effects of phosphorylation on 
bacterial phenotypes.
An interesting example of a phosphoprotein first characterized in vitro and then shown to be 
phosphorylated in vivo with important functional effects of phosphorylation on lipid 
synthesis is the enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase InhA, an essential component of the 
FASII fatty acid synthesis pathway in mycobacteria and the primary target of the first-line 
antitubercular, isoniazid (45, 46). Two groups independently examined in vitro 
phosphorylation of InhA and then pursued functional effects of phosphorylation in vitro and 
in vivo (47, 48). InhA was found to be phosphorylated by multiple kinases, including PknA 
and PknB. Elucidation of the sites of phosphorylation by mutagenesis and mass 
spectrometry yielded similar results, with one group observing phosphorylation at the 
carboxy-terminus of the protein at Thr253, Thr254, and Thr266, while the other group 
identified Thr266 as a unique phosphorylation site. The Thr254 and Thr266 sites have 
features of the preferred phosphorylation site motifs of PknA and PknB (15, 17). In vivo 
phosphorylation of InhA was investigated in M. smegmatis wild type and an InhA 
overexpression strain (47) and in Mycobacterium bovis BCG over-expressing InhA (48), 
with both studies confirming Thr266 as the primary in vivo site of phosphorylation. Using 
phosphorylated InhA and phosphomimetic (T266D or T266E) or phosphoablative (T266A) 
substituted proteins, enzyme activity of InhA was shown to be markedly decreased by 
phosphorylation. Structural analysis showed that these effects were not the result of gross 
disruption of InhA folding, and in combination with binding and kinetic analyses suggested 
a mechanism by which the effects on enzyme activity are the result of decreased affinity of 
the phosphomimetic-substituted InhA for NADH (48).
In vivo, it was observed that expression of the phosphoablative form of InhA was well 
tolerated in M. smegmatis but that the phosphomimetic form led to severe growth inhibition.

Similarly, inhA conditional expression strains were complemented by inhA expressing the 
native or phosphoablative proteins but not the phosphomimetic form. These data provide 
strong evidence for regulation of mycolic acid synthesis by Ser/Thr phosphorylation, though 
it remains uncertain which specific STPK(s) target InhA. Consistent with this observation, 
other FASII enzymes, including KasA, KasB, and MabA, have been shown to be 
phosphorylated in vitro and in mycobacteria with direct effects of phosphorylation on 
enzyme activity (49, 50); FabD and FabH have also been shown to be phosphorylated in 
vitro, though not yet in M. tuberculosis (49, 51).
PknD
PknD is encoded by a nonessential gene at a chromosomal locus encoding multiple genes 
involved in phosphate transport (11, 52). The KD of PknD is most similar to the KDs of 
PknH and PknE and appears to be activated by allosteric effects of dimerization of the KDs 
as described above (23). The PknD extracellular domain has been shown to form a highly 
symmetrical six-bladed β-propeller structure, with variation in the blades concentrated in the 
membrane-distal “cup” region that is the likely site of ligand binding (53).
Though the ligands of PknD and its function are not known, the linkage of pknD to 
phosphate transport genes suggests a role in phosphate uptake, and survival of a pknD 
deletion mutant has been shown to be compromised in a phosphate-deficient growth 
medium (54). PknD has also been shown to phosphorylate the amino-terminal extension of 
Rv0516c, a putative regulator of the sigma factor SigF (55), and recent data have linked 
Rv0516c, SigF, and PknD in an osmosensory signaling pathway (56).
Interestingly, pknD has been linked to central nervous system tuberculosis. A screen for 
genes required for central nervous system infection by M. tuberculosis identified a pknD 
deletion strain as defective for central nervous system invasion (57). PknD was shown to be 
required for invasion of brain endothelial cells in vitro, and the extracytoplasmic domain of 
the molecule was sufficient to stimulate invasion of these cells. The mechanism by which 
PknD may contribute to central nervous system invasion and the protein substrates of PknD 
that may contribute to this phenotype are not known.
PknE
Relatively little is known regarding the substrates or function of PknE. It appears to be a 
receptor-type kinase, with an extracellular domain, transmembrane domain, and intracellular 
KD. The extracytoplasmic domain of PknE has not been characterized and does not contain 
known protein motifs based on amino acid sequence. The gene encoding this STPK is 
adjacent to genes of unknown function and does not appear to be part of an operon. 
Interestingly, pknE is separated from pknF by just two genes, suggesting a possible 
functional link between these two STPKs. A possible link to regulation of lipid synthesis by 
the type II fatty acid synthase system has been suggested, based on functional effects of 
phosphorylation or substitutions of phosphoacceptors and in vitro phosphorylation of some 
of these enzymes by PknE, as well as other kinases (49). PknE has also been suggested to 
regulate apoptosis in M. tuberculosis– infected macrophages (58).

PknF
As noted above, pknF is separated from pknE by less than 2 kb in the M. tuberculosis 
chromosome. Immediately 3′ of pknF is Rv1747, which encodes an ABC transporter that 
contains two forkhead associated (FHA) domains in addition to the transmembrane 
transporter and ATP binding domains (52, 59). Several studies point to functional and 
physical interactions between PknF and Rv1747, in which autophosphorylated PknF recruits 
Rv1747 via its amino-terminal FHA domain, leading to phosphorylation of Rv1747 by PknF 
(60, 61). Though the transport role of Rv1747 and the effects of phosphorylation on 
transport were not determined, an Rv1747 deletion mutant was shown to be attenuated for 
growth in macrophages and in lungs and spleens of mice (61). In a study using pknF 
overexpression and antisense expressing strains, marked effects on growth, morphology and 
septum placement were observed, suggesting a role for pknF in regulating growth and cell 
shape (62).
More recently, it was shown that pknF and Rv1747 are cotranscribed in an operon and that 
PknF phosphorylates Rv1747 at two sites, Thr150 and Thr208, located between the two 
FHA domains of this protein (63). In addition to confirming that the Rv1747 deletion strain 
is attenuated in mice and macrophages, this study demonstrated that phosphoablative 
mutants of Rv1747 did not complement the virulence defect, indicating a role for 
phosphorylation in Rv1747 function. Supporting this interpretation, a construct expressing 
Rv1747 with a mutation in the first FHA domain that is required for phosphothreonine 
binding failed to complement the growth defect of the Rv1747 deletion strain in 
macrophages. Interestingly, however, a pknF deletion strain was not clearly defective for 
growth in macrophages. Given the requirement for phosphorylation in complementing the 
intracellular growth defects, this result suggests that other kinases may also phosphorylate 
Rv1747, consistent with the strong similarity between the phosphorylation motifs of PknF 
and several other STPKs (15, 63). Despite substantial molecular and pathogenic insights into 
the interactions of PknF and Rv1747, the transport activity of Rv1747 and the effect of 
phosphorylation on this activity remain unknown. In addition, the extracellular domain of 
PknF has not been characterized to date.
PknG
PknG is one of the two M. tuberculosis STPKs, PknK being the other, that lack a 
transmembrane region. Thus, PknG does not have the structure of a typical receptor type 
kinase that functions in transmembrane signal transduction (Fig. 7B). In addition to its KD, 
which does not cluster with any of the other M. tuberculosis STPKs based on amino acid 
sequence (Fig. 2 and 3), PknG has amino and carboxy-terminal sequences that are important 
for its function. The amino-terminal region contains a rubredoxin redox-sensing domain, and 
the carboxy-terminus contains a tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat domain, which may function 
in protein-protein interactions and regulation of kinase activity (30, 31, 64). As described in 
detail above, the PknG KD has the characteristic two-lobed structure of Ser/Thr protein 
kinases, though with differences from the PknB structure including absence of 
phosphorylation of the activation loop, absence of the highly conserved Arg preceding the 
catalytic Asp in the catalytic loop, and unusual residues in the ATP-binding pocket (29).

Mutagenesis and activity studies based on this structure indicate that the amino-terminal 
rubredoxin motif likely regulates PknG activity. Deletion of the rubredoxin domain resulted 
in decreased kinase activity and substitution of Cys residues in the iron binding motif caused 
reduction or complete elimination of kinase activity, depending on the nature of the 
substitution (30, 31). PknG is encoded by a gene that is linked in an operon to glnH, a gluta-
mine-binding lipoprotein, and a conserved membrane protein of unknown function (52).
An early publication, using M. bovis BCG and M. smegmatis, suggested that PknG was a 
virulence factor that was secreted into the macrophage phagosome and functioned by 
modulating host signaling to prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion (65). In the first 
publication that analyzed a pknG deletion mutant, Cowley et al. found that the ΔpknG strain 
grew poorly in liquid and on solid media, with decreased growth compared to wild type that 
was most notable after mid-log phase (66). These investigators also demonstrated that the 
ΔpknG strain was attenuated in SCID mice and had elevated intracellular levels of glutamate 
plus glutamine, associated with decreased de novo glutamine synthase.
Further insight regarding the functions of PknG emerged with the identification of its 
primary substrate, the FHA domain-containing protein GarA (Rv1827), and the role of GarA 
in regulating central metabolic pathways (67). O'Hare and colleagues first demonstrated 
three phosphorylation sites in the amino-terminal region of PknG (19). In contrast to other 
M. tuberculosis STPKs, there was no evidence of phosphorylation of the activation or 
catalytic loops of the KD, and autophosphorylation was not required for kinase activity of 
PknG. Building on results obtained in C. glutamicum (68), a related actinomycete, these 
authors identified GarA as a substrate of PknG that is phosphorylated at Thr22, adjacent to 
the Thr21 residue of this protein that is phosphorylated by PknB.
In this and subsequent work by Nott et al., an elegant intramolecular phospho-switch 
mechanism was elucidated as the mechanism by which the phosphorylation state of GarA 
regulates central carbon metabolism (19, 69). In this research, it was shown that 
unphosphorylated GarA binds to three enzymes: α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGD, 
Rv1248c), NAD-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH, Rv2476c), and the α-subunit 
of the glutamate synthase complex (GltB, Rv3859c). In each case, binding regulates their 
enzymatic activity. Phosphorylation of GarA by either PknG (shown for KGD and GDH) 
(19) or PknB (shown for KGD, GDH, and GltB) (69) abolished the binding of GarA to these 
enzymes. Though the amino-terminal region containing the Thr21 or Thr22 
phosphoacceptors was not required for binding of GarA to the enzyme ligands, these 
residues were essential for the phosphor-ylation-mediated abrogation of binding. Structural 
and mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that the FHA domain of GarA was required for 
binding of each of the enzyme ligands. Further, phosphorylation of GarA on Thr21 resulted 
in binding of the amino-terminal region of GarA to the FHA domain, blocking interaction of 
the FHA domain with the enzymes and thereby increasing their activity in the cell. Unlike 
most other M. tubercu losis STPKs, PknG has limited in vitro kinase activity toward a wide 
range of peptide and protein substrates, suggesting that this regulation of metabolic activity 
by phosphorylation of GarA may be its primary role and/or that additional regulatory inputs 
are required for its activity.

PknH
PknH is encoded 3′ of the gene encoding the transcriptional regulator EmbR. Sequence 
analysis indicates that PknH is a typical receptor-type kinase with an intracellular KD and an 
extracellular receptor domain (52). The extracytoplasmic domain contains no previously 
described motifs, and its ligand(s) are not known. A recent structural analysis, however, 
identified unusual features of the structure of this region. The crystal structure revealed the 
presence of two disulfide bonds that contribute rigidity to the structure and the presence of a 
deep cleft, the likely site of ligand binding, lined by a mix of hydrophobic and polar residues 
(70). The presumed ligand binding cleft is highly conserved among PknH orthologues and 
bears some similarity to binding sites of lipoproteins LprG and LppX. However, the greater 
polarity of the PknH cleft was thought to make binding of hydrophobic glycolipids unlikely.
The physical proximity between the genes encoding PknH and the transcriptional regulator 
EmbR suggests a functional interaction between these proteins. The presence of an FHA 
domain in EmbR, in addition to winged helix-turn-helix and bacterial activation domains 
that are characteristic of this family of transcription factors led to investigation of the role of 
phosphorylation, and PknH specifically, in regulating EmbR activity. In an initial study, 
Molle and colleagues demonstrated Thr phosphorylation of EmbR by PknH in vitro (71). 
Using substitutions of conserved residues in the EmbR FHA domain, these authors also 
demonstrated that this domain is essential for EmbR phosphorylation. Singh and colleagues 
subsequently identified the embCAB operon, which encodes proteins required for 
arabinosylation of lipoarabinomannan (embC) and arabinogalactan (embA and embB) (72, 
73), as a target of EmbR, with apparent binding sites 5′ of embC, embA, and embB (74). 
EmbR phosphorylation by PknH enhanced its binding to each of these regions. Expression 
of M. tuberculosis pknH in M. smegmatis resulted in increased phosphor-ylation of M. 
smegmatis EmbR. In a strain expressing native PknH, but not a kinase inactive form, 
semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) showed increased transcription of 
embC, embA, and embB. Consistent with increased expression of these enzymes, the ratio of 
lipoarabinomannan to lipomannan was increased in the pknH overexpression strain. Though 
expression of M. tuberculosis PknH in M. smegmatis, and the absence of evidence that the 
same sites on EmbR are phosphorylated in M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis, complicates 
interpretation of these data, taken together they do suggest that phosphorylation of EmbR by 
PknH positively regulates expression of the embA, embB, and embC genes. Decreased 
expression of embC and embB in a pknH deletion mutant (ΔpknH) further supports this 
regulatory mechanism (75).
In addition to its regulation of cell envelope glycolipids, proteomic and lipid analysis of a 
ΔpknH strain compared to wild type suggests a possible role for PknH in regulating lipids in 
the M. tuberculosis cell envelope (76). Specific phthiocerol dimycoserosates (PDIMs) were 
found to be decreased in the ΔpknH strain. Surprisingly, enzymes involved in PDIM 
synthesis were expressed at similar or higher levels in the mutant strain. In contrast to M. 
smegmatis, where overexpression of PknH led to higher lipoarabinomannan:lipomannan 
ratios, in this study higher lipoarabinomannan:lipomannan ratios were observed in the M. 
tuberculosis pknH deletion strain. The mechanism by which PDIM production is affected by

pknH deletion, and how lower levels of a virulence-associated surface lipid would lead to 
hyper-virulence, remain unknown.
The roles of pknH in response to stress and during infection are complex. The ΔpknH strain 
was found to be more susceptible to peroxide and superoxide (paraquat) stresses but more 
resistant to nitric oxide (acidified nitrite) stresses (75). The mutant showed decreased 
survival in THP-1 macrophages but, surprisingly, was hypervirulent in mice, with greater 
replication in the ΔpknH strain starting at 4 weeks post-infection, reaching 1 to 2 log greater 
bacterial burden of the deletion strain in both lungs and spleen of Balb/C mice after 4 
months of infection.
Further insight into PknH signaling emerged from a proteomic study comparing protein 
levels in wild type and the ΔpknH strain, untreated or after 48 hours of acidified nitrite 
treatment (77). The striking finding of this study was the identification of several DosR 
regulon proteins that were increased in response to acidified nitrite treatment in the pknH 
mutant. Following this lead, Chao et al. (77) then demonstrated that PknH can phosphorylate 
DosR in vitro on two Thr residues and that this phosphorylation enhances the binding of 
DosR to DNA containing a DosR recognition sequence. Subsequent analysis of transcription 
of DosR regulon genes in response to hypoxia and nitric oxide stress indicated decreased 
induction of these genes in the ΔpknH strain, though this effect was modest. These data 
suggest a role for PknH phosphorylation as a mechanism for modulating the M. tuberculosis 
dormancy response, though in vivo confirmation of DosR phosphorylation and the 
mechanism by which this affects DosR activity remain to be shown.
PknI
Relatively little is known regarding the substrates or function of PknI. This STPK has the 
domain organization of a receptor-type kinase, with an extracellular domain, transmembrane 
domain, and intracellular KD. The extracytoplasmic domain of PknI has not been 
characterized and is not similar to known protein domains based on amino acid sequence. 
Immediately 3′ of the gene encoding PknI (Rv2914c) is a gene that encodes a predicted D-
amino acid aminohydrolase (Rv2913c) followed by a transcriptional regulator (Rv2912c) 
and dacB2 (Rv2911), predicted to encode a D-alanyl-D-alanine hydrolase, raising the 
possibility of a role for PknI in regulating cell wall turnover. Immediately 5′ of pknI is a 
gene of unknown function (Rv2915c) and a gene for a predicted signal recognition particle 
(SRP) protein (52). No well-documented substrates of PknI have been identified, but a pknI 
deletion strain was found to be hypervirulent for replication in macrophages and for 
morbidity in SCID mice (78).
PknJ
Like PknI, relatively little is known regarding the substrates or function of PknJ. Jang et al. 
performed an initial characterization of this protein (79). They demonstrated that the KD can 
dimerize and that it auto-phosphorylates on three Thr residues in the activation loop (79), 
consistent with the mode of activation of the other M. tuberculosis STPKs that have been 
studied. PknJ is a receptor-type kinase and was shown to have a single transmembrane 
region, an intracellular KD, and an extracellular domain (79). The extracellular domain has

not been characterized and has no recognizable motifs. Several M. tuberculosis proteins 
were shown to be phosphorylated by PknJ in vitro, but in vivo phosphorylation was not 
demonstrated (79). The several genes 5′ of pknJ encode conserved hypothetical proteins; a 
gene encoding a predicted dipeptidase is located immediately 3′ of pknJ in the opposite 
orientation. Thus, the chromosomal locus provides few clues as to a likely function of PknJ. 
A pknJ transposon insertion mutant did not have a growth phenotype in macrophages or in 
BALB/c mice (79).
PknK
PknK is one of two M. tuberculosis STPKs that lack a transmembrane segment, the other 
being PknG, and is therefore predicted to be a cytoplasmic protein. PknK is a large (119 
kDa) protein with the KD in the amino-terminal region and a long carboxy-terminal region 
that shows similarity to the MalT family of ATP-dependent transcription regulators. Within 
this region are a P-loop ATP binding motif characteristic of AAA+ ATPases, a PDZ 
domain, and a single tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat sequence (64). PDZ domains and TPR 
domains are often involved in protein-protein interactions. TPR sequences typically occur in 
clusters of three or more repeats and mediate protein-protein interactions (80). The function 
and interaction partners of the PDZ domain and the TPR motif in PknK are not known.
Kumar et al. demonstrated that, like most other M. tuberculosis STPKs, PknK 
autophosphorylates on two Thr residues in a TXT motif in the activation loop, and this 
autophosphorylation is required for kinase activity (81). In addition, they provided evidence 
for phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal region of the protein and suggest a positive 
regulatory role for this region. Despite its lack of a predicted transmembrane domain, 
probing of subcellular fractions of M. tuberculosis lysates showed PknK to be present in the 
cell wall/membrane fraction rather than in the cytosol. These investigators demonstrated the 
ability of PknK to phosphorylate in vitro VirS, a transcription factor encoded by a gene that 
is separated from pknK by a single gene in the M. tuberculosis chromosome. PknK also 
phosphorylated several proteins encoded in the mym operon that is regulated by VirS and 
that is adjacent to virS. Phosphorylation of VirS increased binding to the intergenic region 
that likely contains the virS and mym promoters, and increased transcriptional activity from 
a mym promoter-luciferase transcriptional fusion construct when active PknK and VirS were 
coexpressed in M. smegmatis. Though these data suggest a role for PknK-mediated 
phosphorylation in regulating VirS activity, whether VirS is phosphorylated in M. 
tuberculosis and whether PknK might be a cognate kinase for VirS were not shown.
Malhotra et al. have investigated the expression of pknK and phenotypes of a pknK deletion 
strain (ΔpknK) (82). Expression of pknK was found to be greater in virulent M. tuberculosis 
H37Rv compared to avirulent H37Ra, and PknK protein was shown to be much more 
abundant in stationary versus log phase cells grown in broth culture in vitro. The ΔpknK 
strain was found to grow to higher levels during stationary phase, and the cells of the mutant 
strain were shorter than wild type. The ΔpknK strain was slightly more resistant to acidic, 
oxidative, and hypoxic stress, and in a low-dose aerosol infection of C57BL/6 the mutant 
strain showed a transient early growth defect. In a follow-up report the same group showed 
striking effects on the expression of several tRNAs in the ΔpknK strain compared to wild

type, with a large subset of tRNAs expressed at lower levels in the mutant in logarithmic 
growth and at higher levels during stationary phase (83). These phenotypes and expression 
data suggest a role for PknK in regulating translation in relation to growth and 
environmental conditions. These investigators also demonstrated dimerization of the PknK 
KD and, based on indirect evidence of effects on kinase activity, proposed a model in which 
the carboxy terminal domain negatively regulates the activity of the amino-terminal KD 
through steric hindrance.
PknL
PknL is encoded by a gene adjacent to a transposase and a putative DNA binding protein 
(52). Additional genes in the region encode several conserved hypothetical proteins and 
biosynthetic enzymes for aromatic amino acids, mannan, and lipid biosynthesis. Located 
further 5′ is a division and cell wall cluster (dcw) that includes several genes that encode 
enzymes for PGN precursor synthesis, a penicillin binding protein, and several cell division 
proteins, suggesting the possibility that PknL regulates cell wall synthesis. Though the M. 
tuberculosis PknL lacks an extracellular domain, the PknL orthologue in C. glutamicum has 
an extracellular domain comprised of three PASTA domains, further supporting a role for 
this STPK in regulating the mycobacterial cell wall (84).
There has been relatively little investigation of PknL in mycobacteria. The intracellular 
domain has been shown to autophosphorylate on two Thr residues in the activation loop, 
similar to the phosphorylation required for activation of PknB and several other M. 
tuberculosis STPKs (16, 85). Rv2175c, a putative transcription factor encoded by the gene 
adjacent to pknL in M. tuberculosis, was shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by 
recombinant PknL. Overexpression of Rv2175c in M. smegmatis allowed detection of three 
isoforms of the protein with different pIs, consistent with one and two phosphorylations, but 
direct evidence of Rv2175c phosphorylation in M. tuberculosis, and whether PknL is the 
cognate kinase, has not been shown.
TYROSINE PHOSPHORYLATION IN M. TUBERCULOSIS
No tyrosine kinases were annotated in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome sequence or in 
other sequenced strains. Speculating that a Tyr kinase might be linked to a Tyr phosphatase, 
Bach et al. examined Rv2232, a protein of unknown function encoded by the gene adjacent 
to the gene encoding the Tyr phosphatase PtpA, for kinase activity. These investigators 
determined that recombinant Rv2232, which they renamed PtkA, could autophosphorylate 
and that the site of phosphorylation was a Tyr residue (35). They further demonstrated that 
PtkA interacted with PtpA and phosphorylated PtpA in vitro on two Tyr residues. 
Surprisingly, PtpA did not have phosphatase activity toward PtkA. PtkA has no 
characteristic Tyr kinase motifs and thus would be an atypical Tyr kinase, whose role in M. 
tuberculosis remains to be defined.
M. TUBERCULOSIS PROTEIN PHOSPHATASES
Phosphorylation of Ser, Thr, or Tyr is a relatively stable modification, so that reversal of 
phosphorylation requires the enzymatic activity of a phosphatase that can bind to and act on

specific phosphorylated residues on proteins. In most organisms, the number of protein 
kinases substantially exceeds the number of protein phosphatases. In M. tuberculosis there is 
one annotated phospho-Ser/phospho-Thr phosphatase, PstP, encoded by the first gene in the 
operon that includes pknA and pknB. There are two annotated Tyr phosphatases, the low-
molecular-weight phosphatase PtpA and the high-molecular-weight phosphatase PtpB.
PstP is a member of the PPM family of Ser/Thr phosphatases, which utilize Mg2+ or Mn2+ 
to catalyze dephosphorylation (86). PstP was initially shown to dephosphorylate Thr 
residues that had been phosphor-ylated by PknB (16) and has since been shown to have 
broad activity in dephosphorylating Ser and Thr residues targeted by several M. tuberculosis 
kinases. The X-ray crystal structure of PstP was determined and found to be highly similar 
to the structure of PP2Cα, the prototype of the PPM phosphatases, with additional features 
of interest (87). In addition to the two Mn2+ ions present in PP2Cα, a third Mn2+ was found 
to be present in the PstP active site, with positioning of a large flap domain to bring it in 
contact with this metal ion. Given the broad reactivity of PstP, how dephosphorylation by 
this enzyme may contribute to regulating specific Ser/Thr signaling pathways is not clear 
and remains to be elucidated.
The two Tyr phosphatases have attracted a great deal of interest based on the hypothesis that 
one or both may target host phosphotyrosine signaling pathways. In an early paper, Koul et 
al. demonstrated that these enzymes specifically target phospho-Tyr and not phospho-Ser or 
phospho-Thr (88). Examination of subcellular fractions by this group indicated that these 
proteins were present in culture supernatants, suggesting that they are secreted proteins. 
These proteins lack SecI or TAT secretion signals, however, and the mechanism by which 
they are secreted is not known.
Both ptpA and ptpB are widely distributed among pathogenic and nonpathogenic 
mycobacteria. Using a combination of bioinformatic and experimental approaches, 
Beresford et al. identified features of the conserved active site motif of PtpB, suggesting that 
it may be a dual-specificity phosphatase (89). While confirming greater activity against 
phospho-Tyr-containing substrates, these investigators demonstrated phosphatase activity 
against phospho-Ser and phospho-Thr residues as well. Importantly, they also demonstrated 
potent phosphatase activity against phosphoinositides, demonstrating that PtpB may be a 
triple specificity phosphatase that could target multiple host signaling pathways to alter 
macrophage activity against M. tuberculosis.
Crystal and solution structures of PtpA have been determined and demonstrate that PtpA has 
a structure and active site characteristic of eukaryotic low-molecular-protein phosphatases 
despite limited sequence similarity (90, 91). Specific differences in residues of the substrate 
binding site suggested differences in specificity. The d-loop in the apo form of the protein 
was found to be in a more open orientation compared to ligand bound PtpA, and 
phosphorylation of two adjacent Tyr residues that are likely to play regulatory roles was 
demonstrated.
In the case of PtpB, crystal structures demonstrated preservation of the typical phosphatase 
fold plus two unique features: a disordered loop that may play a role in substrate binding or

regulation and a mobile lid over the active site that may serve to protect this site from 
oxidative damage encountered in the phagosome of macrophages or neutrophils that have 
ingested M. tuberculosis (92, 93).
Supporting the hypothesis that these Tyr phosphatases act on host Tyr signaling pathways, 
PtpA has been implicated in modulating phagosome acidification. In an initial report Bach et 
al. demonstrated that a ptpA deletion mutant was defective for survival in macrophages (94). 
Using a substrate trap form of PtpA, vacuolar protein sorting 33B (VPS33B) was identified 
as a candidate substrate of PtpA. This protein was found to autophosphorylate on Tyr 
residues and to be bound and dephosphorylated by PtpA. PtpA and VPS33B were found to 
colocalize in M. tuberculosis macrophages. In a subsequent study from the same group, 
Wong et al. demonstrated that PtpA binds to subunit H of the host vacuolar ATPase (V-
ATPase) in the phagosome membrane and that the macrophage class C sorting complex 
associates with the V-ATPase during phagosome maturation (95). These interactions are 
required for the dephosphorylation of VPS33B and result in exclusion of V-ATPase from 
the M. tuberculosis–containing phagosomes, thereby preventing acidification.
PtpB has also been implicated in modulating host responses, apparently by targeting specific 
Tyr signaling pathways to alter host immune function (96). Zhou et al. demonstrated 
decreased interferon-gamma-stimulated production of IL-6 from a macrophage cell line 
stably transfected with ptpB compared to nontransfected cells and demonstrated decreased 
phosphorylation of Erk2 and p38 in the MptB-expressing cells, but not in cells expressing an 
inactive form of PtpB. These investigators also noted decreased apoptosis in PtpB-
expressing cells and an associated decrease in Caspase 3 activity. Though these data are 
indirect, i.e., experiments were not performed using cells infected with M. tuberculosis, they 
suggest a mechanism that may explain the decreased viability of ptpB deletion strains in 
activated macrophages and guinea pigs (97).
A lipid phosphatase of M. tuberculosis, SapM, has also been identified and shown to be a 
secreted protein (98). In macrophages this protein appears to target phosphatidyl inositol-3-
phosphate in a manner that prevents phagosome maturation (99).
M. TUBERCULOSIS STPKS AND PHOSPHATASES AS POTENTIAL DRUG 
TARGETS
Inhibition of protein kinases and phosphatases has been one the most active areas of current 
pharmaceutical research and drug development to target human diseases. The critical role of 
protein phosphorylation in controlling key physiologies that are dysregulated in diseases 
such as cancer and autoimmune diseases, the extensive detailed structural information on 
proteins and complexes involved in signal transduction, and the ability to develop potent 
inhibitors of these enzymes has led to the development of several approved drugs targeting 
protein phosphorylation, with many more in development (100). The importance of protein 
phosphorylation in regulating key processes for M. tuberculosis viability and virulence, 
together with substantial structural information on M. tuberculosis kinases and phosphatases 
and the extensive expertise in design and development of small molecule inhibitors of these 
enzymes, make them highly attractive targets for the development of new antituberculars.

The wealth of experience in targeting human Ser/Thr and Tyr kinases provides a huge 
advantage in developing inhibitors of M. tuberculosis kinases and phosphatases. The 
similarity of the mycobacterial proteins to their eukaryotic counterparts, however, has led to 
concern that inhibitors of M. tuberculosis enzymes will not be sufficiently selective relative 
to human kinases and phosphatases to avoid important toxicities. While this is a valid 
concern, the success in developing specific inhibitors of individual human kinases suggests 
that this challenge can be overcome, even with ATP-competitive inhibitors that target the 
conserved ATP-binding site of kinases. Both type I inhibitors that bind to the active 
conformation through interactions with the purine binding site and adjacent hydrophobic 
pockets and type 2 inhibitors that bind to the inactive conformation, in which an additional 
binding site is exposed, have been developed as FDA-approved selective inhibitors of 
human kinases (100). Other classes of kinase inhibitors, e.g., allosteric inhibitors that bind at 
sites separate from the ATP binding, are of great interest in that they may target unique 
features of a kinase and offer the potential for very high selectivity.
While the conservation of the KDs of M. tuberculosis kinases offers advantages and 
disadvantages for the inhibitor identification and candidate drug development described 
above, other regions of the M. tuberculosis kinases may also serve as targets for inhibitor 
development. The extracellular domains of the receptor-type M. tuberculosis kinases, and 
the regulatory and protein interaction domains of PknG and PknK, may provide targets that 
are unrelated to human proteins and thus allow development of highly selective inhibitors of 
M. tuberculosis kinases.
A number of groups have undertaken screens to identify inhibitors of M. tuberculosis 
kinases, with most efforts focusing on the essential kinases PknA and PknB and on PknG, 
which is required for virulence and regulates central metabolism (29, 65, 101–103). A 
number of M. tuberculosis kinase inhibitors have advanced through medicinal chemistry 
efforts to optimize their activity. In some cases enzyme inhibitory activity in the low 
nanomolar range has been achieved. Some compounds also show substantial antibacterial 
activity, with MICs in the low micromolar range (102–104), but none has achieved potency 
sufficient to lead to evaluation in clinical trials.
The protein phosphatases also present important opportunities for antitubercular drug 
development (105). Phosphatases have advantages and challenges as targets for drug 
development that are similar to those of the M. tuberculosis kinases; i.e., the presence of 
similar enzymes in humans provides a wealth of knowledge but raises concerns regarding 
selectivity and potential for toxicity (106). The smaller number of protein phosphatases 
relative to kinases suggests that these phosphatases will be less specific than protein kinases, 
and lack of selectivity has been a challenge in developing phosphatase inhibitors to treat 
human diseases. In addition, the natural substrate includes the charged phosphate residue; 
active site inhibitors that share this charge are unlikely to enter the host cell, a problem that 
has slowed phosphatase inhibitor development for human diseases and will be a challenge in 
targeting the secreted protein phosphatases of M. tuberculosis. Potentially offsetting these 
challenges, the fact that PtpA and PtpB are both secreted proteins means that a major 
impediment to developing antituberculars that target proteins in the bacterial cytoplasm, 
passage across the relatively impermeable mycobacterial cell envelope, does not have to be

overcome. The PtpA structure is highly similar to that of human protein phosphatases, so 
that development of highly selective inhibitors may be difficult. In contrast, though PtpB 
retains the phosphatase active site signature sequence, it is otherwise highly divergent from 
known human phosphatases and thus may be especially attractive as a target for inhibitors. 
Further, as described above, both PtpA and PtpB have unique structural features that may 
allow more specific targeting of these proteins.
Several groups have identified compounds that inhibit PtpA. Manger et al. identified two 
classes of natural compounds with IC50s in the low micromolar range and also screened a 
fragment-based library to identify synthetic molecules that inhibit PtpA activity, with the 
most potent having Kis of 1 to 2 μM (107). The compounds that were tested, however, also 
had significant activity against one or more human phosphatases. Chiradia et al. identified 
synthetic chalcones as inhi bitors of PtpA, and in follow-up work elucidated structure-
activity relationships and demonstrated inhibition by one compound of M. bovis BCG in 
human macrophages but not in axenic culture (108–110). A group that had previously 
identified PtpB inhibitors using a fragment-based approach applied this method to identify 
inhibitors of PtpA (111). The most potent of these (Ki = 1.4 μM) was also selective relative 
to human Tyr and dual-specificity kinases.
In the case of PtpB, a number of groups have identified potent inhibitory compounds. 
Grundner et al., using scaffolds from which inhibitors of eukaryotic Tyr phosphatases had 
been developed, identified a competitive inhibitor of PtpB with IC50 of 0.44 μM, with good 
selectivity versus several human tyrosine phosphatases (112). Crystal structure analysis of 
this compound in complex with PtpB demonstrated conformational changes and key 
residues that may guide further inhibitor development. Soellner et al. subsequently used a 
fragment-based approach to identify a more potent inhibitor that maintained good selectivity 
(113). Beresford et al. identified inhibitors with IC50s in the low micromolar range with 
good selectivity (114). One of these compounds was shown to inhibit growth of M. bovis 
BCG in resting murine macrophages, but not in axenic culture, consistent with an effect on 
macrophage function rather than a direct antibacterial effect.
SUMMARY AND FUTURE RESEARCH
Since the identification of 11 STPKs in the M. tuberculosis genome sequence in 1998 (115), 
substantial progress has been made in gaining insight into the role of Ser/Thr 
phosphorylation in regulating M. tuberculosis physiology. The effect of phosphorylation on 
protein function has been elucidated for several M. tuberculosis proteins, a number of which 
have been highlighted in this article. In particular, important insights have been gained into 
the roles of protein phosphorylation in regulating the synthesis of several components of the 
mycobacterial cell envelope, including PGN, glycans, and lipids. To a lesser extent, 
knowledge has been acquired regarding the cognate STPKs that target specific enzymes to 
control these and other cell functions. Structural analyses have also provided key insights 
into STPK function, first demonstrating the structural and mechanistic similarity between 
the mycobacterial and eukaryotic protein kinases, and then providing important and novel 
insights regarding activation and regulation of M. tuberculosis kinases and phosphatases, as 
well as potential ways to target these molecules with inhibitors.

Despite these advances, in many ways we have barely scratched the surface of the regulatory 
roles of protein phosphorylation in M. tuberculosis. Going forward, we expect that many 
new phosphoproteins will be identi-fied, and the effects of phosphorylation on protein 
function will be discerned for many of these. Identification of cognate kinases for individual 
phosphoproteins, though challenging, is critical for deepening our understanding of the 
regulatory roles of Ser/Thr phosphorylation in M. tuberculosis. Identifying ligands for the 
receptor-type STPKs and how ligand binding affects kinase function will provide key new 
information on how these signaling molecules sense the external environment. Ultimately, 
integration of these data to construct functional signal transduction networks will provide 
deep insights into the mechanisms by which M. tuberculosis adapts during the course of 
infection of the mammalian host. Finally, we hope to see these insights translated into novel 
and potent antituberculars to improve the treatment of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant 
tuberculosis.
