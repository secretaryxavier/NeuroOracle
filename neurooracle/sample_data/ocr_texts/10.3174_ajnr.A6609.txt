ABSTRACT
SUMMARY: Miller Fisher syndrome, also known as Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, is an acute peripheral neuropa-
thy that can develop after exposure to various viral, bacterial, and fungal pathogens. It is characterized by a triad of ophthalmople-
gia, ataxia, and areﬂexia. Miller Fisher syndrome has recently been described in the clinical setting of the novel coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) without accompanying imaging. In this case, we report the ﬁrst presumptive case of COVID-19–associated Miller
Fisher syndrome with MR imaging ﬁndings.

M
iller Fisher syndrome (MFS), also known as Miller Fisher
variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, is an acute peripheral
neuropathy that can develop after exposure to various viral, bacte-
rial, and fungal pathogens. It is often immune-mediated and asso-
ciated with anti-GQ1b antibodies, characterized by a triad of
ophthalmoplegia, gait ataxia, and areflexia. Ophthalmoplegia is
due to involvement of cranial nerves III, IV, or VI. Ataxia is
thought to be due to cerebellar involvement, and areflexia is due to
lower motor neuron involvement. MFS has recently been
described in the clinical setting of the novel coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) without accompanying imaging findings.1
While patients with COVID-19 typically present with fever, short-
ness of breath, and cough, neurologic manifestations, including
headache, ataxia, cognitive impairment, anosmia, and stroke, have
been reported.2-4 One retrospective review of 214 patients found
neurologic symptoms in 36.4% of patients, with involvement of
the CNS (24.8%) greater than the peripheral nervous system
(8.9%).4 In this case, we report the first presumptive case of
COVID-19–associated Miller Fisher syndrome with imaging.
A 36-year-old man with a remote history of left eye strabismus
(asymptomatic for 30years) was brought to the emergency depart-
ment by ambulance, presenting with left eye drooping, blurry
vision, and reduced sensation and paresthesia in both legs for 2
days. He was in his usual state of health until 4days before presen-
tation, when he developed viral symptoms in a COVID-19-
endemic region, reporting subjective fevers, chills, and myalgia.
Physical examination was notable for a partial left third nerve palsy
and decreased sensation below the knees to all modalities. MR
imaging of the brain, including high-resolution imaging of the
orbits and retro-orbital region, with and without gadolinium, was
notable for striking enlargement, prominent enhancement with
gadolinium, and T2 hyperintense signal of the left cranial nerve
(CN) III (Figure). No other cranial nerves demonstrated abnormal
signal or enhancement characteristics. MR imaging of the brain
had normal findings. No cerebellar lesions were seen to explain the
patient’s ataxia. There were no findings of meningitis, encephalitis,
demyelination, or infarction. MR imaging of the spine, which may
have provided an imaging correlate for the patient’s areflexia, was
not performed.
The diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by qualitative
detection of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2
RNA in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen by real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction amplification and detec-
tion using TaqMan fluorescent oligonuecleotide probes (Altona
Diagnostics) on the Rotor-Gene Q instrument. Serologic ganglio-
side antibody testing was performed by semi-quantitative enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay (ARUP Laboratories) and showed
Asialo GM1 antibody in the equivocal range, while testing for
other antibodies, including anti-GQ1b, was negative. Nonetheless,
the patient’s hospital course was characterized by progressive oph-
thalmoparesis (including initial left CN III and eventual bilateral
CN VI palsies), ataxia, and hyporeflexia, and the clinical picture

was thought to be consistent with MFS from COVID-19 infection.
The patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, with
subsequent improvement of neurologic symptoms. The patient
also received hydroxychloroquine to treat the underlying COVID-
19 infection. No repeat MR imaging was performed, and the
patient was discharged after 4 days of hospitalization.
MFS accounts for 1%–5% of cases of Guillain-Barré syn-
drome in Western countries, affects men twice as often as
women, and is preceded by an upper respiratory illness in
most patients.5 MFS presents commonly with diplopia
(78%), ataxia (48%), or both (34%).6 Our patient presented
with symptoms of COVID-19 as well as diplopia, which was
found to be due to a CN III palsy noted on the patient’s clini-
cal examination. MR imaging demonstrated corresponding
enlargement, T2 hyperintensity, and enhancement of the
affected CN III from the cavernous sinus through the orbit.
This is the first presumptive case report of MFS associated
with COVID-19 infection with imaging findings.
Although testing was negative for anti-GQ1b, the clinical
picture was consistent with MFS, and the patient improved
with treatment. Negative ganglioside antibody testing is a li-
mitation of this report; however, a review of 123 patients with
MFS found that 15% were negative for anti-GQ1b.7 The
GQ1b ganglioside is a cell surface component that is concen-
trated in the paranodal regions, cranial nerves III, IV, and VI.
Anti-GQ1b antibodies have been shown to bind to fractions
of Campylobacter jejuni and Haemophilus influenzae and are
thought to cause the symptoms of MFS through molecular
mimicry.8
When antibody testing is negative in patients with MFS,
symptoms may be due to viral neurotropism rather than
immune-mediated
injury.9
The
functional
receptor
for
COVID-19 is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and is present
in neural tissue.4 Access to the CNS may be either hematoge-
nous or via retrograde neural propagation along bipolar cells.
Retrograde propagation along the olfactory pathway may
account for the occurrence of anosmia in some patients with
COVID-19.4 It has been proposed that retrograde propaga-
tion could lead to brain stem involvement and contribute to
respiratory symptoms by affecting the nuclei that regulate re-
spiratory rhythm such as chemoreceptors that detect changes
in oxygen and CO2.10 Understanding of COVID-19 patho-
physiology in the CNS and peripheral nervous system and its
contribution to morbidity and mortality is still in its infancy.
Whether MFS is the result of immune-mediated injury or vi-
ral neurotropism, this potential complication should be rec-
ognized by clinicians and radiologists so that appropriate
treatment can be offered to these symptomatic patients.

increased signal involving the nerve from the cavernous sinus through the orbit. Coronal T1-weighted fat-suppressed postcontrast image (C)
also shows an enlarged CN III within the proximal orbit (arrow) and demonstrates marked enhancement of the nerve. The abnormal nerve is
also visible on a whole-brain T2 FLAIR fat-suppressed postcontrast image (arrow, D).
