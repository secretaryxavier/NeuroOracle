A phenolic glycolipid was obtained in high amounts (2% of dry weight) from
Mycobacterium leprae isolated from infected armnadillo liver. Infrared and nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that it is closely related to "mycoside
A" from Mycobacterium kansasii and is therefore a glycosylphenolic phthiocerol
diester. The crucial difference between the two products is in the composition of
the
attached
trisaccharide.
Gas-liquid
chromatography-mass
spectroscopy
showed that the product from M. kansasii is composed of 2,4-di-0-methylrham-
nose, 2-0-methylrhamnose, and 2-0-methylfucose, whereas that from M. leprae
contains 2,3-di-0-methylrhamnose, 3-0-methylrhamnose, and 3,6-di-0-methyl-
glucose. The distinct composition of the oligosaccharide segment of the glycolipid
from M. leprae may make it useful for the chemical and serological differentiation
of this organism from other mycobacteria. Surprisingly large quantities (2.2 mg/
g of dry liver) of the glycolipid were also found in infected liver residue freed of
M. leprae, suggesting that it may be responsible for the electron-transparent
"foam" surrounding the organism in infected lepromatous tissue.
Until recently, research in leprosy has been
impeded by lack of adequate supplies of the
etiological agent, Mycobacterium leprae, be-
cause the organism is extremely fastidious and
incapable of growth in vitro. The only sources of
M. leprae previously available were from in-
fected human tissue and mouse foot pad tissue.
The recent availability of large amounts of M.
leprae-infected armadillo tissue provides an op-
portunity for expanded research. We are inter-
ested in the mechanism of pathogenesis of M.
leprae and in its antigenic composition. In par-
ticular, we seek species-specific antigens which
could be used for the development of diagnostic
skin tests and serological tests and in exploring
the disordered cellular immunity so character-
istic of some forms of leprosy.
Leprosy is the most serious of a variety of
diseases caused by nontuberculous (atypical)
mycobacteria. Recently, we characterized the
specific surface antigens of a host of atypical
mycobacteria as "C-mycosidic" glycopeptido-
lipids, composed of an invariant monoglycosyl-
peptidolipid "core" and a variable species- or
type-specific tri- or tetrasaccharide (6, 7; P. J.
Brennan, Rev. Infect. Dis., in press). Moreover,
the C-mycosidic antigens comprise the bulk of
the superficial cell wall sheath which surrounds
certain atypical mycobacteria and which appar-
ently shields them within phagolysosomes from
lysosomal
enzymes
(3).
This
information
prompted us to seek like substances and roles in
M. leprae. Indeed, we have reported that an
impure apolar lipid fraction from M. leprae
yielded distinct lines of precipitation with anti-
sera from lepromatous patients and from in-
fected armadillos and did not react with antisera
from patients with other mycobacterial infec-
tions (5). Characteristics of the lipid fraction
indicated that the active substance might be
related to the aromatic glycolipids of mycobac-
teria, the so-called "mycosides A," "B," and "G."
These were previously isolated from Mycobac-
terium kansasii (12), Mycobacterium bovis (9),
and Mycobacterium marinum (21), respectively.
These
are
glycosides
of
p-phenol
with
a
branched glycolic chain, the hydroxyl functions
of
which
are
esterified
with
normal
and
branched-chain fatty acids (13). They differ by
the nature and number of sugar molecules which
are linked to the phenolic hydroxyl group of the
aglycone. We now report on the isolation from
the serologically active lipid preparation derived
from M. leprae of a major glycolipid which con-
forms to the specificiations of a phenolic myco-
side, but in which the unique carbohydrate com-
position suggests the role of a species-specific
antigen. Moreover, the presence ofhigh amounts
of the glycolipid in the tissue surrounding the
bacilli implies a function in the mechanism of
the disease process. A brief abstract of this work
has appeared (S. W. Hunter and P. J. Brennan,

PHENOLIC GLYCOLIPID FROM M. LEPRAE

72nd Amer. Soc. Biol. Chem. Annu. Meet., St.
Louis, Mo., abstr. 34, 1981).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolation of M. leprae from infected armadillo
livers. Infected livers were obtained from W. F. Kir-
chheimer, U.S. Public Health Service Hospital, Car-
ville, La., through D. D. Gwinn, Leprosy Program
Officer, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases, National Institutes of Health. The armadil-
los used had been infected with either 103 or 105 bacilli
and sacrificed 1 to 3 years later (18, 25). The number
of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) per gram of liver ranged
between 1 x 109 and 9 x 10'0. Irradiated (2.5 Mrad)
livers (10 to 25 g) were homogenized in a solution
containing 0.135 M NaCl, 0.2 M Tris, 0.01 M MgSO4,
and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 10 min. The super-
natant fluid, which was devoid of AFB, was retained
and examined separately for the presence of the spe-
cific glycolipid. M. leprae was isolated from the 10,000
x g pellet by the gentle method of Draper (10). Re-
covery of bacilli was variable, e.g., 0.09% (dry weight
of bacilli/wet weight of liver) from a liver with an AFB
titer of 1.76 x 109, compared with 0.9% from a liver
with an AFB titer of 9.61 x 10'0.
Fractionation oflipids fromM. leprae and from
infected liver. M. leprae (50 to 100 mg, dry) was
extracted twice with 10 ml of CHC13-CH30H (2:1) at
50°C for 18 h. The dried lipids were applied to a
column (0.5 by 10 cm) of silicic acid (Mallinckrodt)-
Celite (Johns-Manville) (2:1) and eluted with CHC13
(10 ml) followed by 2% CH30H in CHC13. Infected
homogenized liver (10 g) was extracted by the Bligh-
Dyer monophasic extractant (4). The dried lipid ex-
tracts were triturated with distilled ether, and the
ether-soluble lipids were separated on silicic acid as
described above. Likewise, lipids from lyophilized
10,000 x g supernatant fluid (M. leprae free) from
homogenized infected liver were fractionated by dif-
ferential solubility in ether and by silicic acid column
chromatography. In each case, the lipids in the 2%
CH30H in CHC13 eluates were dissolved in hexane-
ether (1:1) and applied to other silicic acid columns
which were developed with hexane-ether (1:1), hex-
ane-ether (1:3), and ether. The latter fraction con-
tained the highly purified glycolipid. Removal of a
slight impurity was possible on account of its insolu-
bility in hexane (boiling point, 69°C).
Isolation of phenolic glycolipid (mycoside A)
from M. kansasiL M. kansasii grown on Middle-
brook's 7H11 medium was extracted with CHC13-
CH30H (2:1) as described previously (6). The lipid (3
g) from 21 g of dry cells was applied to a column (2.5
by 41 cm) of DEAE-cellulose (acetate) (6) in CHC13
and eluted with 300 ml of CHC13 followed by 300 ml of
10% CH30H in CHC13. Lipid from the mixed eluates
(1.7 g) was triturated with ether and the soluble lipids
(1 g) in hexane-ether (1:1) were applied to a column of
silicic acid-Celite (2.5 by 8 cm) which was irrigated
with 100 ml each of hexane-ether (1:1), hexane-ether
(1:3), and ether. The ether eluates contained only one
lipid (Rf of 0.4 in ether-acetone, 9:1) which showed an
infrared spectrum identical to that which has been
published for mycoside A (12). About 60 mg of the
pure lipid was recovered after these steps.
Analytical procedures. Thin-layer chromatogra-
phy was conducted on commercial silica gel G plates
from Fisher Corp., St. Louis, Mo. Glycolipids were
located with orcinol-H2SO4 as described previously (8).
For analysis of the sugar composition, glycolipids (1
mg) were hydrolyzed with 2 M trifluoroacetic acid and
converted to alditol acetates by reduction with sodium
borohydride followed by acetylation with acetic an-
hydride (1). Gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) of al-
ditol acetates was conducted on a column (180 by 0.2
cm) of 3% SP-2340 on 100- to 120-mesh Supelcoport
(Supelco, Inc.) as described previously (7). GLC-mass
spectroscopy of alditol acetates employed the same
column and a Finnigan quadrupol system (model 3200
E) coupled to a model 6000 data and graphic output
system. Structural assignments were partly based on
a comparison of fragmentation patterns with those of
Jansson et al. (16) and Brennan et al.
(6, 7). UV
absorption was measured with a Perkin-Elmer Cole-
man 124 double-beam spectrophotometer at a concen-
tration of 4 to 6 mg/ml of ethanol. Infrared absorption
was determined with a Beckman IR-4240 spectropho-
tometer at a concentration of 25 mg/ml of CC14. Nu-
clear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was
conducted at a concentration of 13.2 mg of glycolipid
per ml of CDCl3 on an NT-360 spectrometer. To
identify anomeric proton signals, glycolipids were first
treated with 10% KOH in benzene-methanol (1:2; re-
fluxing for 16 h) to dest-roy ester bonds, followed by 1
N methanolic-hydrochloric acid (refluxing for 5 h) to
cleave glycosidic links. The NMR spectra of the de-
graded lipids were then compared with those of the
native lipid.
The sources or synthesis of the authentic 0-methyl
sugars used for comparative purposes in this work
have been described previously (6, 7). 0-Methyl sugars
were demethylated by the highly sensitive procedure
described before (7).
RESULTS
Structure of the major lipid in the sero-
logically active lipid preparation from M.
leprae. Previously, we reported that serologi-
cally active lipid fractions from M. leprae con-
tained one major glycolipid component (5). In
the present work, this glycolipid, largely/free of
other lipids, was obtained by developing a silicic
acid column with 2% CH30H in CHC13 after first
charging the column with CHC13. The lipid was
purified by further column chromatography, us-
ing hexane-ether mixtures. It was compared with
the pure mycoside A obtained from M. kansasii
in like fashion. Both lipids appeared as white
solids readily soluble in such apolar solvents as
hexane and ether. On thin-layer plates (Fig. 1)
both gave an identical red-brown color response
to orcinol. However, they had markedly different
mobilities. Infrared spectra of the two (Fig. 2)
were almost identical, characterized by the ab-
sorption bands of an aromatic nucleus (1,510 and
1,605 cm-'), ester absorption at 1,725 cm-', and
hydroxyl group absorption at 3,400 cm-'. The

sas8iglycolipid. Plate was chromatographed in ether-
acetone (8:2), sprayed with 0.1% oreinolin 40% H2SO4,
and heated.
UV absorption spectra of the pure lipids from
both sources were also identical, with two very
strong peaks at 228 and 274 nm (with a shoulder
at 280 nm). A bathochromic shift and increase
in absorption was observed upon addition of 1 N
NaOH to ethanolic solutions ofboth glycolipids,
again indicating the presence of a phenolic
group.
The NMR spectra of the phenolic glycolipids
from M. leprae and M. kansasii were also com-
pared (Fig. 3). Both contained two doublets in
the low-field region 6.92 to 7.14 ppm character-
istic of a phenolic nucleus with its para position
linked to an aliphatic chain. A comparison ofthe
singlets and doublets in the range 3.30 to 3.70
ppm indicated that the glycolipids from M. lep-
rae and M. kansasii differ in their content of
-OCH3 groups. The singlet at 2.17 ppm from
the M. kansasii product pointed to the presence
of an acetyl substituent, probably attached to a
sugar moiety as in the case of the C-mycoside
antigens (3). The absence of such a signal in the
M. leprae lipid presumably indicates the lack of
sugar O-acetyl groups. There are other features
of similarity and similarity in the high-field
region (0.5 to 1.3 ppm) of the spectra which
further indicate that the product fromM. leprae
contains a phenolic, esterified, and methoxylated
glycol closely related but not identical to the
mycoside A from M. kansasii.
The most salient and important difference in
the NMR spectra ofthe glycolipids from the two
sources was in the mid-field region, 4.0 to 5.5
ppm, i.e., the region of anomeric and ester group
protons. The multiplet centered at about 4.80
ppm in both spectra was probably due to two
protons of the ester link (Fig. 3A). However,
other signals in the mid-field region differed. To
distinguish 1-proton anomeric signals from oth-
ers, both glycolipids were hydrolyzed with alkali
followed by acid, and the NMR spectra were
compared with those in Fig. 3. The ester proton
sigals had disappeared, but so also had those
at 4.10, 5.03, and 5.43 ppm for the M. kansasii
product and those at 4.24, ca. 4.42, and 5.45 ppm
for the M. leprae glycolipid. Clearly, signals
attributable to anomeric protons differed in the
two spectra. The origin of the common signal at
5.12 ppm is not yet known; it is stable to both
alkali and acid treatment.
To further emine the differences in ano-
meric proton signals, the sugars in the two gly-
colipids were compared by GLC of the alditol
acetates (Fig. 4). Both contained three sugars.
Those in the product from M. kansasii were
recognized as 2,4-di-O-methy1rhamnose, 2-0-
methylfucose,
and
2-O-methylrhamnose
by
GLC-mass spectroscopy and by cochromatog-
raphy with the derivatized standard sugars.
Thereby, the assigments already given to the
inherent sugars of mycoside A (12) were con-
firmed. Combined GLC-mass spectroscopy read-
ily identified the three sugars in the glycolipid
from M. leprae as a 2,3-di-O-methyl-6-deoxy-
hexose, a 3-0-methyl-6-deoxyhexose, and a 3,6-
di-0-methylhexose (Fig. 5). Demethylation of
the sugar mixture and GLC of the alditol ace-
tates, exactly as described previously (7), showed
that the parent sugars were rhamnose and glu-
cose. Hence, the three sugars in the M. keprae
glycolipid are 2,3-di-0-methylrhamnose, 3-0-
methylrhamnose, and 3,6-di-0-me'thylglucose.

leprae-free and detergent-free supernatant fluid
obtained from the first centrifugation of homog-
enized infected liver proved to be a very rich
source of the specific glycolipid (Table 1). Sep-
aration of this glycolipid from the plethora of
host armadillo lipids was readily accomplished
on account of its extreme apolarity; it was eluted
from silicic acid with ether, whereas chloroform
was required for removal of the earliest of the
host lipids. Of the 2.17 mg of glycolipid per g of
infected liver, 1.9 mg was not intimately associ-
ated with isolated-M. leprae, although, as ex-
pected, there was a much higher specific activity
in the organism than in infected liver (Table 1).
DISCUSSION
It is now clear that the outer surface of the
majority of mycobacteria is characterized by a
variety of rather exotic glycolipid antigens. To
date, we have recognized two distinct classes.
The best characterized of these are the C-my-
cosidic glycopeptidolipid antigens, present in all
serovars of the Mycobacterium avium-M. intra-
cellulare-M. scrofulaceum (MAIS) serocomplex
(6, 7) and which, in the form of a minicapsule,
confer smooth morphology on these bacteria
and, perhaps, resistance to phagocytosis (2, 3).
A second class, present in M. kansasii, M. szul-
gai, and others, consists of short oligosaccha-
rides with fatty acyl and amino acyl attachments
(P. J. Brennan, unpublished data). Both ofthese
groups of glycolipid antigens are the basis of the
famed Schaefer seroagglutination procedure (23,
24) for the identification and classification of
atypical mycobacteria.
Present and past (5) evidence suggests a third
class of mycobacterial glycolipid antigens, the
phenolic glycolipids. The occurrence of a phe-
nolic mycoside in M. leprae is not unexpected
since lipids of this class have been found in other
"typical" and "atypical" mycobacteria (9, 12,21)
and previous reports (5; Philip Draper, personal
communication) had suggested such an event.
The most interesting features of the present
work are the unique sugar composition of the
glycolipid and the fact that it is the major com-
ponent of serologically active lipid preparations.
However, we have not yet been able to unequiv-
ocally demonstrate that the pure glycolipid per
se is serologically active; only impure prepara-
tions in the presence of "carrier" lipids are con-
sistently active
(5). Apparently, the extreme
apolarity of the pure glycolipid interferes with
its proper presentation in an aqueous serological
assay. Other methods of presentation which
should diminish the effects of the long hydro-
carbon chains, such as incorporation of the gly-
colipid into liposomes (17), are now being con-
sidered. Also, as yet to be examined is the effi-
cacy of the glycolipid in eliciting cellular immu-
nity, the primary immunological response in
cases of tuberculoid leprosy. It is possible that
other lipids, present in small amounts, may be
the antigenic principals; we have observed in M.
,leprae and in the liver milieu small quantities of
more highly glycosylated phenolic lipids (S. W.

Hunter, M. L. Goldhahn, and P. J. Brennan,
unpublished data). Nevertheless, a comparison
of the major phenolic glycolipid from M. leprae
with the C-mycosidic glycolipids from the MAIS
complex indicates that the former has all of the
hallmarks ofa species-specific antigen or hapten.
For instance, the type-specific antigen of sero-
type (serovar) 2 (M. avium 2) of the MAIS,
complex also contains a unique 6-deoxyhexose-
containing trisaccharide (7; P. J. Brennan, L. A.
Hinton, and G. R. Gray, unpublished data).
There is little doubt that the combination of
sugars in the M. leprae product is unique. To
our knowledge, the presence of 3,6-di-0-meth-
ylglucose in nature has not previously been re-
ported, nor have we previously encountered 2,3-
di-O-methylrhamnosyl
and
3-0-methylrham-
nose in one oligosaccharide. Therefore, although

the serological activity of the glycolipid is still a
moot question, its unique thin-layer chromato-
graphic mobility and sugar composition provide
a chemical basis upon which M. leprae may be
differentiated from all other mycobacteria.
Perhaps the most striking feature of this gly-
colipid is the quantity of it in the isolated bacil-
lus (2% of the mass) and in the tissue environ
(2.2 mg/g). We feel that it must be responsible
for the so-called electron-transparent zone or
"foam," an ill-defined structure of low density
which surrounds the leprosy organism, particu-
larly in tuberculoid tissue (14, 15). There was
some indirect evidence based on staining prop-
erties (19) and solubility (11, 14) that the zone is
lipid in nature; Ratledge (20) and, to some ex-
tent, Barksdale and Kim (2) have consistently
referred to it as large and lipoidal. If this zone is
in fact composed of the phenolic glycolipid, the
inherent inertness of its structure would provide
