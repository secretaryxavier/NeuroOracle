Objective: To summarize existing knowledge about the characteristics of attention
problems secondary to traumatic brain injuries (TBI) of all severities in children.
Methods:
Computerized databases PubMed and PsychINFO and gray literature
sources were used to identify relevant studies. Search terms were selected to identify
original research examining new ADHD diagnosis or attention problems after TBI in
children. Studies were included if they investigated any severity of TBI, assessed attention
or ADHD after brain injury, investigated children as a primary or sub-analysis, and
controlled for or excluded participants with preinjury ADHD or attention problems.
Results:
Thirty-nine studies were included in the review. Studies examined the
prevalence of and risk factors for new attention problems and ADHD following TBI in
children as well as behavioral and neuropsychological factors associated with these
attention problems. Studies report a wide range of prevalence rates of new ADHD
diagnosis or attention problems after TBI. Evidence indicates that more severe injury,
injury in early childhood, or preinjury adaptive functioning problems, increases the risk
for new ADHD and attention problems after TBI and both sexes appear to be equally
vulnerable. Further, literature suggests that cases of new ADHD often co-occurs with
neuropsychiatric impairment in other domains. Identiﬁed gaps in our understanding
of new attention problems and ADHD include if mild TBI, the most common type of
injury, increases risk and what brain abnormalities are associated with the emergence of
these problems.
Conclusion:
This scoping review describes existing studies of new attention
problems and ADHD following TBI in children and highlights important risk factors and
comorbidities. Important future research directions are identiﬁed that will inform the extent
of this outcome across TBI severities, its neural basis and points of intervention to
minimize its impact.

ADHD After TBI in Children
INTRODUCTION
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of acquired
disability in children (1), and altogether accounts for over
700,000 emergency room visits annually in the United States
(2). Importantly, emergency room visits underreport the true
incidence of TBI as the majority of injuries are at the mild end
of the spectrum (referred to as mild TBI or concussion) and
children with mild injuries may seek medical attention from
family doctors, other medical professions or not at all. The high
prevalence of mild injuries is supported by surveys of high school
students in which one in ﬁve adolescents report a lifetime history
of concussion (3, 4).
TBI in children is associated with many diﬀerent types of
adverse outcomes as TBI to the developing brain impacts ongoing
developmental processes (5). These include behavioral (6) and
social problems (7), diﬃculties with academic achievement (8),
and persistent cognitive deﬁcits (9) that can occur across the
spectrum of severities. The literature suggests a dose-response
relationship between severity and outcome. Children with mild
TBI typically recover within a month of injury (10) and the
poorest outcomes, which may worsen over time, are seen in
severe TBI (11, 12). Attention problems in particular are thought
to be a common sequela of TBI (13). Attention supports higher
cognitive thinking, learning, and problem-solving, and attention
problems can negatively impact social interactions and the ability
to function well at home and in school (14, 15). Attention
problems that arise along with hyperactivity and impulsivity
after TBI may contribute to new diagnoses of attention deﬁcit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (16). The onset of ADHD
symptoms (inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity) after an
injury will hereafter referred to as secondary ADHD (SADHD)
to be consistent with the majority of the existing literature.
Importantly, the similarities and diﬀerences between primary
and SADHD in youth are not fully understood and may represent
very diﬀerent disorders. This scoping review endeavors to begin
to shed light on these diﬀerences by better characterizing SADHD
which may inform the need for updated nomenclature. Studies
have estimated that the rates of SADHD diagnoses may be as high
as 46% in children hospitalized for TBI (17). Importantly, ADHD
is also a risk factor for TBI (16), as children with ADHD are more
likely to be injured, so disentangling preexisting ADHD from
SADHD is important for understanding the etiology of attention
problems and ADHD in children with TBI.
We identiﬁed six existing systematic reviews that included
examinations of ADHD or attention problems after pediatric TBI
(18–23). Generally, these reviews report that attention problems
are among the most commonly reported problems in individuals
with a history of brain injury. However, none of the existing
reviews sought to explicitly characterize new attention problems
or SADHD by accounting for preinjury attention problems or
ADHD before the injury. Since the etiology of pre-existing
ADHD and SADHD are likely to be diﬀerent, assessing the
existing literature that addresses SADHD speciﬁcally is necessary
to guide future research that aims to determine its causes
and provide treatment. A recent meta-analysis took the crucial
step of controlling for or eliminating preinjury ADHD, but
exclusively investigates whether there is an association between
diagnosed ADHD and TBI (24). Given the dearth of synthesized
literature capturing new attention problems, deﬁned broadly,
this review sought to formally assess what research evidence
has been presented on the topic of attention problems that
emerge after TBI in the literature to date. Systematic reviews
and meta-analyses are important tools for addressing questions
of prevalence or risk factors, however they have a narrow scope.
Conversely, a scoping review framework was deemed most
appropriate to achieve the goal of charting the data according to
key general themes to identify knowledge gaps to guide focused
research questions moving forward.
Here we review and synthesize the literature on attention
problems acquired after TBI in children to summarize the
existing knowledge base, as well as to identify areas requiring
further research. We consider studies that examine attention
problems speciﬁcally as well as those that assess SADHD
diagnosis, though acknowledge that ADHD is a complex disorder
that also includes problems with impulsivity and hyperactivity.
Given the volume and scope of literature unearthed, extracted
data was organized into categories which summarized: the
prevalence of new attention problems and SADHD, injury
and non-injury factors associated with risk for developing new
attention problems as well as the behavioral presentation and
associated neuropsychological impairments.
METHODS
The approach for this scoping review was guided by a protocol
drafted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-analysis extension for scoping reviews
(PRISMA-ScR) (25). The protocol which is available via the
Open Science Framework (https://bit.ly/2YcIMYr) was submitted
for registration in December 2020 to ensure transparency. To
be included in the review, sources needed to formally assess
symptoms of ADHD or measure attention problems following
TBI in children (age 0–18 years).
We conducted a scoping review of scholarly and gray
literature. To identify potentially relevant scholarly studies,
PubMed and PsycINFO were searched from inception to June
2021. The ﬁnal search strategy used the following search terms to
search in title and abstract text in scholarly literature: “ADHD”
or “attention deﬁcit disorder” or “attention deﬁcit hyperactivity”
and “secondary” or “after” or “following” and “concussion” or
“concussions” or “concussive” or “TBI” or “TBIs” or “mTBI” or
“mTBIs” or “brain injury” or “brain injuries” or “brain damage”
or “head impacts” (see Appendix S1 for the search strategy
applied to PubMed). The study design ﬁlter was set to select
only peer-reviewed journal articles in the PsycINFO search. The
literature search was performed by SS, in consultation with AW.
The ﬁnal search results were exported into Zotero, before being
imported into Covidence where duplicates were removed.

association websites were sought to decrease publication bias,
and introduce alternative perspectives (26). Following the
identiﬁcation of relevant authorities these sources were searched
through targeted website searching. Where targeted website
searching turned up no sources advanced searching was applied
to search the websites of the relevant authorities. The gray
literature search applied the same search terms utilized for the
scholarly literature search.
The literature search was performed by SSt and AW. To
ensure consistency of screening 10 titles and abstracts were
selected at random, independently screened and results were
discussed to amend the screening protocol. All titles and abstracts
were subsequently evaluated. Literature was retained for full-text
search if it was: written in English, involved human participants,
presented primary research, investigated any severity of TBI,
assessed attention or ADHD after brain injury, and investigated
children as a primary or sub-analysis. We required that studies
controlled for or excluded participants with preinjury ADHD
or attention problems to isolate attention outcomes secondary
to TBI. Full texts of publications identiﬁed by the search
and screening were independently assessed and retained for
extraction if they contained the same features as were considered
for the title and abstract screening. Disagreements on study
selection were resolved by discussion if needed.
A data charting form was jointly developed by SSt and
AW to determine which variables to extract and piloted on
ﬁve randomly selected papers that passed full text screening.
The two reviewers then iteratively updated the data-charting
form to be applied to all eligible studies. Data charting was
performed by SSt and veriﬁed by AW for accuracy, and
inconsistencies were resolved through discussion. Speciﬁcally,
data was abstracted on the following study characteristics: study
design, study population, sample sizes, control groups, brain
injury characteristics, and contextual factors (i.e., injury severity,
age at injury, time since injury), how preinjury attention was
controlled for, and how attention was assessed. Additionally, we
abstracted data related to the following domains: prevalence,
risk factors, behavioral features (including comorbidities), and
neuropsychological characteristics associated with secondary
attention problems and ADHD. Attention problems were deﬁned
according to thresholds for clinical signiﬁcance in the individual
scales used in each publication. We then grouped studies by
the domain(s) of interest that they assessed and summarized the
results of those analyses within each study.
RESULTS
After duplicates were removed, a total of 557 citations were
identiﬁed from searches of electronic databases. Additionally,
675 citations were identiﬁed from searches of gray literature.
Based on title and abstract, 1,158 were excluded and 101 full-
text articles were retrieved and assessed for eligibility. Of these
13 were excluded for having no estimate of preinjury attention,
15 did not assess attention or ADHD, eight did not investigate
children, seven studies included children but did not report
results in children, six were not original research articles, seven
did not control or exclude for preinjury attention or ADHD, three
were excluded for assessing no ﬁelds of interest (prevalence, risk
factor, behavioral features, or neuropsychological impairment),
two did not investigate TBI, and three were excluded for being a
duplicate. The remaining 39 studies were included in this review
(Figure 1).
Study Characteristics
An overview of the characteristics of each of the 39 studies is
provided in Table 1. All 39 studies were derived from scholarly
literature while no material from the gray literature search
survived abstract and full text screening. Of the 39 studies more
than half, 24, were prospective cohort studies of which two
were birth cohorts. Twelve of the studies were retrospective
studies, eight were cross-sectional, two were population cohorts,
and two were chart reviews. Two studies combined prospective
and retrospective cohorts. The majority of the studies (25)
examined youth across the spectrum of TBI severity: mild,
moderate, and severe TBI. Of these studies, ﬁve restricted the
mild cases in their sample to those that were classiﬁed as
“complicated mild,” meaning that there were positive ﬁndings
on clinical neuroimaging assessments. Six studies included only
moderate and severe cases of TBI, two included only severe
TBI, and six included only mild TBI, including one that was a
sample of children with a concussion. Nineteen studies included
only youth with TBI whereas 20 studies also had a non-TBI
comparison group, 10 were orthopedic injury controls and 10
had comparison groups that did not have a TBI. The range
in age of injury of the subjects in each sample varied with
more representation of older children and adolescents than
younger children; only six studies included children injured
in the ﬁrst 3 years of life whereas 10 studies included older
adolescents, age 16–18. The longest post-injury assessment time
points in the studies ranged from 3 months to 20 years with
six studies assessing youth less than a year after their injury,
nine between 1 and 2 years, 11 between 2 and 5 years, nine
between 5 and 10 years, and four longer than 10 years post-
injury. The majority of study samples were hospitalized youth
(27), whereas one study recruited only youth who visited the
emergency department, three were recruited from TBI clinics
and ﬁve studies included youth recruited from a combination
of these settings. Only three studies examined population-based
samples. Approximately half of the studies (20) assessed ADHD
diagnosis as the attention outcome, whereas eight studies used
an attention problem scale, and ﬁve studies used an attention
task. Six studies used a combination of diagnosis, symptoms,
scales, and tasks to assess attention. As this review includes only
studies that assessed ADHD that is secondary to a TBI, studies
used diﬀerent approaches to account for preinjury attention.
The majority of the studies (22) excluded youth with pre-injury
(i.e., primary) diagnoses of ADHD. Eleven studies controlled
for preinjury attention by including a retrospective assessment
as a covariate in their statistical models, four studies examined
youth with primary ADHD separately and two studies were
birth cohorts which allowed them to establish the emergence of
attention problems after injury in early childhood.

FIGURE 1 | Flowchart article selection procedure.
Prevalence of ADHD and Attention
Problems Following TBI
We consider studies that examine attention problems speciﬁcally
as well as those that assess SADHD. Eighteen studies reported
the prevalence of SADHD after TBI and these are reported at
the longest measured timepoint for each study in Table 2. Two
studies reported the prevalence of new attention problems after
TBI and these are reported hereafter.
Two of these studies reported prevalence at diﬀerent time
points post-injury from an overlapping sample (27, 49) and two
studies reported a breakdown of prevalence by injury severity
(42, 48) in samples that overlapped with samples from studies
where they reported the prevalence for all severities (17, 27, 49).
Nine studies included a control comparison group that allowed
for statistical comparisons. In studies that examined the full range
of TBI severity the prevalence of ADHD diagnosis after TBI
ranged from 5 to 53%. Prevalence was lowest in population-based
studies (29, 59), though notably, these rates were statistically
higher than controls in those studies. Prevalence was highest
in the one study that recruited from a TBI clinic, 53% (45).
Prevalence ranged from 11 to 46% in hospitalized samples. Four
studies examined either mild TBI only or reported prevalence in
mild TBI speciﬁcally. A study in a concussion sample reported no
new ADHD post injury (57), whereas, a prospective birth cohort
of children who had sustained a mild injury in early childhood,
reported that 11% of children who had been outpatients and
21% of children who had been inpatients at the time of injury
were diagnosed with ADHD by mid-adolescence compared to
6% of children with no TBI (43). A mixed retrospective and
prospective study reported that 10% of subjects with mild TBI
developed ADHD compared to 5% of subjects with orthopedic
injury (48) whereas a study in younger children reported 33% of
subjects with complicated mild TBI developed ADHD compared
to 15% of subjects with orthopedic injury (42). The same two
studies reported prevalence of moderate TBI as 12% and severe
TBI as 38% compared to 5% in orthopedic injury (48) in the
ﬁrst study, and 30% in moderate TBI and 62% in severe TBI
compared to 15% in orthopedic injury (42) in the second study.
Two studies examined severe TBI exclusively reporting 9% (33)
and 17% (36) prevalence. Where statistical comparisons were
possible the prevalence of SADHD after severe TBI was always
signiﬁcantly higher than the controls (28, 42, 48, 58), whereas
this was not always the case for mild and moderate TBI (42, 48).

youth with moderate and severe TBI and reported clinically
signiﬁcant attention problems after severe injury (32 and 46%,
respectively) compared to orthopedic injury controls (7 and
26%, respectively).
Risk Factors
Twenty-ﬁve studies examined risk factors associated with
children developing ADHD or new attention problems after
TBI. We separated risk factors into injury-related and non-injury
related and have summarized the signiﬁcant and non-signiﬁcant
factors in Table 3.
Injury Factors Associated With ADHD and
Attention Problems Following TBI
As suggested by the prevalence rates grouped by severity,
studies that examined severity as a moderating factor sometimes
reported that increased severity based on grouping (mild,
moderate, and severe) or Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), an index
of severity based on the level of consciousness after an injury,
was associated with higher rates of ADHD diagnosis or attention
problems. However, an equal number of studies found that
severity/GCS was not associated with SADHD or attention
problems. Two studies examined the impact of having more than
one injury and reported that this was associated with increased
attention problems or SADHD diagnosis (51, 59). Only one study
examined the loss of consciousness, reporting that increased time
spent unconscious after the injury was associated with developing
ADHD (48). Two prospective cohort studies with similar design
reported an association between time since injury and attention
problems, however with opposite directions of eﬀect (30, 31).
Two retrospective studies that assessed children many years after
injury reported no eﬀect of time since injury suggesting that
attention problems do not get worse or improve over time after
injury (38, 41).
The ability of neuroimaging to predict risk for subsequent
new attention problems was investigated in several studies. Acute
imaging with computerized tomography (CT) is common after
injury and in their population study. Yang et al. (29) found
that contusion and subdural hemorrhage, but not other types
of hemorrhage or skull fracture were associated with subsequent
ADHD diagnosis. A study by Max et al. (45) measured 2 frontal
ratios and reported that bicaudate ratio, indicative of ventricular
compression, was associated with attention problems when
measured 6 and 12 months after injury but not at 3 months and
2 years post-injury. Another prospective cohort study by Max
and colleagues employed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

and demonstrated that lesions in the orbital frontal cortex 6
months after injury and the cerebellum 6–12 months after injury
were associated with SADHD. However, these ﬁndings did not
hold for the other time points examined and there were no
relationships between lesions in other regions and SADHD (27).
Another MRI study by Gerring et al. (56) found an association
between lesions in the thalamus and basal ganglia 3 months
after injury and SADHD, but no association with lesions in the
frontal cortex. Power et al. (39) examined MRIs 5 years after
injury and noted no relationship between cerebellar lesions or
the location and severity of cerebral lesions and performance
on attention tasks. Similarly, Anderson et al. (63) noted that
there were no signiﬁcant relationships between lesion site and
attentional impairment after injury in a preschool-aged sample.
Non-injury Factors Associated With ADHD
and Attention Problems Following TBI
Most studies reported the inﬂuence of the age at the time of
injury on the subsequent diagnosis of ADHD or new attention
problems. For the most part, these studies did not report
signiﬁcant eﬀects, however, the four studies that did report that
younger children were at increased risk of attention problems
were those that included the youngest children in their samples
(29, 54, 59, 63). Of the 12 studies that examined sex as a possible
risk factor all but one reported that there was no increased risk
for attention problems for males or females (27, 30, 36, 38, 40–
42, 46, 48, 49, 52). The study that did report an eﬀect found
that female sex increased the risk for attention problems (54).
An equal number of studies found that socioeconomic status
was a signiﬁcant (27, 49, 52) or non-signiﬁcant (36, 40, 45, 48)
risk factor for new ADHD or attention problems. Worse family
functioning was sometime (42, 45, 48) but not always (27, 32, 46,
49, 54) shown to be associated with ADHD or more attention
problems. Wade et al. (32), assessed aspects of family function
and reported that in severe but not moderate TBI more baseline
parental negativity and less parental warmth and responsiveness
were associated with more attention problems. The population
study by Chang et al. (59) found that low birth weight but no
other perinatal or birth factors increased the risk of developing
ADHD after TBI. Studies that examined family psychiatric
history (27, 45, 48, 49) or baseline IQ (32, 40, 46) did not
ﬁnd associations with subsequent attention problems following
TBI. Lower preinjury adaptive functioning was reported as a
signiﬁcant factor in 3 out of 4 studies that assessed it (27, 31,
49, 63). Greater preinjury behavior problems (38, 63), as well as
preinjury attention problems (28, 58) speciﬁcally in severe TBI,
were consistently associated with secondary attention problems.
Behavioral Features Associated With
ADHD and Attention Problems Following
TBI
Thirteen studies reported behavioral features of SADHD,
though ﬁve of these studies examined overlapping samples.
These behavioral features are summarized in Table 4. All
studies were prospective cohort studies of hospitalized samples.
Two studies described inattention as the predominant feature
of SADHD. One study noted that the inattention but not
hyperactivity/impulsivity subscales of the Conners-3 ADHD
scale increased pre to post injury (30) and another reported

ADHD After TBI in Children
the inattentive ADHD subtype was the most common while
hyperactive symptoms declined over time in children with
SADHD (52). Children with SADHD were reported to have
reduced communication skills and socialization skills compared
to children that did not develop SADHD as well as children
with primary ADHD. However, ratings of daily living skills were
not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent between groups (40). In line with this
study, another study also found that SADHD was associated
with reduced adaptive functioning as well as intellectual function
relative to children who did not develop ADHD after injury
(48). Another study found that SADHD was associated with
worse functional impairment and behavioral regulation but not
metacognition in comparison with children with TBI that do not
develop ADHD, as well as children with an orthopedic injury
that develop SADHD (17). The emergence of SADHD has also
been associated with co-occurring novel psychiatric problems
including oppositional deﬁant disorder and conduct disorder (27,
45, 49), and aﬀective lability (27, 33, 47–50). In the same sample,
SADHD did not co-occur with new-onset anxiety disorders but
did co-occur with new-onset depressive disorders at a 1 yr but
not 6 mo or 2 years post injury (27, 49).
Neuropsychological Impairments
Unsurprisingly tests of attention revealed impaired function
after TBI. One study found impaired selective attention after
mild TBI (61), another found impaired focused attention after
severe but not moderate TBI compared to controls (28) and
two studies found that children with severe TBI perform more
poorly than mild to moderate groups on a sustained attention
task (60, 63). Children with SADHD performed worse on a
divided attention task compared to children who did not develop
ADHD after an injury as well as those that had primary ADHD
(40). Though children with TBI were found to have deﬁcits in
inhibitory control processing in the stop-task similar to children
with primary ADHD (53), there is mixed evidence as to if
children with SADHD are especially impaired (37, 38, 40, 41, 53).
New post-injury attention problems in children were associated
with poorer verbal learning (35), short term memory (36),
and working memory as well as planning ability (40). These
neuropsychological impairments are summarized in Table 5.
DISCUSSION
This scoping review summarized the state of the literature
that assesses new-onset ADHD and attention problems that
emerge after TBI in children and adolescents. Identiﬁed
literature was organized into the following conceptual domains:
prevalence, risk factors (divided into injury-related and non-
injury related factors), associated behavioral features, and
neuropsychological impairments.
The ﬁndings from the scoping review supports the increased
prevalence of new clinically signiﬁcant attention problems
and SADHD following injury in severe TBI (28, 42, 48, 58),
consistent with a recent meta-analysis of SADHD (24). The

ADHD After TBI in Children
review also supports that there is a higher risk of new attention
problems and SADHD in children and youth with low preinjury
adaptive functioning (27, 31, 49, 63), and when the injury
occurs in early childhood (<7 years of age at time of injury)
(29, 42, 54, 59, 63). Evidence suggests that both sexes are
equally vulnerable (27, 30, 36, 38, 40–42, 46, 48, 49, 52),
and poor family functioning was sometimes (42, 45, 48) but
not always (27, 32, 46, 49, 54) a risk factor for SADHD
and new attention problems. These conclusions are supported
by a recent review that speciﬁcally examined biopsychosocial
factors associated with attention problems in youth with TBI
(23). Due to the lack of topical limitation of a scoping review
framework the current review also found evidence to support
that commonly concurrent neuropsychological characteristics
and behavioral presentation include: (1) co-occurring novel
psychiatric problems including ODD, CD (27, 45, 49), and
aﬀective lability (27, 33, 47–50), (2) and reductions in
daily functioning (communication, socialization, and adaptive
functioning) (17, 40, 48). Furthermore, this scoping review
identiﬁed mixed evidence as to: (1) the prevalence of new
attention problems in mild TBI, (2) if children with SADHD
are especially neuropsychologically impaired (37, 38, 40, 41,
53), (3) the predominant class of attentional impairment in
youth with TBI due to inconsistent outcome measures (28, 60,
63), and (4) the role of brain lesions in attention problems
after injury.
A wide range of prevalences were reported for SADHD and
new attention problems after TBI which is likely inﬂuenced
by the presence of identiﬁed risk factors in diﬀerent study
samples. Evidence from identiﬁed studies suggests that new
attention problems and ADHD diagnoses may be more common
when the injury occurs in early childhood (29, 42, 54, 59, 63).
Children injured in early childhood may be most vulnerable to
developing new attention problems after injury. This may be
due to damage to brain circuitry that is responsible for basic
attentional processes in early development or injury that prevents
the future proper development of later maturing attentional
processes (65, 66). Experiencing multiple injuries was associated
with elevated risk for attention problems in the two reviewed
studies that examined this and it should be an area for further
study given that repeat injuries are common in children who
play sports.
Though the prevalence of primary (i.e., developmental)
ADHD is higher in males than females [3:1 (67)] this does
not appear to be the case for ADHD secondary to TBI
as the majority of studies reported no inﬂuence of sex.
There is a need for additional research to determine the
circumstances when mild TBI is a risk factor for secondary
attention problems and ADHD as prevalence reported in
these subjects was particularly varied. The majority of the
reviewed studies included hospitalized children suggesting that
they included more severe forms of mild TBI or children
who suﬀered from other extensive injuries. This points to an
underrepresentation of mild cases that are representative of
typical mild cases of TBI that are seen in an emergency room,
assessed by their general practitioner, or who receive no initial
medical attention.
Studies that examined whether speciﬁc types of brain
pathology detected with brain imaging are associated with new
attention problems are diﬃcult to synthesize due to their varied
methodology. Speciﬁcally, the ability to meaningfully consider
risk factors identiﬁed through neuroimaging is confounded by
diﬀering imaging modalities, time since injury, the severity
of the injury, and population type in the identiﬁed studies.
Some evidence supports the usefulness of imaging performed
acutely after injury to inform the child’s outcome including
attention problems (27, 49, 56). However, one study reported
acute imaging as a non-signiﬁcant risk factor (48) and all positive
studies were in hospitalized youth which brings into question
the generalizability to those with mild injury. Currently, CT is
most often performed to assess hematomas, brain swelling, and
skull fracture though it is not recommended for mild injury to
avoid unnecessary radiation exposure in children. MRI, which
does not involve radiation, is more sensitive to certain types
of pathology such as microhemorrhage, contusion, and gliosis,
as well as axonal injury. MRI may be a more sensitive tool
for prognosis through the detection of brain changes after TBI.
However, there is currently no agreed-upon schema for coding
of MRI ﬁndings used in clinical practice. It may be the case that
diﬀuse axonal injury (68, 69), known to result from TBI, disrupts
the functional integrity of widely distributed neural pathways
that are involved in attention processes (70) and is associated with
new attention problems, but this has not been assessed. Advanced
MRI methods such as diﬀusion-weighted imaging that is sensitive
to microscopic injury in the brain would be suitable diﬀuse
axonal injury in attention circuits in future studies. Similarly, we
did not identify any existing studies that use functional imaging
(EEG, MEG, or fMRI) to examine circuit functional alterations
that may predict new attention problems after injury.
Some studies include a comparison group with primary
ADHD which could be informative for distinguishing related
factors and may have implications for how the ADHD
is managed. Whether SADHD mimics the primary ADHD
endophenotype or not may inform whether these are separate
disorders with diﬀerent underlying mechanisms. The studies
reviewed here demonstrated no associations between risk for
secondary attention problems and family psychiatric history,
unlike primary ADHD (71). This is consistent with a lack of a
genetic association seen between genetic risk variants associated
with primary ADHD and ADHD associated with TBI (72). The
reviewed studies suggest that SADHD is associated with more
debilitating outcomes (i.e., comorbid disorders, behavioral and
functional impairments, and cognitive impairment) in some
cases compared to primary ADHD. Of note treatment studies
reviewed elsewhere suggest that treatment approaches that are
beneﬁcial for primary ADHD in children, methylphenidate,
in particular, are also beneﬁcial for treating SADHD (21,
22). Together these studies suggest that although attention

ADHD After TBI in Children
similar study variables and outcomes which supports calls for the
collection of TBI common data elements across all methodologies
to more easily compare studies and draw conclusions (73).
In this review, attention was assessed via diagnosis of ADHD
as well as measures of attention (questionnaire and objective).
The criteria for diagnosis are discrete, while measurements of
self or parent-reported attention problems are heterogeneous
in terms of their interpretation and reliability. This imposes
limitations on the ability to characterize attention problems
following TBI since the threshold on labeling behaviors as
pathological is likely inconsistent. Another important source of
methodological heterogeneity was that only half of the studies
examined included a non-TBI comparison group, and half of
these were an orthopedic injury group. The selection of an
appropriate non-TBI comparison group controls for factors
that predispose children to injury and are associated with the
injury and recovery process. These factors are important to
consider as they may inﬂuence the detection of the emergence
of attention problems after TBI in children. Importantly, this
review sought to explicitly examine new attention problems and
SADHD however retrospective recall of preinjury functioning
is potentially confounded. Recall can be heavily inﬂuenced by
retrospective biases (26). Additionally, as per scoping review
methodology, the quality of the included studies was not assessed.
Therefore, there is a potential risk of bias inherent from included
studies with potentially low-quality methodological design which
limits the interpretations that can be made from this review.
Finally, due to the large age range included in the majority of
identiﬁed studies we were not able to break down the results by
restricted age cohorts in order to identify age as a moderating
factor between studies.
In summary, this scoping review synthesized a sizable body of
evidence about the eﬀects of TBI in childhood and adolescence
on the emergence of new ADHD and attention problems.
The results suggest that children that experience TBI are at
increased risk for SADHD and new attention problems and
that several injury and non-injury factors such as severity, the
number of injuries, and age at injury may predict this risk.
However, the evidence in some areas is lacking. This review
identiﬁed that younger age of injury was a risk factor for new
attention problems or SADHD within studies that included the
youngest children (<7 years), however most studies included
children across a large age range. Future studies should examine
new attention problems in more restricted age cohorts that
are expected to diﬀer in their recovery from TBI due to
many important neurodevelopmental changes take place across
childhood. At the severe end of the TBI spectrum where the
association with an increased risk for attention problems and
SADHD is noted in this review and elsewhere (24) future
clinical intervention studies can consider exploring psychosocial
factors identiﬁed in this review. For example, interventions
focused on family functioning and parental style, which have
been associated with more attention problems (42, 45, 48), may
prevent or attenuate the development of attention problems
following injury. As even subclinical attention problems can
aﬀect learning and socializing in children the ﬁeld would beneﬁt
from large studies of representative mild and moderate cases of
TBI that measure attention problems dimensionally. These future
studies should control for dimensional measures of preinjury
attention problems and include appropriate control groups to
understand the true risk for new attention problems following
mild TBI. Further, longitudinal studies of representative cases will
allow for the investigation of prevalence at various timepoints
following injury to establish how often and in whom this type
of impairment persists. Across severities a deeper understanding
of the etiology of new attention problems and SADHD following
brain injury can be achieved from the integration of advanced
brain imaging. Functional and structural neuroimaging studies
can shed light on the speciﬁc circuits that are disrupted by injury
and cause attention problems. In addition to determining if or
when mild TBI promotes new attention problems in children,
these studies will be able to inform the mechanism by which
these attention diﬃculties emerge and potentially distinguish
them from the large existing body of literature on primary ADHD
(74, 75). Evidence for prevalence, risk factors and characteristics
of attention problems that develop after pediatric TBI is of
interest to scientists as further understanding of the unique
etiology of secondary attention problems will lead to knowledge
of the mechanisms of symptom generation. This information
may eventually be relevant to clinicians who treat these patients
as this knowledge can aid the detection of attention problems and
inform its management.
