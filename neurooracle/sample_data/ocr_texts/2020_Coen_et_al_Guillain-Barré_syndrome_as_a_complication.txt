Since January 2020 Elsevier has created a COVID-19 resource centre with 
free information in English and Mandarin on the novel coronavirus COVID-
19. The COVID-19 resource centre is hosted on Elsevier Connect, the 
company's public news and information website. 
 
Elsevier hereby grants permission to make all its COVID-19-related 
research that is available on the COVID-19 resource centre - including this 
research content - immediately available in PubMed Central and other 
publicly funded repositories, such as the WHO COVID database with rights 
for unrestricted research re-use and analyses in any form or by any means 
with acknowledgement of the original source. These permissions are 
granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID-19 resource centre 
remains active.

Guillain-Barré syndrome as a complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection
A
man
in
his
seventies
was
hospitalized
because
of
paraparesis,
distal allodynia, diﬃculties in voiding and constipation. Ten days be-
fore he developed myalgia, fatigue, and a dry cough. He was diagnosed
with
an
oligosymptomatic
coronavirus
disease
2019
(COVID-19)
[po-
sitive
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus
2
(SARS-CoV-2)
RT-PCR
in
two
nasopharyngeal
(NP)
swab].
At
day
25
from
RT-PCR,
serum
anti-SARS-CoV-2
IgA
and
IgG
ELISA
(Euroimmun,
Seekamp,
Germany) resulted positive. Figure shows a timeline of the main events
(Fig. 1).
The patient had no medical history. Vital signs were normal. Physical
examination
revealed
ﬁne
crackles
in
the
left
base,
bilateral
lower limb
ﬂaccid paresis, absent deep tendon reﬂexes of the upper and lower limb and
idiomuscular
response
to
percussion
of
the
muscle
tibialis
anterior,
in-
diﬀerent
plantar reﬂexes. There
was no sensory deﬁcit.
Blood tests
were
normal. Cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) analysis showed albuminocytologic dis-
sociation
without
intrathecal
IgG
synthesis.
FilmArray
Meningitis/
Encephalitis (ME) Panel testing (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT) and
SARS-CoV-2
RT-PCR
were
negative;
antiganglioside
antibodies
were
not
detected. Chest X-ray was normal. Contrast-enhanced MRI excluded mye-
lopathy.
Nerve
conduction
study showed
sensorimotor
demyelinating
polyneuropathy with
“sural
sparing
pattern”;
F
wave
study
showed de-
creased persistence or absent F-waves in tested nerves.
Findings
were
compatible
with
an
acute inﬂammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy,
the
most
common
subtype
of
Guillain-Barré
Syndrome
(GBS).
On
the
day
following
admission
the
patient
was
started
on
in-
travenous
immunoglobulins
(IVIg;
IgPro10,
Privigen®;
0.4
g/kg/day for
5
days).
Improvement
was
rapid.
At
day
eleven
from
hospitalisation
the
patient was transferred to the Division of Neurorehabilitation.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus ﬁrst detected in Wuhan, Hubei
province, China, in late 2019 and the etiologic agent of COVID-19 (Zhu
et al., 2020). It belongs to the genus β-coronavirus, like HCoV-OC43 and
HCoV-HKU1
(responsible
of
mild
upper
respiratory
tract
infections),
and
MERS-CoV
and
SARS-CoV
[the
agents
of
the
Middle
East
Re-
spiratory Syndrome (MERS) and of the SARS, respectively] (Fehr and
Perlman,
2015).
GBS
is
an
acute,
immune-mediated,
typically
post-
infectious polyneuropathy. Its main manifestations are progressive bi-
lateral
weakness
of
arms
and
legs
and
hyporeﬂexia/areﬂexia
in
the
aﬀected
limbs.
Dysautonomia
(including
bowel
and
bladder
dysfunc-
tion) is common (Leonhard et al., 2019).
Our
patient
had
a
classic
presentation
of
GBS.
He
tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2 before the ﬁrst signs of polyneuropathy, thus
supporting a postinfectious GBD phenotype.
Before
the
SARS-CoV-2
pandemic,
only
two
cases
of
coronavirus-
associated GBS were reported in the literature: a man with MERS-CoV
who
developed
Bickerstaﬀ
brainstem
encephalitis
(a
variant
of
GBS)
(Kim et
al., 2017),
and a boy who developed an atypical
GBS after
a
respiratory infections sustained by HCoV-OC43 (Sharma et al., 2019).
Up
to
now,
two
paper
have
described
a
possible
association
between
SARS-CoV-2 and GBS (Zhao et al., 2020; Toscano et al., 2020).
We describe one of the ﬁrst cases of GBS occurring in the context of
SARS-CoV-2
infection.
In
the
context of
the
current
pandemic,
clin-
icians should be aware that GBS can complicate SARS-CoV-2 infection

patient’s
outcomes,
thus
requiring
a
prompt
intervention.
Moreover, physician should remember that that the incidence of GBS
during outbreaks of infectious disease can increase (as with the recent
Zika
virus
epidemic)
(Leung,
2020).
To
note,
although
neurological
manifestation in COVID-19 are frequently described (like in the recent
case
report
by
Ye
et
al.
(2020),
the
neuroinvasive potential of SARS-
CoV-2 remains hitherto inexplored (Wu et al., 2020).
