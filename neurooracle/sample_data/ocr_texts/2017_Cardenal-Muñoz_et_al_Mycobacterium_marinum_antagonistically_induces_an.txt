Abstract
Autophagy is a eukaryotic catabolic process also participating in cell-autonomous defence.
Infected host cells generate double-membrane autophagosomes that mature in autolyso-
somes to engulf, kill and digest cytoplasmic pathogens. However, several bacteria subvert
autophagy and benefit from its machinery and functions. Monitoring infection stages by
genetics, pharmacology and microscopy, we demonstrate that the ESX-1 secretion system
of Mycobacterium marinum, a close relative to M. tuberculosis, upregulates the transcription
of autophagy genes, and stimulates autophagosome formation and recruitment to the myco-
bacteria-containing vacuole (MCV) in the host model organism Dictyostelium. Antagonisti-
cally, ESX-1 is also essential to block the autophagic flux and deplete the MCV of proteolytic
activity. Activators of the TORC1 complex localize to the MCV in an ESX-1-dependent man-
ner, suggesting an important role in the manipulation of autophagy by mycobacteria. Our
findings suggest that the infection by M. marinum activates an autophagic response that is
simultaneously repressed and exploited by the bacterium to support its survival inside the
MCV.
Author summary
One of the cell-autonomous defence pathways against intracellular pathogens is autop-
hagy, an ancestral eukaryotic process surprisingly conserved throughout evolution. Recent
studies have highlighted contradictory roles for autophagy during mycobacterial infec-
tion. Whereas some studies revealed a role for autophagy to control intracellular bacterial
growth, others brought evidence that mycobacteria somehow inhibit autophagic killing.
Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Mycobacterium marinum induces both an

early autophagic response and its simultaneous repression by blocking the autophagic
digestion. This antagonistic manipulation of autophagy is dependent on a functional
ESX-1-secretion system, which secretes the membrane-damaging factor ESAT-6, pro-
posed to participate in the perforation of the M. marinum-containing vacuole (MCV). We
show here that these membrane damages activate the formation of autophagosomes and
their recruitment to the MCV. However, M. marinum also utilizes its ESX-1 secretion sys-
tem to avoid killing inside autolysosomes by blocking the autophagic flux. In addition, we
bring evidence that this manipulation of autophagy is orchestrated via the regulation of
TORC1, the major eukaryotic kinase complex controlling nutrient-sensing and cell
metabolism.
Introduction
Autophagy is one of the most ancestral and important catabolic pathways in eukaryotes.
Under stresses such as oxidative stress, nutrient starvation, accumulation of toxic protein
aggregates or DNA and organelles damage, cells turn on a complex machinery to maintain
their homeostasis. One of the main protein complexes regulating autophagy is TORC1 (target
of rapamycin complex 1), which comprises the serine/threonine kinase TOR that coordinates
cell growth and metabolism [1]. Under optimal conditions, TORC1 suppresses autophagy,
while promoting growth via increased ribosome biogenesis and protein translation. However,
upon stress, TORC1 activity is repressed and autophagy generates nutrients and energy to
maintain essential activities [2]. When TORC1 is inhibited, the Atg1/ULK1 kinase complex
activates and promotes the recruitment of Atg8/LC3 and Atg18/WIPI-2 to autophagosome
formation sites (next to the vacuole in yeasts, and at multiple locations in mammalian cells
and the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum) [3]. Atg8 is lipidated and incorporated into both
the external and internal sides of the phagophore membrane, facilitating its expansion and
engulfment of cytoplasmic material into a double-membrane vesicle termed autophagosome.
After fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, the sequestered material is digested and
recycled into new macromolecules [4].
As a degradation pathway, autophagy can also operate as an innate immune response against
intracellular pathogens, specifically coined "xenophagy". The pathogen or the damaged cellular
components activate autophagy, causing the capture and digestion of the invader [5]. Neverthe-
less, some microbes exploit the autophagic machinery to their own benefit, such as Francisella
tularensis or Staphylococcus aureus, which use autophagy to support their intracellular growth
[6, 7]. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major threat to human health and causative agent of tuber-
culosis, survives in host cells by arresting phagosome maturation [8]. M. tuberculosis can escape
into the host cytosol by damaging the membrane of its containing compartment [9, 10]. Autop-
hagy, shown to be induced by M. tuberculosis infection, controls mycobacterial growth in host
cells [11, 12]. However, these bacteria also harbour several lipidic and proteinic virulence factors
such as lipoarabinomannan (LAM), PDIMs, Eis, Rv3242c, Rv3167c, SapM, PhoP and the type
VII secretion system ESX-1, to inhibit killing by autophagy [13–19].
The role of the ESX-1 secretion system in the regulation of autophagy has also been studied
during Mycobacterium marinum infection. M. marinum is a close relative of M. tuberculosis
that naturally infects fish and frogs and produces skin lesions in humans [20]. Its conserved
ESX-1 secretion system is essential for its escape from the mycobacteria-containing vacuole
(MCV) and induction of an autophagic response in the host [21, 22]. However, whether M.
marinum ESX-1 is also involved in the inhibition of the autophagic flux, as described for M.

tuberculosis, remains unexplored. Here, by using D. discoideum/M. marinum as a model sys-
tem to study mycobacterial infections, we demonstrate for the first time that M. marinum
induces both an early autophagic response and its simultaneous repression by blocking the
autophagic flux. This antagonistic manipulation of autophagy is dependent on its ESX-1-secre-
tion system.
Free-living D. discoideum is a biochemically and genetically tractable amoeba that phagocy-
toses bacteria and yeasts for food. It possesses a simplified and well-conserved cell-intrinsic
immune system, making this professional phagocyte a powerful model to study host cell
responses during bacterial infection [23]. Most mammalian autophagy genes are conserved in
D. discoideum, permitting the use of this amoeba to uncover the mechanisms of xenophagy
against a variety of pathogens [24]. For instance, we have shown that after escape to the cytosol
M. marinum recruits the autophagic machinery to egress from D. discoideum in non-lytic
manner [25]. Here, we reveal the kinetics of the D. discoideum xenophagic response to M. mar-
inum and show that these virulent mycobacteria induce autophagy at the level of gene tran-
scription, autophagosome formation and recruitment to the MCV, while blocking the
autophagic flux in an ESX-1- and TORC1-dependent manner.
Results
M. marinum induces an early autophagic response in D. discoideum
Autophagy is highly dynamic in D. discoideum, as evidenced by the rapid flow of GFP-Atg8+
autophagosomes from formation to degradation, and the fusion events, which occur in 1–3
min (S1A–S1C Fig). Thus, the average number of autophagosomes at steady state can be as
low as one (Fig 1A and 1B, mock). Under autophagy-inducing conditions, such as nutrient
starvation [26], mechanical stress [27] and rapamycin treatment [28], Atg8 associates with
nascent autophagosomes, resulting in an increase in the number of GFP-Atg8 puncta. To
investigate whether M. marinum induced a similar response, we infected GFP-Atg8-expressing
D. discoideum cells with wild type (wt) bacteria. By live microscopy, we detected a three-fold
increase in the number of GFP-Atg8 structures 1.5 hours post-infection (hpi) (Fig 1A and 1B).
This three-fold increase was confirmed using GFP-Atg18 (S1D–S1E Fig), a marker specific for
omegasomes and expanding phagophores [29].
Notably, recruitment of GFP-Atg8 to the bacteria fell in distinct patterns that we defined as
dots (puncta next to the bacterium), patches (extended structures along the bacterium) and
compartments (vacuoles completely surrounding the bacterium) (Fig 1C and 1D). Double-
membrane structures were observed by EM of the MCV (Fig 1E), likely corresponding to
those detected by fluorescence microscopy (Fig 1C). This heterogeneity in GFP-Atg8+ patterns
next to the MCV might reflect temporal stages in a rapid series of events during phagophore
elongation around the MCV and/or MCV-autophagosome fusion. In addition, immunofluo-
rescence staining showed co-localization of the autophagy markers ubiquitin (Ub) and p62
with Atg8 at the site of recruitment to bacteria (Fig 1F), suggesting that the classic autophagic
machinery was activated early after infection.
The accumulation of autophagosomes during infection might be indicative of either
increased induction or decreased degradation, since an impairment of autolysosomal function
would also lead to the accumulation of autophagy proteins and compartments [30]. A change
in the mRNA levels of autophagy genes may correlate with the change in autophagic activity
[30]. Therefore, we measured the transcription levels of autophagy genes at various stages of
infection. The expression of the two D. discoideum atg8 genes (atg8a and atg8b), of atg1 and
p62 was significantly upregulated early after infection (Fig 1G).

Autophagy induction restricts M. marinum proliferation
To determine the impact of autophagy induction during infection, we treated infected cells
with the autophagy inducer drug AR-12/OSU-03012 [31]. After validating that AR-12 induced
the formation of autophagosomes (S2A–S2C and S6D–S6E Figs), and was neither cytotoxic
for D. discoideum nor for M. marinum (S2D–S2E Fig), we quantified the recruitment of
GFP-Atg8 to M. marinum after drug treatment (Fig 2A–2C). We did not observe a significant
difference in its overall recruitment (Fig 2B), but the number of patches increased by 20%
when compared to dots, suggesting enhanced phagophore elongation around the bacteria (Fig
2C). Formation of GFP-Atg8 vacuoles around the bacteria did not increase though, suggesting
that the xenophagic flow was somehow arrested. In addition, treatment with AR-12 lead to a
decrease in bacterial load, as measured using lux-expressing M. marinum (Fig 2D), suggesting
that artificial induction of autophagy can restrict M. marinum survival and/or proliferation.
The decrease in bacterial load resulting from artificial induction of autophagy was confirmed
with other inducers such as the TOR kinase inhibitors AZD8055 and PI-103 [32, 33] (S2F Fig).
The autophagic machinery is required to maintain the MCV
In D. discoideum, disruption of atg1, the homolog of the mammalian ULK1 kinase, leads to a
complete block in the canonical pathway [34]. To confirm a negative effect of autophagy on
the proliferation of M. marinum, we infected wt and atg1- cells with lux-expressing bacteria.
As predicted, the bacterial load was significantly higher in the atg1 mutants, visible from 24
hpi (Fig 3A). This increase was also observed during infection of atg8 knock out cells, but not
of cells lacking the selective autophagy adaptor p62 (S3A Fig), because of potential redundancy
with other Ub-binding xenophagy adaptors [24]. Importantly, treatment with AR-12 had no
effect on bacterial load in atg1- cells, confirming the autophagy-dependent effect of this drug
(S3B Fig).
We have previously shown that M. marinum grows inside a vacuole with features of post-
lysosomes in D. discoideum, and escapes into the cytosol after about 24 hpi [10, 35]. In addi-
tion, we show here that autophagic structures accumulate around bacteria (Fig 1C). We there-
fore wondered whether autophagy provides membranes to maintain the integrity of the MCV,
as previously suggested for other bacteria [36, 37]. Surprisingly, EM monitoring of infected
atg1- cells revealed that M. marinum was released into the cytosol as early as 1 hpi (Fig 3B).
Cytosolic, but not vacuolar M. marinum becomes ubiquitinated in both macrophages and D.
discoideum [25, 38]. Staining for p80, an endosomal copper transporter enriched at the MCV
[35], also distinguishes between bacteria inside a phagosomal compartment (p80-positive and
non-ubiquitinated), and cytosolic bacteria (p80-negative and positive for Ub) (S4A Fig). Con-
sistent with our EM data, we detected a striking increase in the level of ubiquitinated M. mari-
num in atg8- and atg1- cells (Fig 3C and 3D), which was complemented by expression of
Atg1-GFP (Figs S4B and 3D). Taken together, these results suggest that autophagy is necessary
for the establishment and/or maintenance/repair of the MCV, preventing early escape of
mycobacteria to the cytosol.

M. marinum induces autophagosome formation in an ESX-1-dependent
manner
Both M. tuberculosis and M. marinum possess a genomic locus, RD1/ESX-1, that encodes a
type VII system necessary for secretion of the virulence factor ESAT-6, proposed to participate
in the disruption of membranes in mammalian cells [9, 39] as well as in the rupture of the
MCV in D. discoideum [10]. Because membrane damage caused by various bacteria induces
autophagy [40], we hypothesize that ESAT-6 might also be responsible for the recruitment of
the autophagic machinery to early MCVs. Monitoring GFP-Atg8 and GFP-Ub during the first
stages of infection revealed a considerable decrease of their recruitment to the ΔRD1 bacteria,
from 60% to 20% and from 40% to 20%, respectively (Figs 4A and 4B and S4C). Infection of
atg1- cells with either M. marinum ΔRD1 or ΔCE, a strain with a knock out restricted to
ESAT-6 and its chaperone CFP-10 [41], also showed reduced bacteria ubiquitination at 6–7

hpi (Figs 4C and S4D), suggesting that secretion of ESAT-6 is thus required for cytosolic
escape and subsequent ubiquitination of mycobacteria in D. discoideum. Complementation of
the ΔRD1 strain with the M. tuberculosis-derived RD1-2F9 cosmid [42] restored ubiquitination
to wt levels (Fig 4C).
In addition, we measured intracellular proliferation of lux-expressing M. marinum wt and
ΔRD1 strains (Fig 4D). Deletion of the RD1 locus severely reduced the M. marinum load in
both wt and atg1- cells, suggesting that the growth advantage of wt bacteria in atg1- D. discoi-
deum strictly depends on their capacity to escape to the cytosol. Moreover, the upregulation of
autophagy genes early after infection (Fig 4E) was also strictly dependent on a functional ESX-
1 secretion system. We also observed the reduction in fluorescence intensity of the cytosolic
GFP-Atg8 fraction in cells infected with M. marinum wt but not with ΔRD1 (Fig 4F), indicat-
ing that the activity of the RD1 locus induces autophagosome formation and the consequent
translocation of cytosolic GFP-Atg8 to membranes. Therefore, we suggest that the damages
produced by ESAT-6 to the MCV membrane lead to an early induction of the autophagic
response, which somehow limits damage and contributes to retain bacteria in the MCV.
M. marinum blocks the autophagic flux in D. discoideum
Because M. marinum induces the formation of autophagosomes and xenophagy represses bac-
teria growth, the expected bacterial fate would be degradation in autolysosomes. However,
intracellular mycobacteria not only survive but proliferate. One plausible explanation is that
M. marinum avoids xenophagy by blocking the autophagic flux, as already suggested by the
lack of effect of AR-12 on the frequency of GFP-Atg8+ compartments fully enclosing bacteria
(Fig 2C). We first mapped the endocytic and autophagic features of the MCVs containing M.
marinum (Fig 5). At 7 hpi, only 30% of the MCVs were decorated by Rab11, a recycling endo-
some GTPase involved in phagophore elongation and autophagosome maturation, while 80%
of the compartments recruited Rab7, a late endosomal protein necessary for the transition
from autophagosomes to autolysosomes [43] (Fig 5A–5D). In addition, 40–50% of the MCVs
were positive for markers of acidic compartments such as VatB, a peripheral subunit of the
vacuolar H+-ATPase, and LysoSensor Green (Fig 5E–5H). We did not observe any significant
difference in these characteristics between the wt and the ΔRD1 MCVs, even though there is
no overall proliferation of the latter mutant bacteria (Fig 4D). In sharp contrast, staining with
DQ-BSA revealed that only the M. marinum ΔRD1 MCV had lysosomal-like degradative
capacity (Fig 5I and 5J). Together, these data indicate that, at the time points studied here, M.
marinum wt actually resides in a compartment with features of late endosomes, and suggest
that a functional ESX-1 is necessary to block either fusion of the MCV with lysosomes or the
activity of lysosomal enzymes.
To test the hypothesis of M. marinum blocking the autophagic flux in an ESX-1-dependent
manner, we measured the flux using an improved protocol tailored to the specific infection
conditions (see Materials and Methods and S5 Fig). Infection with M. marinum wt but not
ΔRD1 led to a general increase in the number of cytoplasmic GFP-Atg8+ structures (Fig 6A),
but treatment with a protease inhibitor (PI) cocktail, which impairs lysosomal function (S6A
Fig) but does not alter the amount of cytosolic GFP-Atg8 (S6B Fig), resulted in the accumula-
tion of such structures in both infected and non-infected cells (Fig 6A and 6B). However, this
accumulation was less apparent in cells infected with M. marinum wt compared to ΔRD1 or to
uninfected cells (Fig 6A–6C). Despite the increased numbers of GFP-Atg8 puncta, by immu-
noblot, the free GFP signal was reduced in cells infected with both wt and ΔRD1 bacteria at 1.5
and 7 hpi (Fig 6D and 6E). Both the induction and the blockade of the autophagic flux can
lead to a decrease in the free GFP signal in western blot (S5 and S6C and S6D Figs) [30], but

because the ratio in GFP-Atg8 puncta between cells treated with PI and not treated was lower
for an infection with M. marinum wt (Fig 6C), we conclude that only M. marinum wt blocks
the autophagic flux. Nevertheless, this ratio was not equal to one, suggesting again the parallel
induction of autophagosome formation by M. marinum wt. The ESX-1-dependent blockade of
the autophagic flux as well as the induction of autophagy by M. marinum were confirmed by
treatment with the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor concanamycin B (CMB) (see Materials and
Methods and S7 Fig).
The hypothesis that M. marinum wt blocks the autophagic flux is supported by the presence
of membrane tubules or lamella projecting from the MCV, which appear more prominent
after PI treatment (Figs 6F and S8A). These resemble the proto-lysosomal tubules generated
during autophagic lysosomal reformation (ALR) [44, 45] or omegasomes [4]. The accumula-
tion of undigested membranes and cytoplasmic material inside the MCV, observed by EM
even after treatment with AR-12 (S8A Fig), also supports the view of a block induced by M.
marinum.
The requirement for a functional ESX-1 secretion system for both induction of autophago-
somes and blockade of the autophagic flux was confirmed by the fact that PI treatment only
increased the accumulation of GFP-Atg8 around wt but not ΔRD1 bacteria (S8B Fig). In addi-
tion, we observed ΔRD1 bacteria completely surrounded by a GFP-Atg8+ vacuole only after PI
treatment, while it did not change the percentage of M. marinum wt inside such structures
(S8C Fig). This indicates that killing and degradation of M. marinum ΔRD1 by autophagy is
more prominent than for M. marinum wt, and that ESX-1 is essential to block the flux. Alto-
gether, our data suggest that, in D. discoideum, M. marinum induces the formation of autopha-
gosomes while it blocks the autophagic flux in an ESX-1-dependent manner.
The early autophagic response induced by M. marinum might depend on
TORC1
The main inhibitor of autophagy is TOR, a highly-conserved kinase that associates with Rap-
tor, Lst8 and Deptor to form the TORC1 complex (Fig 7A). Some pathogenic bacteria manipu-
late the autophagic defence response in host cells via regulation of TORC1 activity [40].
Therefore, we investigated whether M. marinum also controls autophagy in D. discoideum by
impacting on TORC1.
As a readout for TORC1 activity, we monitored the phosphorylation of conserved sites in
Raptor and in the TOR substrate 4E-BP1 during infection (see Materials and Methods and Fig
7B–7E). At 1.5 hpi, TORC1 activity was decreased, since both p-Raptor (Fig 7B and 7C) and p-
4E-BP1 (Fig 7D and 7E) were significantly reduced. This inhibition of TORC1 activity was
transient, and at 7 hpi the phosphorylation levels of both proteins returned to control levels
(Fig 7B–7E). Antibodies against mammalian 4E-BP1 or Raptor did not detect the endogenous
proteins in D. discoideum, but we confirmed by monitoring the level of GFP-Raptor that the
inhibition of TORC1 activity was due to the decrease in p-Raptor and not to its degradation
(S9 Fig). For unknown reasons, the results obtained during infection with the ΔRD1 bacteria

were very variable, impeding a definite conclusion on whether the ESX-1 system was responsi-
ble for the regulation of TORC1 during M. marinum infection.
In mammalian cells, TORC1 translocates from the cytosol to membranes of late endosomes
and lysosomes upon activation by amino acids [46], while it always resides at the vacuolar
membrane in yeasts [47]. Since the MCV in D. discoideum possesses characteristics of late
endosomes (Fig 5), we monitored whether TORC1 was also located on bacteria compartment
(Fig 7F). Recruitment of GFP fusions of Lst8 and Raptor to the MCV was observed at 1.5 hpi.
We also detected recruitment of the lipid-anchored membrane proteins Lamtor1 and Rheb
(Fig 7A), which activate TORC1 when amino acid levels are high [48]. However, unlike
TORC1 activity, the recruitment of all these proteins to the MCV did not significantly change
between 1.5 and 7 hpi (Fig 7G), indicating that recruitment is probably independent of
TORC1 activity. Nevertheless, we detected a significant decrease in the recruitment of Lam-
tor1, Rheb and Lst8 to the M. marinum ΔRD1 MCV at 7 hpi (Fig 7G), suggesting that the fea-
tures of the bacterial compartment diverge during infection depending on the functionality of
the ESX-1 system.
We conclude that, early after infection of D. discoideum, M. marinum induces autophago-
some formation presumably via downregulation of TORC1, which might be dependent on the
activity of the ESX-1 secretion system. However, this downregulation is not associated with
changes in the localization of TORC1, which remains associated with the MCV at all times.
Discussion
In recent years, the professional phagocyte D. discoideum has become a powerful model to
study host-pathogen interactions at the cellular level [23, 49]. The functional conservation of
the autophagy pathway between D. discoideum and mammalian cells, in addition to its genetic
tractability, make this amoeba an excellent model system to uncover the mechanisms of xeno-
phagy [24]. In this study, we validate the infection model D. discoideum-M. marinum as a
robust system to uncover the complex manipulation of autophagy by mycobacteria.
It was previously shown that M. marinum recruits LC3/Atg8 in murine macrophages and
zebrafish embryos [21, 50]. In D. discoideum, we detected not only an increase in the number
of Atg8+ and Atg18+ structures (Figs 1A and 1B and S1D–S1E), but the recruitment of those
structures and other autophagy markers like Ub and p62 to the MCV early after infection (Fig
1C, 1D and 1F). This recruitment is likely due to an early induction of autophagosome forma-
tion, since the activity of the main autophagy inhibitor, TORC1, decreased at 1.5 hpi (Fig 7B–
7E), the transcription of some of the genes involved in nucleation (atg1) and elongation (atg8)
of the isolation membrane, the two major steps in autophagosome formation [51, 52], were
upregulated at the beginning of the infection (Fig 1G), and translocation of GFP-Atg8 from
Fig 6. The autophagic flux is blocked during wt M. marinum infection. A. GFP-Atg8-expressing cells were infected or mock-
infected for 0.5 or 6 h with mCherry-expressing M. marinum wt or with DsRed-expressing M. marinum ΔRD1 and treated or not with a

the cytosol to autophagosomal membranes can also be observed from 1.5 hpi (Figs 4F, 1A and
1B). With time during infection (5–7 hpi), the autophagy induction driven by M. marinum
diminished, as confirmed by the decrease in (1) the transcription of autophagy genes (Fig 4E),
(2) the total number of GFP-Atg8 structures per cell (Mm wt mock in Figs 6B and S7D), and
(3) the recruitment of those GFP-Atg8+ and GFP-Ub+ structures to the MCV (Fig 4A and 4B).
Intriguingly, at 24 hpi transcription of autophagy genes was no longer upregulated (Fig 4E),
even though the recruitment of Atg8 to the bacteria raised back to the initial level (Fig 4A). We
have recently shown that M. marinum recruits the autophagic machinery during its ejection
from D. discoideum, a process that enables the non-lytic cell-to-cell transmission of the bacte-
rium after 24 hpi [25]. Our results suggest that, later in the infection, M. marinum benefits
from pre-formed autophagosomes for its ejection from the host cell.
Surprisingly, at early stages only 5–10% of the co-localization events between bacteria and
Atg8 corresponded to closed compartments (Fig 1D), suggesting that only a few mycobacteria
are captured in autophagosomes. Autophagy is reported to play both negative and positive
roles during infection. When it acts as a cell-autonomous defence response, it leads to bacterial
killing, but it can also support replication of pathogens such as S. aureus or Brucella abortus
[5]. Despite inducing an early autophagic response, M. marinum not only survives but prolifer-
ates inside D. discoideum (Fig 2D, mock). This points to a complex interface between D. discoi-
deum and M. marinum in which autophagy plays both a negative and a positive role. We
suggest that overall autophagy restricts bacterial load, as revealed by the unrestricted prolifera-
tion in atg1- and atg8- cells (Figs 3A and S3A). This loss of control of the mycobacteria replica-
tion can only be due to autophagic deficiency and not to the lack of an inflammatory response,
as previously suggested to occur in mice [53], since D. discoideum lacks a canonical inflamma-
tion pathway. However, in these mutant cells, the bacteria escape precociously to the cytosol
(Fig 3B) due to a compromised integrity of the MCV, indicating a contribution of autophagy
to the maintenance/repair of damaged MCV membranes early during infection. A similar
cyto-protective role of autophagy in repairing membrane damages caused by Salmonella has
been suggested [54]. In addition, a role of the ESX-1 secretion system in the induction of
autophagy in animal cells has been reported [21, 55]. Here, we suggest that M. marinum uses
the same membrane damage-dependent mechanism to subvert autophagy in the ancient
phagocyte D. discoideum. Note that in wt D. discoideum the capacity of autophagy to maintain
the integrity of the MCV is likely overwhelmed at later stages of infection by M. marinum,
leading to ESX-1-dependent cytosol escape. In any case, a massive physiological or pharmaco-
logical induction of autophagy can overcome such positive effects, leading to restriction of
mycobacterial load [13, 56], as we also observed in D. discoideum after treatment with AR-12,
AZD8055 and PI-103 (Figs 2D and S2F).

Our observations of autophagosomes associated with the MCV and of regions of double
membrane at the periphery of the MCV (green arrowheads in S8A Fig) suggest an additional
or alternative role for autophagy in supplying the MCV with membranes. The formation of
MCV with features of autophagic membranes was completely dependent on a functional ESX-
1 secretion system, since deletion of the RD1 locus tremendously reduced the recruitment of
Atg8 and Ub to the damaged MCV (Fig 4A–4C) and abolished the upregulation of autophagy
genes (Fig 4E). We confirmed that the decrease in the percentage of cells with GFP-Atg8+ bac-
teria observed during infection with M. marinum ΔRD1 (Fig 4A) was not due to a lower bacte-
rial load (Fig 4D), since quantifying the percentage of mutant bacteria positive for GFP-Atg8
showed a similar reduction (S4C Fig). In addition, the attenuation of M. marinum ΔRD1
observed in wt D. discoideum was not epistatically reversed by a knock out of the autophagy
pathway (Fig 4D), likely indicating that xenophagy mainly limits cytosolic bacteria burden.
To impede its killing by xenophagy, M. marinum must somehow block the autophagic flux.
We show here that, in D. discoideum as in macrophages [21], M. marinum resides in a com-
partment with late endosomal features but devoid of lysosomal properties (Fig 5). A role for
ESX-1 in flux blockade has been proposed for M. tuberculosis [13]. Here, we demonstrate for
the first time that M. marinum escapes from lysosomes and also blocks the autophagic flux in
an ESX-1-dependent manner (Figs 5I, 5J, 6B–6E, S7D–S7E and S8C). The membrane perfora-
tions caused by the ESX-1 secretion system might alter the content or properties of the MCV,
preventing its fusion with lysosomes, as previously shown for the action of Listeryolisin O
from Listeria monocytogenes [57, 58]. Actually, M. marinum ΔRD1 does not induce autophago-
some formation or recruitment (Figs 4A–4C, 4E and 6A, mock) nor blocks the autophagic flux
(Figs 6B, 6C and S7D–S7E). However, the decrease in cytosolic GFP-Atg8 fluorescence at 1.5
hpi (Fig 4F), the decrease in free GFP (Fig 6D) and the increase of bacteria inside autophago-
somes after PI treatment (S8C Fig) when D. discoideum is infected with M. marinum ΔRD1
suggest that it might undergo enhanced autophagic clearance. Altogether, our data indicate
that M. marinum utilizes the ESX-1 secretion system to block the autophagic flux in D. discoi-
deum and to tailor the composition of the MCV.
Little is known about the role of TOR during mycobacterial infections. Mycobacterial lipids
and ESAT-6 stimulate TOR signalling [59, 60], but the kinetics of TOR activity and autophagy
during infection have not been studied. Here, we show that early after infection, M. marinum
inhibits TORC1 activity, which is reactivated at 7 hpi (Fig 7B–7E). TORC1 reactivation might
contribute to the block of autophagic flux. In agreement with this, at 8 hpi, the MCV was full
of cytoplasmic material, and membrane tubules (reminiscent of ALR) or lamella extended
from the compartment (Fig 6F). ALR involves the autophagy-dependent reactivation of TOR
after inhibition by stress, and consists in the formation of proto-lysosomal tubules from auto-
lysosomes that finally mature into functional lysosomes [44, 45]. On the other hand, these
membrane extensions or lamella also resemble omegasomes arising from the compartment
containing M. marinum, which is supported by the localization of GFP-Atg18 (S1D–S1E Fig)
at the MCV. This suggests the MCV as a site for autophagosome formation, but more experi-
ments will be necessary to confirm the origin of those membrane tubules/lamella at the MCV.
In conclusion, we propose that the membrane damages caused by the M. marinum ESX-1
secretion system activate an early cell-autonomous defence response in D. discoideum, which
is accompanied by the transient inhibition of TORC1 activity. However, M. marinum avoids
killing inside induced autolysosomes by blocking the autophagic flux, likely as a consequence
of the membrane perforations. The autophagic flux blockade results in the accumulation of
membranes and cytoplasmic material in the MCV, which might somehow support bacterial
survival within the niche (Fig 8).

Materials and methods
Dictyostelium strains and culture
The D. discoideum strains used for this work are listed in S1 Table. Cells were axenically grown
at 22˚C in HL5c medium (Formedium) supplemented with 100 U mL−1 of penicillin and
100 μg mL−1 of streptomycin (Invitrogen).
To generate the p62 knockout strain, p62 was amplified with the primers p62F10 and
p62R10 from genomic DNA of DH1 and ligated into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega). The Bs-resis-
tance cassette flanked by SmaI sites from plasmid pLPBLP [61] was inserted into pGEM-T-
p62, previously digested with EcoRV and BclI and blunted.
Plasmids and primers to generate the D. discoideum GFP-tagged proteins Atg8, Atg18,
Atg1, Ub, p62, Rab11c, Rab7a, VatB, Lamtor1, Rheb, Lst8 and Raptor are listed in S1 and S2
Tables. Plasmids were transfected into D. discoideum by electroporation and selected with the
relevant antibiotic. Hygromycin and G418 were used at a concentration of 50 and 5 μg mL−1,
respectively.
Fig 8. Model of the D. discoideum autophagic response during M. marinum infection. Early after engulfment, M. marinum damages the membrane of
its MCV in an ESX-1-dependent manner. Membrane perforations might block lysosome fusion and, consequently, autophagic flux. In addition, ESX-1 inhibits
TORC1 activity early during infection (1.5 hpi), presumably through a nutrient-sensing pathway as described for other bacteria [75–77]. Downregulation of
TORC1, which is always bound to the wt MCV membrane, induces the formation of autophagosomes that somehow repair the membrane damages and
provide the MCV with cytoplasmic material. TORC1 re-activation at 7 hpi leads to the decrease in autophagosome formation and recruitment to the MCV, and
enhances the blockade of the autophagic flux, which generates proto-lysosomal tubules (ALR). The block in autophagic flux prevents bacteria killing in
autolysosomes and degradation of membranes and cytoplasmic material delivered to the MCV via the recruited autophagosomes.

Mycobacteria strains and culture
Mycobacteria, listed in S1 Table, were cultured in 7H9 (Difco) supplemented with 10% OADC
(Becton Dickinson), 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween80 at 32˚C in shaking culture at 150 r.p.m.
To minimize bacterial aggregation, Erlenmeyer flasks containing 5 mm glass beads were used.
Cultures were grown until OD600 of 1 (1.5 x 108 bacteria mL−1). M. marinum ΔRD1 was com-
plemented with the RD1-2F9 cosmid by integration into the chromosomal attB site [42].
Bacteria growth measurements
Growth of luminescent bacteria was measured as described previously [62]. Briefly, 1.0 × 105
luxABCDE-expressing M. marinum were plated on a non-treated, white F96 MicroWell plate
(Nunc) containing 7H9-OADC medium and covered with a gas permeable moisture barrier
seal (Bioconcept). Luminescence was measured for 30–70 h with 1 to 3 h intervals with a Syn-
ergy Mx Monochromator-Based Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (Biotek). The temperature
was kept constant at 32˚C. For intracellular growth measurements, dilutions between 0.5 and
2.0 × 105 of infected cells were plated as described above with HL5c medium containing
10 μM of amikacin to avoid extracellular growth of mycobacteria. Luminescence was also mea-
sured for 30–70 h with 1 h intervals at a constant temperature of 25˚C.
Cell cytotoxicity assay
Cell cytotoxicity was determined as the percentage of reduction of the signal from alamarBlue
reagent, as indicated by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Briefly, 2.0 × 105 cells were cultured on
a 96-well plate with HL5c containing DMSO or AR-12 for 4 h at 21˚C. After washing with
phosphate buffer, cells were cultured in the dark with 10% (v/v) alamarBlue reagent for an
additional 4 h. Finally, fluorescence at 595 nm was measured and normalized to 1 (DMSO
carrier).
Antibodies, reagents, immunoblot and immunofluorescence microscopy
As readouts of TORC1 activity [63, 64], the rabbit polyclonal antibody (pAb) anti-p-Raptor
(S863) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the rabbit pAb anti-p-4E-BP1(T70) (Cell Signaling
Technology), which recognise the conserved phosphorylated sites in D. discoideum, were
used. A rabbit pAb was raised against full-length recombinant Atg8; anti-p80 [65] was pur-
chased from the Geneva Antibody Facility (http://www.unige.ch/antibodies); the anti-Ub
(FK2) monoclonal antibody (mAb) was from Enzo Life Sciences; rabbit anti-Abp1 pAb was
previously described [66]; mAb and pAb anti-GFP were from Abmart and MBL, respec-
tively; rat mAb anti-RFP was from ChromoTek; rabbit Goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG
coupled to Alexa488 or Alexa594 (Invitrogen) or to HRP (Brunschwig) were used as sec-
ondary antibodies.
To stain live bacteria, 10 μM Vibrant DyeCycle Ruby Stain (ThermoFisher) was added to the
infection sample 30 min before imaging. To stain acidic compartments, 1 μM LysoSensor Green
DND-189 (ThermoFisher), a pH-dependent probe which fluorescence intensity increases upon
acidification, was added to the infected cells. After 10 min incubation, excess dye was washed
away and cells were imaged for a maximum of 30 min. To stain compartments with proteolytic
activity, 50 μg/mL DQ Green BSA (ThermoFisher), which releases fluorescent protein fragments
upon dequenching of the self-quenched, BSA-associated Bodipy dye by proteolysis, was added to
the infection sample one hour before imaging. To measure the autophagic flux, the cOmplete
EDTA-free PI cocktail from Roche (11873580001) and CMB (BioViotica) were used. To assess
inhibition of the lysosomal function, before treatment with PI and CMB (1 h and 2 h, respectively)

cells were incubated overnight in the dark with 4 mg/mL TRITC-Dextran (Sigma) and 0.4 mg/
mL FITC-Dextran (Sigma). To prepare lysates for immunoblotting, the cOmplete, ULTRA Tab-
lets, Mini, EASYpack PI cocktail from Roche (05892970001) were used. PhosSTOP phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail was also from Roche (04906837001). AR-12 (OSU-03012), AZD8055 and PI-
103 were purchased from Selleckchem.
For immunoblotting of samples to monitor the autophagic flux and TORC1 activity,
3.6 × 106 cells were gently collected in a 15 mL Falcon conical tube on ice and centrifuged 5
min at 1500 r.p.m. in the cold. The pellet was resuspended in RIPA buffer (Tris 20 mM, NaCl
50 mM, sodium deoxycholate 0.5%, NP-40 1%, pH 7.4) containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors, and lysis was allowed for 10 min on ice. Lysates were then centrifuged 10 min at
13000 r.p.m. in the cold and boiling sample buffer added to the supernatant at 2×. Samples
were further boiled at 95˚C for 5 min. Final cell density in the sample was 5 × 107 cells mL−1.
Around 5 × 105 cells were loaded per lane.
After SDS-PAGE separation [67] and transfer onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran,
Schleicher & Schuell), immunodetection was performed as previously described [68] but with
ECL Prime Blocking Reagent (Amersham Biosciences) instead of non-fat dry milk. When the
GFP-Atg8 cleavage was analysed, a mix of mAb and pAB anti-GFP was used to enhance the
signal. Detection was performed with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) using an EpiChemi
II Darkroom device (UVP). Data quantification was carried out with ImageJ.
Infected D. discoideum cells were fixed by rapid freezing in ultracold methanol and immu-
nostained as previously described [69]. Immunofluorescence images were recorded either
with a Leica SP5 or Zeiss LSM700 or LSM780 confocal microscope using a 63× 1.4NA or a
100× 1.4NA oil-immersion objective.
Infection assay
Infections were performed as previously described [35], with few modifications. Briefly, after
infection and phagocytosis, extracellular bacteria were washed off and attached infected cells
were resuspended in HL5c containing 5 μg mL−1 of streptomycin, 5 U mL−1 of penicillin.
Live imaging
Cells were plated on a μ-dish (iBIDI) at the indicated times and, after adherence, either 1μm sec-
tions or time-lapse movies with 4 s intervals were taken with a spinning disc confocal system
(Intelligent Imaging Innovations) mounted on an inverted microscope (Leica DMIRE2; Leica)
using the 63 × or the 100 × 1.4 NA oil objective. Images were processed with ImageJ. Quantifi-
cation of autophagic fluorescent structures, bacteria co-localization or cytosolic GFP-Atg8 fluo-
rescence intensity was performed manually. Under infectious conditions, only cells containing
bacteria were considered for quantification. To improve imaging in S1A–S1C Fig, a 1 mm thin
agarose sheet was overlayed in the middle of the μ-dish as described previously [70].
Electron microscopy (EM)
EM in Figs 3B and S2B and S2C was performed as previously described [71]; For Figs 1E, 6F
and S8A, the exact protocol described before [72] was followed. Samples were processed and
analysed at the EM Core facility of the Faculty of Medicine (University of Geneva).
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)
RNA from non-infected cells or cells infected with M. marinum wt or ΔRD1 at appropriate
times was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA MiniPrep kit (Zymo Research) as indicated by

the manufacturer. 1 μg RNA was retro-transcribed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit and
polydT primers (Biorad). The cDNA was amplified using the primers listed in S2 Table and
the SsoAdvanced universal SYBR Green supermix (Biorad). Amplimers for atg1, atg8a, atg8b,
p62 and gapdh were detected on a CFX Connect Real-Time PCR Detection System (Biorad).
The housekeeping gene gapdh was used for normalization. PCR amplification was followed by
a DNA melting curve analysis to confirm the presence of a single amplicon. Relative mRNA
levels (2−ΔΔCt) were determined by comparing first the PCR cycle thresholds (Ct) for the gene
of interest and gapdh (ΔC), and second Ct values in infected cells vs non-infected cells (ΔΔC).
Autophagic flux assay
Current autophagic flux assays in D. discoideum rely on a 4 h treatment with the lysosomotro-
pic compound NH4Cl to suppress lysosomal acidification [73], which induces adverse effects
on cell and organelle morphology. We therefore, developed an alternative assay using a cock-
tail of PI to block autolysosomal proteolysis of GFP-Atg8 (S5 Fig). Because of the fast autopha-
gic flux in D. discoideum (S1A–S1C Fig) [30], as short as one hour of treatment was required to
detect a lack of lysosomal function (S6A Fig) and an accumulation of GFP-Atg8 by immuno-
blot (S6C and S6D Fig). In addition, we also observed a 2-fold accumulation of GFP-Atg8-po-
sitive structures by live microscopy (S6E and S6F Fig). As a positive control for the flux assay,
we used AR-12, which increased the number of autophagosomes (S6E and S6F Fig), as well as
the rate of degradation of the GFP cleaved from GFP-Atg8 (S6C and S6D Fig). The induction
of flux was confirmed by the detection of 2.5-fold more GFP-Atg8 puncta in cells treated with
AR-12 and PI compared to cells treated only with AR-12 (S6E and S6F Fig). These induction
and blockade of the autophagic flux by AR-12 and PI, respectively, were not toxic, since the
cell shape remained unaltered (S6E Fig). We confirmed that these effects were autophagy-
dependent, since almost no GFP-Atg8 cleavage or accumulation were observed in treated
atg1- cells (S6C–S6F Fig).
Infected or non-infected cells expressing GFP-Atg8 were cultured in a shaking Falcon 6
Well Clear Multiwell Plate at a density of 1.33 × 106 cells mL−1. One hour before the indicated
time point, the PI cocktail was added at 2.5-fold the recommended concentration. Addition of
ddH2O was used as mock-treatment. As a positive control, AR-12 was added 2 h before the
indicated time point (1 h before the PI treatment) at a final concentration of 2.5 μM. In this
case, DMSO was used as a mock-treatment. Cells were collected either on ice for immunoblot-
ting or on a μ-dish for live imaging (see above).
Similar results were obtained with the vacuolar H+-ATPase inhibitor CMB (S7 Fig). Two-
hours treatment with 1 μM CMB (or DMSO as mock-treatment) was needed for a clear
impairment of the lysosomal function (S7A Fig) and the autophagic flux (S7B and S7C Fig).
However, since 2 h, but not 1 h, treatment mildly but significantly affected atg1- cells (S7C
Fig), 1.5 h treatment with CMB was finally used to monitor the autophagic flux during M. mar-
inum infection (S7D–S7E Fig).
Statistical analysis
The GraphPad Prism and MATLAB software were used to perform statistical tests and to plot
graphs. For the autophagic flux assays (Figs 6B, S6F and S7C and S7D), all data sets were fitted
to Poisson distributions, and the corresponding parameter λ was estimated. 106 random per-
mutations of the data sets were performed to generate random λ. These λ were used to calcu-
late the probability of differences occurring by chance between the pairs of λ of the original
data sets, as described in [74]. The λ of each data set and the corresponding p-values obtained
by the random permutation test are listed in S3 and S4 Tables, respectively. In Figs 6C and

S7E, the log2 of the ratios between the λ in drug-treated (PI or CMB) and mock-treated cells
was calculated. The probability of differences occurring by chance were similarly tested using
2x106-random permutations of the data sets.

S5 Fig. PI-based autophagic flux assay in D. discoideum. Scheme of the autophagic flux assay
in D. discoideum expressing exogenous GFP-Atg8 and the expected results. In mock conditions
autophagosomes form and fusion with lysosomes, leading to the degradation of the engulfed
cytoplasmic material and the GFP-Atg8 protein at the inner membranes. Atg8 is sensitive to
degradation whereas GFP, which fluorescence is quenched by low pH, is relatively resistant to
hydrolysis [30]. Therefore, after autolysosome formation low signal is detected by fluorescence
microscopy while free GFP appears in immunoblotting; Treatment with AR-12 induces both
autophagosomes formation and autophagic degradation, while the rates of GFP-Atg8 produc-
tion in the cell remains the same. As a result, more autophagosomes can be observed by micros-
copy while the intensity of the free GFP band in immunoblotting is reduced; Short-treatment (1
h) with PI derives in the accumulation of autophagosomes which content cannot be degraded.
Hence, by both microscopy and immunoblot higher GFP-Atg8 signal will be observed. Double
treatment with AR-12 and PI arises the accumulation of autophagosomes; In atg1- cells, autop-
hagosomes cannot be formed under any condition. As a consequence, the GFP-Atg8 signal
does not vary during the experiment. It needs to be noticed that some Atg1-independent degra-
dation of GFP-Atg8 may still occur.
