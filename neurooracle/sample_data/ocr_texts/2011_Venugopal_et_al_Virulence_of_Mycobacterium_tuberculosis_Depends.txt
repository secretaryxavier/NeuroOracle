SUMMARY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) adapts to persist in a nutritionally limited macrophage
compartment. Lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), the third enzyme (E3) in Mtb’s pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex (PDH), also serves as E1 of peroxynitrite reductase/peroxidase (PNR/P),
which helps Mtb resist host reactive nitrogen intermediates. In contrast to Mtb lacking
dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (DlaT), the E2 of PDH and PNR/P, Lpd-deficient Mtb is
severely attenuated in wild type and immunodeficient mice. This suggests that Lpd has a function
that DlaT does not share. When DlaT is absent, Mtb upregulates an Lpd-dependent branched chain
keto-acid dehydrogenase (BCKADH) encoded by pdhA, pdhB, pdhC and lpdC. Without Lpd, Mtb
cannot metabolize branched chain amino acids and potentially toxic branched chain intermediates
accumulate. Mtb deficient in both DlaT and PdhC phenocopies Lpd-deficient Mtb. Thus, Mtb
critically requires BCKADH along with PDH and PNR/P for pathogenesis. These findings
position Lpd as a potential target for anti-infectives against Mtb.
INTRODUCTION
Most cases of tuberculosis are curable by drugs that have been available for over 40 years,
yet Mtb is the single leading cause of death from bacterial infection (Bloom and Murray,
1992). This medical-societal failure stems in part from using anti-infectives that are chiefly
active against replicating bacteria to treat an infection in which many of the bacteria are not
replicating (McCune et al., 1966; Nathan, 2009; Nathan et al., 2008). During a multi-decade
innovation gap in anti-infective drug development (Fischbach and Walsh, 2009), the
inexorable progression of drug-resistance has made tuberculosis increasingly harder to treat
and sometimes untreatable (Chan et al., 2008; Glaziou et al., 2009). Thus, a basic biologic
question has acquired urgent medical relevance: on what gene products does Mtb depend for

survival in the host? This is distinct from how the question is usually framed in anti-bacterial
drug development: on what gene products does the pathogen depend for survival in vitro?
Whether Mtb infection is latent or active, many of the bacilli reside in macrophage
phagosomes (Russell, 2001), where they can sustain net rates of population growth near zero
for long periods (Gill et al., 2009; Munoz-Elias et al., 2005). Knowledge is growing about
the metabolic pathways required for survival and persistence of intraphagosomal Mtb (Barry
et al., 2009; Smith, 2000). Mtb requires the enzymes isocitrate lyases 1 and 2 (encoded by
icl1 and icl2 and serving the glyoxylate shunt and methylcitrate cycle) to establish infection
in the mouse (Munoz-Elias and McKinney, 2005), and genes required for cholesterol
metabolism to persist (Pandey and Sassetti, 2008). Additionally, upregulation of
gluconeogenic and glyoxylate shunt genes in Mtb recovered from mouse macrophages
(Schnappinger et al., 2003), mouse lungs and patient specimens (Timm et al., 2003) suggests
that to survive in the host, Mtb must metabolize acetyl CoA in an anaplerotic fashion. It has
been assumed that this reflects the derivation of acetyl CoA from β-oxidation of fatty acids
(Munoz-Elias and McKinney, 2006).
Anabolism of the branched chain amino acids leucine, isoleucine and valine has been well
studied in Mtb, and pathways responsible for their synthesis are essential for virulence
(Hondalus et al., 2000). However, little attention has been given to their catabolism, which
might serve to prevent their over-accumulation, facilitate the generation of branched chain
fatty acids, or provide energy.
One aspect of host immune chemistry that contributes substantially to Mtb’s non-replication
in vivo is the generation of reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) by inducible nitric oxide
synthase (iNOS) (MacMicking et al., 1997). RNI can kill bacteria by forming intrabacterial
peroxynitrite (St John et al., 2001). Accordingly, we searched for enzymes that permit Mtb
to survive exposure to RNI. We discovered a PNR/P consisting of four enzymes: Lpd,
encoded by lpdC (Rv0462) (Argyrou and Blanchard, 2001); DlaT; a thioredoxin-like protein
AhpD; and the peroxiredoxin AhpC (Bryk et al., 2000; Bryk et al., 2002). Enzymes that
function in complexes are often designated “E1”, “E2”, etc. in the order of sequential
catalysis. Lpd was originally predicted to serve as the last enzyme (E3) in two complexes, α-
ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (αKGDH) and PDH in Mtb (Cole and Barrell, 1998). However,
we found that Mtb lacks αKGDH (Tian et al., 2005a) and that the E1 and E2 of PDH are
products of aceE and dlaT (Tian et al., 2005b), the latter originally mis-annotated as E2 of
αKGDH. This left unexplained the functions of the proteins encoded by the genes pdhA
(Rv2497c, annotated as the α subunit of E1 of PDH), pdhB (Rv2496c, annotated as the β
subunit of E1 of PDH) and pdhC (Rv2495c, annotated as E2 of PDH). In many organisms
Lpd is also the E3 of BCKADH, so we hypothesized that the pdhABC operon may encode
the E1 and E2 of BCKADH (Tian et al., 2005b). However, we could detect no such activity
in Mtb (Tian et al., 2005b).
Deletion of dlaT had a pronounced effect on Mtb’s growth in standard medium in vitro,
sensitized Mtb to RNI, and attenuated Mtb in the mouse (Shi and Ehrt, 2006). Additionally,
species-selective DlaT inhibitors selectively killed non-replicating Mtb (Bryk et al., 2008).
We then focused on Lpd as a potential target, because it participates in the same two enzyme
complexes as DlaT, namely, PDH and PNR/P (Bryk et al., 2000; Bryk et al., 2002).
Structural differences between the active sites of human and mycobacterial Lpd
(Rajashankar et al., 2005) were exploited in the development of species-selective inhibitors
of mycobacterial Lpd (Bryk et al., 2010). In the course of these studies we were surprised to
discover that Lpd-deficient Mtb was far more attenuated in vivo than DlaT-deficient Mtb.
This led us to search for yet another function of Lpd. The findings add to our understanding
of host-pathogen interactions in experimental tuberculosis.

RESULTS
Mtb Requires Lpd for Virulence
We disrupted lpdC in Mtb H37Rv by homologous recombination and confirmed the deletion
by Southern blot (See Figure S1A online), mRNA analysis (See Figure S1B online) and
western blot (Figure 1A). We reintroduced lpdC via complementation in an integrative
vector driven by a constitutive hsp60 promoter and achieved wild type (WT) expression
levels of Lpd mRNA (See Figure S1B online) and protein (Figure 1A). As will be shown
subsequently, the Lpd-deficient strain grew, albeit poorly, in standard medium with
dextrose, glycerol and fatty acids as carbon sources. To confirm Lpd’s role in metabolism of
carbohydrates through its participation in PDH, we monitored the growth of WT, mutant and
complemented bacteria with glycerol and dextrose as the only carbon sources. As predicted,
the Lpd-deficient bacteria failed to grow on carbohydrates, while the WT and complemented
strains grew normally (Figure 1B). The LpdC-containing PNR/P detoxifies peroxynitrite but
not NO (Bryk et al., 2000; Bryk et al., 2002). Killing of bacteria by mildly acidified nitrite
or other NO donors requires oxygen and involves oxidation of intrabacterial peptidyl
methionine (St John et al., 2001), strongly suggesting that it proceeds through intrabacterial
conversion of NO (a non-oxidizing species) to peroxynitrite (a strong oxidant). Thus, to test
Lpd’s role in PNR/P, we exposed the three strains to mildly acidified nitrite. The Lpd-
deficient bacteria lost 3 log10 colony forming units (CFU) at concentrations of nitrite that
reduced the viability of the WT and complemented strains by only <0.5 log10 (Figure 1C),
consistent with Lpd’s role in PNR/P. To determine whether Mtb lacking lpdC was
specifically resistant to the stresses imposed, or merely sickly, we exposed WT, mutant and
complemented strains to oxidative stress in the form of H2O2. Mtb lacking lpdC was more
resistant than WT and complemented strains, a property shared by several other Mtb
mutants that are more sensitive to RNI in vitro (Darwin et al., 2003; Gandotra et al., 2007)
(Figure 1D).
Next we assessed the role of lpdC in Mtb’s ability to grow and persist in vivo by infecting
C57BL/6 mice with Lpd-deficient Mtb or the WT or complemented strains. The mutant
strain was rapidly cleared from the lungs, (Figure 2A) and either never seeded the spleen or
failed to survive there (Figure 2B). Because we plated the organs in their entirety, the
detection limit in our assays was 1 CFU/organ. Non-detection of CFU did not result from
toxicity of lung homogenates to the bacteria, because the expected number of CFU was
observed using the same homogenization procedure on the first day after infection. Lungs
contained no detectable CFU in most of the mice from day 7 through termination of the
experiment at day 164, and spleens contained no CFU at any time tested (days 28, 64 and
164). Moreover, the lungs of mice infected with the lpdC mutant displayed no gross or
microscopic pathology (Figure 2C, See Figure S2 online). Complementation of the mutant
restored virulence in vivo, confirming that the severe attenuation of the mutant in vivo was
due to loss of lpdC.
Infection with Mtb elicits IFNγ production first by NK cells and then by T lymphocytes.
IFNγ is critically required for control of Mtb infection in both mice and humans (Flynn et
al., 1993; Jouanguy et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 2008). To test whether Mtb lacking lpdC
requires IFNγ-dependent immunity for clearance of the bacterium, we infected IFNγ−/−
mice. IFNγ−/− mice infected with the lpdC mutant rapidly cleared the infection, while those
infected with WT Mtb were highly susceptible (Figure 2D).
Consistent with the rapid clearance of Lpd-deficient Mtb in vivo, bone marrow derived
macrophages from C56BL/6 mice killed the lpdC mutant by ~5 fold even without
immunologic activation, while the WT and complemented strains grew ~1.5 log10 over the
same period (Figure 2E). When macrophages were activated with IFNγ and then infected,
Venugopal et al.

the lpdC mutant was killed by ~1 log10 while the WT and complemented strains still grew,
albeit more slowly than in naïve macrophages (Figure 2F). The lesser effect of IFNγ in these
experiments than earlier (e.g., (Shi and Ehrt, 2006)) was associated with use of different
IFNγ preparations and our current practice of omitting all antibiotics during the
differentiation of the macrophages.
Metabolic Differences Between DlaT-deficient and Lpd-deficient Mtb
Characterization of DlaT-deficient Mtb in the same mouse model had revealed only a 1.5
log10 reduction in CFU in the lungs at the onset of the chronic stage of the infection
compared to WT Mtb (Shi and Ehrt, 2006). The ≥6 log10 attenuation that we observed here
with Lpd-deficient Mtb suggested that Lpd serves an important function in Mtb in which
DlaT does not participate. Lpd-deficient and DlaT-deficient mutants were almost
indistinguishable in their survival during exposure to a cell wall-perturbing agent (SDS)
(See Figure S3A online) or lipophilic antibiotics (See Figures S3B - S3D online). Both
mutants, however, were more resistant to ethambutol and rifimpicin than WT Mtb, possibly
due to the impaired replication of these strains.
However, compared to DlaT-deficient Mtb, Lpd-deficient Mtb had an inferior capacity for
extended growth in 7H9 medium (Figure 3A). Along with carbohydrates, 7H9 medium
provides fatty acids when it is supplemented in the standard manner with the dispersal agent
Tween 80 (an oleic acid polymer) and bovine serum albumin (a fatty acid carrier). The lpdC
mutant did not merely cease growth at later time points, but died, as reflected by ~1 log loss
of CFU, while WT, DlaT-deficient and complemented Mtb continued to survive in
stationary phase (Figure 3B). Removing dextrose and glycerol impaired the growth of WT
Mtb as well as the dlaT mutant so that their growth rates became almost indistinguishable
from that of the lpdC mutant (Figure 3C). This suggested that when carbohydrates were
present, DlaT-deficient Mtb may have metabolized carbohydrates along with the fatty acids,
while Lpd-deficient Mtb may have subsisted only on the fatty acids.
In order to elucidate a potential mechanism by which the dlaT mutant, despite lacking PDH,
was able to use carbohydrates, we quantified several intracellular metabolites in WT and
mutant bacteria. Inhibition of PDH by genetic deletion of either lpdC or dlaT is expected to
lead to a build up of glycolytic intermediates and pyruvate (Bryk et al., 2008). We grew the
WT, mutant and complemented strains on filter discs on 7H9 agar plates to facilitate rapid
harvest and to avoid losing the metabolites that leak during handling (de Carvalho, 2010)
and analyzed metabolites in their lysates by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. At
week 2 of in vitro culture, by which time the lpdC and dlaT mutants had grown to a similar
extent, pyruvate was comparably elevated in both mutant strains compared to WT and
complemented strains (Figure 4A). Alanine, a metabolite of pyruvate, was also elevated in
both mutant strains (See Figure S4A online). The branched chain amino acids valine,
leucine, and isoleucine can also arise from pyruvate, and their levels were also elevated at
day 14 in both mutant strains compared to WT and complemented strains (See Figures S4B -
S4D online). Metabolism of branched chain amino acids results in generation of branched
chain keto acids, which are direct substrates for the BCKADH complex. The intracellular
levels of ketovaline, ketoleucine, and ketoisoleucine were similarly elevated in both mutant
strains compared to WT and complemented strains (Figures 4B, C). In contrast, histidine,
whose metabolism is independent of PDH, was equally abundant in all five strains (Figure
4D). At day 28, when the dlaT mutant had continued to grow but the lpdC mutant had
stopped growing, intracellular pyruvate, leucine, isoleucine, valine and their keto acid
metabolites returned to near normal levels in the dlaT mutant, suggesting that they had been
metabolized. However, these metabolites all remained elevated in Mtb lacking lpdC (Figures
4A - 4C, See Figures S4A - S4D online), while histidine remained constant (Figure 4D). The
reduction in levels of ketoleucine/ketoisoleucine in the dlaT mutant from day 14 to day 28 (p

= 0.0026 for the difference between the two time points) brought the level nearly to that of
WT. In contrast, there was a much smaller reduction in levels in the lpdC mutant (p = 0.01
for the difference between the two time points). As noted, complementation of the mutant
strains partially or completely restored levels of metabolites to WT levels (Figure 4A - 4D,
see Figures S4A - S4D online). Thus, early in culture, both DlaT-deficient Mtb and Lpd-
deficient Mtb gave metabolic evidence of their PDH deficiency. However, between the 2nd
and 4th week of culture, the metabolic profile of DlaT-deficient Mtb and Lpd-deficient Mtb
diverged. DlaT-deficient Mtb appeared to acquire the ability to overcome the block in
metabolite flux, while Lpd-deficient Mtb did not.
Consistent with this, Mtb lacking DlaT grew on leucine (Figure 4E) and isoleucine (Figure
4F) even better than WT and complemented strains. In contrast, Mtb lacking Lpd was
unable to grow on leucine or isoleucine. In this respect, Lpd-deficient Mtb phenocopied Mtb
lacking both Icl1 and Icl2 (See Figures 4E, 4F online). Thus, both Lpd and the methylcitrate
cycle and/or glyoxylate shunt are required for growth on branched chain amino acids. In
contrast, absence of DlaT augmented the ability of Mtb to grow on these substrates, perhaps
by forcing Mtb to express an Lpd-dependent enzyme that metabolizes them. Neither the
mutants nor WT Mtb was able to grow on valine.
Appearance of BCKADH in PDH-deficient Mtb
To identify proteins that complex with Lpd in different circumstances, we generated FLAG-
HA-tagged Lpd and introduced it into both the lpdC and dlaT mutants (ΔlpdC::FLAGlpdC
and ΔdlaT::FLAGlpdC). FLAG-HA-tagged Lpd restored growth of the lpdC mutant in 7H9
medium to WT levels, suggesting that the tag did not interfere with Lpd’s functional
associations. Introduction of FLAG-HA-tagged Lpd into the dlaT mutant had no discernible
effect on its growth (See Figure S5A online). After 28 days of growth in 7H9 medium, we
lysed the bacteria and immunoprecipitated Lpd using α-FLAG antibody. E2’s of ketoacid
dehydrogenase complexes require lipoic acid as a prosthetic group (Perham, 2000). In
earlier work, DlaT was the only lipoylated protein we could detect in WT Mtb (Bryk et al.,
2002). In ΔlpdC::FLAGlpdC, DlaT was the major interacting partner of Lpd and was again
the only lipoylated protein observed in the immunoprecipitate (Figure 5A). In contrast, in
the ΔdlaT::FLAGlpdC strain, Lpd co-immunoprecipitated with PdhA, PdhB and PdhC, as
identified by peptide mass fingerprinting (See supplementary Table 1 online). An antibody
we raised against pure, recombinant PdhC immunoblotted a protein in the latter
immunoprecipitate that migrated at 42 kDa, as expected for PdhC. The anti-PdhC antibody
reacted with nothing in a control immunoprecipitate prepared from lysates of ΔdlaT Mtb in
which native LpdC did not carry the FLAG epitope (Figure 5A). The results with anti-PdhC
antibody strongly reinforced the mass spectroscopic evidence that PdhC associates
specifically with LpdC. Finally, in the anti-LpdC-FLAG immunoprecipiates from lysates of
ΔdlaT Mtb, a unique protein became lipoylated instead of DlaT, and it co-migrated with
PdhC (Figure 5A).
Next, we monitored the status of protein lipoylation in the total lysates of Mtb strains rather
than only in Lpd-interacting proteins, again focusing on 28-day cultures. In DlaT-deficient
Mtb, we detected only one lipolylated protein. It migrated at ~42 KDa and co-migrated with
the upper band in the doublet immunoblotted by anti-PdhC (Figure 5B). The lower band in
the doublet thus corresponds to PdhC that was not lipoylated. Although there was a non-
lipoylated fraction of PdhC in Mtb lysates, the PdhC recovered from anti-Lpd
immunoprecipitates migrated as a singlet (Figure 5A). These observations suggest that only
lipoylated PdhC binds LpdC. In contrast, only DlaT was lipoylated in WT and Lpd-deficient
Mtb. Moreover, the level of PdhC in DlaT-deficient Mtb appeared to be higher than in WT
Mtb or Lpd-deficient Mtb. Consistent with this, transcripts for pdhA and pdhC were 8-fold
higher in DlaT-deficient Mtb than in WT and Lpd-deficient strains (Figure 5C). Deep

sequencing of the transcriptomes of WT and DlaT-deficient Mtb revealed that pdhA, pdhB
and pdhC were the most highly upregulated genes in the dlaT mutant, being expressed at
levels 14.3-, 12.5- and 12.5-fold, respectively, over the levels in WT Mtb (R.B., unpublished
observations). We amplified cDNA across the junctions of pdhA-B and pdhB-C and verified
that pdhABC are transcribed as an operon (See Figure S5B online).
Finally, BCKADH activity was evident in lysates from 28-day cultures of DlaT-deficient
Mtb with 3-methyl 2-oxobutyrate (3M2OB) as a substrate (Figure 5D). Lysates from WT,
Lpd-deficient, and DlaT-complemented strains showed no BCKADH activity (Figures 5E,
5F; see Figure 5C online). Lysates from 14-day WT and ΔlpdC cultures lacked BCKADH
activity while lysates from 14-day ΔdlaT cultures showed very low levels of BCKADH
activity (See Figure S5D online). As a control, we also measured PDH activity in WT and
mutant lysates. As expected, only the WT strain carried out this reaction (See Figure 5E
online).
Thus, in the absence of DlaT, Mtb upregulated pdhABC, expressed readily detectable
quantities of lipoylated PdhC in complex with Lpd and acquired the ability to metabolize
branched chain keto acids.
Recapitulation of Lpd Deficiency by Double Deficiency of DlaT and PdhC
To help confirm the foregoing interpretations, we deleted pdhC from H37Rv, generating
ΔpdhC, as well as from H37RvΔdlaT, generating ΔdlaTΔpdhC. We confirmed the
disruption of pdhC by western (Fig. 6A) and Southern blotting and qRT-PCR (See Figures
S6A, S6B online). The strain ΔdlaTΔpdhC was severely attenuated in its ability to grow in
7H9 containing glycerol and dextrose, as well as on leucine or isoleucine, thus
phenocopying ΔlpdC. The strain lacking only PdhC did not appear to have a growth defect
in any of these conditions, suggesting that when PdhC is missing, these substrates may be
metabolized via PDH. Only when the E2’s of PDH and BCKADH were both missing did it
appear that glycolytic and branched chain carbon sources could no longer be metabolized.
Introduction of a single copy of the dlaT gene into ΔdlaTΔpdhC, generating
ΔdlaTΔpdhC::dlaT, complemented all growth phenotypes to WT levels (Figures 6B – 6D).
Finally, we infected C57Bl/6 mice with both the ΔpdhC and the ΔdlaTΔpdhC mutants. As
controls, we also infected mice with ΔdlaTΔpdhC::dlaT, ΔlpdC or ΔdlaT. The ΔpdhC
mutant resembled WT Mtb (See Figures S6C online) in its virulence. Reproducibly, the
ΔdlaTΔpdhC strain could not be recovered at day 1, despite equal input into the aerosolizer.
However, by day 7, the ΔdlaTΔpdhC and ΔlpdC mutants were both recovered at ~100
CFU’s. This suggests that the ΔdlaTΔpdhC mutant was viable but non-culturable at day 1,
for unknown reasons. At day 35, the ΔlpdC strain could no longer be recovered. At that
point, and at day 190, the ΔdlaTΔpdhC mutant was 2-3 log more attenuated than the ΔdlaT
mutant, but more virulent than the ΔlpdC mutant. Complementation of the double knockout
with dlaT restored WT virulence levels (Figure 6E). Thus, both PDH and BCKADH
complexes are jointly required for virulence of Mtb. However, the finding that the
ΔdlaTΔpdhC mutant was not as attenuated as the ΔlpdC mutant suggests Lpd may play a
fourth important role over and above its contributions to PDH, BCKADH and PNR/P.
DISCUSSION
This work sheds light on three facets of our understanding of host-pathogen interactions in
experimental tuberculosis: how we assess the nutritional composition of the host niche; how
a pathogen adapts to nutritional challenges; and how targets are validated in the search for
anti-infectives that hold promise to be effective against Mtb in the host.

One major avenue in the study of host-pathogen relationships is to infer the properties of the
pathogen’s survival and growth niches in the host by assessing the phenotype of the
pathogen when specific enzymes have been knocked out. Attenuation by knockout of a
metabolic enzyme is often interpreted to mean that the pathogen must subsist in the host on
that enzyme’s substrate(s). This line of reasoning requires two key inputs: an accurate
understanding of what reactions the enzyme catalyzes, which may be different from what
was expected; and an assessment of whether the phenotype may reflect not lack of the
enzyme’s products, but rather, intoxication by substrates that accumulate in its absence. The
extent to which metabolic substrates will actually accumulate in the absence of a given
enzyme is difficult to predict. Most metabolites lie on multiple enzymatic pathways. We
have insufficient knowledge of alternative pathways and their rate constants, particularly in
the setting where one major route is inactivated and others may then be adaptively
modulated, not only by transcription but also by changes in negative and positive feedback
by substrates and products.
For example, Mtb is severely attenuated in the mouse by combined inactivation of icl1 and
icl2 (Munoz-Elias and McKinney, 2005). While this was initially interpreted as reporting
that Mtb subsists in vivo on fatty acids, subsequent in vitro studies with mutants of M.
smegmatis cultured on various carbon sources led to an alternative interpretation, that poor
survival of Mtb lacking Icl1 and Icl2 may reflect intoxication by accumulation of propionate
and its metabolites (Upton and McKinney, 2007). That disruption of a gene encoding an
enzyme can prove lethal from accumulation of toxic precursors was recently demonstrated
for the Mtb maltosyltransferase encoded by glgE (Kalscheuer et al., 2010). Similarly, Pethe
et al. identified pyrimidine-imidazoles that killed Mtb in vitro by promoting accumulation of
glycerol-phosphate in a standard growth medium containing glycerol (Kevin Pethe, 2010).
Although Mtb requires leucine to survive, excess leucine in the growth medium proved toxic
(data not shown). This is reminiscent of maple syrup urine disease, an autosomal recessive
disorder of humans in which insufficiency of BCKADH leads to accumulation of toxic
levels of branched chain amino keto acids (Mackenzie and Woolf, 1959). In the present
work, disruption of lpdC led to extraordinary accumulations of pyruvate and branched chain
amino and keto acids. These accumulations may cause this strain’s marked attenuation.
Metabolomic analysis was invaluable for allowing us to recognize this possibility. Thus, the
first implication of our findings is that metabolomic analysis provides an important
complement to gene knockout studies in studies aimed at inferring the nutritional
composition of the pathogen’s niche in the host.
Another fundamental goal of studying host-pathogen interactions is to understand the
molecular basis of the pathogen’s adaptability to changing conditions. Adaptability is
critical to pathogenesis, both when the pathogen changes niches upon infecting a new host
and when the host responds to infection in ways that alter the niche. The present work has
demonstrated a remarkably slow, extremely specific and functionally important adaptation
by Mtb that consists in switching lipoylation from one protein substrate to an alternative
protein substrate. Thus, when the E2 of PDH was genetically deleted, Mtb upregulated
pdhABC, accumulated lipolyated PdhC and expressed a BCKADH whose function was
evident in the distribution of metabolites and the activity of lysates. In light of these
findings, Rv2497c, Rv2496c and Rv2495c can be re-annotated as bkdA, bkdB and bkdC,
respectively. In contrast, WT and Lpd-deficient Mtb grown on a standard rich medium in
vitro either did not express a functional BCKADH complex or expressed it at levels below
our ability to detect it.
Yet another important goal of studying host-pathogen interactions is to guide the
development of anti-infectives that are effective in vivo because they cripple pathways on

which the pathogen actually depends in vivo. This has been difficult to predict from studies
in vitro. A pathway can be essential in vitro but not in vivo (Kevin Pethe, 2010), or essential
in vivo but not in vitro (Munoz-Elias and McKinney, 2005). Thus, it is important to learn
that ΔlpdC Mtb was markedly attenuated in vivo. This could not have been predicted from
our limited understanding of central carbon metabolism in Mtb.
It has commonly been thought that intermediary metabolism in Mtb mirrors that in other
organisms and is therefore well understood. In fact, Mtb’s core intermediary metabolism
diverges markedly from the standard model. For example, the tricarboxylic acid cycle is
interrupted by the lack of αKGDH (Tian et al., 2005b). A unique anaerobic-type but
aerobically-active ferredoxin oxidoreductase acts on α-ketoglutarate (Baughn et al., 2009),
but metabolomic analysis does not support the interpretation that the oxidative and reductive
arms of the tricarboxylic acid cycle are fully joined (de Carvalho et al., 2010). Additionally,
the pentose phosphate pathway and tricarboxylic acid cycle in Mtb are extensively
compartmentalized from each other (de Carvalho et al., 2010). In short, core intermediary
metabolism in Mtb is vitally important but incompletely understood. Combining genetics,
biochemistry, metabolomics and infections can help fill this gap.
We were surprised to discover that Mtb was more attenuated by lack of Lpd than by lack of
DlaT or even by lack of both DlaT and PdhC. Lpd clearly has important functions that it
does not share with DlaT. At present, participation in BCKADH is the only such function
identified. Transcription of bkdABC was detected in Mtb recovered from lungs of mice, but
only at the same low level as in Mtb grown in rich medium in vitro (Talaat et al., 2004).
This leaves open the question whether BCKADH is expressed at the protein level to an
extent that can contribute to the metabolism of PDH-replete Mtb during infection of the
mouse, or only plays a role when it is upregulated, for example, in the context of insufficient
PDH activity. In either setting, BCKADH might be critical to Mtb’s survival for several
reasons. Above, we stressed the role in avoiding accumulation of pyruvate, branched chain
amino acids and branched chain ketoacids. Additionally or alternatively, in glucose-limiting
conditions in vivo, Mtb may operate a phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP)-glyoxylate pathway,
whose activity is dependent on PDH (Fischer and Sauer, 2003; Munoz-Elias and McKinney,
2006). In the absence of PDH, BCKADH may be able to shunt metabolites from pyruvate to
acetyl coA, as is required for the functioning of the PEP-glyoxylate pathway. In vitro,
carbon-starved Mtb upregulated transcripts for bkdA, bkdB, bkdC and icl1 (Betts et al.,
2002). Thus, when otherwise facing starvation, Mtb may metabolize branched chain keto
and amino acids via BCKADH as a source of energy. Finally, BCKADH may help regulate
the levels of branched-chain lipids. Inactivation of the BCKADH complex in S. aureus and
M. xanthus led to a decrease in quantity of branched chain fatty acids in the cell membrane
and rendered the mutants more susceptible to a variety of stresses (Singh et al., 2008; Toal et
al., 1995). Changes in Mtb’s branched chain fatty acids likewise affect Mtb’s virulence
(Glickman and Jacobs, 2001). Thus, the present work establishes the contribution of LpdC
to BCKADH in Mtb and the essentiality of LpdC for Mtb’s virulence in the mouse.
However, it is not yet clear how BCKADH contributes to Mtb’s virulence.
The essentiality of mycobacterial Lpd in the mouse and the participation of this one protein
in at least three different enzyme complexes (Figure 7) suggest that Lpd might be a
promising target for chemotherapy of tuberculosis. The triazospirodimethoxybenzoyl
inhibitor that inhibits Mtb’s Lpd while sparing human Lpd was not able to enter intact Mtb
but its identification demonstrates that species-selective Lpd inhibition is attainable (Bryk et
al., 2010).

Experimental Procedures
Strains and Culture Conditions
WT Mtb H37Rv, mutants and complemented strains were cultured at 37 °C in Middlebrook
7H9 with 0.2% glycerol, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V (BSA), 0.05% Tween 80,
0.2% dextrose and 0.085% sodium chloride (standard medium). Studies on defined carbon
sources (0.2%) used fatty acid-stripped BSA (Roche) without glycerol and dextrose with
tyloxapol (0.02%) and vitamin B12 (10 μg/ml) (Savvi et al., 2008). CFU were determined
on 7H11 agar plates after 4 weeks at 37 °C. Strains bearing antibiotic resistance cassettes
were cultured in the presence of hygromycin (50 mg/ml), kanamycin (30 μg/ml),
streptomycin (30 μg/ml) or zeocin (25 μg/ml). For growth on solid medium, Middlebrook
7H11 was supplemented with 0.5% glycerol and 10% oleic acid-dextrose-catalase (7H11-
OADC).
Mutant Strains
Efforts to delete lpdC (Rv0462, lpdC) from the genome of Mtb H37Rv were initially
unsuccessful. We cloned lpdC into an integrative complementation vector (pMV306k)
downstream of a constitutively active hsp60 promoter. pMV306k-hsp60lpdC was
transformed into WT H37Rv to create a merodiploid strain carrying lpdC at its native site as
well as at the attB site (H37Rv::lpdC). LpdC was deleted from the native site of the H37Rv
merodiploid strain via a single step recombination using the mycobacteriophage pHAE87
(Bardarov et al., 1997). 550 base pairs upstream and 500 base pairs downstream of lpdC
were cloned into the plasmid pJSC284 flanking a hygromycin resistance cassette. The
recombinant mycobacteriophage was used to infect H37Rv::lpdC. Knockout colonies were
screened by PCR and confirmed by Southern blotting. The complementing plasmid was
switched out of the attB site with an empty plasmid bearing a streptomycin resistance
cassette, pTCS-mcs1, creating H37RvΔlpdC pTCS-mcs1 (H37RvΔlpdC).
To construct FLAG-HA tagged lpdC, an N-terminal FLAG-HA tag (codon optimized for
use in Mtb) was fused to lpdC by PCR, deleting the N terminal valine of Lpd (FLAG-Lpd).
This was cloned into an episomal plasmid, pTEK-hsp60, downstream of the hsp60 promoter.
pTEK hsp60 nFLAG-HAlpdC was transformed into H37RvΔlpdC (ΔlpdC::FLAGlpdC) and
H37RvΔdlaT (ΔdlaT::FLAGlpdC).
PdhC (Rv2495c) was deleted via single step recombination using the mycobacteriophage
pHAE87 with a streptomycin resistance cassette. Regions flanking pdhC (727 bp upstream,
717 bp downstream) were cloned on either side of the streptomycin cassette. The
recombinant mycobacteriophage infected H37Rv and H37RvΔdlaT::dlaT, creating
H37RvΔpdhC and H37RvΔpdhCΔdlaT::dlaT. Colonies were screened by PCR and
confirmed by Southern blotting. To create a strain lacking both DlaT and PdhC, the
complementing plasmid was switched out of the attB site of H37RvΔpdhCΔdlaT::dlaT with
an empty plasmid bearing a zeocin resistance cassette, pTCZ-MCS1, creating
H37RvΔpdhCΔdlaT pTCZ-mcs1 (ΔpdhCΔdlaT).
To confirm deletion of lpdC, genomic DNA from WT H37Rv and knockout candidates was
digested with XmaI and NcoI, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a
nylon membrane that was probed with a 500-bp digoxygenin-labeled fragment containing
the upstream lpdC 5′ flanking fragment, revealing a 4.5 Kb band for WT Mtb, and a 2.7 Kb
band for lpdC deficient Mtb.
Genomic DNA from H37RvΔpdhC and H37RvΔpdhCΔdlaT::dlaT was digested with EcoRV
and XmaI and transferred to a nylon membrane that was probed with a fragment containing
300 bp of pdhB yielding a 1.5-Kb fragment for WT and a 3.5-kb fragment for pdhC

deficient Mtb upon Southern blotting with the ECL Direct Nucleic Acid Labeling and
Detection System (Amersham).
Antisera to Lpd and PdhC
Recombinant Lpd purified as reported (Argyrou and Blanchard, 2001) was used to
immunize chickens. Recombinant PdhC purified as reported (Tian et al., 2005b) was used to
immunize rabbits.
Stress Assays
For nitrosative stress, Mtb strains were grown to mid log phase and washed twice in 7H9
acidified to pH 5.5 with HCl. Cultures were centrifuged at 120 g for 10 minutes to remove
clumps. Supernatants were adjusted to an OD580 = 0.1, NaNO2 was added and CFU were
determined after 4 days. For oxidative stress, Mtb strains prepared as above but in non-
acidified medium were adjusted to an OD580 = 0.1, H2O2 was added and CFU were
determined after 4 hours. For other stresses, Mtb strains prepared as above were adjusted to
OD580 = 0.1 and SDS or antibiotics were added. CFU were determined after 1 hour with to
SDS and after 4 hours with lipophilic antibiotics. All experiments were performed in
triplicate with serial dilution and plating on 7H11 agar, counting CFU after 4 weeks at 37
°C.
Mouse Infections
C57BL/6 WT and IFNγ−/− mice (Jackson Labs) were infected using an Inhalation Exposure
System (Glas-Col). Early-mid log phase Mtb was washed once in PBS containing with
0.05% Tween 80 (PBST) and centrifuged at 120 g to remove clumps. The inoculum (6 ml,
OD580 0.002 – 0.005) was nebulized for 40 minutes. Lungs and spleen were homogenized in
PBS, serially diluted and plated on 7H11 agar. For mice infected with Lpd-deficient or
DlaT/PdhC-deficient Mtb, entire organ homogenates were plated on 7H11-OADC plates,
except in mice euthanatized on days 64 and 164, where the upper left lobe was reserved for
histology. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 5 weeks if no CFU were detected earlier. In
most experiments, the upper lobe of the left lung was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
histopathology.
Macrophage Infections
Marrow cells were flushed from femurs of 8-10 week old C57BL/6 mice and incubated for 6
days at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM (GIBCO) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum,
20% L929 fibroblast-conditioned medium (LCM), 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Mediatech Inc.),
10 mM Hepes (GIBCO) and 0.58 g/L L-glutamine (Mediatech Inc.). Cells were fed with the
same medium at day 4 and seeded in 48 well plates on day 6 (Ehrt et al., 2001). Where
indicated, macrophages were stimulated with IFNγ (10 ng/ml, R&D Systems). Mid-log Mtb
cultures were washed twice in PBS + 0.05% Tween 80 (PBST). Clumps were removed by
centrifugation at 120 g and the macrophages were infected with 0.1 Mtb per macrophage.
CFU were assessed over 6 days (Ehrt et al., 2001).
Quantitative Real Time PCR
We grew Mtb in standard medium starting at an OD580 of 0.05 for 14 and 28 days and added
an equal volume of buffer containing guanidium thiocyanate (4 M), sodium lauryl sulfate
(0.5%), trisodium citrate (25 mM), and 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 M). Cultures were pelleted,
resuspended in TRIzol and bead-beaten 3 times. RNA was extracted and qRT-PCR
performed using gene-specific Taqman probes and primers (Biosearch Technologies).

Analysis of Intracellular Metabolites
Mtb was grown to mid-log phase in standard medium and diluted to an OD580 of 0.2. One
ml of each culture was filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (0.22 μM, Millipore
GSWP 02500). Mtb-bearing filters were placed on individual 7H9 agar plates supplemented
with 0.5% glycerol, 0.5% BSA, 0.2% dextrose, and 0.085% sodium chloride with the
bacterial surface on top. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 14 and 28 days.
Filters were flipped onto a 1-ml ice-cold solution of 40% acetonitrile, 40% methanol and
20% water. Bacteria were scraped off the filter and lysed by bead beading 3 times.
Intracellular metabolites and those that had leaked into the lysis solution were pooled as
described (de Carvalho, 2010). Metabolite abundances were quantified using a calibration
curve generated with chemical standards spiked into homologous mycobacterial extracts to
correct for matrix-associated ion suppression effects. Protein was measured using the Biorad
DC assay (Biorad). Ion counts of specific metabolites were normalized to total protein.
Statistical significance was assessed using the Mann-Whitney T test. *, p < 0.02.
Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation
Mtb was grown to late stationary phase (28 days in culture) in standard medium, pelleted,
washed twice in PBST, and resuspended in potassium phosphate buffer (KPi, 25 mM)
containing EDTA (1 mM) and PMSF (1 mM). Lysates were prepared by bead-beating 3
times and pelleting at 20,000 g. Proteins (15-30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblots used: anti-Lpd (1:5000); anti-PdhC
(1:5000); anti-DlaT (1:10,000) (Bryk et al., 2002); and anti-PrcB (1:10,000) (Gandotra et al.,
2007); or anti-lipoic acid (Calbiochem, 1:2500). Secondary antibodies used were rabbit anti-
chicken IgY (Promega, 1:5000) and donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham, 1: 10,000). Lysates
of late log phase cultures of ΔlpdC::FLAGlpdC, ΔdlaT::FLAGlpdC, H37Rv and
H37RvΔdlaT were adjusted to 5 mg/ml with the lysis buffer, pre-cleared with Sepharose
beads for 1 hour and incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads (SIGMA) at 4 °C overnight.
Beads were washed 3 times using wash buffer (WB300) containing Tris pH 7.4 (20 mM),
NaCl (300 mM), glycerol (10%), EDTA (0.2 mM), Triton X-100 (0.2%), PMSF (1 mM) and
DTT (1 mM). The beads were then washed with WB100 buffer containing only 100 mM
NaCl and eluted in WB100 containing 2x FLAG peptide (SIGMA) for SDS-PAGE and
western blotting.
Enzyme Assays
Lysates of late log phase cultures (1 mg protein/mL) were incubated in cuvettes at 37 °C in
KPi (25 mM) with NAD (1 mM), thiamine pyrophosphate (0.2 mM), coenzyme A (0.17
mM) and MgCl (1mM) and 3-methyl 2-oxobutyrate (2 mM) (Fluka). Production of NADH
was monitored at 340 nm in a Uvikon XL spectrophotometer.
