Background:
Increasing research reports neurological manifestations of COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 shares
homology with other human coronaviruses that have also had nervous system involvement.
Objective:
To
review
the
neurological
aspects
of
SARS-cov2
and
other
coronavirus,
including
transmission
pathways, mechanisms of invasion into the nervous system, and mechanisms of neurological disease.
Methods:
We conducted a systematic review of articles in PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE data bases. Reviewed
evidence is presented in sections of this manuscript which includes pathogenesis, neuro-invasion, encephalitis,
Guillain-Barré, ADEM, multiple sclerosis, polyneuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease.
Results:
A
total
67
studies
were
included
in
the
ﬁnal
analysis
of
experimental
studies,
case
reports,
series
of
cases, cohort studies, and systematic reviews related to neurological manifestations of SARS- CoV-2 and other
human coronavirus infections.
The
SARS-CoV-2
receptor
is
expressed
in
the
nervous
system.
Common
reported
symptoms
included
hy-
posmia, headaches, weakness, altered consciousness. Encephalitis, demyelination, neuropathy, and stroke have
been
associated
with
COVID-19.
Infection through
the cribriform
plate
and
olfactory
bulb
and
dissemination
through
trans-synaptic
transfer
are
some
of
the
mechanisms
proposed.
Invasion
of
the
medullary
cardior-
espiratory center by SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the refractory respiratory failure observed in critically-ill
COVID-19 patients.
Conclusion:
An increasing number of reports of COVID-19 patients with neurological disorders add to emergent
experimental
models with neuro-invasion
as a reasonable concern that
SARS-CoV-2 is a new neuropathogen.
How it may cause acute and chronic neurologic disorders needs to be clariﬁed in future research.

Introduction
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared
the
infection
of
coronavirus
(CoV)
severe
acute
respiratory
syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) a pandemic [1]. Since being ﬁrst identiﬁed
in Wuhan, China [2], it has rapidly spread around the world, with more
than 4,000,000 reported cases to date [3]. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar
in
structure
and
infection
mechanism
to
other
known
coronaviruses,
such
as the
SARS-CoV
and
Middle
East respiratory
syndrome (MERS)
[4,5]. The
respiratory system is the most commonly aﬀected, but nu-
merous
experimental
studies
and
case
reports
on
these
viruses
have
shown their potential neurotropism. According to observational studies,
SARS-CoV-2
patients
have
presented
with
complaints
of
headache,
nausea,
vomiting,
myalgia,
dizziness
[5],
hypogeusia,
hyposmia
and
impaired consciousness [6], symptoms that suggest involvement of the
nervous system.
Although the exact mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 penetrates the
central nervous system (CNS) has not yet been established, two possi-
bilities appear to oﬀer the most likely explanations: 1) hematogenous
spread of SARS-CoV-2 from systemic circulation to cerebral circulation,
where the slower ﬂow is conducive to the virus damaging the capillary
endothelium and gaining access to the brain [7] and 2) dissemination
through the cribriform plate and olfactory bulb [8].
Prior experimental models have shown that other coronaviruses can
compromise
the
nervous
system
and
the
respiratory
drive
by
directly
targeting
neurons
located
in
the
cardiorespiratory
centers
[8–10].
Preliminary observation of cases seen in the 2019 coronavirus disease
(COVID-19)
pandemic,
however,
suggests
that
the
SARS-CoV-2
virus
may have a higher aﬃnity for CNS targets.
This
review
aims
to
create
a
systematic
compilation

neurological symptoms seen in these cases as well as reviewing possible
transmission
pathways
of
SARS-CoV-2.
Finally,
we
will
explore
the
mechanisms by which coronaviruses aﬀect speciﬁc regions of the ner-
vous system.

Methods
We searched PubMed, SCOPUS and EMBASE databases. We speci-
ﬁcally screened studies that were published between January 1990 and
April 2020 to ensure our results were relevant. The following research
terms
were
used:
Coronavirus,
SARS,
COVID-19,
SARS-CoV-2,
neu-
rology,
mechanism,
axonal,
polyneuropathy,
stroke,
cardiovascular
disease,
multiple
sclerosis,
neuroinvasion,
acute
disseminated
en-
cephalomyelitis
(ADEM),
myopathy,
neuromuscular,
Guillain–Barré
syndrome
(GBS),
encephalitis,
encephalopathy
and
symptoms.
Restrictions were imposed to exclude studies without detailed metho-
dological reporting. The publications that were not peer reviewed were
also excluded from this study. PRISMA criteria were applied.
The screening of titles and abstracts was performed by the authors.
The
full
texts
were
reviewed
in
a
second
screening.
The
papers
were
considered where a study was designated as a case report, cohort study,
series
of
cases,
ecological
study,
systematic
review,
metanalysis
or
clinical trial related to the neurological manifestations of coronavirus
infections. We restricted our search to studies published in English.
3.
Search results
Our literature search identiﬁed 324 abstracts, 80 of which were full
text articles focused on the neurological manifestations of coronavirus
infections.
Among
the
80
detailed
full-text
articles,
17
non-peer
re-
viewed publications were excluded from the study and 6 studies were
not available in full text. A total of 67 studies was included in the ﬁnal
analysis.
Of
these
studies,
12
were
systematic
reviews,
15
were
ex-
perimental
model
studies,
21
were
series
of
cases,
3
were
cases
and
controls
and
16
were
case
reports.
Some
studies
contributed
to
more
than one section in this review. Detailed characteristics of the studies
included are presented in Tables 1 and 2.

Pathogenesis
SARS-CoV-2
has
a
spike
protein
surface
unit
1
that
has
a
high
binding aﬃnity to the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme
2 (ACE2) [11]. The increased expression of ACE2 in the epithelial cells
in the lower respiratory tract facilitates viral entry by fusion with the
cell
membrane
[12,13].
The
expression
of
the
ACE2
receptors
likely
explains the involvement of medullary structures by SARS-CoV-2, but is
less
likely
to
be
an
explanation
for
the
involvement
of
the
temporo-
limbic structures by the virus. ACE2 is strongly expressed in the ven-
trolateral medulla and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius, two areas
that
are
closely
involved
in
the
regulation
of
the
respiratory
cycle
[14,15] (Table 1). However, the aﬃnity of the virus for the olfactory
bulb is likely mediated by a diﬀerent, yet unidentiﬁed mechanism. In
rodents, transnasal exposure to SARS-CoV resulted in the rapid detec-
tion
of the
virus in
the piriform
and infralimbic
cortex,
basal
ganglia
and the midbrain, all of which have direct neuronal connections with
the olfactory bulb [8]. Once the virus was established in the brain, there
was
evidence
of
dissemination
along
the
neurotransmitter
pathways,
such
as
the
serotonergic
dorsal
raphe
system
or
hematogenously
through the Virchow–Robin spaces. Prior studies have shown that both
SARS-CoV
and
MERS
[10]
directly
induced
neuronal
death
in
the
re-
spiratory
center
in
the
medulla
through
an
upregulation
of
IL-1,
IL-6
and
TNF
alpha
cytokine
response,
possibly
through
either
an
in-
ﬂammatory response or autophagy [8,16]. However, these observations
were conducted with SARS, and further studies will be needed to de-
termine
whether
they
are
also
applicable
to
the
novel
SARS-CoV-2
virus.
5.
Progression of the virus in the nervous system
A neuronal dissemination model of coronavirus invasion, in which
the
virus
infects
a
peripheral
neuron
and
relies
on
the
machinery
of
active
transport,
synaptic
terminals
and
retrograde
transport
to
the
neuronal
cell
body
in
remote
areas
of
the
brain,
has
been
postulated
[7].
This
trans-synaptic
transfer
mechanism
is
supported
by
studies
involving
the
hemagglutinating
encephalomyelitis
virus
strain
67
N
(HEV-67 N), the ﬁrst CoV strain that was found to invade the porcine
brain [4].

Clinical data from 214 patients with COVID-19 demonstrated neu-
rological
symptoms in 36.4 %
of patients. Neurological symptoms in-
cluded headache, impaired consciousness, ataxia, acute cerebrovascular
disease, seizures, hyposmia, hypogeusia and neuralgias. The data sug-
gests that patients with more severe systemic presentations were more
likely
to
have
neurologic
symptoms,
such
as
acute
cerebrovascular
diseases (5.7 % vs. 0.8 %), impaired consciousness (14.8 % vs. 2.4 %)
and skeletal muscle injury (19.3 % vs. 4.8 %), in comparison with those
with milder forms of the infection [6].
Less
speciﬁc
“neurological-type”
symptoms
that
are
also
common
with
other
viral
infections
have
also
been
reported
with
COVID-19.
While
their
presence
may
suggest
some
degree
of
nervous
system
in-
volvement,
their
signiﬁcance
is
still
unclear
in
some
cases.
In
an
ob-
servational study of 41 patients with COVID-19, headache was found in
8% of patients and myalgia was found in 12 % [17]. In most of these
cases, headaches appeared to be a non-speciﬁc symptom, without fea-
tures
suggestive
of
meningeal
irritation.
The
occurrence
of
isolated
headaches in the absence of other neurological-type symptoms suggests
the mechanism was more likely due to the systemic illness rather than a
primary
invasion
of
the
CNS
by
the
virus.
An
observational report
of
138 patients with COVID-19 showed that fatigue was present in 69.6 %
of patients, myalgia was reported in 34.8 % and headache in 6.5 % on
admission
[5].
Similarly,
an
observational
study
of
99
patients
with
COVID-19 showed confusion in 9% of patients and headache in 8% of
patients
[18].
In
another
observational
study
in
Wuhan,
headaches
were reported by 34 % of COVID-19 positive patients [19] (Table 2).
6.
Multiple sclerosis and CoV
Multiple experimental models have used human coronavirus (HCV)
to
explore
the
environmental
component
triggering
the
autoimmune
changes
seen
in
multiple
sclerosis
(MS)
[20–23].
Toll-like
receptors
(TLRs),
which
are
involved
in
host
defense
and
in
the
recognition
of
invading
pathogens,
play
a
role
in
MS
pathophysiology.
It
has
been
postulated
that
viral
particles
are
recognized
by
these
receptors
and
contribute to the modiﬁcation of the immune response of patients de-
veloping MS. This interaction shows a potential link between viral in-
fections, including coronavirus, and the development of demyelinating
diseases [24].
An observational study targeted the detection of HCV RNA in a large
panel of human brain autopsy samples. Reverse transcription-PCR for
229E and OC43 coronavirus strains was performed on samples from 39
patients
with
MS
and
51
patients
with
other
neurological
diseases
or
normal
controls.
A
statistically
signiﬁcant
higher
prevalence
of
OC43
was observed in MS patients (35.9 %; 14 of 39) as compared to controls
(13.7 %; 7 of 51) [25]. Another observational study showed that 4 out
of 21 specimens from a white matter plaque, normal-appearing white
matter, gray matter and cervical cord tissue of MS patients tested for
HCV-229E nucleic acid, consistently gave positive results while none of
the
11
control
brain
specimens
did
so.
A
similar
study
reported
the
detection of murine like coronaviruses in 12 of 22 MS brains [26]. This
association
is
also
supported
by
the
observation
of
coronavirus-like
particles
in
the
perivascular
cuﬃng
of
an
MS
plaque
intrathecal
synthesis of antibodies to HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 in a proportion of
MS
patients,
in
addition
to
the
isolation
of
HCV
from
MS
patients’
brains [27].
Direct
inoculation
of
the
blood-brain-barrier
endothelial
cells
and
persistence of infection in a leukocytic cell line allows CoV to not only
infect
the
macrophages
and
dendritic
cells,
but
to
also
modulate
the
innate
immunity
system
as
a
whole
[28].
Experimental
models
per-
formed in susceptible strains of mice inoculated with the coronavirus
JHMV
strain
resulted
in
an
acute
encephalomyelitis
followed
by
a
chronic
demyelinating
disease
[29].
In
addition,
multiple
models
of
murine
coronavirus
induced
demyelinating
diseases
in
rodents
[21],
either through a persistent infection of oligodendrocytes or astrocytes
or
by
autoimmune
stimulation
against
myelin
basic
protein
that
contributed
to
the
postulated
molecular
mimicry
[30].
Despite
these
ﬁndings
associating
some
alfa
and
beta
coronaviruses
with
demyeli-
nating disease, a connection between SARS-CoV-2 and MS has not been
demonstrated, however an eventual association can be expected.
7.
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and CoV
Multiple
experimental
studies
inoculating
CoV
in
mice
showed
myelin loss in the spinal cords of mice in the acute phase of infection
[31]
and
myelin
destruction
2–3
weeks
post
infection
[32,33].
There
was a case of a 15 year old child with initial upper respiratory symp-
toms
and
subsequent
ADEM,
in
which
both
the
cerebrospinal
ﬂuid
(CSF)
and
nasopharyngeal
specimens
were
reported
as
positive
for
HCV-OC43 [34]. Another report showed a case of a 71 years old posi-
tive
for
MERS-CoV
infection
who
developed
new
lesions
in
the
peri-
ventricular
deep
white
matter,
corpus
callosum,
bilateral
pons,
mid-
brain, left cerebellum and upper cervical cord on the 24th day of the
disease [35]. Despite evidence showing the persistence CoV RNA in the
nervous
system,
even
after
the
acute
phase
of
infection
has
occurred
and
has
caused
neuronal
loss,
more
clinical
research
is
required
to
support a relationship between ADEM and CoV.
8.
Peripheral nervous disease and CoV
Multiple reports have documented acute polyneuropathy in patients
infected with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [6,35–38]. Acute
autoimmune
polyneuropathy
triggered
by
coronavirus
infection
has
been
postulated
[36].
As
found
in
case
report
publications,
most
of
these
patients
were
observed
in
a
critically
ill
context.
Critically
ill
polyneuropathy
(CIP),
prolonged
neuromuscular
blockage,
vitamin
deﬁciencies and electrolyte disturbances, and
drug related neuromus-
cular disorders were usually included in the diﬀerential diagnosis list as
pointed in their discussions [6,35–38].
From a case report including 4 patients with acute neuromuscular
disorders
and
SARS
infection,
3
developed
weakness,
sensorimotor
peripheral nerve symptoms and decreased deep tendon reﬂexes (DTRs)
within
21–25
days after
the
onset
of
SARS.
Nerve
conduction
studies
(NCSs) indicated temporarily reduced compound muscle action poten-
tial
(CMAP)
amplitudes,
and
there
was
no
evident
slowing
of
nerve
conduction velocity, prolonged distal motor latency, conduction block
or
temporal
dispersion.
Electromyography
(EMG)
showed
acute
de-
nervation with increased polyphasia. These patients received intensive
care
for
multiple
organ
failure
from
their
systemic
inﬂammatory
re-
sponse syndrome and, thereby, CIP likely played a signiﬁcant role [37].
In an observational study of 214 patients with a conﬁrmed diagnosis
of
COVID-19,
8.9
%
presented
with
peripheral
nervous
system
(PNS)
symptoms including hypogeusia, hyposmia, hypoplasia and neuralgia.
The
most
common complaints
were
hypogeusia
and
hyposmia.
These
symptoms
could
be
evidence
of
a
coronavirus
neurotropic
invasion
pathway shown in previous research [19].
Another
report
studying
acute
polyneuropathy
in
CoV
included
4
patients
with
Guillain-Barré
syndrome
(GBS)
attributed
to
the
MERS-
CoV infection. One of those was diagnosed with Bickerstaﬀ's brainstem
encephalitis (BBE), a variant of GBS, after showing hypersomnolence,
ophthalmoplegia
and
weakness
in
all
four
limbs
with
cerebrospinal
ﬂuid
(CSF)
studies
being
positive
for
antiganglioside
antibodies
and
albumin
cytologic
dissociation
in
the
CSF
after
a
severe
MERS-CoV
infection.
The
other
two
of
these
patients
were
diagnosed
with
acute
sensory neuropathy in the context of treatment with ribavirin and lo-
pinavir/ritonavir.
Findings
in
the
fourth
patient
were
attributed
to
a
CIP neuropathy [36].
A single case report showed a 28-year-old male with a MERS-CoV
severe respiratory infection that gradually improved. He was found to
have weakness in both legs and an inability to walk with numbness and
tingling
in
stocking
distribution.
Electroneurography
showed
axonal
polyneuropathy. A CIP was assumed as the ﬁnal diagnosis [35].

Similarly, a 3 pat [39]ient case report showed 2 women experien-
cing
motor-predominant
peripheral
nerve
disorders
and
another
woman experiencing neuropathy and myopathy 3 weeks after the onset
of SARS-CoV. Clinical and electrophysiologic improvement was evident
during follow-up examinations, with a good prognosis [38]. GBS in a
child with another beta coronavirus (HCV-OC43) infection, presenting
with unilateral peripheral palsy and bulbar palsy has also been reported
[40].
Based on the current literature twelve cases of GBS have been re-
ported
in
patients
with
COVID-19
infection.
Some
of
them
required
mechanical ventilation. The interval between the onset of viral illness
and
the
development
of
GBS
symptoms
was
approximately
ten
days.
Most
patients
presented
with
paresthesia
and
progressive,
ﬂaccid
quadriparesis and showed Albumin-cytologic dissociation in CSF study.
Acute Inﬂammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy subtype was most
commonly observed and Immunoglobulin was the treatment of choice
in all these reports. [39,41–47]
Developing
axonal
polyneuropathies
in
the
context
of
a
viral
in-
fection suggests that the virus can cause a neural inﬂammatory reaction

mimicry,

of
an

sponse syndrome [36,38]. However, those mechanism of SARS-CoV-2
related neuropathy needs to be clariﬁed.

Acute encephalitis and CoV
The notion that an infectious respiratory pathogen can inﬁltrate the
CNS and lead to brain inﬂammation was tested using HCV-OC43. In this
study,
infection
led
to
the
degeneration
of
neurons
and
ultimately
apoptosis.
Susceptible
mice
samples
after
inoculation
of
HCV-OC43
developed acute encephalitis with viral RNA present for several months
causing neuronal degeneration [48].
Full-length HCV-OC43 RNA was recovered from the brain of an 11-
month-old boy, with severe combined immunodeﬁciency (SCID), who
had
symptoms
of
viral
encephalitis
after
undergoing
a
cord-blood
transplantation. The patient died 1.5 months post-transplantation. RNA
sequencing of a brain biopsy sample obtained 2 months after the onset
of symptoms showed HCV-OC43, which was subsequently conﬁrmed on
real-time PCR and brain immunohistochemical analysis [49].
A
middle-aged
female
with
COVID-19
was
diagnosed
with
necro-
tizing hemorrhagic encephalitis after presenting with a 3-day history of
cough,
fever
and
altered
mental
status.

generalized fatigue and fever, presented with generalized seizures and
altered mental status that progressed to impaired consciousness. Clin-
ical
and
laboratory
evidence
was
suggestive
of
a
viral
meningoence-
phalitis, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in an RT-PCR analysis of the CSF. A
brain MRI revealed changes in the right wall of the lateral ventricle, the
right mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus, which probably correlates
with a SARS-CoV-2 meningitis. Interestingly, the nasopharyngeal swab
specimen for RT-PCR was found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2, raising
an
awareness
of
COVID-19
possible
independent
mechanisms
of
neu-
ropathogenesis [51]. Despite postulated mechanisms of neuronal colo-
nization and clinical reports, stronger evidence for the association be-
tween COVID-19 and encephalitis is needed.
10.
Cerebrovascular disease (CVD) and CoV
Strokes
are
uncommon
complication
of
viral
CNS
infections.
Large
vessel strokes were reported in 5 of 206 SARS-CoV patients in Singapore.
Four
of
those
were
critically
ill
and
3
died.
Two
patients
had
cardiac
dysfunction
and
disseminated
intravascular
coagulation
(DIC),
and
sig-
niﬁcant hypotension was present just before the onset of stroke [52]. An
elevated number of venous thromboembolisms was observed in critically
ill patients with SARS-CoV in another observational report [53].
Case series from Wuhan reported 14 strokes out of 214 patients with
COVID-19. Data showed that patients with severe systemic presentation
and
cardiovascular
risk
factors
were
more
likely
to
have
acute
cere-
brovascular
diseases
[6].
In
a
retrospective
study,
4
elderly
patients
with
multiple
cardiovascular
risk
factors
diagnosed
with
COVID-19
developed
stroke.
Large
vessel
disease
was
documented
as
the
me-
chanism of vascular damage in all of them [54]. Similarly, 5 cases of
stroke in the context of COVID-19 were reported more recently. Three
of these younger patients, had vascular risk factors including diabetes,
dyslipidemia and hypertension. Evidence of occlusion of large vessels,
treated with endovascular therapy was documented in all of them.
This
apparent
association
of
COVID-19
and
stroke,
however,
is
likely
due
to
the
fact
that
both
conditions
share
similar
risk
factors.
There
is
ample
evidence
that
the
severity
of
COVID-19
infection
in
humans
is
directly
related
to
the
presence
of
cardiovascular
co-mor-
bidities,
such
as
hypertension
(HTN),
diabetes
mellitus
(DM)
and
el-
derly
status
predisposing
to
large
vessel
disease
[55].
A
recent
meta-
analysis
of
8
studies
from
China,
including
46,248
infected
patients,
showed
the
most
prevalent
comorbidities
were
HTN
(17
%)
and
DM
(8%), followed by cardiovascular diseases (5%) [57,58]. In those few
reported cases, of patients without vascular risk factors, the SARS-CoV-
2 induced hypercoagulability may be the most important mechanism of
the cerebrovascular disease [54,56].
In
the
setting
of
a
COVID-19
infection,
patients
with
a
previous
history of vascular risk factors [55,57,58] may have an increased risk of
stroke
by
facing
complications
such
as
hypotension,
shock,
ar-
rhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy,
heart
failure
and
DIC
that
can
poten-
tially contribute to hypoperfusion, embolic mechanisms of stroke and
large vessel occlusion [5,18,54,58,59]. In an observational study of 138
hospitalized patients with COVID-19, shock was observed in 8.7 % of
infected
patients,
acute
cardiac
injury
was
present
in
7.2
%,
and
ar-
rhythmia in 16.7 % [5]. Recently, another observational study of 191
patients
in
China
showed
that
23
%
were
complicated
with
heart
failure, 20 % with septic shock, 19 % with coagulopathy, and 17 % with
acute
cardiac
injury
[58].
All
of
which
are
factors
potentially
predis-
posing
patients
to
stroke
[60].
The
presence
of
speciﬁc
viral
factors
directly causing hypercoagulability, arteritis, and endothelial dysfunc-
tion, which can lead to ischemic stroke or brain bleeding, need to be
clariﬁed in further research.

Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic has become a challenging world issue after
its
emergence
in
December
2019.
Despite
its
most
characteristic
symptom
of
respiratory
distress,
patients
with
COVID-19
have
also
shown
neurologic
manifestations.
An
increasing
number
of
reports
of
COVID-19
patients
with
neurological
issues,
in
addition
to
emergent
experimental
models
evidencing
neuroinvasion,
brings
a
reasonable
concern
of
SARS-CoV-2
being
a
new
neuropathogenic
that
remains
underdiagnosed. How it may cause acute and chronic neurologic issues
and
whether
possible
targeting
of
the
medullary
cardiorespiratory
center is contributing to the poor outcomes observed remains unclear.
Exploring the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 is a step towards
better understanding the virus, preventing further spread and treating
patients aﬀected by this pandemic.
