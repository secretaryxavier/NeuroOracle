The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in the activity-dependent regulation of
synaptic structure and function, particularly of the glutamatergic synapses. BDNF may be released in the mature form, which
activates preferentially TrkB receptors, or as proBDNF, which is coupled to the stimulation of the p75NTR. In the mature form
BDNF induces rapid effects on glutamate release, and may induce short- and long-term effects on the postsynaptic response to
the neurotransmitter. BDNF may affect glutamate receptor activity by inducing the phosphorylation of the receptor subunits,
which may also affect the interaction with intracellular proteins and, consequently, their recycling and localization to defined
postsynaptic sites. Stimulation of the local protein synthesis and transcription activity account for the delayed effects of BDNF
on glutamatergic synaptic strength. Several evidences show impaired synaptic plasticity of glutamatergic synapses in diseases
where compromised BDNF function has been observed, such as Huntington’s disease, depression, anxiety, and the BDNF
polymorphism Val66Met, suggesting that upregulating BDNF-activated pathways may be therapeutically relevant. This review
focuses on recent advances in the understanding of the regulation of the glutamatergic synapse by BDNF, and its implications
in synaptic plasticity.

Introduction
Neurotrophins control survival, differentiation and synapto-
genesis, and play important roles in activity-dependent
forms of synaptic plasticity in the CNS. The physiological
responses to neurotrophins are mediated by activation of
two distinct classes of transmembrane receptors, the tropo-
myosin-related kinase (Trk) family of receptors and the
p75NTR (reviewed in: Reichardt, 2006; Manadas et al., 2007).
The Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases includes the TrkA,
TrkB and TrkC receptors, which are activated preferentially
by nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF), NT-4/5 and NT-3, respectively. In contrast with the
specificity displayed by the Trk family of receptors, the
p75NTR binds both the mature form of the neurotrophins
and their uncleaved (precursor) forms (pro-neurotrophins)
(Lee et al., 2001; Teng et al., 2005). Sortilin, a member of the
Vps10p-domain family of transmembrane receptors, acts as a
p75NTR coreceptor to mediate pro-neurotrophin-induced cell
death (Nykjaer et al., 2004; Teng et al., 2005).
The levels and secretion of BDNF can be regulated by
activity, and BDNF colocalizes with its receptor, TrkB, at
glutamatergic synapses both presynaptically and postsynap-
tically.
This
makes
BDNF
attractive
as
a
bidirectional
modulator of excitatory synaptic transmission and plasticity.
GABAergic synapses are also regulated by BDNF, which has
been shown to act pre- and postsynaptically (for example,
Frerking et al., 1998; Wardle and Poo, 2003; Jovanovic et al.,
2004; Baldelli et al., 2005; Matsumoto et al., 2006). Moreover,
BDNF modulates growth and complexity of dendrites, and
changes spine density and morphology. This review focuses
on the role of BDNF as a synaptic modulator through its
pre- and postsynaptic actions at the glutamate synapse. The
following sections will consider how BDNF is produced,
processed and released, the signalling pathways that are

activated through activation of TrkB, how BDNF regulates
glutamate release and how it regulates glutamate receptor
function. The final sections summarize recent progress in
understanding the role of BDNF in synapse formation and
stabilization, and in synaptic plasticity. A model for some of
the mechanisms of action of BDNF on the glutamatergic
synapse is depicted in Figure 1.
BDNF transport and release
Neurotrophins, including BDNF, are synthesized as pre-pro-
neurotrophin precursors that undergo post-translational
modifications before giving rise to mature homodimeric
proteins. proBDNF is present in many regions of the CNS,
including the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum,
hypothalamus, substantia nigra, amygdala and spinal cord
(Zhou et al., 2004). Expression of the bdnf gene is tightly
controlled by neuronal activity, through mechanisms de-
pendent on the [Ca2 þ]i (reviewed in Mellstrom et al., 2004).
The pro-neurotrophins
produced in the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) then transit to the Golgi apparatus and
finally accumulate in the trans-Golgi network. A model was
proposed according to which proBDNF binds to sortilin in
the Golgi, facilitating the correct folding of the mature
domain. In the appropriate conformation,
the mature
domain of BDNF binds to carboxipeptidase E, thereby sorting
the neurotrophin to the regulated secretory pathway (Chen
et al., 2005; Lou et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2005). The sorting of
BDNF to this secretory pathway is impaired by a BDNF
polymorphism consisting in a valine to methionine sub-
stitution at codon 66 in the prodomain, which affects
human memory and hippocampal function (Egan et al.,
2003). It remains to be determined whether the missorting
phenotype of this BDNF polymorphism implies the existence
of an additional, and independent, sorting motif in the
prodomain
of
the
neurotrophin.
A
recent
study
also
suggested that huntingtin, a protein mutated in patients
with Huntington’s disease, plays an important role in the
post-Golgi transport of BDNF (del Toro et al., 2006).
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor produced in the cell
body is transported to postsynaptic dendrites, in secretory
granules (Goodman et al., 1996; Haubensak et al., 1998;
Hartmann et al., 2001; Kohara et al., 2001; Adachi et al.,
2005; Brigadski et al., 2005). Alternatively, the neurotrophin
contained within large dense core vesicles is delivered to the
presynaptic
axon
terminals,
by
anterograde
transport
(Fawcett et al., 1998; Kohara et al., 2001; Adachi et al.,
2005). Accordingly, BDNF was found in a vesicular fraction
isolated from nerve endings (Fawcett et al., 1997), and
electron microscopy studies showed that it is stored in dense
core vesicles, together with neuropeptide transmitters, in the
amygdala (Salio et al., 2007). The release of BDNF from the
synaptic terminals of cerebellar granule neurons is mediated
by Ca2 þ-dependent activator protein for secretion, type 2, a
protein that interacts with the secretory granules containing
the neurotrophin (Kawaguchi et al., 2004; Sadakata et al.,
2007). The BDNF vesicle clusters, pre- and postsynaptic, are
found close to active synapses and their content is released
in response to synaptic stimulation (Hartmann et al., 2001;
Kohara et al., 2001; Kojima et al., 2001). Depolarization of
cultured neurons with KCl or electrical stimulation, or
stimulation with glutamate, induces the release of endo-
genous proBDNF/BDNF and BDNF-green fluorescent protein
(GFP) fusion protein in a Ca2 þ-dependent manner (Goodman
et al., 1996; Hartmann et al., 2001; Kojima et al., 2001;
Balkowiec and Katz, 2002; Lou et al., 2005). The specificity in
the location of BDNF release, together with the fact that the
release occurs by a regulated mechanism, is an important
issue in determining the specificity of the effects of the
neurotrophin in the modulation of synaptic activity and
neuronal connectivity.
Interestingly, BDNF mRNA is accumulated in dendrites of
cultured hippocampal neurons following KCl depolarization,
Figure 1
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) modulates glutamatergic synapses through pre- and postsynaptic targets. ProBDNF is
secreted in an activity-regulated way, processed by extracellular proteases, such as plasmin, and acts on pre- and postsynaptic TrkB receptors.
Presynaptically, BDNF regulates glutamate release, whereas the postsynaptic actions of BDNF include changes in glutamate receptor
phosphorylation and synthesis, changes in gene expression and local alterations in protein synthesis. These effects of BDNF influence synaptic
plasticity, and spine density and morphology.

by a mechanism involving Ca2 þ influx, glutamate receptor
activation and stimulation of TrkB receptors by endogenous
BDNF (Tongiorgi et al., 1997; Righi et al., 2000). Under the
same conditions there was an increase in dendritic BDNF
immunoreactivity, even in the presence of dendritic trans-
port blockers, suggesting that the neurotrophin is synthe-
sized locally (Tongiorgi et al., 1997). Dendritic targeting of
BDNF mRNA and accumulation of the neurotrophin were
also observed in the rat hippocampus following epilepto-
genic stimuli, and may contribute to the cellular changes
leading to epilepsy (Tongiorgi et al., 2004).
The 32 kDa proBDNF is the main form of the neurotrophin
secreted from cultured neurons (Mowla et al., 1999, 2001;
Chen et al., 2004), indicating that the mature form originates
mainly from the extracellular cleavage of proBDNF by
extracellular
proteases.
The
most
relevant
extracellular
protease in the cleavage of neurotrophins, including BDNF,
is plasmin (Lee et al., 2001; Pang et al., 2004). This serine
protease is expressed as an inactive zymogen, plasminogen,
which becomes activated upon cleavage by tissue plasmino-
gen activator (Plow et al., 1995). The cleavage of proBDNF by
tPA/plasmin plays a key role in hippocampal long-term
potentiation (LTP) (see below) (Pang et al., 2004). However, it
remains to be determined whether the activation of plasmin
can be regulated to tightly control the extracellular concen-
tration of BDNF.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor has also been found in
some of the neurons that lack BDNF mRNA transcripts,
which are unable to synthesize the neurotrophin (Conner
et al., 1997). This indicates that extracellular BDNF may be
taken up by pre- or postsynaptic neurons, as observed in
cultured cortical neurons transfected with GFP-tagged BDNF
(Kohara et al., 2001). In vivo studies also showed transneu-
ronal transport of BDNF following injection of BDNF into
the eyes of chick embryos (von Bartheld et al., 1996; Butowt
and von Bartheld, 2001) or adult rodents (Caleo et al., 2000,
2003; Butowt and von Bartheld, 2005). Following uptake by
retinal ganglion cells, BDNF is transported to the nerve
terminals and released, increasing the survival of target
neurons (von Bartheld et al., 1996; Caleo et al., 2000, 2003).
In addition to the long-range transport to distal synapses,
BDNF may also be recycled locally. In the hippocampus, the
complex formed by BDNF and its receptor (TrkB) is inter-
nalized by Pincher (pinocytic chaperone)-mediated macro-
endocytosis-dependent mechanism, in axons and dendrites,
and enters rapidly into a local recycling pathway indepen-
dent of the ER and the Golgi (Valdez et al., 2005). The
internalized BDNF may be released following stimulation of
the neurons, allowing the recycling of the neurotrophin, and
the
recycled
BDNF
was
shown
to
contribute
to
the
maintenance of LTP (see below) (Santi et al., 2006).
TrkB receptors and signalling pathways
The TrkB receptors are activated by BDNF and NT-4/5
(reviewed
in:
Reichardt,
2006;
Manadas
et
al.,
2007).
Neurotrophins bind to the Trk receptors as dimers, thus
promoting receptor dimerization (Jing et al., 1992) and
transphosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues located in
the intracellular domain. This, in turn, creates docking sites
for different adaptor proteins and signalling enzymes, setting
in motion various parallel signal transduction cascades,
with distinct functions (Atwal et al., 2000; Reichardt, 2006;
Manadas et al., 2007). The signalling activity of the various
Trk receptors is rather similar, due to the high homology
between their intracellular domains (Atwal et al., 2000).
Phosphorylation of two tyrosine residues located outside the
kinase activation domain of the Trk receptors mediates the
interaction with Shc (Src homology 2-containing protein)
and phospholipase C g (PLC g; reviewed in: Reichardt, 2006;
Manadas et al., 2007). Shc recruitment to the active Trk
receptors is followed by phosphorylation of the adaptor
protein, leading to the activation of the Ras/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signalling pathway through
recruitment of Grb2 and SOS. The Shc docking site on active
Trk receptors may also allow binding of the adaptor protein
fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2, which becomes
phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, thus creating binding
sites for the adaptor proteins Grb2 and Crk, the phosphatase
SH-PTP2, the tyrosine kinase Src and the cyclin-dependent
kinase substrate p13 suc 1. Crk binds and activates the
exchange factor C3G, which in turn stimulates a small G
protein, Rap-1, thereby activating the downstream kinase
B-raf and the MEK/ERK signalling cascade (Reichardt, 2006).
Alternatively, CrkL can be recruited to the activated Trk
receptor through binding to the tyrosine-phosphorylated
ARMS/Kidins220
(ankyrin-rich
membrane
spanning
do-
main), resulting in the activation of Rap1 through C3G
(Arevalo et al., 2006). Activation of ERK influences transcrip-
tion events, such as the activation of cAMP-response element
binding (CREB) transcription factor (Shaywitz and Green-
berg, 1999).
Binding of Shc to the Trk receptors also activates the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, either by
direct interaction of Ras with PI3K or through recruitment
of the adaptor protein Gab1. Activation of PI3K changes the
composition of inositol phospholipids in the inner leaflet
of the plasma membrane, resulting in the translocation of
PKB (also known as Akt) to the plasma membrane, where it
is activated through phosphorylation by upstream kinases,
including phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinases 1
and 2 (possibly the rictor–mTOR complex; Sarbassov et al.,
2005). Akt may change transcription activity, but may also
induce rapid and local changes in the proteome by regulating
the translation machinery (Takei et al., 2001, 2004). This
signalling pathway plays an important role in cell survival
(Brunet et al., 2001; Almeida et al., 2005; Manadas et al.,
2007).
Phosphorylation of TrkB on Tyr785 recruits PLC g to the
receptors, and the enzyme becomes activated upon tyrosine
phosphorylation (Pereira et al., 2006; Reichardt, 2006). A
recent study showed that full activation of this signalling
pathway requires TrkB translocation to lipid rafts, possibly
through a Fyn-dependent mechanism (Pereira and Chao,
2007). PLCg hydrolyses phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphos-
phate, giving rise to diacylglycerol, which activates protein
kinase
C
(PKC),
and
inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate
(Ins(1,4,5)P3), which releases Ca2 þ from intracellular stores.
In cultured cerebellar granule cells, the BDNF-induced

mobilization of intracellular Ca2 þ stores acts together with
the diacylglycerol generated by PLCg in the activation of
plasma membrane transient receptor potential canonical
subfamily 3/6 (TRPC3/6) channels. The influx of Ca2 þ
through these channels contributes to ERK and CREB
activation, increasing cell survival (Jia et al., 2007). Activa-
tion of this pathway also plays a key role in synaptic
plasticity (see below; Minichiello et al., 2002).
Little is known about the role of the p75NTR in the
regulation of the glutamatergic synapses. These receptors
lack intracellular catalytic activity and, therefore, their
signalling activity is initiated by binding to several adaptor
proteins, including Traf6, neurotrophin receptor-interacting
factor, melanoma-associated antigen, neurotrophin receptor
p75-interacting melanoma-associated antigen homologue,
Schwann cell factor 1, RhoGDI and other proteins (reviewed
in: Harrington et al., 2004; Nykjaer et al., 2005; Schor, 2005).
Activation of p75NTR by proBDNF facilitates long-term
depression (LTD) in the hippocampus, but the signalling
mechanism involved is still unknown (Woo et al., 2005).
Subcellular distribution of TrkB receptors and
regulation of glutamate release by BDNF
The TrkB mRNA and protein are widely distributed through-
out the brain, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus,
striatum, septal nuclei, substantia nigra, cerebellar Purkinje
neurons, brain stem and spinal cord motor neurons (Kokaia
et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 1993; Muragaki et al., 1995; Shelton
et al., 1995; Fryer et al., 1996; Yan et al., 1997). The
subcellular localization of these receptors has been investi-
gated in great detail in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex,
given their role in synaptic plasticity (see below). In the adult
rat hippocampus, the TrkB receptors are present in the
glutamatergic pyramidal and granule cells, mainly in axons,
nerve terminals and dendritic spines. The receptors are also
present to a lower extent in the cell bodies and dendritic
shafts (Drake et al., 1999), and in dendritic spines of the rat
brain cortex (Aoki et al., 2000). Subcellular fractionation of
the rat hippocampus showed that TrkB receptors are present
in about one-third of the glutamatergic nerve terminals,
being evenly distributed between the presynaptic active zone
and the postsynaptic density (Pereira et al., 2006). However,
with the exception of the dendritic spines, most of the TrkB
receptors appear to be intracellular and, therefore, should
not respond to extracellular BDNF (Drake et al., 1999; Pereira
et al., 2006). Interestingly, the cellular response to BDNF may
depend on the recent history of the cell since plasma
membrane depolarization and an increase in the intra-
cellular cAMP concentration rapidly increase the amount
of receptors associated with the plasma membrane (Meyer-
Franke et al., 1998). Local protein synthesis also contributes
to the increase in BDNF and TrkB protein levels in distal
dendrites following depolarization of cultured hippocampal
neurons (Tongiorgi et al., 1997).
In agreement with the presynaptic expression of TrkB
receptors, BDNF was shown to potentiate the depolarization-
evoked Ca2 þ-dependent release of glutamate from isolated
hippocampal and cerebrocortical nerve terminals (Sala et al.,
1998; Jovanovic et al., 2000; Gooney and Lynch, 2001;Canas
et al., 2004; Pereira et al., 2006). This effect is mediated by
mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2)-dependent phos-
phorylation of synapsin I/II, since it was significantly
reduced in synaptosomes isolated from mice deficient in
each or both synapsins (Jovanovic et al., 2000). Mitogen-
activated protein kinase phosphorylation of synapsin I
reduces its ability to promote G-actin polymerization into
actin filaments (Jovanovic et al., 1996). In addition to the
contribution of the mitogen-activated protein kinase path-
way, PLC may also contribute to the effects of BDNF on the
depolarization-evoked exocytotic release of glutamate, as
shown in cultured cerebrocortical neurons (Matsumoto et al.,
2001). Furthermore, a recent study showed that BDNF-
induced potentiation of neurotransmitter release depends on
the interaction of myosin VI, a minus end-directed actin-
based motor, and the GIPC1 adaptor protein. GIPC1 binds
directly to myosin VI and the Trk receptors (Yano et al.,
2006).
In cultured neurons from the cerebral cortex, cerebellum,
striatum and hippocampus, BDNF induces the release of
glutamate in the absence of other depolarizing stimuli, and
this effect is dependent on the mobilization of Ca2 þ from
Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive stores (Takei et al., 1998; Numakawa
et al., 1999, 2001). The BDNF-induced release of glutamate in
cultured neurons is mainly mediated by reversal of the
plasma membrane transporter and is dependent on extra-
cellular Na þ (Numakawa et al., 2001), suggesting that it may
be secondary to the activation of the Na þ/Ca2 þ exchanger.
Studies using cultured hippocampal neurons also showed an
increase in the frequency, but not amplitude, of miniature
excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) following stimula-
tion
with BDNF, showing
a presynaptic effect
of the
neurotrophin on excitatory synapses (Li et al., 1998).
Control of glutamate receptors by BDNF
AMPA receptor structure, diversity and traffic
Ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate most of the excita-
tory synaptic transmission in the brain where they also play
key roles in synaptic plasticity and pathology. In view of
pharmacological and electrophysiological criteria, ionotropic
glutamate receptors have been classified into three major
subtypes: a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic
acid (AMPA), kainate and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors, named after their most selective agonist (Watkins
et al., 1981). AMPA receptors (AMPARs) are responsible for
the primary depolarization in glutamate-mediated neuro-
transmission. They are largely Ca2 þ impermeable, display
exceptionally fast kinetics and mediate moment-to-moment
synaptic signalling (Jonas, 2000). These characteristic func-
tional properties depend on the subunit composition and on
subunit modifications introduced by alternative splicing.
AMPARs assemble in tetrameric structures of four subunits,
GluR1–GluR4 (or GluRA–GluRD), in various combinations
(Laube et al., 1998; Mano and Teichberg, 1998; Rosenmund
et al., 1998). The subunit stoichiometry determines channel
function (that is desensitization/resensitization kinetics and
conductance properties) (Ozawa et al., 1998) and trafficking
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor

to synapses (Malinow et al., 2000). Stargazin and other
transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins also coassemble
stoichiometrically with native AMPARs. The transmembrane
AMPAR regulatory proteins act as auxiliary subunits that are
required for AMPAR maturation, trafficking and channel
function (Korber et al., 2007; Ziff, 2007). The C-terminus of
AMPAR subunits is intracellular and shows differences
between the subunits. GluR1, GluR4 and an alternative
splice form of GluR2 (GluR2L) have longer cytoplasmic tails
that are homologous. In contrast, the predominant splice
form of GluR2, GluR3 and an alternative splice form of
GluR4 (GluR4c) have shorter, homologous cytoplasmic tails.
Receptors composed of subunits with short cytoplasmic
C-termini (GluR2/3) cycle continuously in and out of the
synapse with a time constant of B15 min (Passafaro et al.,
2001; Shi et al., 2001), whereas receptors that contain long
C-termini (GluR1/2 and GluR2/4) are added into synapses in
an activity-dependent manner (Hayashi et al., 2000; Shi
et al., 2001). Through their C-terminal tail, each subunit
interacts with specific cytoplasmic proteins, which play
important roles in controlling the trafficking of AMPARs
and/or their stabilization at the synapses.
AMPAR subunits are synthesized and assembled in the
rough ER and then inserted into the plasma membrane after
crossing the Golgi apparatus. The final step of insertion of
the receptors in the synaptic membrane involves tightly
regulated events that depend on the subunit composition of
the receptor and on specific signals contained within the
C-termini. Several PDZ domain-containing proteins, such as
SAP97,
glutamate
receptor-interacting
protein
(GRIP1),
AMPAR-binding protein (ABP) and protein interacting with
C-kinase-1 (PICK1), have been shown to participate in the
process. GluR2 also binds N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor,
an ATPase required for membrane fusion events, which
interacts
with
a
membrane
proximal
segment
of
the
C-terminus of GluR2. This protein helps to maintain the
synaptic expression of GluR2-containing AMPARs. Several
recent reviews summarize in detail the literature in this field
(Bredt and Nicoll, 2003; Gomes et al., 2003; Derkach et al.,
2007; Elias and Nicoll, 2007; Greger and Esteban, 2007).
Phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification
in regulating AMPAR function (Carvalho et al., 2000). It can
regulate the physiological properties of the channel as well
as protein trafficking. GluR1 subunit has been described to
be phosphorylated at three sites located in the intracellular
C-terminus: serine 831 (Ser831) can be phosphorylated by
both PKC (Roche et al., 1996) and calcium- and calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (Mammen et al., 1997);
serine 845 (Ser845) is a protein kinase A (PKA) phosphoryla-
tion site (Roche et al., 1996) and serine 818 (Ser818) is a
substrate for PKC (Boehm et al., 2006). LTP induction
increases the CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of GluR1
at Ser831 (Mammen et al., 1997). Although such phosphory-
lation may enhance the function of synaptic receptors
(Benke et al., 1998), it does not seem to be required for
receptor delivery, since mutations on GluR1–Ser831 that
prevent its phosphorylation by CaMKII do not prevent
delivery of the receptor to synapses by active CaMKII
(Hayashi et al., 2000). Interestingly, mutations at Ser845,
the PKA phosphorylation site of GluR1 (Roche et al., 1996),
do prevent delivery of GluR1 to synapses by active CaMKII or
LTP (Esteban et al., 2003). On the other hand, PKA activity is
necessary but not sufficient for the CaMKII-driven incor-
poration of GluR1 into synapses (Esteban et al., 2003). It is
important to note that both Ser831 and Ser845 are necessary,
but not sufficient to deliver AMPARs into synapses, which
requires the activation of the CaMKII-Ras-mitogen-activated
protein kinase (Esteban, 2003). Phosphorylation of GluR1–
Ser818 by PKC is critical in LTP-driven incorporation of
AMPARs into the postsynaptic membrane and is suggested to
exert its function by facilitating the interaction between
GluR1 and a delivery or tethering protein (Boehm et al.,
2006).
Regulation of AMPAR expression and traffic by BDNF
In addition to the presynaptic effects of BDNF on glutama-
tergic synapses, the neurotrophin may also act postsynapti-
cally, through regulation of the abundance of the plasma-
membrane-associated glutamate receptors. Stimulation of
cultured hippocampal neurons with BDNF increases the
amount of GluR1 associated with the plasma membrane, by
a protein synthesis-dependent mechanism, without affecting
the distribution of GluR2. BDNF also promotes the synaptic
delivery of homomeric GluR1 AMPARs in cultured organo-
typic hippocampal slices by a mechanism dependent on the
activation of Trk receptors (presumably TrkB) (Caldeira et al.,
2007a). The synaptic delivery of GluR1 induced by BDNF is
associated with the phosphorylation of the protein in
Ser831, the CaMKII and PKC phosphorylation site, but no
phosphorylation was detected in Ser845 (Caldeira et al.,
2007a). Because GluR1 phosphorylation in Ser831 is not
sufficient to induce synaptic delivery of AMPARs (Hayashi
et al., 2000), the effect of BDNF may require GluR1
phosphorylation on Ser818, a PKC phosphorylation site
(Boehm et al., 2006), or changes in a protein involved in
GluR1 traffic.
Similarly, BDNF induces the synaptic delivery of GluR1-
containing AMPARs in cultured cerebrocortical neurons,
from a local pool, and by a mechanism dependent on the
mobilization of Ca2 þ from Ins(1,4,5)P3-sensitive internal
stores (Nakata and Nakamura, 2007). [3H]AMPA-binding
studies showed that the surface translocation of AMPARs to
the membrane induced by BDNF requires intracellular Ca2 þ
and is sensitive to blockers of exocytosis (Narisawa-Saito
et al., 2002). It remains to be determined whether the
population of GluR1-containing AMPARs recruited to the
synapse following stimulation with BDNF is synthesized
locally. This may occur by TrkB-induced activation of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-PI3K-dependent
pathway, as shown in isolated rat forebrain synaptoneuro-
somes (Schratt et al., 2004).
Activation of Trk receptors, presumably TrkB, increases the

(Caldeira

and GluR2/3 protein levels in cultured rat neocortical
neurons, probably by activation of Fyn, a non-receptor-type
tyrosine kinase of the Src family, which is known to be

activated by Trk receptors (Narisawa-Saito et al., 1999). Under
the same conditions, there is an upregulation of several
postsynaptic
density
proteins
known
to
interact
with
AMPARs, including SAP97, GRIP1, PICK1, and an increase
in the interaction between GluR1 and SAP97, and GluR2/3
with GRIP1 (Jourdi et al., 2003), which may in turn stabilize
AMPARs at the membrane. However, the mechanisms that
act downstream of the Trk receptors in the upregulation of
the expression of AMPAR subunits in hippocampal and
cerebrocortical neurons remain to be determined. In agree-
ment with the observed upregulation of AMPAR subunits
following long-term stimulation of cultured neurons with
BDNF, chronic treatment with BDNF increases the inward
membrane currents evoked by AMPA and, consequently,
AMPA-triggered GABA release in neocortical GABAergic
neurons (Nagano et al., 2003). Also, long-term treatment of
hippocampal cultures with BDNF potentiates excitatory
transmission by augmenting the amplitude of AMPAR-
mediated miniature EPSCs (Bolton et al., 2000). In contrast,
BDNF was shown to strongly inhibit postsynaptic AMPAR-
mediated currents in a large subset of newborn nucleus
tractus solitarius neurons (Balkowiec et al., 2000). These
BDNF induced-changes in synaptic activity may be due to
the insertion or removal of AMPARs from potentiated and
depressed synapses (Carroll et al., 1999; Lissin et al., 1999),
respectively, or to changes in the phosphorylation state of
AMPA-type glutamate receptors (Wu et al., 2004).
NMDA receptor structure, diversity and traffic
N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors are glutamate, glycine (or
D-serine) and voltage-dependent receptors that mediate a
relatively slow and long-lasting excitatory postsynaptic
current component (reviewed in Chen and Wyllie, 2006).
These receptors are ligand-gated cation channels characte-
rized by their high Ca2 þ permeability (Ascher and Nowak,
1988). The NMDA receptor family is made of NR1, NR2 and
NR3 subunits. NR1 contains the glycine-binding site and is
essential for the NMDA receptor function, but the glutamate-
binding site is contained within the NR2 subunits. Therefore,
functional NMDA receptors are thought to be tetramers of
two NR1 and two NR2 subunits, and their activity requires
the binding of the co-agonists glycine and glutamate (or
NMDA) (Kew and Kemp, 2005; Chen and Wyllie, 2006). The
NR3 subunits can assemble with NR1–NR2 complexes to
depress NMDA receptor responses, and may interact with
NR1 subunits to form excitatory glycine receptors, insensi-
tive to glutamate or NMDA, calcium impermeable and
resistant to Mg2 þ blockade (Chatterton et al., 2002; Kew
and Kemp, 2005). NMDA receptor diversity arises from
alternative splicing at three sites in the NR1 mRNA, giving
rise to eight distinct functional splice variants, and one non-
functional truncated splice variant of NR1 (McBain and
Mayer, 1994). The existence of four NR2 subunits (NR2A–
NR2D), and two NR3 subunits (NR3A and NR3B) further
contributes to the diversity of NMDA receptors. Each NR2
subunit is encoded by its own gene, and is unable to form
functional channels on its own, but greatly enhances NMDA
receptor function when coexpressed with NR1 (Cull-Candy
et al., 2001). Regional and developmental regulation of NR2
subunit expression underlies much of the diversity of NMDA
receptor responses in the CNS (Wenthold et al., 2003). Thus,
during development there is a general trend towards a
decreasing contribution of NR2B, associated with an increasing
contribution of NR2A-containing NMDA receptors to the
synaptic currents. This shift in the subunit composition of
the NMDA receptors causes a significant decrease in the
deactivation time of the NMDA receptors (Cull-Candy et al.,
2001).
NMDA receptors are targeted to the postsynaptic sites in
glutamatergic synapses at an initial stage after the contact
between axons and dendrites (Friedman et al., 2000). NMDA
receptors are synthesized in the ER and delivered to the
synapse, and localization signals at the intracellular C-
terminal tail of the NR1 and NR2 subunits regulate NMDA
receptors delivery to and retrieval from the plasma mem-
brane. Longer splice variants of NR1 are retained in the ER
due to the presence of an ER retention motif in the
alternatively spliced C1 cassette present in these forms.
Assembly of these NR1 forms with the NR2 subunits masks
the retention motif and allows traffic of the assembled
receptors to the cell surface and targeting to dendritic spines
(for a review, see Wenthold et al., 2003).
The targeting of NMDA receptors to the synapse and their
stabilization at the synapse depend on interactions with
other proteins, and many of these interactions involve the
intracellular C-terminus of the receptor subunits. Accord-
ingly, mice expressing NR2A or NR2B subunits truncated at
the C-terminus show compromised synaptic localization of
NMDA receptors (Mori et al., 1998; Steigerwald et al., 2000).
The NR2 subunits have been shown to bind, through PDZ
recognition motifs at the distal end of the C-terminal tail, to
the first two PDZ domains of PSD95, PSD93 and SAP102.
These scaffolding proteins bind other intracellular proteins
and can therefore link NMDA receptors to other glutamate
receptors and to ion channels in the postsynaptic reticulum.
Moreover, PSD95 promotes the surface expression and
clustering of NMDA receptors containing NR2A, enhances
NMDA channel opening, reduces the desensitization of
NMDA responses and links synaptic NMDA receptors to
downstream signalling molecules, such as neuronal nitric
oxide synthase (for a review, see Lau and Zukin, 2007).
Phosphorylation of NMDA receptors is another major
mechanism for regulating receptor trafficking at the synapse.
Phosphorylation of NR1 by PKC at serine residues near the
ER retention motif promotes NMDA receptor traffic to the
cell surface on a timescale of hours (Scott et al., 2001). In
parallel, activation of PKC increases NMDA channel opening
and plasma membrane expression of NMDA receptors in
hippocampal neurons, through a mechanism not involving
direct phosphorylation of the receptors (Lan et al., 2001).
PKA phosphorylates NR1, NR2A and NR2B (Leonard and
Hell, 1997), and mediates activity-regulated synaptic target-
ing of NMDA receptors (Crump et al., 2001). PKA is anchored
to NMDA receptors via yotiao, a protein that binds to the C1
cassette present in the C-terminus of some splice variants,

currents (Westphal et al., 1999). Fyn, a kinase of the Src

PSD95-dependent manner (Tezuka et al., 1999), and PSD95 is
required for Src-mediated potentiation of the NR1/NR2A
receptor currents in Xenopus oocytes (Liao et al., 2000).
Moreover, Fyn phosphorylates NR2B (Nakazawa et al., 2001).
Finally, NMDA receptors are regulated by cyclin-dependent
kinase-5, which phosphorylates NR2A. In fact, roscovitine,
a
selective
cyclin-dependent
kinase-5
inhibitor,
blocks
both LTP induction and NMDA-evoked currents in rat CA1
hippocampal neurons (Li et al., 2001), suggesting that cyclin-
dependent kinase-5 upregulates NMDA receptors.
N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors are relatively stable at the
synapse when compared to AMPARs, but recent evidences
indicate that NMDA receptors are internalized in a regulated
manner (for a review, see Lau and Zukin, 2007). NMDA
receptor internalization is mediated by the tyrosine-based
internalization motifs in the C-terminus of NR2 subunits,
and NR2B shows stronger internalization, and sorting to
recycling endosomes. Phosphorylation of this internaliza-
tion motif in NR2B by Fyn suppresses internalization of
NMDA receptors. Moreover, endocytic motifs present in the
membrane-proximal region of the C-terminus of NR1, NR2A
and NR2B also drive internalization, and drive receptors to
recycling endosomes.
The activity-dependent changes in NMDA receptor traffic
may
provide
an
additional
mechanism
for
regulating
synaptic efficacy. In fact, the primary mechanism for LTP
and LTD involves alterations in the number of synaptic
AMPARs, but there are also evidences for changes in the
currents conducted by NMDA receptors triggered by LTP and
LTD (Lau and Zukin, 2007). Moreover, the forms of synaptic
plasticity that operate over longer timescales, such as
synaptic scaling and metaplasticity, seem to rely on mechan-
isms that involve activity-dependent alterations in NMDA
receptor trafficking (Perez-Otano and Ehlers, 2005).
BDNF modulation of NMDA receptors
The current understanding of the regulation of NMDA
receptors by BDNF is not as extensive as for AMPARs. BDNF
increases the amount of NR1, NR2A and NR2B NMDA
receptor subunits associated with the plasma membrane in
cultured hippocampal neurons (Caldeira et al., 2007b). The
BDNF-induced delivery of NMDA receptors to the plasma
membrane is correlated with an increase in the activity of
the receptors, as measured by the [Ca2 þ]i response to NMDA
stimulation. However, in addition to the effect of the
neurotrophin on the number of receptors associated with
the plasma membrane, BDNF may also change the responses
to NMDA by regulating the biophysical properties of the
receptors.
Activation
of
TrkB
receptors
was
shown
to
potentiate NMDA receptor currents in Xenopus oocytes
micro-transplanted with rat forebrain postsynaptic densities
(Sandoval et al., 2007). Furthermore, BDNF increases NMDA
receptor single channel open probability in cultured hippo-
campal neurons (Levine et al., 1998), presumably through
phosphorylation of the receptors. BDNF induces tyrosine
phosphorylation of NR1 and NR2B subunits in hippocampal
and cortical neurons, but not NR2A (Suen et al., 1997; Lin
et al., 1998; Alder et al., 2005), and the effects of BDNF on the
NMDA receptor open probability depend on the presence of
NR2B subunits (Levine and Kolb, 2000). Phosphorylation of
NR2B may be mediated by Fyn, a member of the Src family of
non-receptor tyrosine kinases, since this kinase is activated
by TrkB receptors (Narisawa-Saito et al., 1999), phosphory-
lates this NMDA receptor subunit (Nakazawa et al., 2001) and
contributes to BDNF-induced increase in synaptic transmis-
sion (Wang and Salter, 1994; Alder et al., 2005). CaMKII and
PKC may also contribute to the potentiation of NMDA
receptors by BDNF, as demonstrated in cultured hippocam-
pal neurons (Crozier et al., 1999; Lan et al., 2001). Both
kinases are activated downstream of TrkB, following stimula-
tion of PLC, which gives rise to Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DAG. The
Ins(1,4,5)P3 mobilizes Ca2 þ from intracellular stores and
DAG stimulates PKC (see above).
In addition to the effects on the activity and trafficking of
NMDA receptors, BDNF upregulates the expression of NR1,
NR2A and NR2B NMDA receptor subunits in cultured
hippocampal neurons, by a transcription-dependent me-
chanism (Caldeira et al., 2007b). NR2A mRNA and protein
levels
are
also
upregulated
in
cultured
cerebrocortical
neurons stimulated with BDNF (Small et al., 1998), and the
neurotrophin regulates NR2A expression in the developing
visual cortex (Margottil and Domenici, 2003). In fact, NR1
expression is regulated by different transcription factors,
including the NF-kB (Liu et al., 2004) and CREB (Lau et al.,
2004), and the latter is a major mediator of neuronal
neurotrophin responses (Finkbeiner et al., 1997). NR2B
expression is also regulated by CREB (Rani et al., 2005) and
AP-1 (Qiang and Ticku, 2005), which may be activated by
BDNF-induced signalling (Li et al., 2004). Recent studies have
also shown that BDNF increases the translation of the NR1
subunit mRNA in cultured cerebrocortical neurons (Schratt
et al., 2004), suggesting that the neurotrophin may regulate
the abundance of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus by
acting at the translation level.
Role of BDNF in synapse formation and
stabilization
The fast changes in synaptic efficacy triggered by BDNF may
be translated to structural changes if the synapses are
exposed to BDNF for longer periods. These alterations
include axonal branching and dendritic growth (McAllister
et al., 1999), but there is also ample evidence that BDNF
influences the formation, stability and morphology of
excitatory synapses, probably through presynaptic as well
as postsynaptic mechanisms. TrkB receptors have been found
in postsynaptic densities in adult rat cerebral cortex and
hippocampus (Wu et al., 1996), and surface TrkB was found
to be enriched at glutamatergic synapses in cultured cortical
neurons (Gomes et al., 2006). In this preparation, before
synapse formation some TrkB puncta in dendrites colocalize
with NMDA receptors, and almost all TrkB puncta in axons
colocalize with synaptic vesicle proteins; moreover, surface
TrkB is found in structures that participate in synapse
formation, such as axonal growth cones and dendritic
filipodia (Gomes et al., 2006). The distribution of TrkB in
cortical neurons in culture suggests that TrkB is correctly
localized to play a role in glutamatergic synapse formation.

The first evidence that BDNF is involved in regulating
synapse number came from a study using electron micro-
scopy to analyse the phenotype of hippocampal connections
in Trkb-knockout mice, which showed lower densities of
synaptic contacts and important structural alterations of
presynaptic boutons, such as decreased density of synaptic
vesicles, in P13–P14 Trkb (/) mice when compared to
wild-type littermates (Martinez et al., 1998). Another early
study using hippocampal cultures prepared from embryonic
day 16 rat embryos, which form presynaptically silent
synapses, showed that functional connectivity between
these neurons could be established by 1–3 days exposure of
the culture to BDNF (Vicario-Abejon et al., 1998).
Later studies using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures
from postnatal rats showed that exogenous BDNF applica-
tion increases the number of synapses per neuron, and the
number of docked vesicles at the active zone of excitatory
synapses onto CA1 pyramidal neurons (Tyler and Pozzo-
Miller, 2001). Using the same system, Tyler and Pozzo-Miller
(2003) found that BDNF increases the proportion of short
stubby spines, which are thought to promote synchronous
widespread
of
Ca2 þ
transients
among
adjacent
spines
(Nimchinsky et al., 2002). Moreover, it was found that
spontaneous, action potential-independent, synaptic trans-
mission is sufficient for BDNF to induce spine formation and
increase the proportion of stubby spines (Tyler and Pozzo-
Miller, 2003), and that ERK1/2 activation is necessary for
BDNF to increase dendritic spine density in hippocampal
CA1 pyramidal neurons (Alonso et al., 2004). A recent study
from the laboratory of Pozzo-Miller showed that BDNF elicits
a postsynaptic slowly developing and sustained non-selec-
tive cationic current in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons,
which was blocked by anti-TRPC3 channel antibodies, and
that functional TRPC3 channels are required for BDNF to
increase dendritic spine density (Amaral and Pozzo-Miller,
2007).
On the other hand, in dissociated
cultures of
hippocampal neurons, cAMP was found to specifically
facilitate the increase in dendritic spine density induced by
BDNF, and to recruit TrkB to the postsynaptic densities (Ji
et al., 2005).
Exogenous BDNF application for 2 weeks to cocultures of
cerebellar Purkinje and granular cells increased the density of
Purkinje cell dendritic spines, without causing alterations in
the spine morphology, whereas treatment with TrkB-immuno-
globulin G alone increased the length of spine necks
(Shimada et al., 1998).
In the visual cortex, overexpression of BDNF caused
destabilization of dendritic spines, suggesting that BDNF
allows for activity-dependent morphological changes in
dendritic spines by causing local dendritic instability (Horch
et al., 1999). A recent study shows that BDNF treatment of
cultured visual cortical neurons increases the size of synaptic
PSD95 puncta, and that dendritic transport of PSD95 is
facilitated
by
a
pathway
initiated
by
NMDA
receptor
stimulation of BDNF-TrkB signalling (Yoshii and Constantine-
Paton, 2007).
Taken together, the evidences provided by these studies
using several different systems indicate a contribution of
BDNF to sculpture synapses through both pre- and post-
synaptic effects.
Role of BDNF in synaptic plasticity
The role of BDNF and TrkB in LTP is well documented in the
adult
hippocampus
and
visual
cortex
(Bramham
and
Messaoudi, 2005). Thus, LTP in the hippocampus is attenuated
by the TrkB-immunoglobulin
G fusion protein, which
sequesters endogenous BDNF, and is also reduced in BDNF-
or TrkB-knockout mice (Korte et al., 1995, 1998; Patterson
et al., 1996; Chen et al., 1999; Minichiello et al., 1999; Xu
et al., 2000). The impairment of LTP in BDNF-knockout mice
can be rescued by acute application of BDNF (Figurov et al.,
1996; Patterson et al., 1996; Pozzo-Miller et al., 1999) or by
virus-mediated transfer of the neurotrophin (Korte et al.,
1996a, b). A role for BDNF in synaptic potentiation in the
hippocampus was also found in studies where stimulation
with the neurotrophin was associated with synaptic stimula-
tion that would not normally induce potentiation (Figurov
et al., 1996; Kovalchuk et al., 2002). Acute application of
BDNF to hippocampal slices also induces synaptic potentia-
tion in the hippocampal CA1 region (Kang and Schuman,
1995; Kang et al., 1997), and similar results were obtained in
the dentate gyrus following intrahippocampal infusion of
the neurotrophin (Messaoudi et al., 1998). However, the
effect in hippocampal slices was not occluded by tetanus-
induced LTP (and vice versa), suggesting that the mechanism
involved is distinct from the one involved in LTP (Kang and
Schuman, 1995). Also, the acute effects of BDNF on the
excitatory synaptic transmission have been controversial,
with some groups reporting minimal or no effects (Frerking
et al., 1998). Similar to the effects reported in the hippo-
campus,
BDNF
induces
a
long-lasting
potentiation
of
synaptic transmission in the developing visual cortex (Jiang
et al., 2001), and BDNF-heterozygous mice show an impair-
ment of LTP in the visual cortex due, at least in part, to a
reduction in glutamate release (Jiang et al., 2001; Abidin
et al., 2006).
The role of BDNF in LTP is correlated with its contribution
to the mechanisms of learning and memory. Thus, an
impairment of spatial leaning was observed in BDNF- or
TrkB-knockout mice, and in rats subjected to chronic
injection of antibodies to BDNF, in contrast with the
improved spatial learning and memory formation observed
in transgenic mice overexpressing TrkB (Linnarsson et al.,
1997; Minichiello et al., 1999; Mu et al., 1999; Koponen et al.,
2004). Deletion of the BDNF gene in the hippocampus of
adult mice impaired spatial learning and novel object
recognition (Heldt et al., 2007). Animals with deletions in
hippocampal BDNF also showed significantly reduced ex-
tinction of conditioned fear (Heldt et al., 2007). Interestingly,
the BDNF val66met polymorphism that affects the activity-
dependent release of BDNF is associated with poorer episodic
memory in human subjects (Egan et al., 2003). Taken
together, these evidences suggest that a decrease in hippo-
campal BDNF may account for the cognitive deficits and the
impairment in extinction of aversive memory characteristic
of depression and anxiety disorders (Heldt et al., 2007).
Stimulation of the BDNF-activated pathways may, therefore,
be therapeutically relevant under these conditions.
The rapid activity-dependent release of BDNF from the
nerve terminals of hippocampal neurons may contribute to
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
AL Carvalho et al

the induction phase of LTP (Kohara et al., 2001). This may be
followed by postsynaptic release of the neurotrophin, but
the relative role of the dendritic BDNF in synaptic potentia-
tion remains to be determined. The BDNF pool that is
relevant in LTP is thought to be released as proBDNF, and
cleaved by the extracellular protease plasmin. This protease
is activated by the tissue plasminogen activator (Plow et al.,
1995), which can also be secreted from stimulated nerve
terminals in a Ca2 þ-dependent manner (Krystosek and
Seeds, 1981; Gualandris et al., 1996). According to this
hypothesis, tPA- or plasminogen-knockout mice show a
severe impairment of late LTP, and this phenotype can be
rescued by the mature form of BDNF (Pang et al., 2004; Pang
and
Lu,
2004).
The
extracellular
BDNF
may
be
then
internalized upon binding to the TrkB receptors, and this
pool of endocytosed neurotrophin contributes to the release
of BDNF necessary to maintain LTP (Santi et al., 2006).
However, the relative roles of anterograde and retrograde
BDNF signalling in LTP remain to be determined.
The signalling mechanisms that operate downstream of
the TrkB receptors in LTP have been investigated using
mice with targeted mutations in either the Shc- or the PLCg-
binding sites of TrkB (Minichiello et al., 2002). These studies
showed that the early and late phases of LTP in the CA1
region of the hippocampus are dependent on the TrkB
coupling to PLCg, whereas mutation of the Shc docking site
on TrkB was without effect on LTP. Selective pre- and
postsynaptic expression of the PLCg pleckstrin homology
domain with viral vectors, which blocks PLCg signalling and
Ins(1,4,5)P3 production, abrogated the effect of TrkB recep-
tors on LTP. However, selective blockade of pre- or post-
synaptic signalling alone did not result in a significant
reduction of LTP, indicating that both sides contribute to the
effects of BDNF (Gartner et al., 2006; Gruart et al., 2007). The
role of TrkB coupling to PLCg in LTP induced by high-
frequency stimulation correlates with a role of this signalling
pathway in associative learning (Gruart et al., 2007).
The presynaptic role of BDNF in the early phase of LTP has
been attributed to an enhancement in the synaptic responses
to tetanic stimulation and to the facilitation in synaptic
vesicle docking to the plasma membrane (Gottschalk et al.,
1998; Pozzo-Miller et al., 1999; Jovanovic et al., 2000; Xu
et al., 2000; Tyler and Pozzo-Miller, 2001). Furthermore, the
induction of LTP by tetanic stimulation of hippocampal
slices from P12–13 mice, which requires the addition of
exogenous BDNF, depends on the presynaptic interaction of
TrkB receptors with the minus end-directed actin-based
motor myosin VI and its binding protein GIPC1 (Yano
et al., 2006). The presynaptic effects of BDNF enable
sustained glutamate release during bursts of action poten-
tials, thereby facilitating LTP induction in response to high-
frequency stimulation.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor also induces postsynap-
tic responses, some of them contributing to the development
of late stages of LTP. Thus, pairing of a weak burst of synaptic
stimulation with a brief dendritic application of BDNF
induces a rapid and robust LTP, by a mechanism dependent
on the activation of postsynaptic Ca2 þ channels and NMDA
receptors (Kovalchuk et al., 2002). Furthermore, BDNF was
shown to induce delivery of GluR1-containing AMPARs to
the synapse in hippocampal slices (Caldeira et al., 2007a),
which may also account for the earlier postsynaptic effects
of BDNF in LTP. Interestingly, the BDNF-induced delivery of
AMPARs to the synapse depends on Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptor and
TRPC calcium signalling (Nakata and Nakamura, 2007),
initiated by the PLCg pathway, a mechanism that resembles
the role of the TrkB–PLCg coupling in LTP (Minichiello et al.,
2002). However, there is yet no direct evidence that BDNF
regulates AMPAR trafficking during LTP.
Delayed
BDNF
signalling
coupled
to
local
dendritic
protein synthesis and stimulation of transcription in the
postsynaptic cell is also required for the late phase of LTP,
which is mimicked by BDNF application to hippocampal
slices and in vivo (Soule et al., 2006). Anatomical evidences
for the presence of ribosomes in dendrites date from several
decades ago (Bodian, 1965; Steward and Levy, 1982), and
were
followed
by
evidences
for
the
incorporation
of
radiolabelled amino acids into proteins in synaptosomes
(Rao and Steward, 1991; Weiler and Greenough, 1991). Since
then, many observations in several different systems support
a role for local protein synthesis in dendrites in synaptic
plasticity and memory (Sutton and Schuman, 2006). Inter-
estingly, BDNF induced potentiation of the synaptic trans-
mission between CA3 and CA1 neurons in hippocampal
slices where the CA1 dendrites were surgically isolated from
their cell bodies, in a manner dependent on protein
synthesis (Kang and Schuman, 1996), suggesting that BDNF
regulates synaptic function at least in part by activating
dendritic protein synthesis. In an elegant study using a
dendritic protein synthesis reporter, Aakalu et al. (2001) have
shown that protein synthesis can be stimulated in dendrites
by BDNF. The protein synthesis reporter consists of GFP
flanked by the 50 and 30 untranslated regions from the
CaMKII a-subunit, since these regions contain information
sufficient for the dendritic localization of the mRNA. BDNF
treatment for 4 h of hippocampal neurons expressing the
reporter construct resulted in increased GFP synthesis in
both the cell body and dendrites. BDNF also stimulates
protein synthesis in mechanically or optically isolated
dendrites, and the protein synthesis reporter is concentrated
near sites of translation and synapses (Aakalu et al., 2001).
Synaptic potentiation induced by BDNF injection into the
rat dentate gyrus is accompanied by a rapid phosphorylation
of two key translation factors, the eukaryotic initiation factor
4E (eIF4E) and elongation factor-2, and enhanced expression
of eIF4E (Kanhema et al., 2006). However, BDNF treatment of
synaptoneurosomes, which contain the pre- and postsynap-
tic components, selectively induced a transient phosphory-
lation of eIF4E and upregulated the CaMKII, but had no
effect on elongation factor-2. These evidences suggest that
BDNF-induced translation is initiated at synapses, whereas
initiation and elongation are regulated at non-synaptic sites
(Kanhema et al., 2006; see also Smart et al., 2003; Schratt
et al., 2004). The regulation of eIF4E by BDNF also includes
the translocation of the initiation factor to mRNA granules,
by an F-actin-dependent mechanism (Smart et al., 2003). In
vivo studies suggested that the effects of BDNF on the
initiation and elongation steps of translation in the dentate
gyrus are mediated by ERK (Kanhema et al., 2006). In
contrast, several studies have indicated a role for the

mTOR-PI3K-dependent pathway in the regulation of den-
dritic protein synthesis by BDNF. A genome-wide screen for
mRNAs whose translation is regulated by BDNF in a mTOR
signalling-dependent manner in cortical neurons 4 and 14
DIV was performed using RNA associated with the polysomal
fraction, presumably being translated, and using Affymetrix
DNA microarrays (Schratt et al., 2004). This screening led to
the identification of several genes whose transcripts are
associated with polysomes in an mTOR-sensitive way and
among them several transcripts are present in dendrites,
such as those for CaMKIIa, Homer2 and NR1. Moreover, the
BDNF-induced synthesis of activity-regulated cytoskeleton-
associated protein (Arc) and CaMKII in synaptoneurosomes
is partially blocked by rapamycin (Takei et al., 2004). This
study
describes
how
BDNF
activates
the
translation
machinery in dendrites, through the activation of mTOR
and its downstream translation regulatory molecules, such as
3EBP, p70S6K and S6, in dendrites. The role proposed for the
rapamycin (mTOR)-PI3K-dependent pathway and the ERK
signalling
pathway in activation of translation
at the
dendritic level contrasts with the key role proposed for the
PLCg in the signalling activity of TrkB coupled to synaptic
potentiation (Minichiello et al., 2002).
Dendritic mRNAs are transported to synapto-dendritic
compartments in RNA granules. The translation of these
mRNA molecules may be suppressed during their transport
and at synaptic sites until factors released during synaptic
stimulation activate their translation. BDNF was recently
found to induce the expression of Limk1, a protein kinase
whose mRNA translation is inhibited by a brain-specific
microRNA, miR-134 (Schratt et al., 2006). miR-134 is present
within dendrites and partially colocalizes with synapsin,
indicating that it is present near synaptic sites. Moreover,
overexpression of miR-134 in hippocampal neurons in
culture leads to a decrease in spine size, through repression
of Limk1 mRNA translation. The translation of Limk1 mRNA
is regulated by BDNF. In fact, BDNF treatment significantly
increases the synthesis of Limk1 protein in isolated synapto-
neurosomes, in a rapamycin-sensitive manner, and BDNF
relieves the suppression of Limk1 mRNA translation by miR-
134 (Schratt et al., 2006). The regulation of translation in
dendrites by microRNAs, in a BDNF-sensitive manner, may
constitute a mechanism whereby the neurotrophin regulates
the postsynaptic proteome during the late phases of LTP.
Studies performed in synaptoneurosomes showed that
activation of the dendritic translation machinery by BDNF
leads to the local synthesis of GluR1 (Schratt et al., 2004),
Arc/Arg3.1 (Yin et al., 2002; Takei et al., 2004) and CaMKII
(Takei et al., 2004). Moreover, intrahippocampal microinfu-
sion of BDNF to trigger LTP at medial perforant path-granule
cell synapses in vivo leads to the upregulation of mRNA and
protein for Arc, and the Arc transcripts are rapidly delivered
to granule cell dendrites after BDNF infusion (Ying et al.,
2002). The synthesis of Arc in particular is necessary for the
induction of BDNF-LTP and its time-dependent consolida-
tion (Soule et al., 2005), and this protein was proposed to
regulate actin polymerization contributing to the formation
of stable LTP (Messaoudi et al., 2007). One or more proteins
synthesized
locally
in
response
to
activation
of
TrkB
receptors may act locally as a ‘synaptic tag’ (Reymann and
Frey,
2007)
to
specifically
bind
pre-existing
or
newly
synthesized plasticity-related proteins at activated synapses
expressing LTP.
Importantly, a recent study shows that the presympto-
matic impairment in LTP in hippocampal slices from knock-
in mouse models of Huntington’s disease can be rescued
with
BDNF,
suggesting
that
the
upregulation
of
this
neurotrophin and/or its signaling activity could be a possible
treatment for cognitive deficits in asymptomatic carriers of
Huntington’s disease (Lynch et al., 2007). The role of BDNF
in LTP contrasts with the effect of proBDNF in enhancing
NR2B-dependent long-term synaptic depression, and NR2B-
mediated synaptic currents, in the hippocampus (Woo et al.,
2005). The effect of proBDNF in LTD is mediated by p75NTR,
but the signalling mechanisms involved remain to be
determined.
Concluding remarks
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor is a strong molecular
candidate for regulating synaptic plasticity, over short time-
scales, which requires the involvement of post-translational
modifications of pre-existing synaptic components, and also
over longer timescales, which requires changes in gene
expression or in local protein synthesis. The direct roles for
BDNF in synaptic plasticity require synapse-specific actions
of the neurotrophin, and precise temporal resolution of
these actions. At present, it is still unresolved how the spatial
and temporal specificity of the actions of BDNF are assured.
Elucidation of these issues is crucial for understanding the
function of BDNF as a synaptic modulator.
