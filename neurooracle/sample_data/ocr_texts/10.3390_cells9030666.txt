Abstract: Autophagy is an important innate immune defense mechanism that controls Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) growth inside macrophages.
Autophagy machinery targets Mtb-containing
phagosomes via xenophagy after damage to the phagosomal membrane due to the Type VII
secretion system Esx-1 or via LC3-associated phagocytosis without phagosomal damage. Conversely,
Mtb restricts autophagy-related pathways via the production of various bacterial protein factors.
Although bacterial lipids are known to play strategic functions in Mtb pathogenesis, their role in
autophagy manipulation remains largely unexplored. Here, we report that the lipid virulence factors
sulfoglycolipids (SLs) and phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIMs) control autophagy-related pathways
through distinct mechanisms in human macrophages. Using knock-out and knock-in mutants of Mtb
and Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Bacille Calmette Guerin) and puriﬁed lipids, we found that (i) Mtb
mutants with DIM and SL deﬁciencies promoted functional autophagy via an MyD88-dependent and
phagosomal damage-independent pathway in human macrophages; (ii) SLs limited this pathway
by acting as TLR2 antagonists; (iii) DIMs prevented phagosomal damage-independent autophagy
while promoting Esx-1-dependent xenophagy; (iv) and DIMs, but not SLs, limited the acidiﬁcation
of LC3-positive Mtb compartments. In total, our study reveals an unexpected and intricate role
for Mtb lipid virulence factors in controlling autophagy-related pathways in human macrophages,
thus providing further insight into the autophagy manipulation tactics deployed by intracellular
bacterial pathogens.

1. Introduction
Each year, over 1.5 million people die from tuberculosis. This pulmonary infectious disease,
which is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains the leading cause of death worldwide of
bacterial origin. Mtb pathogenicity is closely related to its ability to survive in macrophages through the
deployment of strategies to escape or neutralize host defenses [1]. One of these defenses is autophagy, a
cellular process that allows for the capture of intracellular bacteria and their killing by lysosomes [2–5].
After phagocytosis by macrophages, Mtb resides in a single-membrane-bound compartment
called the phagosome. The autophagy machinery targets Mtb-containing phagosomes via two main

degradative pathways, xenophagy and LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) [6–10]. The LAP pathway
is triggered upon bacterial phagocytosis (after the engagement of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)
on the cell surface) to promote LC3 conjugation to the phagosomal membrane: this phagosome is
called a LAPosome [11]. Interestingly, Mtb RNA delivered by extracellular vesicles from infected
macrophages in combination with IFN-β can also promote LAP via an RIG-I/MAVS-dependent
pathway [12]. On the other hand, damage to the phagosomal membrane, which is triggered by the Type
VII secretion system Esx-1, promotes xenophagy via the exposure of pathogen-associated molecular
patterns (PAMPs) to the cytosolic sensor cGAS (cyclic GMP-AMP synthase), followed by STING
signaling and the ubiquitination of damaged phagosome or via galectin recruitment onto the damaged
phagosome [7,13–15]. Alternatively, the xenophagy of Mtb-containing phagosomes can be achieved
exogenously using pharmaceutical drugs or immunomodulators, such as cytokines [5,16]. Xenophagy
requires the formation of an LC3-decorated double-membrane-bound compartment, which is called an
autophagosome and engulfs the bacteria. Importantly, both the LAP and xenophagy pathways result
in acidiﬁcation, fusion with lysosomes of the Mtb compartment, and eventually bacterial death [7,10].
Mtb evades various host defense mechanisms (autophagy is one of them) [1,5]. Over the past
decade, several studies have identiﬁed the mycobacterial proteins implicated in autophagy inhibition.
For instance, Eis, an N-acetyl transferase, and PE_PGRS47 prevent autophagy initiation, whereas Esx-1
limits autophagic ﬂux, i.e., fusion with lysosomes [17–19]. Recently, CpsA has been shown to restrict
the LAP pathway by impairing the assembly of the NADPH oxidase NOX2 [10]. While quite a few
mycobacterial proteins have been investigated, very little is known about the role of Mtb lipids in
macrophage autophagy. In particular, little information is available on the noncovalently associated
lipids located in the outermost part of the cell envelope, despite the fact that several of them contribute
eﬃciently to pathogenesis [20,21].
These complex lipids are present on the surface of the bacteria and can be traﬃcked inside
infected cells, as well as extracellularly. Some of them are potent immunomodulators. They can act as
ligands of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and can trigger autophagy upon phagocytosis [22,23]. Others,
such as mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan, limit LC3 recruitment onto latex beads containing
phagosomes via an unknown mechanism [23,24]. A few envelope lipids also have a role in Mtb
virulence, among which are major lipid virulence factors phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIMs, also
called PDIMs), and Mtb-speciﬁc lipids sulfoglycolipids (SLs, also called SGLs). Recently, DIMs have
been proposed to induce autophagy. Indeed, THP-1 macrophages infected with an Mtb mutant with
DIM transport deﬁciencies have lower levels of GFP-LC3 associated with their membranes than do
those with wild-type (WT) Mtb, suggesting either a decrease in autophagy or an activation of LC3
degradation [25,26]. Whether DIMs promote the targeting of Mtb through autophagy machinery also
remains to be investigated [26]. Another work has reported that puriﬁed Mtb SLs promote GFP-LC3
puncta accumulation in macrophages [27]. Again, it is unclear whether SLs activate autophagy or
prevent LC3 turnover. In addition, the importance of SLs in the bacterial context has not been addressed.
Collectively, these published data suggest that DIMs and SLs may modulate macrophage autophagy, but
how these lipids precisely control autophagy-related pathways that target Mtb-containing phagosomes
needs to be explored.
Here, we investigated the contributions of Mtb lipid virulence factors (DIMs and SLs) to the
modulation of autophagy during the course of human macrophage infection. Our work unveiled a
multifaceted role for Mtb lipid virulence factors in controlling autophagy-related pathways. Overall,
this study deepens our understanding of autophagy manipulation by Mtb and the functions of lipid
virulence factors in infection.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Antibodies and Reagents
The following rabbit antibodies were used: Atg16L1 (#PA1-18296 Thermo Scientiﬁc), beclin-1
(#sc-11427 Santa Cruz), and LC3 (#L7543 Sigma, #PM036 MBL). The following mouse antibodies were
used: beta-actin (#sc-81178 Santa Cruz), galectin-3 (#556904 BD Pharmingen), and ubiquitin (FK2,
#BML-PW8810 Enzo Life Sciences). Pam3CSK4 was purchased from Invivogen. The synthetic SL
analog (2,3-dipalmitoyl-2′-sulfate-α-α′-d-trehalose) we used was a kind gift from Drs. Jacques Prandi
and Martine Gilleron (Institute of Pharmacology and Structural Biology, Toulouse) [28,29]. The DIMs
were prepared as previously described [30].
2.2. Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions
The green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP)-expressing strains used in this study included WT Mtb H37Rv
Pasteur, Mtb H37Rv∆ppsE,∆pks2 (PMM127, deﬁcient in DIMs and SLs), Mtb H37Rv∆ppsE,∆pks2::ppsE
(PMM127/DIM, complemented with DIM production), Mtb H37Rv∆ppsE,∆pks2::pks2 (PMM127/SL,
complemented with SL production), WT M. bovis BCG Pasteur 1173P2, M. bovis BCG::ESX-1, BCG∆mas
(deﬁcient in DIMs), and BCG∆mas::ESX-1 [31]. All strains were cultured at 37 ◦C in liquid Middlebrook
7H9 liquid medium (Difco) supplemented with 10% (v/v) ADC (albumin-dextrose-catalase, Difco) and
0.05% (v/v) Tween-80. When required, kanamycin and hygromycin were added to the medium at a
ﬁnal concentration of 40 µg/mL and 50 µg/mL, respectively.
2.3. Cell Culture and Infection
Human blood from fully anonymous nontuberculous donors was purchased from the
Etablissement Français du Sang of Toulouse. Human macrophages derived from monocytes (hMDMs)
were prepared as described in Reference [32]. In brief, monocytes plated into 24-well plates were
isolated by adhesion from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and allowed to diﬀerentiate
for 7 days in RPMI (Roswell Park Memorial Institute) 1640 medium (Gibco, USA) supplemented with 2
mM glutamine (Gibco) and 7% (v/v) heat-inactivated human AB serum at 37 ◦C in 5% CO2. The culture
medium was renewed on the third day. Before use, hMDMs were washed twice with fresh RPMI
medium containing glutamine.
Human monocytic THP-1 cells (ATCC TIB-202T) and WT THP-1-XblueTM and THP-1-XblueTM
MyD88 knockouts (Invivogen) were cultured in complete RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v)
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-Glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 1% (v/v) MEM
(minimum essential media) nonessential amino acids. THP-1 monocytes were diﬀerentiated into
macrophages with 20 ng/mL phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Fisher bioreagents) for 24 h at 37
◦C in 5% CO2. The PMA was washed away, and the cells were rested for at least 1 h in RPMI medium
before infection.
A mycobacterial infection was performed as described in Reference [32]. Brieﬂy, exponentially
growing mycobacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and subsequently dispersed in serum-free RPMI
1640 medium using sterile glass beads. The number of bacteria per ml in the suspension was estimated
through a measurement of the optical density at 600 nm. Human macrophages were infected for 1 h at
an MOI (multiplicity of infection) between 5 and 10 in RPMI medium at 37 ◦C in 5% CO2. Extracellular
bacteria were then removed by three successive washes with fresh medium, and infected cells were
further incubated in RMPI medium supplemented with heat-inactivated serum at 37 ◦C in 5% CO2.
2.4. Western Immunoblotting and a Proteome Proﬁler Human Phospho-Kinase Array Kit
THP-1 cells were seeded and diﬀerentiated in 6-well plates (5 × 106 cells). Cells were infected
with Mtb strains at MOI = 10 for 1 h, and then extracellular bacteria were washed away. Infected cells
were incubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of 100 nM Baﬁlomycin A1 (Santa Cruz, CA, USA)
(for the last 2 h) (0.1% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) was used as a negative control, Sigma, USA). For the

Cells 2020, 9, 666

Pam3CSK4 experiment, cells were treated with the indicated concentration for 2 h, and then 100 nM
Baﬁlomycin A1 or the DMSO control was added and cells were incubated for 2 h to block autophagic
ﬂux and accumulate LC3-II. After incubation, the cells were lysed with a Laemmli buﬀer containing
beta-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 10–15 min at 95 ◦C. Denaturated proteins were subjected to SDS
(sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (4–16% gradient) using a Tris/glycine
buﬀer system (BioRad, USA). After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose transfer
membrane. Blots were blocked with 5% dried milk or bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS (phosphate
buﬀered saline) and then incubated with primary antibodies and the corresponding horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Thermo Scientiﬁc, USA). Immunostaining was detected
with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc). A beta-actin band was
used as a loading control. A proteome proﬁler array kit (ARY003B) was purchased from R&D Systems
(USA). Each array contained two membranes spotted in duplicate with antibodies against 43 diﬀerent
phosphorylated proteins and 2 related total proteins. The assay was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Membranes were visualized with a ChemiDocTM Touch Imaging System
(BioRad), and integrated densities of Western blot bands and phospho-kinase array dots were measured
using Image J software (National Institutes of Health).
2.5. Immunoﬂuorescence, Lysotracker Staining, and Confocal Microscopy
Macrophages cultured on sterile glass coverslips were infected with GFP (green ﬂuorescent
protein)-expressing mycobacteria and ﬁxed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy
Sciences, USA) at diﬀerent times after infection. Cells were then permeabilized for 5 min through
a treatment in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X100. After blocking with 4% (w/v) BSA (bovine serum
albumin) and 2% (v/v) goat serum in PBS, permeabilized cells were incubated with primary antibody
followed by secondary Alexa 568-conjugated antibody or Alexa 647-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen,
France). For the LysoTracker Red (LTR) experiment, cells were incubated during the last two 2 h of
postinfection with LTR (Invitrogen) at 1 µM, followed by several washes and ﬁxation. The coverslips
were mounted onto glass slides with ﬂuorescent mounting medium (Dako) and were analyzed on a
Zeiss LSM510 or Olympus FV1000 confocal microscope. Around 15 to 30 random images were taken
per condition per independent experiment. Images were analyzed using LSM510 or Image J software.
2.6. Statistical Analyses
The data were from at least three independent experiments, and they are shown as the mean ±
SEM (standard error of the mean). Statistical analyses were performed with Graphpad Prism version 5
software using Student’s two-tailed t-test. Diﬀerences were considered signiﬁcant when the p-value
was inferior to 0.05.
3. Results
3.1. The Loss of SLs and DIMs Promoted LC3 Recruitment to M. tuberculosis Compartments
In our previously published work, we reported that the Mtb mutant PMM127, which is lacking
in both DIMs and SLs, is traﬃcked more eﬃciently to lysosomes than is WT Mtb (in human
macrophages) [33]. Importantly, the Mtb mutant PMM127 does not represent a signiﬁcant change
to the bacterial cell envelope structure [33]. However, whether this Mtb mutant interacts diﬀerently
with autophagy machinery than does WT Mtb was not investigated. First, we examined endogenous
LC3’s association with the Mtb intracellular compartment using immunoﬂuorescence and confocal
microscopy. Human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) were pulsed with GFP-expressing
Mtb strains for 1 h, chased for diﬀerent time points, and stained with a speciﬁc antibody against
LC3. At both early (2 h) and late time points (72 h) postinfection (p.i.), the percentage of Mtb positive
for LC3 was two times higher with PMM127 than with WT (Figure 1A,B). These results were also
observed in PMA-diﬀerentiated THP-1 macrophages up to 96 h p.i (Figure 1C). To determine the

contribution of each type of lipid to the inhibition of LC3 recruitment, macrophages were infected with
PMM127 that had been complemented genetically for either DIM or SL production [31]. At 2 h p.i., the
complemented strains behaved like PMM127. However, at a late time point p.i. (72 h), DIM and SL
production signiﬁcantly reduced LC3 colocalization with PMM127-containing compartments by 50%
and 90%, respectively (Figure 1A,B). These results reveal that Mtb producing SLs, and to a lesser extent
DIMs, are able to prevent LC3 recruitment to Mtb compartments in human macrophages.

antibody. Specimens were analyzed using confocal ﬂuorescence microscopy. (A) Representative

3.2. The Mtb Mutant Deﬁcient in DIMs and SLs Promoted Autophagy Activation
Several studies have revealed that LC3 can be involved in autophagy-independent processes [34].
To conﬁrm that PMM127 is more targeted by autophagy machinery than is WT Mtb, we examined
the intracellular localization of endogenous Beclin-1 and Atg16L1, two autophagy-related gene
(Atg) products acting upstream of LC3. An immunoﬂuorescence confocal microscopy analysis and
quantiﬁcation showed that around 65% to 50% of PMM127 was colocalized with Beclin-1 and Atg16L1
independently of the time postinfection, whereas only 30% to 20% of WT Mtb was associated with these
proteins (Figure 2A–D). To determine whether the increase in Atg recruitment was associated with
an upregulation of these proteins, we evaluated the protein levels of Beclin-1 and Atg16L1 through

Cells 2020, 9, 666

immunoblotting. Infection with PMM127 induced an approximately two-fold increase in the Beclin-1
protein amount compared to WT Mtb and noninfected macrophages (Figure S1A,B). Although not
signiﬁcant, a similar trend was observed for Atg16L1 (Figure S1C,D). Using quantitative RT-PCR,
we found that both WT Mtb and PMM127 induced an increase in BECN1 gene expression, but not in
ATG16L1 expression (Figure S1E,F). However, no diﬀerence was detected between the two strains for
either gene, indicating that the diﬀerence observed upon infection with WT or PMM127 was not due
to diﬀerential gene expression. Collectively, these data indicate that the lipid-deﬁcient Mtb mutant
promoted autophagy machinery recruitment to bacterial compartments.

Lysates were analyzed using immunoblotting with anti-LC3 or anti-actin antibodies. The densitometric
LC3-II/actin ratios are shown underneath the blot. The ratios were normalized to the ratio of noninfected
(NI) cells in the absence of BafA1. Data are representative of two independent experiments.

To further explore autophagy activation, LC3-II lysosomal turnover was determined using
Baﬁlomycin A1 (BafA1), an inhibitor of lysosomal degradative activities, and immunoblotting. WT Mtb
and PMM127 infections resulted in an increase in LC3-II turnover compared to noninfected macrophages
(Figure 2E). However, the turnover was almost two-fold higher with PMM127 (LC3-II/actin with BafA1
minus LC3-II/actin without BafA1 = 5.85) than with WT (LC3-II/actin with BafA1 minus LC3-II/actin
without BafA1 = 3.25) (Figure 2E). Furthermore, in the presence of BafA1, the total level of LC3-II was
much greater with PMM127 than with the WT, which supported the idea of the activation of autophagy
initiation. Altogether, these results indicate that the lipid-deﬁcient Mtb mutant unleashed functional
autophagy in macrophages.
3.3. The Mtb Mutant Deﬁcient in DIMs and SLs Promoted Autophagy via MyD88
In order to get some insight into the signaling pathway involved in autophagy activation induced
by PMM127, we used an unbiased approach based on a phosphoprotein-speciﬁc antibody array [35].
We found that the two major signaling pathways implicated in autophagy regulation, i.e., mTOR
(mammalian target of rapamycin) (p70S6K phosphorylation) and AMPK (5′ AMP-activated protein
kinase), were activated in the WT Mtb- and PMM127-infected macrophages (Figure S2A,B) [36].
However, the levels of activation were similar between WT and PMM127, indicating that these two
pathways were not responsible for the autophagy upregulation observed with Mtb mutants deﬁcient
in DIMs and SLs.
The TLR/MyD88 signaling pathway is known to promote autophagy [3], in particular in
mycobacteria-infected macrophages [22,37]. Therefore, we investigated its role in PMM127-induced
autophagy. Diﬀerentiated THP-1 macrophages (WT or MyD88 knockouts (KOs)) were infected
with WT Mtb or PMM127 and treated with BafA1 to determine the total amount of LC3-II formed
upon infection. Immunoblot analyses showed that the LC3-II level in infected cells was reduced in
MyD88-deﬁcient macrophages compared to WT macrophages (Figure 3A). Importantly, while in WT
macrophages PMM127 induced more LC3-II than did WT Mtb, this diﬀerence was drastically reduced
in MyD88-deﬁcient macrophages. These results indicated that Mtb mutants deﬁcient in DIMs and
SLs promoted autophagy via TLR/MyD88. This is consistent with published data showing that SLs
limit the TLR/MyD88 pathway in macrophages by acting as a competitive TLR2 antagonist [28]: it is
also consistent with a recent report indicating that DIMs evade TLR signaling in macrophages [38],
although the mechanism of action remains unclear [39].
3.4. Synthetic SL, but not Puriﬁed DIM, Molecules Limited TLR2-Dependent Autophagy
TLR2, one of the main PRRs (pattern recognition receptors) that recognize Mtb [40], has
been implicated in autophagy activation in the context of mycobacterial infection [22,41,42].
Next, we investigated whether SLs and DIMs could per se limit TLR2-dependent autophagy by
testing puriﬁed SL and DIM molecules. TLR2-dependent autophagy was induced by incubating
macrophages with a synthetic lipopeptide TLR2 ligand, Pam3CSK4.
First, we determined the
concentration of Pam3CSK4 required for autophagy activation in THP-1 macrophages and found that
2.5 µg/mL was necessary to obtain about a two-fold increase in the LC3-II total in the presence of
BafA1 (Figure 3B). Cells were then pretreated with a synthetic analog of SLs [28] or with puriﬁed DIMs,
followed by Pam3CSK4 treatment in the presence of BafA1. We found that synthetic SLs at 10 µg/mL
inhibited TLR2-mediated autophagy by around 20% but had a negligible eﬀect on basal autophagy
(Figure 3C). Similar results were obtained with SLs at 20 µg/mL (Figure S3A,C) and another TLR2 ligand,
zymosan (Figure S3B). In contrast, puriﬁed DIMs at 100 µg/mL did not inhibit Pam3CSK4-induced
autophagy, but rather seemed to activate basal autophagy (Figure 3D, Figure S3D). These results show
that SL, but not DIM, molecules could directly prevent TLR2-mediated autophagy.

treated with 100 nM Baﬁlomycin A1 (BafA1) during the last 2 h post-infection. Lysates were analyzed
using immunoblotting with anti-LC3 or anti-actin antibodies. The densitometric LC3-II/actin ratios are

or anti-Actin antibodies. LC3-II/actin ratios were normalized to the ratio of cells without Pam3CSK4
and BafA1. (C) Diﬀerentiated THP-1 cells were pretreated for 30 min with 10 µg/mL of SL synthetic

was added for 2 h more. LC3-II/actin ratios were normalized to the ratio of cells without Pam3CSK4.
Data are representative of two independent experiments. (D) Diﬀerentiated THP-1 cells were pretreated
for 60 min with 70 µM (100 µg/mL) of puriﬁed DIMs and then incubated with 2.5 µg/mL Pam3CSK4 for

to the ratio of cells without Pam3CSK4. Data are representative of two independent experiments.
3.5. Autophagy Mediated by a Lipid-Deﬁcient Mtb Mutant Was Not Associated with Phagosomal Damage
TLR/MyD88 is involved in autophagy pathways that target either damaged or intact
phagosomes [37,43,44]. Since Mtb can reside in both types of phagosome, we examined whether
enhanced LC3 recruitment was associated with enhanced phagosomal membrane damage using
ubiquitin and galectin-3 as markers [45]. Immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy analyses
showed that, at 3 days p.i., a small percentage of LC3-positive compartments containing WT Mtb,
around 20%, were positive for ubiquitin and galectin-3 (Figure 4A–D). This result highlights the
coexistence of two autophagy-related pathways targeting Mtb, one linked to phagosomal damage and
a second that targets intact phagosomes. Importantly, the percentage of LC3 compartments containing
Mtb that were positive for ubiquitin and galectin-3 dropped signiﬁcantly to approximately 5% with
PMM127. These ﬁndings indicate that the loss of DIMs and SLs did not enhance LC3 recruitment to
the damaged phagosome, but rather promoted LC3 recruitment to the damage-free phagosome.

3.6. DIMs Limited Phagosomal Damage-Independent Autophagy while Promoting
Esx-1-Dependent Autophagy
As shown in Figure 4, we noted a higher proportion of damage-associated autophagy with WT
Mtb than with a lipid-deﬁcient mutant. To determine which lipids, DIMs or SLs, were involved in
this process, macrophages were infected with PMM127 complemented genetically for DIM or SL
production, and the percentage of LC3 compartments containing Mtb that were positive for ubiquitin or
galectin-3 was counted. Mtb complementation for DIM production (but not SL) signiﬁcantly increased
the percentage of LC3-positive compartments containing Mtb that were positive for ubiquitin and
for galectin-3 (Figure 5A). These results were consistent with our published data, which showed an
increase in phagosomal damage when Mtb was complemented for DIM (but not for SL) production [31].
Thus, DIMs seemed to favor LC3 associated with phagosomal damage (Figure 5A). However, overall,
DIMs inhibited LC3 recruitment to Mtb compartments (Figure 1A,B), suggesting that these lipids may
inhibit LC3 recruitment to damage-free phagosomes. To validate this hypothesis, we investigated the
respective contribution of these two pathways using Mycobacterium bovis Bacillus Calmette-Guérin
(BCG), which is naturally deﬁcient in SLs; Esx-1, a secretion system required for phagosomal damage;
and recombinant BCG strains expressing diﬀerent combinations of DIMs and Esx-1 [31]. Macrophages
were infected with diﬀerent GFP-expressing BCG strains and stained for endogenous LC3 and
ubiquitin. As expected from a previous work [7], damage-dependent autophagy was induced by
Esx-1, as seen in the occurrence of ubiquitin in LC3-positive compartments containing BCG::Esx-1
but not BCG (Figure 5B). Furthermore, we observed that DIM-deﬁcient BCG::Esx-1 was less able to

Cells 2020, 9, 666

promote ubiquitin-associated autophagy than was DIM-proﬁcient BCG::Esx-1. This conﬁrmed that
DIMs promoted damage-dependent autophagy in the presence of functional Esx-1. Nevertheless,
the percentage of mycobacteria positive for LC3 was signiﬁcantly higher in the absence of DIM, even
in the absence of Esx-1, indicating that DIMs inhibited damage-independent autophagy (Figure 5C)
while promoting Esx-1-dependent autophagy (Figure 5B).

3.7. DIMs, but not SLs, Limited the Acidiﬁcation of LC3-Positive Compartments Containing Mtb
The autophagy machinery of Beclin-1, Atg16L1, and LC3 targeted Mtb mutants deﬁcient in DIMs
and SLs (Figures 1 and 2). To determine whether the Mtb-containing compartments positive for LC3
could be acidiﬁed, infected macrophages were stained with LysoTracker Red (LTR) and analyzed
using immunoﬂuorescence confocal microscopy [22]. At 72 h p.i., while only 30% of WT Mtb within
the LC3-positive compartments was colocalized with LTR, we observed that more than 50% of the
LC3-positive compartments containing PMM127 were acidiﬁed (Figure 6A,B), indicating that PMM127
not only enhanced LC3 recruitment compared to the WT (Figure 1) but also increased the acidiﬁcation of
LC3-positive bacterial compartments. To determine the contribution of each type of lipid to preventing
the acidiﬁcation of LC3-positive compartments containing Mtb, macrophages were infected with
PMM127 complemented genetically for either DIM or SL production. Only 30% of PMM127/DIMs
within the LC3-positive compartment were acidiﬁed compared to 50% with PMM127/SLs, indicating
that DIM, but not SL, synthesis limited the acidiﬁcation of mycobacterial compartments and restored
the Mtb WT phenotype (Figure 6B).

4. Discussion
In recent years, an increasing number of studies have reported that Mtb can circumvent autophagy
pathways in macrophages by producing diﬀerent bacterial proteins [10,17,18]. The present study
reports, for the ﬁrst time, that Mtb lipid virulence factors, namely DIMs and SLs, control autophagy
at multiple levels in infected human macrophages. First, we found that Mtb mutants deﬁcient
in DIMs and SLs upregulated autophagy pathways that rely on MyD88 but not on phagosomal
damage. SLs prevented this pathway by acting as an TLR2 antagonist. DIMs also limited autophagy
independently of phagosomal damage, but in addition promoted an autophagy pathway that relied on
Esx-1-mediated phagosomal damage. Finally, the presence of DIMs, unlike SLs, prevented acidiﬁcation
of the LC3-positive compartments containing Mtb (Figure 7).
Our previous work indicated that Mtb deﬁcient in DIMs and SLs was attenuated in macrophages
and in a mice model of infection (compared to WT Mtb) [33]. Furthermore, using an autophagy
inhibitor, Baﬁlomycin A1, we were able to restore the WT Mtb growth phenotype [31], indicating
that autophagy could contribute to growth attenuation. Here, we show that Mtb mutants deﬁcient
in DIMs and SLs promoted an autophagy-related pathway that required MyD88 but did not involve
phagosomal damage. The LAP pathway is triggered upon phagocytosis after the engagement of PRRs
on the cell surface (which includes TLR2) to promote LC3 conjugation in undamaged phagosomal
membranes [44]. MyD88 is an important TLR adaptor protein that is involved in autophagy activation
during the course of mycobacterial infection [37]. Recently, the LAP has been shown to target Mtb
phagosomes [11], suggesting that Mtb mutants deﬁcient in DIMs and SLs may stimulate a LAP process
that involves TLR/MyD88 signaling. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that intact Mtb
phagosomes might be captured in autophagosomes by a yet undeﬁned molecular mechanism [46].
A growing amount of literature has demonstrated the key role of TLR/MyD88 signaling in bacterial
infections [2,3,37,47]. Mtb produces numerous TLR ligands involved in triggering immune responses,
but it has also developed several strategies to avoid recognition or to alter downstream signaling
cascades [40]. Here, we found that SLs were able to restrict LC3 recruitment to an intact phagosome
containing Mtb. As anticipated from our previous published data, which showed that SLs act as
an antagonist of TLR2 [28], synthetic SLs prevented TLR2-induced autophagy. In contrast, puriﬁed
DIMs did not prevent TLR2-mediated autophagy. This could be explained by either a requirement for
the entire bacteria or the inhibition of MyD88-induced autophagy (which is independent of TLR2).

In human macrophages, DIMs are transferred to host cell membranes and disorganize the lipid bilayer
in a way that modulates phagocytic receptor functions [30,32]. We thus suspect that DIMs’ eﬀects
on membranes can aﬀect membrane receptors such as TLR. Recently, the Mtb lipoprotein LprE has
been shown to suppress TLR2-dependent autophagy [42]. Since Mtb produces several factors that
antagonize TLR2, such as Esat-6 and phenolic glycolipids [48,49], it is tempting to speculate that these
factors might also participate in limiting TLR2-induced autophagy during the course of Mtb infection.
Recently, DIMs, but not SLs, have been reported to be required for phagosomal damage and rupture
in human macrophages [26,31]. Furthermore, a ﬂow cytometry analysis has shown that Mtb mutants
deﬁcient in DIMs accumulated less membrane-bound LC3-II than did WT Mtb, which suggested
reduced autophagy initiation, although this could also be interpreted as an increase in autophagic
ﬂux [26]. Along the same lines, in lymphatic endothelial cells, DIMs promote phagosomal rupture
and recruitment of the xenophagy receptors NDP52 and p62 to Mtb, hinting toward a pro-xenophagy
role for DIMs [50]. As anticipated, our ﬁndings demonstrate that DIMs, but not SLs, triggered the
xenophagy of Mtb in human macrophages. Importantly, we found that DIMs induced xenophagy only
when the mycobacteria expressed functional Esx-1, which underscores the signiﬁcance of the interplay
between DIM and Esx-1 in modulating host defense mechanisms, including autophagy.
Another interesting ﬁnding is the role of DIMs in preventing the acidiﬁcation of LC3-positive
Mtb compartments (Figure 7). Mtb seems to limit autophagic ﬂux by preventing Rab7 recruitment in
autophagosomal membranes [51]. One major Mtb factor known to block the last stage of autophagy is
Esx-1 and its eﬀector Esat-6, albeit their molecular mechanisms of action remain to be elucidated [19,51].
We have previously shown that DIMs prevent the acidiﬁcation of the Mtb phagosome inside human
macrophages [32]. Here, we found that DIMs also interfered with the acidiﬁcation of LC3-positive
compartments containing Mtb. How DIMs block the acidiﬁcation of phagosomes is under intensive
investigation. Since DIMs and Esx-1 synergize to promote phagosomal damage and xenophagy, it will
be interesting to determine whether they also act together in preventing the acidiﬁcation of autophagic
compartments. Importantly, DIM action seems to be speciﬁc, as we did not observe such inhibition
with SLs, even though puriﬁed SLs can modulate phagosome acidiﬁcation [52,53]. Other mycobacterial
lipids are known to prevent phagosome acidiﬁcation [23,54–57]. Whether such lipids impair the
acidiﬁcation of autophagosomes or LAPosomes needs to be explored.
Compelling evidence has shown that DIMs and SLs exert multiple activities during the infection
of macrophages, including the modulation of immune responses [20,26,28,31,38]. Here, we established
a new role for DIMs and SLs in the control of autophagy. To survive in the adverse environment of the
host, Mtb alters its gene expression. It should be noted that the genes involved in the biosynthesis of
SLs and DIMs are upregulated upon infection [58,59]. In addition, the mass of these lipids increases as
a result of their synthesis being coupled to cholesterol metabolism [60–62]. Given the multifaceted
functions of SLs and DIMs, it is therefore reasonable to propose that the expansion of lipid pools in
M. tuberculosis has important consequences in pathogenesis.
To conclude, our work uncovered novel Mtb virulence factors involved in the evasion of
macrophage autophagy. To our knowledge, DIMs and SLs are the ﬁrst bacterial lipids reported
to modulate autophagy in an infection context. In addition to being attractive potential therapeutic
targets in curtailing Mtb infection, DIMs and SLs, or synthetic functional analogs, might be useful
tools for further deciphering the mechanisms of autophagy inhibition. Exploring these molecular
mechanisms should help in the development of new compounds to either stimulate autophagy in the
context of host-directed therapy against tuberculosis [5] or to limit detrimental autophagy in some
other pathological contexts [63,64]. A deeper understanding of the multiple roles of autophagy in Mtb
infection is warranted to discover important clues for the development of autophagy-based vaccines
against and therapies for tuberculosis [65,66].

human macrophages. Mtb resides inside either a damaged or an intact phagosome [1]. The Type VII
secretion system Esx-1 promotes phagosomal damage, which leads to xenophagy [7]. However, Esx-1
can also inhibit autophagic ﬂux via an unknown mechanism [19,51,67]. Here, we found that (i) SLs
limited TLR/MyD88-dependent and phagosomal damage-independent autophagy by acting as a TLR2
antagonist (1). (ii) DIMs prevented, to some extent, phagosomal damage-independent autophagy
(dotted line) (1) while triggering xenophagy by favoring Esx-1-dependent phagosomal damage (2).
