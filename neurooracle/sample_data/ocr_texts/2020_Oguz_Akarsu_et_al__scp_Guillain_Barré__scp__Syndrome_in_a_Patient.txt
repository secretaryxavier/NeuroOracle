Guillain-Barré Syndrome in a Patient With Minimal Symptoms
of COVID-19 Infection
The new coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavi-
rus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, has become a pandemic. Here, we
report a patient with Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) who had
evidence of a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, but
was otherwise asymptomatic for COVID-19 except for a low-grade
fever.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

A 53-year-old previously healthy woman presented with a 3-day
history of dysarthria associated with progressive weakness and numb-
ness of the lower extremities. She had no history of recent infection
or vaccination. Vital signs were normal. A neurologic examination rev-
ealed mild dysarthria due to jaw weakness and bilateral, predomi-
nantly lower limb weakness, with 4−/5 strength in knee and ankle
flexor and extensor muscles, and 4−/5 in the left and 4+/5 in right hip
flexor muscles by the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. She
could walk only with assistance. There was slight weakness in her
hand muscles. Reduced sensation to pinprick was found distally to the
upper thighs. Tendon reflexes were absent in the lower extremities.
GBS was considered to be the most likely diagnosis.
Biochemical screening (electrolytes, liver and kidney function
tests, C-reactive protein) and HIV test were normal other than mild
neutropenia (1.49 cells/μL) and a high monocyte percentage (19.77;
normal 4–12) in the complete blood count. Nerve conduction studies
(NCS) confirmed a demyelinating pattern with conduction blocks and
temporal dispersion in motor nerves (Figure 1A, Table 1). Ulnar and
median nerves demonstrated normal minimal F-wave latencies with
decreased persistence (median 55%; ulnar 65%) and increased chro-
nodispersion (median 22.1 ms; ulnar 18.0 ms) (Table 1; Figure 1B).
Plasma exchange (five sessions; one every other day) was performed
5 days after the onset of neurologic symptoms.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar and cervical
spines revealed asymmetrical thickening and hyperintensity of post-
ganglionic roots supplying the brachial and lumbar plexuses in
short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences (Figure 1C,D). Focal
intensities suspicious for COVID-19 pneumonia were incidentally
identified in peripheral areas of lungs on STIR sequence of the bra-
chial plexus MRI (Figure 1E). She had a mild fever (37.5C) but no
cough, dyspnea, anosmia, or ageusia. Chest computed tomography
showed bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities and consolidations
on both lungs (Figure 1F); the patient was placed in isolation. She had
mild lymphopenia (1.042/mm3) and high C-reactive protein level
(33.2 mg/L; normal 0–5 mg/L). Nasopharyngeal swab for real-time
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) SARS-CoV-2 was positive. She
was treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) analysis on day 7 of admission showed a protein level of
32.6 mg/dL with no leucocytes and a CSF test for SARS-CoV-2 was
negative. Two weeks after the onset of symptoms, the neurologic
findings had improved markedly; MRC scores were 4+/5 in lower limb
muscle groups, and she was able to walk without assistance.
Neurologic manifestations during the course of COVID-19 infec-
tion have been described.1 Previous reports of GBS and COVID-19
demonstrated marked respiratory symptoms before or concurrent
with the onset of neurologic symptoms.2–4 In contrast, our patient

with GBS had evidence of a COVID-19 infection, but was otherwise
asymptomatic for COVID-19 except for a low-grade fever.
We speculate that the pathophysiologic mechanism of GBS in
COVID-19 may be para-infectious rather post-infectious, likely due to
“molecular mimicry” that preferentially affects the nervous system
before the respiratory system. Another explanation could be direct
viral neuropathogenic effects on the nervous system.5
This possibility that this patient acquired the virus nosocomially
cannot be ruled out, because we did not perform microbiologic testing
at
the time of admission. In the neurology
clinic,
during the
hospitalization period, none of the other patients or staff had symp-
toms, and none of the contacts had positive PCR results for SARS-
CoV-2. The initial laboratory test demonstrating a high monocyte per-
centage might also support an infection before hospital admission.6
The diagnosis of acute-onset chronic inflammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy (CIDP) cannot be excluded. Nearly 16% of patients
with CIDP show an acute onset, and plasma exchange might have
prevented progression. Motor weakness with less prominent sensory
signs at presentation support the diagnosis of GBS.7
In conclusion, our findings highlight the importance of attention
to the subtle clinical findings of COVID-19 infection in newly
diagnosed GBS.
