Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has coevolved with humans for tens of thousands of
years. It is thus highly adapted to its human host and has evolved multiple mechanisms to
manipulate host immune responses to its advantage. One central host pathogen interaction
modality is host cell death pathways. Host cell apoptosis is associated with a protective
response to Mtb infection, whereas a necrotic response favors the pathogen. Consistently,
Mtb inhibits host cell apoptosis signaling but promotes induction of programmed necrosis.
The molecular mechanisms involved in Mtb-mediated host cell death manipulation, the
consequences for host immunity, and the potential for therapeutic and preventive approach-
es will be discussed.
T
he death of eukaryotic cells is an extremely
diverse and complex event that has been
categorized into multiple cell death types ac-
cording to morphological features and unique
cell signaling and effector molecules involved
(Galluzzi et al. 2012b). Here we will give a brief
overview of apoptosis, necroptosis, and pyro-
ptosis, as these are the cell death modalities
that are the most relevant in regard to interac-
tion of pathogens with their host cell (Lamkanﬁ
and Dixit 2010).
Apoptosis is morphologically characterized
by cell shrinking, fragmentation of the nucleus,
formation of membrane blebs, and apoptotic
bodies. The apoptotic bodies contain cell cyto-
plasm and other cellular organelles and they are
taken up by macrophages via receptor-mediated
phagocytosis. In a process deﬁned as efferocy-
tosis, a macrophage phagocytoses a whole apo-
ptoticcell.Inbothcasesthecytoplasmandother
cellular components never leave the dying cell,
and hence apoptosis is immunologically silent.
Important biochemical and cell signaling events
that are often used to measure cellular apoptosis
are the loss of mitochondrial outer membrane
permeability (MOMP), cleavage and activa-
tion of members of the caspase protease family,
fragmentation of chromosomal DNA, and ex-
ternalization of phosphatidylserine at the cell
membrane. The extrinsic apoptosis signaling
pathway is activated by ligand binding to a death
receptor (DR) such as TNF-receptor or Fas. In-
tracellular signaling events are complex but lead
to the activation of caspase 8, which will then
activate the executioner caspase 3, 6, and 7. The
intrinsic apoptosis signaling pathway can be en-
gaged byan increase in cytosolic reactive oxygen
species (ROS), UV exposure, genotoxic stress,
growth factor withdrawal, and others. These
events will change the equilibrium of pro- and

antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members toward a
majority of proapoptotic proteins being acti-
vated. Two of these are Bax and Bak, which after
activation form a pore that results in MOMP
and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol.
Here it associates with the apoptosis protease
activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) to form the apo-
ptosome complex, which will cleave and acti-
vate procaspase 9. Just like caspase 8, caspase 9
also cleaves and activates the executioner cas-
pases 3, 6, and 7. The activated executioner cas-
pase target and activate a wide array of cellular
proteins, which are responsible for the morpho-
logical changes associated with apoptosis, such
as caspase-activated DNases that cleave chro-
mosomal DNA (Lamkanﬁand Dixit 2010; Gal-
luzzi et al. 2012a) (Fig. 1).
Historically, it was assumed that all cellular
necrosis is accidental but it is now evident that
most necrotic events are highly regulated by a
multitude of pathways (Vanlangenakker et al.
2012). DRs and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) can
induce the formation of an intracellular sig-
naling complex containing Fas-associated death
domain (FADD), caspase 8, rest in peace 1
(RIPK1), and rest in peace 3 (RIPK3). This com-
plex can either induce apoptosis via activated
caspase 8 or necroptosis via activated RIPK3,
depending on other regulatory proteins. RIPK3
leads, via activation of other signaling proteins,
to the disruption of mitochondrial function
and necrosis. RIPK1 knockout mice are not vi-
able and so necrostatin-1, a very speciﬁc inhib-
itor of RIPK1, is commonly used to investigate
RIPK1-mediated necroptosis induction. An-
other important modulator of a necrotic cell
death pathway, referred to as parthanatos, is
the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1).
PARP1 upon short-term activation actually
helps to prevent apoptotic cell deathvia its DNA
repair function. Nevertheless, continuous acti-
vation leads to massive ATP consumption that
triggers mitochondrial malfunction and necro-
sis. PARP1 may also be activated by RIPK1,
highlighting a connection with DR and TLR
signaling (Vanlangenakker et al. 2012; Sridha-
ran and Upton 2014).
Finally, pyroptosis can be regarded as a mix-
ture between apoptosis and programmed ne-
crosis because, like the latter, pyroptosis leads
to cell membrane rupture and no membrane
blebs or apoptotic bodies are produced but,
similar to apoptosis, genomic DNA is degraded
and caspase activation is required (Kepp et al.
2010; Aachoui et al. 2013). In contrast to apo-
ptosis, pyroptosis leads to inﬂammation caused
by the leakage of cytosolic content via damaged
cell membranes and because of the caspase 1–
mediated generation of the secreted inﬂamma-
tory cytokines IL-1b and IL-18. The caspase 1–
mediated pyroptosis can be dependent on the
adaptor ASC in the cases of NLRP3 and AIM2
activation or independent of ASC in the case of
NLRC4-mediated activation. Caspase 11 tran-
scription can be induced via TLR signaling after
bacterial infection, and then it can either lead to
stimulation of caspase 1 activity or directly in-
duce pyroptosis. In contrast to caspase 1, cas-
pase 11 is unable to cleave proIL-1b and proIL-
18 cytokines. The mechanism of caspase 11 ac-
tivation and its downstream targets for pyro-
ptosis induction are unknown (Miao et al. 2011;
Aachoui et al. 2013; Broz and Monack 2013; Ng
and Monack 2013).
HOST CELL APOPTOSIS AND
CONSEQUENCES TO Mtb PATHOGENESIS
The induction of host cell apoptosis was report-
ed to have some direct bactericidal effects on
intracellular bacterial viability (Molloy et al.
1994; Duan et al. 2002). Nevertheless, recent
reports show that this is probably not a major
factor during in vivo infections; instead, uptake
of apoptotic cells by bystander macrophages
and/or neutrophils, a process deﬁned as effer-
ocytosis, can lead to killing of Mtb (Fratazzi
et al. 1997; Blomgran et al. 2012; Briken 2012;
Martin et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2012). The killing
of the bacteria inside the phagocytosed dead cell
depends on recruitment and activation of the
phagosomal NADPH oxidase complex, NOX2,
to generate ROS (Yang et al. 2012). Another
mechanism for the increased killing after effer-
ocytosis is that Mtb, contained within double
membrane phagosomes, is unable to inhibit
phagosome maturation, and consequently lyso-

Figure 1. Host cell apoptosis pathways are classiﬁed into two main categories—extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.
The extrinsic pathway of cell death is triggered by the interaction of death receptors (DRs) with speciﬁc death
ligands and involves activation of caspase 8. Intrinsic pathways are triggered by stimuli that target mitochondria
and result in release of cytochrome c, which participates in apoptosome formation, a platform for caspase 9
activation. In addition, CD8þ T cells engage the extrinsic pathway via the Fas death receptor and the intrinsic
pathway via perforin/granzyme secretion. Caspase 8 and 9 activate downstream effector caspases (caspase 3, 6,
and 7), which leads to the characteristic features of apoptotic cells via activation of multiple targets. Apoptosis is
immunologically silent as cellular material is enclosed within apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis of Mtb-infected cells
results in packaging of mycobacterial antigens within apoptotic bodies that, when phagocytosed by dendritic
cells, allow forantigen presentation to CD8þ T cells viacross-presentation and the induction of a robust adaptive
immune response. Additionally, uptake of dying apoptotic cells by healthy macrophages or neutrophils (effer-
ocytosis) leads to killing of bacteria. However, Mtb-mediated apoptosis induction was also reported to help in
dissemination of bacteria during early phase of infection.

somes and their bactericidal enzymes will fuse
with the Mtb phagosome (Martin et al. 2012).
Granuloma formation is a hallmark feature
of tuberculosis lung pathology (Ramakrishnan
2012; Reece and Kaufmann 2012). Compelling
evidence from the zebraﬁsh model shows that
the ESX-1 secretion system, via secretion of
EsxA (ESAT-6), is involved in the up-regulation
of MMP9 on epithelial cells surrounding the
granuloma, leading to recruitment of uninfect-
ed macrophages (Volkman et al. 2010), and that
this, together with apoptosis induction of in-
fected macrophages, helps in the dissemination
of the bacteria (Davis and Ramakrishnan 2009).
The beneﬁcial effect of host cell apoptosis in the
spread of bacteria and its dependence on the
ESX-1 system were supported by evidence
from Mtb in mouse lung infections showing a
correlation between strains that induce in-
creased lung cell apoptosis and bacterial growth
(Aguilo et al. 2013). Consistently, the proapo-
ptotic nuoG Mtb mutant was present in a larger
number of diverse lung myeloid cells, albeit
with fewer bacteria per cell, compared with
wild-type Mtb during the early phase of aerosol
mouse infection (Blomgran et al. 2012).
It is difﬁcult to reconcile the contradictory
observations of host cell apoptosis on Mtb pa-
thology during the innate phase of the immune
response. One explanation is that maybe during
this phase both features (protective and permis-
sive) of host cell apoptosis come into play. This
may explain why proapoptotic Mtb mutants
do not have a virulence defect during the early
phaseofinvivoinfections,asonewouldexpectif
only the defense features of host cell apoptosis
are in effect (Hinchey et al. 2007; Velmurugan
et al. 2007; Blomgran et al. 2012). Consequently,
proapoptosis mutants may induce better innate
immune defense responses, but they mayalso be
more efﬁcient in attracting uninfected macro-
phages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells, and
hencedisseminate betteraccording tothe results
obtained in the zebraﬁsh model (Davis and Ra-
makrishnan 2009) and by comparing dissemina-
tionofwild-typeandtheproapoptoticnuoGmu-
tant Mtb in mouse lungs (Blomgran et al. 2012).
In contrast, the long-term in vivo survival
studies using proapoptosis Mtb mutants show
that host cell apoptosis induction is beneﬁcial to
host survival overall (Edwards et al. 2001; Vel-
murugan et al. 2007; Sun et al. 2013). Mice in-
fected with the nuoG Mtb mutant survive longer
and have lower bacterial burden in the lungs
duringthe persistent phase of the infection (Vel-
murugan et al. 2007). The knockdown of super-
oxide dismutase A (SodA) resulted in increased
apoptosis of host cells in mouse lungs and de-
creased virulence of the bacteria (Edwards et al.
2001). SodA is secreted via the SecA2 secretion
system in Mtb, and a secA2 deletion mutant was
attenuated in mice (Braunstein et al. 2003) and
has a proapoptosis phenotype because of its
defect in SodA secretion (Hinchey et al. 2007).
However, the SecA2 system also affects other
responses of the hostcelland consequently these
pleiotropic effects of the mutant make the in-
terpretation of the cause of the in vivo attenua-
tion difﬁcult (Ligon et al. 2012). For example,
the early growth defect of the secA2 mutant
is not caused by a lack in SodA export, because
expressing a SodA protein secreted via the
SecA1 pathway could not reverse the phenotype
(Sullivan et al. 2012). This suggests that it is
not the proapoptotic feature of the SecA2 mu-
tant that mediates that phenotype but rather the
defect in the secretion of another effector (Sul-
livan et al. 2012). Recently, an antisense knock-
down approach was successful in reducing ex-
pression of the nucleoside diphosphate kinase
(Ndk) gene in Mtb and showed its importance
for host cell apoptosis inhibition and virulence
(Sun et al. 2013).
Another line of evidence supporting the role
of host cell apoptosis in host defense is provided
by studies using mouse mutants that lack genes
important for either induction or repression of
host cell apoptosis and their changes in sus-
ceptibility to Mtb infections. The Intracellular
pathogen resistance 1 (Ipr1) gene is crucial for
mediating host cell apoptosis instead of necro-
sis on Mtb infections ex vivo (Pan et al. 2005).
The Ipr1 knockout mice are more susceptible
to Mtb infections and induce less host cell apo-
ptosis (Pan et al. 2005). Mice deﬁcient in the 5-
lipoxygenase gene (Alox52/2) cannot produce
the lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and therefore infected
macrophages undergo apoptosis instead of ne-

crosis after Mtb infections (Chen et al. 2008).
The Alox52/2 mice are also more resistant to
Mtb infection (Baﬁca et al. 2005; Divangahi
et al. 2010). Finally, mice deﬁcient in the protein
kinase R (Pkr) gene are more resistant to Mtb
infections, and this correlates with higher levels
of apoptosis in infected macrophages (Wu et al.
2012).
During tissue homeostasis the apoptosis
of cells is immunologically silent. Nevertheless,
in the context of an infection, microbial com-
ponents within apoptotic bodies can, after
phagocytosis, activate dendritic cells in order
to induce antigen presentation and acquired
immunity (Winau et al. 2004). This was ﬁrst
shown for a bacterial pathogen in the context
of Salmonella infection (Yrlid and Wick 2000)
and subsequently also for mycobacterial infec-
tion (Schaible et al. 2003). The uptake of Mtb
antigens via phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies
by DCs allowed for the presentation of extracel-
lular antigens to CD8þ T cells, a process deﬁned
as cross-presentation (Schaible et al. 2003). In-
terestingly, the apoptotic bodies puriﬁed from
mycobacteria-infected cells can be used to vac-
cinate mice and induce a protective immune
response (Winau et al. 2006). This indirect
pathway of generating CD8þ T-cell responses
via uptake of antigen-containing apoptotic
bodies by DCs was deﬁned as the detour path-
way (Winau et al. 2004). Additional evidence
for the importance of host cell apoptosis in-
duction for priming of Mtb-speciﬁc CD8þ T
cells was provided by an analysis of the immune
response after infection of mice with the pro-
apoptotic secA2 Mtb mutant (Hinchey et al.
2007). The increase in CD8þ T-cell priming by
the secA2 mutant was abolished by overexpres-
sion of SodA, which reversed the proapoptotic
phenotype of the secA2 mutant (Hinchey et al.
2007). In an elegant system, adoptive transfer of
wild-type or Alox52/2 macrophages was used
to study the impact of increased apoptosis on
the induction of CD8þ T cells (Divangahi et al.
2010). Transfer of the Mtb-infected Alox52/2
macrophages (which show higher rates of apo-
ptosisthanwild-typemacrophages)resultsinan
increased and more rapid CD8þ T-cell response
against the mycobacterial antigen TB10.4 (Di-
vangahi et al. 2010). The depletion of endoge-
nous DCs abrogates the increase in antigen
presentation after adoptive transfer of the mac-
rophages, thus showing the need for cross-pre-
sentation of Mtb antigens from apoptotic mac-
rophagesbyDCs(Divangahietal.2010).Finally,
aerosol infection of micewith Mtb and the nuoG
Mtb mutant showed an increase of lung neu-
trophil apoptosis after mutant infection that
led to an increase in acquisition of bacteria by
myeloidDCs(Blomgranetal.2012).Thisresult-
ed in a quicker and more robust priming of Mtb
antigen 85–speciﬁc CD4þ T cells (Blomgran
et al. 2012), thus highlighting the impact of
host cell apoptosis induction not only on
CD8þ but also CD4þ T-cell priming. In conclu-
sion, there is strong evidence that host cell apo-
ptosis is an important pathway for increased
host resistance to Mtb infection via induction
of an improved acquired immune response.
MANIPULATION OF APOPTOSIS
PATHWAYS BY Mtb
The literature on the inhibition of host cell ap-
optosis by Mtb has been reviewed recently
(Abebe et al. 2011; Behar et al. 2011; Briken
2013). The mechanisms of inhibition include
the up-regulation of host cell antiapoptosis sig-
naling proteins such asthe Bcl-2 family member
Mcl-1 (Slyet al. 2003) or the Bﬂ-1 protein (Kau-
salya et al. 2001). The Mtb-induced secretion of
soluble host cell TNF-receptor 2 to inhibit TNF
signaling hasalso beendescribed(Balcewicz-Sa-
blinska et al. 1998). In addition, virulent Mtb
H37Rv strains, but not attenuated Mtb H37Ra,
caninhibitTNF-mediatedcelldeathsignalingin
infected cells (Keane et al. 1997). The Fas–FasL
interaction is one pathway for a CD8þ T cell to
induce death of target cells. Mtb infection leads
to a reduction of Fas expression at the cell sur-
face to inhibit T-cell-mediated killing (Oddo
et al. 1998) and activates intracellular signaling
pathways to suppress FasL-induced apoptosis
signaling (Loeuillet et al. 2006). Finally, the neu-
tralization of phagosomal ROS by bacterial de-
fense mechanisms detailed below is important
in suppressing TNF-mediated host cell apopto-
sis (Miller et al. 2010).

Mtb GENES INVOLVED IN HOST CELL
APOPTOSIS INHIBITION
The Mtb nuoG gene is part of a 14-gene operon
(NDH-1) encoding for a type I NADH dehy-
drogenase whose function is important for the
capacity of Mtb to inhibit host cell apoptosis
(Velmurugan et al. 2007; Miller et al. 2010). In
cells infected with the nuoG Mtb mutant, ROS
accumulates in the phagosome, which leads to
an increase in apoptosis (Miller et al. 2010). The
detailed mechanism of how the NDH-1 sys-
tem neutralizes and/or inhibits the ROS gener-
ated by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase system,
NOX2, is still unknown. Catalases and super-
oxide dismutases are enzymes important for
the detoxiﬁcation of superoxides. The deletion
mutant of the Mtb superoxide dismutase, SodA,
is not viable but it was shown that the proapo-
ptotic phenotype of the secretion mutant SecA2
is dependent on the secretion defect of SodA
(Hinchey et al. 2007). It is thus likely that the
mutants deﬁcient in secretion of SodA lead to
an increase in phagosomal ROS similar to the
nuoG mutant, which results in increased apo-
ptosis. Another Mtb protein that targets host
cell ROS is the enhanced intracellular survival
(eis) protein. Nevertheless, it can inhibit not
only NOX2-generated phagosomal ROS but
also mitochondrial ROS via inhibition of the
intracellular kinase JNK (Kim et al. 2012). eis
is a secreted protein that reaches the host cell
cytosol and, via its acetyltransferase activity,
acetylates the phosphatase DUSP16/MKP-7
that increases its activity to dephosphorylate
and hence inactivate JNK (Kim et al. 2012).
The eis Mtb mutant induces caspase-indepen-
dent apoptosis and autophagy that is different
from the nuoG mutant that induces caspase-de-
pendent apoptosis and no autophagy (Miller
et al. 2010; L Srinivasan, unpubl.). Besides
ROS, reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNIs)
are generated in the phagosome to kill bacteria.
The serine/threonine protein kinase E (PknE)
of Mtb is up-regulated by an increase in RNIs,
and without PknE there is an increase in the
expression of proapoptotic members of the
Bcl-2 family (Bax and Bid), a down-regulation
of the antiapoptotic members such as Mcl-1,
and a dephosphorylation of the prosurvival ki-
nase Akt (Jayakumar et al. 2008; Kumar and
Narayanan 2012).
A “loss-of-function” genetic screen for pro-
apoptotic transposon mutants of Mtb identiﬁed
the importance of two operons for host cell
death inhibition (Danelishvili et al. 2010). The
ﬁrst operon (Rv3654c-Rv3660c) encompasses
four genes that have homology with type IV
pili. Interestingly, Rv3654c is secreted into the
host cell cytosol, where it binds to and cleaves
the protein-associated splice factor (PSF),
which is important for splicing of caspase 8
pre-mRNA (Danelishvili et al. 2010). The con-
sequence of this interaction is that there are
lower levels of caspase 8 in cells infected with
wild-type Mtb compared with a Rv3654c dele-
tion mutant (Danelishvili et al. 2010). The oth-
er antiapoptotic operon is Rv3361c-Rv3365c,
which is implicated in the inhibition of cell
death dependent on the inﬂammatory caspase
1 (Danelishvili et al. 2011). After Mtb infection,
Rv3364c entersthe host cell cytosol and bindsto
and inactivates the host cell protease cathepsin
G (Danelishvili et al. 2011). How cathepsin G
regulates caspase 1 activity is not known but it
was hypothesized that the effect might be me-
diated viacathepsin G cleavage and activation of
the protease activated receptor-4, which then
can induce caspase 1 activation via a NOD (nu-
cleotide-binding oligomerization domain)-de-
pendent pathway (Danelishvili et al. 2011) (for
a detailed review, see Briken 2013).
HOST CELL PROGRAMMED NECROSIS
AND CONSEQUENCES TO Mtb
PATHOGENESIS
Host cell programmed necrosis is not detri-
mental to viability of intracellular Mtb (Molloy
et al. 1994; Duan et al. 2002; Gan et al. 2008).
Instead Mtb, after infection and multiplication,
induces programmed necrosis to escape the cell
(Chen et al. 2006; Lee et al. 2006; Behar et al.
2010).
The host cell production of the eicosanoids,
PGE2 versus LXA4, is of critical importance for
the induction of apoptosis or necrosis, respec-
tively (Behar et al. 2010). Mice deﬁcient in 5-

lipoxygenase cannot make LXA4 and thus are
more resistant to Mtb infections (Baﬁca et al.
2005). On the other hand, mice deﬁcient in
prostaglandin E synthase (PTGES) cannot pro-
duce PGE2, and these animals are more suscep-
tible to Mtb infections (Divangahi et al. 2009).
Mutations in zebraﬁsh and humans in the leu-
kotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) are associated
with hypersusceptibility state to mycobacterial
infections (Tobin et al. 2010). This is due to the
increase in LXA4 in the absence of LTA4H, lead-
ing to increased necrosis and decreased TNF
production, which favors mycobacterial repli-
cation and leads to host cell programmed ne-
crosis and increased bacterial virulence (Tobin
et al. 2010). Interestingly, the overexpression of
LTA4H and subsequent high levels of the leuko-
triene B4 (LTB4) and low levels of LXA4 also
leads to an increase in host cell programmed
necrosis and increased susceptibility to myco-
bacterial infections (Tobin et al. 2012). This is
due to the induction of excessive TNF produc-
tion by LTB4, which keeps bacterial replication
low, but favors induction of host cell necrosis
and excessive inﬂammation leading to tissue
damage and pathology (Tobin et al. 2012; Roca
and Ramakrishnan 2013). Hence at both ex-
tremeendsofthespectrum,highLXA4/noLTB4
and high LTB4/no LXA4, the outcomes for the
host are very similar with high levels of host cell
necrosis, host tissue pathology, and host sus-
ceptibility (Tobin et al. 2012; Roca and Rama-
krishnan 2013). This is despite the fact that the
bacterial numbers are quite different in the two
scenarios. High LXA4 levels result in high bac-
terial numbers, and high LTB4 levels result in a
lowbacterialburden(Tobinetal.2012;Rocaand
Ramakrishnan 2013). In conclusion, the Goldi-
locks principle applies to levels of LXA4 and
LTB4 in order to produce a successful host im-
muneresponse(TobinandRamakrishnan2013).
MANIPULATION OF PROGRAMMED
NECROSIS PATHWAYS BY Mtb
A correlation between virulence of Mtb and
its capacity to induce mitochondrial-depen-
dent necrosis was ﬁrst proposed by studies com-
paring the capacities of Mtb H37Rv and the
attenuated Mtb H37Ra strains to disrupt mi-
tochondrial function (Chen et al. 2006; Behar
et al. 2011). Indeed only Mtb H37Rv led to
an early mitochondrial transmembrane poten-
tial loss caused by mitochondrial permeability
transition (MPT) pore complex. Inhibitors of
MPT and mitochondrial Ca2þ inﬂux both ab-
rogated Mtb H37Rv-mediated programmed ne-
crosis induction (Duan et al. 2002; Chen et al.
2006). Other reports showed caspase-indepen-
dent, programmed necrotic cell death induc-
tion after infection of cells with high bacterial
numbers that did not lead to bactericidal ac-
tivity (Lee et al. 2006). The threshold for host
cells to undergo necrosis was determined to be
between 20 and 40 bacteria per phagocyte as
determined in ex vivo and in vivo studies (Lee
et al. 2006; Repasy et al. 2013). This death path-
way was independent of Ca2þ ﬂux and MPT
and did not require lysosomal cathepsin pro-
tease activity (Lee et al. 2006, 2011; Welin et
al. 2011; Wong and Jacobs 2011). One report
showed that this high bacterial burden, pro-
grammed necrosis pathway is independent of
ESX-1 secretion system but requires the pres-
ence of the PhoPR two-component system for
the activation of lysosomal lipases that mediate
cell necrosis (Lee et al. 2011). This is in contrast
to other studies, which showed that cell death
induction of Mtb-infected cells was dependent
on bacterial expression of EsxA, one protein of
the ESX-1 system that is involved in function
of the system but is also a secreted effector itself
(Welin et al. 2011; Wong and Jacobs 2011; Si-
meone et al. 2012). The function of the ESX-1
system was linked to escape of Mtb out of the
phagosome at later stages of the infection,
which coincided with host cell necrosis induc-
tion (Simeone et al. 2012). The Mtb EsxA pro-
tein is important in forming pores in the phag-
osomal membrane (Wong and Jacobs 2011),
which is essential for subsequent NLRP3-in-
ﬂammasome activation, because esxA Mtb mu-
tants are deﬁcient in activation of this inﬂam-
masome (Koo et al. 2008; Kurenuma et al. 2009;
Wong and Jacobs 2011; Abdalla et al. 2012; Do-
rhoi et al. 2012). The activation of NLRP3 in-
ﬂammasome in Mtb-infected cells is dependent
on the tyrosine kinase Syk, and this activation is

essential for cell lysis, hence showing a necrop-
totic host cell death pathway (Wong and Jacobs
2011) (Fig. 2). This is consistent with a previous
report showing the activation of the NLRP3 in-
ﬂammasome by Syk during a fungal infection
(Gross et al. 2009). Another intriguing aspect of
host cell programmed necrosis during myco-
bacterial infections was recently revealed by
studies in the zebraﬁsh model, which showed
that too low as well as too high levels of host
TNF production resulted in increased necrosis
and host susceptibility to infection (Roca and
Ramakrishnan 2013). At too low levels of TNF,
the high intracellular bacterial burden led to
necrosis, whereas at too high levels of TNF the
burden of bacterial per cell was actually reduced
but cells were sensitized by TNF to undergo
RIPK1/3-dependent necroptosis (Roca and Ra-
makrishnan 2013).
Virulent Mtb induces the production of
LXA4 that inhibits cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2)
expression, which is an essential enzyme in the
PGE2 synthesis pathway, and thus increased
LXA4 levels result in decreased PGE2 (Chen
et al. 2008). PGE2 is a central inhibitor of host
cell programmed necrosis via two potentially
related mechanisms. First, high levels of PGE2
limit the mitochondrial membrane damage,
which leads to less ROS leakage into the cyto-
sol and hence less programmed necrosis induc-
tion (Chen et al. 2008). This effect is mediated
via PGE2 binding to the E-prostanoid (EP) 2
receptor leading to protein kinase A activation
and increased cAMP production (Chen et al.
2008). Second, PGE2 induces the recruitment
of Lamp-1-positive vesicles of lysosomal origin
to the cell surface to repair damaged cell mem-
branes (Divangahi et al. 2009). On the basis of
susceptibility to PI3(K) inhibitors it was pro-
posed that the mechanism involves binding
of PGE2 to the EP4 receptor leading to PI(3)K
activation. In the same study it was clearly
shown that PGE2 leads to increased expression
of the calcium sensor synaptotagmin 7 (Syt-7)
and reduced necrosis and, vice versa, that re-
duction of Syt-7 via siRNA approaches inhibit-
ed plasma membrane repair (Divangahi et al.
2009). These data show that regulation of Syt-
7 by PGE2 is central to suppression of host cell
necrosis during infection with avirulent Mtb
strains.
Another pathway through which LXA4
facilitates programmed necrosis is via inhibi-
tion of the formation of the apoptotic cell en-
velope (Gan et al. 2008). The primary target of
LXA4 in these events is the serine protease in-
hibitor, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2
(PAI2), which is down-regulated by increasing
LXA4 levels (Gan et al. 2008). During the apo-
ptotic envelope formation, phosphatidylserine
(PS) and annexin-1 levels at the cell membrane
are augmented. Annexin-1 binds to PS and is
the target for the tissue transglutaminase (tTG),
which cross-links annexin-1 to form a matrix
that stabilizes the apoptotic envelope. Neverthe-
less, annexin-1 can be cleaved by an unknown
cellular serine protease, which will result in a
truncated annexin-1 that binds to PS but can-
not be cross-linked and hence fails to support
the formation of a stable apoptotic envelope
(Gan et al. 2008). The result will be the induc-
tion of cellular lysis. PAI2 is a serine protease
inhibitor that can inhibit the protease cleaving
annexin-1. Thus, Mtb, by inhibiting PAI2 ex-
pression, facilitates programed necrosis induc-
tion (Gan et al. 2008).
As mentioned above, Mtb inhibits the lyso-
somal cell membrane repair pathway via down-
regulation of the calcium sensor Syt-7. There
is a second cell membrane repair pathway that
is not controlled by PGE2 and is dependent
on Golgi-derived vesicles (Divangahi et al.
2009). Interestingly, only this pathway shuttles
PS and annexin-1 to the cell membrane in order
to inhibit cell necrosis and support induction
of apoptosis (Divangahi et al. 2009). Hence, by
targeting the PAI2 protease inhibitor, Mtb has
evolved to ﬁnd away to functionally inhibit also
this second cell membrane repair mechanism.
It is fascinating that this is achieved via target-
ing of one central cellular signaling molecule
the eicosanoid LXA4 (for review, see Behar et
al. 2011). A precise programmed necrosis path-
way using the available hallmark inhibitors or
knockout mice (Fig. 2) has not been deﬁned by
these studies involving LXA4 and consequent-
ly it was referred to here just as programmed
necrosis.

Figure 2. Necroptosis and pyroptosis both lead to the loss of cell membrane integrity. Necroptosis can be
initiated by extracellular ligands interacting with their cognate cell surface receptors (DRs, death receptors;
TLR, Toll-like receptors) or by varied intracellular stress signals (physicochemical stress). One pathway involves
activation of RIPK1 and RIPK3, which leads to mitochondrial malfunction. Intracellular stress can also activate
PARP1, which can signal for mitochondrial dysfunction potentially involving RIPK1 (sometimes referred to as
the parthanatos death pathway). The inﬂammasome (NLR/ASC) may signal directly for necroptosis induction
or indirectly via caspase 1 leading to pyroptosis, which also results in cell lysis but induces DNA degradation
similar to apoptotic cell death. Caspase 11 can signal directly for a pyroptosis-like cell death or indirectly via
NLR/ASC to activate caspase 1–dependent pyroptosis signaling. The cell may attempt to inhibit cell membrane
lysis either by recruitment of lysosomal membranes to the cell surface to repair the cell membrane or by cross-
linking annexin-1 on the cell surface and thus leading to formation of a stable apoptotic envelope. Necrotic cell
death is inﬂammatory as it leads to spilling of the intracellular contents into the extracellular milieu. Mtb has
been associated with both the induction of necrosis pathways and the inhibition of the inhibitory mechanisms.
Programmed necrosis of Mtb-infected host cells leads to bacterial escape, whereas the associated inﬂammatory
response recruits new host cells for extracellular Mtb to infect and replicate in, thus leading to dissemination of
infection.

Mtb GENES INVOLVED IN HOST CELL
PROGRAMMED NECROSIS INDUCTION
There are several Mtb genes that are involved in
the induction of host cell death (Briken 2013).
Nevertheless, it is still not determined which of
these orother, yet to be discovered, genes are the
mediators of the Mtb necrotic cell death induc-
tion during the ﬁnal stage of the bacterial in-
tracellular replication cycle. An interesting can-
didate for a major role is the heparin-binding
hemaglutinin (HBHA) protein, which is secret-
ed into the host cell cytosol and targeted to the
mitochondria to induce activation of the Bax
protein (Sohn et al. 2011). This leads to the cre-
ation of a mitochondrial membrane channel re-
sulting in the loss of membrane potential (Sohn
et al. 2011). It is noteworthy that inhibition of
mitochondrial membrane damage is one of the
key features of PGE2 to inhibit host cell necrosis
(Chen et al. 2008). Nevertheless, the Mtb HBHA
protein does not seem to induce necrotic cell
death but instead leads to caspase 9–dependent
apoptotic cell death (Sohn et al. 2011).
The ancestral mycobacterial type VII se-
cretion system ESX-4 has been duplicated four
times during the evolution of mycobacterial
species to yield ESX-1 to ESX-5 (Gey van Pittius
et al. 2006; Houben et al. 2013). The EsxA pro-
tein of the ESX-1 system can form homo- and
heterodimers that can insert into the host cell
membrane to induce necrosis (Hsu et al. 2003;
deJongeetal.2007; Smithetal.2008;Welinetal.
2011). In contrast, other reports show that ec-
topic expression of EsxA and/or the incubation
of cells with puriﬁed EsxA induce host cell apo-
ptosis (Derrick and Morris 2007; Choi et al.
2010). There is a clear consensus though in the
literature that Mtb or Mm mutants deﬁcient in
esxA induce less cell death and that these mu-
tants are also severely attenuated in the mouse
and zebraﬁsh model of tuberculosis (Abdallah
et al. 2007; DiGiuseppe Champion and Cox
2007; Ramakrishnan 2012). The interpretation
of results with the esxA mutants in regard to the
bacterial effector mediating the phenotype is
difﬁcult because deletion of esxA not only af-
fects secretion of EsxA but also of all the other
ESX-1 secretion system substrates.
A functional ESX-1 system is also essential
for full activation of the NLRP3-inﬂammasome
after mycobacterial infection (Koo et al. 2008;
Mayer-Barber et al. 2010; McElvania Tekippe et
al. 2010; Mishra et al. 2010; Walter et al. 2010;
Abdalla et al. 2012; Dorhoi et al. 2012). One
report showsthat this activation of NLRP3 leads
to the induction of necroptosis (Wong and
Jacobs 2011). The Mtb Rv3364c protein is an
inhibitor of host cell cathepsin G and this inhi-
bition led to less caspase 1–dependent pyrop-
tosis (Danelishvili et al. 2011). The ESX-5 sys-
tem has also been implicated in the induction
of host cell necrosis and inﬂammasome acti-
vation (Abdallah et al. 2011). According to the
proposed model, the ESX-1 system helps Mtb
to escape the phagosome following which ESX-
5-secreted effector proteins participate in the
induction of programmed necrosisto allow bac-
teria to leave the infected cell (Abdallah et al.
2011). The ESX-5 system is crucial for the se-
cretion of the Mtb PE/PPE family of proteins
(Abdallah et al. 2006, 2009). Interestingly, the
PE_PGRS33 protein is transported to host cell
mitochondria and induces programmed necro-
sis when expressed ectopically in mammalian
cells (Cadieux et al. 2011). It remains to be de-
termined what the function of this protein is in
the context of live Mtb infection.
POTENTIAL FOR THERAPEUTIC AND
PREVENTIVE APPROACHES
The fact that increased host cell apoptosis re-
sulted in improved CD8þ and CD4þ T-cell
priming as discussed above obviously led to ef-
forts to improve the current vaccine, BCG (Ba-
cillus Calmette–Gue´rin), by increasing its apo-
ptosis-inducing potential. The ﬁrst evidence
that this strategy might be successful was pro-
vided by a BCG vaccine modiﬁed to express the
Listeria monocytogenes toxin Listeriolysin O
(LLO). The toxin is not secreted outside the
infected cell but inserts into the phagosomal
membrane to generate pores that allow better
access of BCG proteins to the host cell cytosol,
which should result in improved CD8þ T-cell
priming. This BCG-LLO strain also induces in-
creased host cell apoptosis compared with wild-

type BCG (Grode et al. 2005). Indeed, apoptotic
vesicles derived from macrophages infected
with this vaccine strain led to increased CD8þ
and CD4þ T-cell priming (Farinacci et al. 2012).
Overall the BCG-LLO strain offered better pro-
tection to mice from virulent Mtb challenge
(Grode et al. 2005), and this vaccine is now in
phase IIa human clinical trials (Kaufmann
2013). The secA2 deletion mutant in the back-
ground of an auxotroph Mtb vaccine strain also
increases protection of mice to virulent Mtb
challenge when compared with the original
auxotroph Mtb vaccine strain or to BCG-vacci-
nated animals (Hinchey et al. 2007, 2011).
Immunotherapeutic approaches to treat-
ment of tuberculosis are one additional ap-
proach besides traditional chemotherapy and
vaccine prevention. The hypersusceptibility of
zebraﬁsh with a speciﬁc LTA4H genotype re-
sulting in high TNF levels could be reversed
by using inhibitors of the TNF-induced pro-
grammed necrosis pathway (Tobin et al. 2010;
Roca and Ramakrishnan 2013). Indeed, alispor-
vir is an inhibitor of cyclophilin D that is re-
leased by the mitochondria via the MPT pore
and is currently in phase III human trial to treat
hepatitis C (Quarato et al. 2012). The otherdrug
used in the study is desipramine, which is an
antidepressant that has been given to humans
for half a century. Desipramine inhibits the pro-
duction of ceramides, which, at sufﬁciently high
levels, may induce host cell necroptosis (Roca
and Ramakrishnan 2013). The combination of
both drugs results in synergy in suppressing vir-
ulence of mycobacterial infection in zebraﬁsh
(Roca and Ramakrishnan 2013). Human pa-
tients with a variant of the LTA4H promoter
that resulted in high LXA4 levels could be suc-
cessfully treated with dexamethasone, a TNF-
suppressive drug (Tobin et al. 2012). Hence,
inhibition of host cell necroptosis holds a lot
of promise as one part of a multipronged ap-
proach to tuberculosis treatment (Tobin and
Ramakrishnan 2013).
CONCLUDING REMARKS
The interaction of Mtb with the host in regard to
cell death is complex. Currently, the research is
at a stage that does not allow designing a model
that explains all of the data available. For exam-
ple, more time and effort is needed to elucidate
the ambiguous role of host cell apoptosis in Mtb
pathogenesis. Also, how does Mtb regulate the
induction of host cell necrosis in order to escape
the cell and what are the bacterial effectors in-
volved? Identifying these effectors may provide
excellent novel drug targets because inhibiting
the necrotic property of Mtb during the later
stages of active pulmonary disease should be
able to provide clear therapeutic beneﬁts. It is
now well established that Mtb infection of host
cells involves interaction with the three major
cell death pathways: apoptosis, pyroptosis, and
necroptosis. It is quite likely that we will be able
to gain many insights into these cell death path-
ways by studying a pathogen that has coevolved
with humans for more than 50,000 years
(Hershberg et al. 2008).
