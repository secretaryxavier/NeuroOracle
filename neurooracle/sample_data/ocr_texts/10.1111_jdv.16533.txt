Acral cutaneous lesions in the
time of COVID-19
Dear Editor,
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic
condition, yet little is known about its dermatologic manifesta-
tions.1,2 We report here on peculiar (perniosis-like) skin lesions,
unreported in the previous years, observed in young outpatients
visited in our dermatologic unit in the last 4 weeks of COVID-
19 pandemic (March–April 2020). Similar cases were referred to
us in the same period by paediatricians and dermatologists from
Italy and European countries.
We directly observed 14 cases including 11 children (average
age 14.4 years, range 13–18) and three young adults (average age
29 years, range 23–39). In this series, three couples were siblings
and the ratio female–male was 8 : 6. The cutaneous manifesta-
tions consisted of an acral eruption of erythemato-violaceous
papules and macules, with possible bullous evolution, or digital
swelling (Fig. 1a–c). Lesions were localized on the feet in eight
cases, on the hands in four cases and on both sites in 2. Two
children developed erythemato-papular targetoid lesions on the
hands and elbows after few days (Fig. 1c,d). No systemic symp-
toms were reported, except mild itch in three cases. In three
cases, cough and fever preceded the onset of the lesions 3 weeks
before. Lesions resolved after 2–4 weeks without treatment. No
association with cold exposure, comorbidities or drug intake
was recorded. No familial history of COVID-19-related symp-
toms was elicited.
Routine laboratory ﬁndings were normal, including complete
blood count, C-reactive protein, lactic dehydrogenase and D-
dimer; serology ruled out Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus,
Coxsackie and parvovirus B19 infection. Skin biopsies were per-
formed from lesions on the ﬁngers (n = 2) and from targetoid
lesions on the elbows (n = 2). Histology of the acral lesions
showed a diffuse dense lymphoid inﬁltrate of the superﬁcial and
deep dermis, as well as hypodermis, with a prevalent perivascular
pattern, and signs of endothelial activation (Fig. 2). Histology of
the targetoid lesions of the elbows showed a mild superﬁcial
perivascular dermatitis. Both nasopharyngeal (three patients)
and rectal swabs (two patients) for COVID-19 yielded negative

results. Rectal swabs were performed considering that gastroin-
testinal tract involvement induces a prolonged virus RNA shed-
ding in feces.3,4 Nevertheless, in the hypothesis that these skin
lesions were linked to COVID-19 infection, we checked accu-
rately for acral perniotic signs 107 COVID-19-positive patients
(average age 72.2 years, 58 males, 49 females) hospitalized in
our hospital for acute respiratory illness. We found only two
patients with acrocyanosis due to respiratory failure and one
patient with left foot thrombosis. None showed perniotic
lesions.
We suspect that these cutaneous manifestations could be
COVID-19 related. The temporal relationship with the COVID-
19 pandemia, the rapid outbreak and clustering of unusual skin
lesions, the occurrence of familial cases in a situation of home
restriction and the multiple reporting of similar cases from other
affected areas in parallel with pandemic diffusion strongly sup-
port this hypothesis. Young age, swab negativity and the absence
of other symptoms appear to be common features of these sub-
jects. The swab negativity could be explained with the disappear-
ance of detectable viral presence after a brief asymptomatic
course: according to this hypothesis, the observed skin lesions
would represent late manifestations of the COVID-19 infection
in young healthy subjects, possibly due to an immunologic
response targeting the cutaneous vessels. The absence of similar
signs in acute COVID-19-positive patients of older age would
corroborate this assumption. Thus, children could be facilitators
of viral transmission in the early stage, before skin involvement.5
Only serology, showing antibody response to COVID-19 virus,
could validate this hypothesis, and we are waiting for such an
answer from reliable serological tests.
