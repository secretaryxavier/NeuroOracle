Diverse GABAergic interneuron networks orchestrate information processing in the brain.
Understanding the principles underlying the organisation of this system in the human brain,
and whether these principles are reﬂected by available non-invasive in vivo neuroimaging
methods, is crucial for the study of GABAergic neurotransmission. Here, we use human gene
expression data and state-of-the-art imaging transcriptomics to uncover co-expression pat-
terns between genes encoding GABAA receptor subunits and inhibitory interneuron subtype-
speciﬁc markers, and their association with binding patterns of the gold-standard GABA PET
radiotracers [11C]Ro15-4513 and [11C]ﬂumazenil. We found that the inhibitory interneuron
marker somatostatin covaries with GABAA receptor-subunit genes GABRA5 and GABRA2, and
that their distribution followed [11C]Ro15-4513 binding. In contrast, the inhibitory interneuron
marker parvalbumin covaried with GABAA receptor-subunit genes GABRA1, GABRB2 and
GABRG2, and their distribution tracked [11C]ﬂumazenil binding. Our ﬁndings indicate that
existing PET radiotracers may provide complementary information about key components of
the GABAergic system.

W
hilst accounting for <30% of cortical cells, GABAergic
inhibitory interneurons control information proces-
sing throughout the brain1–4. Their diverse functions
include input gating into cortical5 and subcortical6 structures,
regulating critical period boundaries, homoeostasis7 and local

oscillations1. Due to their critical role in such wide range of brain
functions, inhibitory interneuron dysfunction has been robustly
implicated in several psychiatric and neurological conditions,
including affective disorders6,8,9 and schizophrenia7,10,11.
The GABAergic system comprises diverse inhibitory inter-
neuron subtypes, innervating different excitatory and inhibitory
neural targets through a variety of receptors1. Inhibitory inter-
neurons vary in their ﬁring threshold, spiking frequency and
location of postsynaptic cell innervation, which makes them ﬁt
for various functions including the control of synaptic input into
the local network and neuronal output regulation5,12. This mul-
titude of inhibitory interneurons can be classiﬁed through the
expression of speciﬁc proteins (markers)13. While the vast
majority of inhibitory interneurons are positive for either par-
valbumin (PVALB), somatostatin (SST), or vasoactive intestinal
peptide (VIP), further speciﬁc subtypes can be identiﬁed through
the expression of other markers, such as cholecystokinin (CCK)3.
This array of neurons achieves ﬁne-tuned inhibitory responses via
the ionotropic GABAA receptor (GABAAR), which mediates the
hyperpolarisation of the postsynaptic excitatory or inhibitory
target cell. The GABAAR is a pentameric chloride channel which
most commonly comprises two α, two β and one γ subunit14.
There are ﬁve subtypes of the α subunit and three each of the β
and γ subunits; moreover, β can be replaced by a θ subunit, and γ
can be replaced by δ, ε or π14. This generates a large variety of
receptors, the biology and pharmacology of which are determined
by their subunit composition. For instance, the low-afﬁnity α1
subunit-containing GABAAR (GABAARα1) mediates phasic or
activity-dependent inhibition on the postsynaptic cell, whereas
GABAARα5 presents higher afﬁnity to GABA, maintaining a
more continuous inhibitory tone extrasynaptically15–19. This
intricacy of the GABAergic system poses a challenge to the
investigation of the human GABAergic system in vivo that can be
both selective and non-invasive.
Given this complexity, the investigation of the roles that
GABAergic neurotransmission may play in human brain function
in health and disease requires: (1) knowledge of the basic prin-
ciples underlying the organization of this intricate system; and (2)
the ability to distinguish between the contribution of distinct
components of the GABAergic system to in vivo measurements of
GABAergic neurotransmission. In this context, positron emission
tomography (PET) enables quantiﬁcation of GABAAR binding
in vivo in anatomically deﬁned brain regions. This is achieved
through the use of radiolabelled tracers (radiotracers), mainly
[11C]Ro15-4513, with high afﬁnity to GABAARα5, and [11C]ﬂu-
mazenil, a benzodiazepine site-speciﬁc radiotracer with more
general afﬁnity to GABAARα1-3 and α520,21. Although receptor
afﬁnity for these radiotracers has been conﬁrmed in preclinical
research22, it is unknown whether this holds inter-species relia-
bility and whether the distribution of distinct cellular and mole-
cular components of the GABAergic system are reﬂected in
radiotracer binding. Answering these questions would advance
our
understanding
of
which
inhibitory
interneurons
and
GABAAR sub-types may contribute the most to available
neuroimaging-based GABA PET measurements. Interestingly,
both the distribution of inhibitory interneurons and GABA PET
radiotracer binding are heterogeneous across the human brain.
For
instance,
SST
and
PVALB
follow
an
anticorrelated
distribution11, as do the binding patterns of [11C]Ro15-4513 and
[11C]ﬂumazenil23. Moreover, there is abundant rodent evidence
of an association between the expression of speciﬁc GABAAR
subunits, encoded by individual genes in both presynaptic and
target neurons (excitatory or inhibitory), and speciﬁc inhibitory
interneuron subtypes19,24–26. However, whether analogous orga-
nisation patterns are present in human is unclear. Brain-wide
gene expression atlases such as the Allen Human Brain Atlas
(AHBA) are increasingly being used to address these questions27.
The approach involves testing for covariance between the spatial
expression pattern of each gene in the AHBA and the spatial
topography of neuroimaging measures. This results in the iden-
tiﬁcation of speciﬁc cellular and molecular candidates which
might contribute the most to the spatial variability in the neu-
roimaging signal. Hence, using this approach for GABA PET
radiotracers will inform how GABAergic system organisation in
the human brain may be captured by these existing neuroimaging
measures.
Here, we sought to address this issue by using state-of-the-art
imaging transcriptomics to (1) uncover patterns of co-expression
between genes encoding GABAAR subunits and inhibitory
interneuron markers in the human brain, and to (2) decode their
links to the binding distribution patterns of two gold-standard
GABA PET radiotracers, [11C]Ro15-4513 and [11C]ﬂumazenil28.
We found that distinct GABAergic inhibitory interneuron marker
genes co-expressed with speciﬁc GABAAR subunit-encoding
genes. Furthermore, we observed that a substantial portion of
the variation in [11C]Ro15-4513 and [11C]ﬂumazenil binding
covaried with the expression of genes encoding speciﬁc compo-
nents of the GABAergic system. Our ﬁndings provide a frame-
work to bridge the gap between genes, cells and macroscopic
molecular neuroimaging features of the GABAergic system that
may be of help for future in vivo studies in health and disease.
Results
GABAergic inhibitory interneuron markers co-express with
speciﬁc GABAAR subunit-encoding genes. Our ﬁrst aim was to
uncover patterns of co-expression between genes encoding
GABAAR subunits and inhibitory interneuron markers. The latter
comprised: the GABA-synthesising enzymes GAD67 (GAD1)
and GAD65 (GAD2)29, parvalbumin (PVALB)25, somatostatin
(SST)30, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)31, cholecystokinin
(CCK), neuropeptide Y (NPY)32, calbindin (CALB1)30, calretinin
(CALB2)30, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1)3, reelin
(RELN)33, and the tachykinin precursor genes TAC1, TAC3 and
TAC434, selected according to preclinical literature and Petilla
classiﬁcation of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons13. Data on all
available GABAAR subunit genes passing quality threshold were
included: α1-5 (GABRA1-5), β1-3 (GABRB1-3), γ1-3 (GABRG1-
3), ε (GABRE) and δ (GABRD). Genes encoding subunits α6
(GABRA6), π (GABRP), θ (GABRQ) and ρ1-3 (GABRR1-3) were
not used in further analyses as they did not show levels of
expression above background. We performed weighted gene co-
expression network analysis (WGCNA)35 on gene expression
data from the AHBA36. This dataset contained microarray data
on 15,633 genes from six post-mortem samples across the left
(n = 6 healthy donors) and right hemispheres (n = 2 healthy
donors), which were resampled into 83 brain regions of the
Desikan–Killiany atlas37. WGCNA is a data-driven approach that
allows to identify clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes
across the whole transcriptome35.
WGCNA identiﬁed 52 co-expression clusters, 13 of which
included genes encoding inhibitory interneuron markers and
GABAAR subunits of interest. We selected these 13 clusters to
investigate which genes shared cluster allocation (Fig. 1a). SST
was located in the same cluster as GABRA5, GABRA2 and
GABRB1. PVALB had its own cluster (i.e., it was not located in

the same cluster as any other gene of interest). VIP was found in
the same cluster as CCK and no other genes of interest. As those
three individual clusters included three of the main non-
overlapping inhibitory interneuron markers, labelling the major-
ity of GABAergic inhibitory cells in the mammalian brain2, we
investigated their enrichment in genes co-expressed in speciﬁc
cell types deﬁned by previous single-cell transcriptomic analysis38
using the WEB-based GEne SeT AnaLysis Toolkit39. These
analyses revealed inhibitory interneuron cell-type enrichment in
the SST and PVALB clusters, and excitatory cell-type enrichment
in the VIP cluster (Supplementary Fig. 1). This indicated that
the
subsequent
analyses
including
the
SST
and
PVALB
clusters
were
relevant
for
networks
involving
GABAergic
inhibitory interneuron cell-types. Other separate clusters of genes
included GAD1, GABRA1, GABRB2, GABRG2 and GABRG3;
CALB1, CALB2, GABRG1 and GABRE; GABRA4, NPY and TAC3;
and GAD2 and NOS1. Finally, GABRB1, GABRB3, GABRA3,
RELN, TAC1, GABRD and TAC4 were all found individually in
separate clusters that did not share assignment with any other
gene of interest.
The WGCNA cluster-based ﬁndings were complemented by a
pairwise correlation analysis. This served both as a validation
step and as a method to investigate co-expression patterns
between genes of interest that might not pertain to a discrete
WGCNA cluster. Hence, we performed bivariate correlation
analysis of the genes of interest with the corrplot package in R
4.0.3 (Fig. 1b). This revealed strong correlations (Pearson’s r > 0.5,
p < 0.05) between SST and GABRA5, GABRA2 and GABRB1
(Fig. 1c–e); between VIP and CCK (Fig. 1f); between GABRA1
and GABRB2, GABRG2 and GABRG3 (Fig. 1h–j); and between
PVALB and genes encoding the subunits of the main GABAergic
receptor in the brain, GABAARα1β2γ2 (GABRA1, GABRB2 and
GABRG2)19 (Fig. 1k–m).
[11C]Ro15-4513 and [11C]ﬂumazenil PET binding track the
expression of speciﬁc genes encoding GABAergic inhibitory
interneuron markers and GABAAR subunits. Our second aim
was to decode the links between the co-expression patterns of
genes encoding GABAAR subunits and inhibitory interneuron
markers (identiﬁed through the ﬁrst aim) and the binding patterns
of two gold-standard GABA PET radiotracers, [11C]Ro15-4513
and [11C]ﬂumazenil. For this purpose, we integrated the gene
expression data with maps of [11C]Ro15-4513 binding (n = 10
healthy volunteers) and [11C]ﬂumazenil binding (n = 16 healthy
volunteers) through a covariance analysis. We used partial least
square (PLS) regression, accounting for spatial autocorrelation.
For each radiotracer, we performed two complementary analyses.
First, we used as predictors the eigengenes of each of the clusters
we identiﬁed in the WGCNA analysis. Eigengenes in this context
refer to the ﬁrst principal component of a given cluster, thus
representing the pattern of regional expression of all genes within
that cluster. Second, we used as predictors all 15,633 genes that
passed our pre-processing criteria and inspected the rank of each
of our genes of interest in the ranked list of genes according to
their spatial alignment with the radiotracer. This would provide a
sense of how speciﬁc the correlation of each of our genes of
interest might be as compared to other non-hypothesized genes
and the cluster-wise analysis.
[11C]Ro15-4513 binding is associated with SST, GABRA5,
GABRA2 and GABRB1 expression. For [11C]Ro15-4513, the ﬁrst
PLS component (PLS1) of the cluster-wise analysis explained
alone the largest amount (58.28%, pspatial < 0.0001) of variance in
radiotracer binding (Supplementary Fig. 4a). We focused our
subsequent analyses on this ﬁrst component, as it explained the
most of variance. The cluster containing GABRA5, GABRA2, SST
and GABRB1 was assigned the highest positive PLS1 weight
(Z = 6.18, FDR = 1.67 × 10−8). In the gene-wise PLS analysis,
the ﬁrst PLS component explained alone the largest amount of
variance (57.78%, pspatial < 0.0001) (Supplementary Fig. 4b).
GABRA5, GABRB3, GABRA2, NPY, VIP, SST, GABRB1, TAC3,
CCK,
GABRA3,
RELN
and
TAC1
(Z = 4.38–2.28,
pFDR =
0.000273-0.0366) were all assigned signiﬁcant positive weights in
descending order (Table 1). Interestingly, PVALB expression had
a signiﬁcant negative PLS1 weight (Z = −2.46, pFDR = 0.0255),
which suggested a negative relationship between PVALB expres-
sion and [11C]Ro15-4513 binding. For full PLS results, see Sup-
plementary Data 1 and 2.
The radiotracer binding and the distribution of weights
resulting from both PLS analyses (cluster-wise and gene-wise)
followed and antero-posterior distribution gradient in the brain
(Fig. 2), consistent with the analogous gradient of SST expression
shown previously11. We then followed up these results with a cell-
type enrichment analysis, accounting for the weights associated
with each gene included in the analysis. This analysis revealed
enrichment in genes expressed in SST, CCK and VIP/CCK
inhibitory interneurons (Supplementary Fig. 2). The result
supported an association between the distribution of these cell
types with [11C]Ro15-4513 binding.
[11C]ﬂumazenil binding is associated with PVALB, GABRA1,
GABRB2, GABRG2, GABRG3 and GAD1 expression. For [11C]
ﬂumazenil, the ﬁrst PLS component (PLS1) of the cluster-wise
analysis explained alone the largest amount of variance
(36.49%, pspatial = 0.001) in radiotracer binding (Supplementary
Fig. 4c). The cluster containing GABRB2, GABRG3, GABRA1,
GABRG2 and GAD1 was assigned the highest positive PLS1
weight (Z = 7.48, pFDR = 1.87 × 10−12). In the gene-wise PLS
analysis, the ﬁrst PLS component explained alone the largest
amount of variance (37.13%, pspatial = 0.005) (Supplementary
Fig. 4d). GABRB2, GABRD, GABRG3, GABRA1, GABRG2,
GABRA4,
GAD1,
VIP,
CCK
and
PVALB
(Z = 6.91–2.26,
pFDR = 1.45 × 10−9-0.0315) were all assigned signiﬁcant posi-
tive weights in descending order (Table 2). For full PLS results,
see Supplementary Data 3 and 4
Radiotracer binding, as well as the distribution of weights
resulting from both PLS analyses, followed a postero–anterior
distribution gradient (Fig. 3), consistent with analogous pattern
of PVALB expression shown previously11. Following up these
results with a cell-type enrichment analysis, accounting for
weights associated with each gene input into the analysis,
revealed enrichment in genes expressed in PVALB, CCK, VIP/
CCK and SST inhibitory interneurons (Supplementary Fig. 3).
The result supported an association between the distribution of
PVALB, CCK and VIP/CCK cell-types with [11C]ﬂumazenil
binding, and suggested an association between genes enriched in
the SST cell-type and radiotracer signal despite no direct
covariance with SST expression found in the PLS analysis.
Interestingly, [11C]ﬂumazenil binding was negatively associated
with astrocyte-enriched genes.
Discussion
Our main ﬁnding was that the spatial pattern of expression of
speciﬁc inhibitory interneuron marker genes covaried with that of
different GABAAR subunit genes and that these co-expression
patterns explained a substantial portion of the variation in GABA
PET radiotracer binding, a measure of in vivo neurotransmission.
Speciﬁcally, while [11C]Ro15-4513 binding followed an anterior
distribution that tracked the expression of GABRA5 and SST,
[11C]ﬂumazenil followed a more posterior distribution which

covaried with the expression of GABRA1 and PVALB. Previous
PET studies described that [11C]Ro15-4513 and [11C]ﬂumazenil
binding were anticorrelated along an anterior-posterior axis23,
convergent with recent ﬁndings of a largely developmentally
preserved gradient of SST to PVALB distribution in the human
brain11. Our investigation suggests that these ﬁndings may not be
coincidental and that these two GABA PET radiotracers could
provide complementary information about the architecture of the
inhibitory
system.
These
ﬁndings
may
have
important
implications for the study of GABAergic dysfunction in neu-
ropsychiatric conditions, as discussed below.
Preclinical studies have shown that GABAARα5 are enriched
on principal cell membranes targeted by SST cells5,26,40. Con-
sistent with these ﬁndings, we observed that the spatial pattern of
[11C]Ro15-4513 binding covaried most strongly with gene
expression from a cluster containing GABRA5, GABRA2 and SST.
In previous research, [11C]Ro15-4513 was shown to present
10–15-fold higher afﬁnity to human cloned GABAARα5 than to

GABAARα1-323, and the co-expression of GABRA2 and GABRA5
was shown by immunohistochemistry in the rat brain16, also in
line with our observations. Interestingly, we also found covariance
between the expression of CCK and GABRA3 and the distribution
of [11C]Ro15-4513 signal. GABAARα2/3 expression in rodents
has been most consistently found in the post-synapse of principal
cells targeted by CCK basket cells3,19,24,41. It is plausible that the
association we found between [11C]Ro15-4513 binding and CCK,
GABRA2 and GABRA3 expression is circumstantial, if enough
spatial overlap between the expression of these genes with SST
and GABRA5 exists. Both GABRA241 and GABRA342 are highly
expressed in the hippocampus, where α5 is most enriched14.
Moreover, GABRA2 and GABRA5 follow a similar expression
pattern in several brain regions42. Alternatively, the ﬁnding might
reﬂect secondary afﬁnity of the radiotracer to GABAARα2/3.
While [11C]Ro15-4513 has 10-15-times greater afﬁnity towards
GABAARα5 than to GABAARα1-323, it is possible that in regions
where GABAARα5 is lower, this radiotracer binds secondarily to
GABAARα2/3. This might deserve further investigation, especially
as GABAARα5 constitute <5% of all GABAARs in the brain41 and
PET radiotracers are administered systemically with an intrave-
nous injection, which allows for secondary binding to occur.
However, our approach relied on the interrogation of indirect
spatial associations between PET radiotracer binding and gene

about speciﬁc synaptic contributions to our ﬁndings warrant
future validation with precise molecular methods such as
immunocytochemistry or autoradiography with pharmacological
blocking.
Patterns

of

subunits may help elucidate whether [11C]Ro15-4513 binds to
GABAARα2/3 in addition to GABAARα5. For instance, future
studies may assess interlaminar differences in [11C]Ro15-4513
binding, as α2/3 and α5 present different expression patterns
across human prefrontal cortex layers43. In addition, future
research could investigate the proportion of synaptic to extra-
synaptic binding of [11C]Ro15-4513 in human neurons, as
GABAARα5 are predominantly extrasynaptic17.
The spatial pattern of [11C]ﬂumazenil binding covaried most
strongly with the gene expression cluster containing GAD1,
GABRA1, GABRB2, GABRG2 and GABRG3. There is prior evi-
dence that [18F]ﬂumazenil accumulation across the mouse brain
after mutations in α2, α3 and α5 subunits, but not in α1,
remained similar to that in wild-type mice44. This may suggest
that [11C]ﬂumazenil binding to GABAARα1 accounts for most of
the PET signal. Our ﬁnding aligns with the notion that the
abundance of GABAARα1 may be reﬂected in the pattern of
ﬂumazenil binding14,23. Indeed, GABAARα1β2γ2 is the most

GABRA1, GABRB2 and GABRG2 are supported by analogous
observation in preclinical immunohistochemistry studies45,46.
Interestingly, we found that [11C]ﬂumazenil signal was also
associated with PVALB expression, consistent with our obser-
vation of a high association between PVALB expression with
GABRA1, GABRB2 and GABRG2, and with preclinical evidence
that post-synaptic membranes of principal cells and PVALB
inhibitory interneurons targeted by this interneuron subtype are
enriched in GABAARα119,24–26,41. Covariance of GABRA4 and
GABRD expression with [11C]ﬂumazenil binding is consistent
with the ﬁnding that those subunits are commonly co-expressed
in the forebrain, and that the δ subunit associates extra-
synaptically with α1, primarily in the cerebellum where [11C]
ﬂumazenil uptake is higher than that of [11C]Ro15-451323,
but also in the cerebrum47,48. As mentioned above, further
study using more precise molecular methodology is required to
validate these ﬁndings.
Interestingly, our cell-type enrichment analysis of radiotracer
signal covariance with gene expression showed [11C]ﬂumazenil to
be negatively associated with astrocyte-enriched genes, whereas
[11C]Ro15-4513 binding did not show such association (Supple-
mentary Figs. 2 and 3). Astrocytes express GABAARs49, and those
containing α1, α2, β1 and γ1 were shown to be expressed on rat
astrocytes50. This suggests some GABA PET radiotracer binding
may occur on this cell type. We found [11C]Ro15-4513 and [11C]
ﬂumazenil binding to be associated with the expression of genes
encoding some of these subunits. We also observed a trend-level
enrichment of the astrocyte cell-type in the cluster containing
SST, which covaried most strongly with [11C]Ro15-4513 signal.
Astrocyte distribution is higher in the frontal and temporal
cortex51, where [11C]Ro15-4513 binding is also greater. However,
the spatial associations we set out to identify through our
approach relied on the levels of radiotracer binding and gene
expression. The degree of GABAAR expression52, as well as
Gabra1 and Gabra553, was shown in rodents to be lower in
astrocytes than in neurons. Moreover, the human brain comprises
approximately equal numbers of glial and neural cells, and
astrocytes represent around 20% of glial cells54. This suggests
neural GABAAR expression exceeds that of astrocytes. This may
explain the negative covariance between [11C]ﬂumazenil signal
and astrocyte-enriched genes, as [11C]ﬂumazenil binding is
greatest in posterior brain areas, where astrocyte distribution is
lower51. Correspondingly, it is plausible that the contribution of
radiotracer binding to GABAARs on astrocytes might be insufﬁ-
cient to considerably drive spatial variation in [11C]Ro15-4513
binding across the brain.
Our study may have important implications for future research
into the role of GABAergic dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disease
using PET imaging. A substantial portion of the variation in [11C]
Ro15-4513
and
[11C]ﬂumazenil
binding
covaried
with
the
expression of genes encoding distinct cellular and molecular
components of the GABAergic system. These ﬁndings support the
use of these existing GABA PET radiotracers to capture separate,
albeit complementary, features of GABAergic dysfunction in
those disorders. For instance, altered GABAergic function is
hypothesised to contribute to the pathophysiology of affective
disorders8. GABAARα2 and GABAARα3 agonism is implicated in
benzodiazepine-mediated
anxiolysis14,19,
whereas
GABAARα1
agonism is associated with the undesired sedative effects of
benzodiazepines14,19. Furthermore, SST inhibitory interneuron
dysfunction has been implicated in the aetiology of depressive
disorders41,55, and α5 subunit increases have been found post-
mortem in patients with depression9. Interestingly, SST cell disin-
hibition produced an anxiolytic- and antidepressant-like effect akin
to that of benzodiazepines or ketamine in preclinical models56. Our
ﬁnding that SST, GABRA2 and GABRA3 co-expression was linked
to [11C]Ro15-4513, but not to [11C]ﬂumazenil binding, suggests
that [11C]Ro15-4513 may be useful to investigate GABAergic
system components implicated in anxiogenesis and depressive
symptomatology.
Furthermore, our ﬁndings may have important implications
for the study of disorders where multiple GABAergic system
abnormalities might occur, such as schizophrenia. PVALB inhi-
bitory interneuron loss was reported in hippocampi of patients
with schizophrenia by post-mortem examination57. We found
that
[11C]ﬂumazenil
binding
was
associated
with
PVALB
expression. Two separate [11C]ﬂumazenil PET studies in schi-
zophrenia reported inconsistent effects across multiple cortical
regions for patients with different medication status, while one of
these two studies did ﬁnd binding alterations in subcortical
regions including the hippocampus58,59. SST inhibitory inter-
neuron cell reductions have also been reported in the hippo-
campus and cortical regions of schizophrenia patients57,60.
We found that [11C]Ro15-4513 signal covaried with SST
expression. A recent [11C]Ro15-4513 study in schizophrenia
reported
binding
decreases
in
antipsychotic
medication-
free patients compared to healthy controls, limited to the
hippocampus61. Analogous deﬁcits were not identiﬁed in another
sample including currently or previously medicated patients61,62,
which may be consistent with preclinical observations that anti-
psychotic treatment may affect hippocampal [11C]Ro15-4513
binding63. Taken together, these ﬁndings may suggest that SST
interneuron dysfunction in the hippocampus and PVALB inter-
neuron abnormalities in cortical and subcortical regions may play
a role in the onset of psychosis. Future GABA PET studies in
early psychosis may address this hypothesis by examining PVALB
interneuron-mediated inhibition with [11C]ﬂumazenil and SST
interneuron-associated inhibition with [11C]Ro15-4513, while
carefully considering the effects of antipsychotic medication.
Our study had some limitations. First, we relied on indirect
spatial associations between gene expression and radiotracer bind-
ing, which alone does not directly imply co-expression in the same
cell or in interconnected neurons, nor direct radiotracer binding.
The limited resolution of both methods also did not allow us to
discern between speciﬁc cell-types or synaptic microcircuits. How-
ever, we note that our ﬁndings are broadly supported by the pre-
clinical literature using more ﬁne-grained methods, which lends
support to the plausibility of our imaging transcriptomics ﬁndings
in humans. We cannot exclude that the use of two different pipe-
lines for the quantiﬁcation of [11C]ﬂumazenil and [11C]Ro15-4513
might have had an impact on our results. However, the spatial
distribution of radiotracer binding to their target, of importance for
this study, has been shown with pharmacological blocking studies
to be preserved regardless of which particular quantiﬁcation
method is used64. This spatial distribution of signal is also expected
to be preserved regardless of the normalisation method originally
applied to the [11C]ﬂumazenil map, due to the non-selective nature
of binding to benzodiazepine-sensitive receptors of both [11C]ﬂu-
mazenil and diazepam64. Second, the relationship between mRNA
and their product proteins can be affected by post-translational
modiﬁcations—in those cases, one cannot assume that the density
of mRNA is a good proxy for the distribution of the protein65. Our
study did not aim to determine the molecular binding of the two
radiotracers, but rather their global pattern of covariance with genes
encoding speciﬁc GABAergic signalling components. Thus, our
ﬁndings are correlational by nature and must be interpreted with
caution. Third, the AHBA includes data from six donors only.
Samples from the right hemisphere were only collected for two
donors, which led us to restrict our analyses to the left hemisphere.
Although not a speciﬁc limitation of this study, this raises questions
about whether this small sample can capture well the principles of
organisation of the canonical architecture of gene expression in the

human brain and generalise well. However, it is noteworthy that
previous studies found differences in gene expression between the
two hemispheres to be mostly negligible66. Finally, because we
applied an intensity threshold to the microarray dataset to minimise
inclusion of unreliable measures of gene expression, we were not
able to investigate some genes of interest, including GABRA6,
GABRP, GABRQ and GABRR1-3, due to the low intensity of signal
for these genes in the AHBA dataset as compared to background.
Future studies using high sensitivity methods to measure expression
of these genes across the whole brain will help to complement our
ﬁndings in this respect.
In summary, we provide evidence of the regional association
between the expression of: (1) SST, GABRA5 and GABRA2; (2)
PVALB and GABRA1, GABRB2 and GABRG2; and (3) VIP and
CCK in the human brain. These ﬁndings expand our understanding
of the canonical transcriptomic architecture of speciﬁc GABAergic
system components in the human brain. Furthermore, we provide
ﬁrst evidence that the expression of distinct inhibitory interneuron
sub-types and speciﬁc GABAAR subunits covary with [11C]Ro15-
4513 and [11C]ﬂumazenil binding in a largely non-overlapping
manner. While [11C]Ro15-4513 signal covaried with the expression
of SST and genes encoding several major benzodiazepine-sensitive
GABAAR subunits implicated in affective functioning (GABRA5,
GABRA2 and GABRA3), [11C]ﬂumazenil tracked PVALB and genes
encoding subunits comprising the most widely expressed receptor
(GABRA1, GABRB2 and GABRG2). These ﬁndings may have
important implications for existing and future PET studies of GABA
dysfunction in neuropsychiatric disease. Once corroborated by more
direct molecular methods, our work has the potential to inform
methodological choices for imaging the GABAergic system, and to
help the interpretation of ﬁndings within a framework that bridges
the gap between genes, cells and macroscopic in vivo molecular
neuroimaging features.
Methods
The Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) dataset. The AHBA dataset includes
microarray data of gene expression in post-mortem brain samples from six healthy
donors (one female, mean age ± SD 42.5 ± 13.38, range 24–57)36. Detailed informa-
tion about donor characteristics and dataset generation can be found in the Allen
Human Brain Atlas website (https://human.brain-map.org/). In short, the brain
(cerebrum including the brainstem) was sampled systematically across the left
hemisphere in all six donors, and the right hemisphere in two of the donors. Manual
macrodissection was performed on the cerebral and cerebellar cortex, as well as
subcortical nuclei, in 50–200 mg increments. Subcortical areas and cerebellar nuclei
were sampled with laser microdissection in 36 mm2 increments. RNA was then
isolated from these dissections and gene expression was quantiﬁed with microarray.
Gene expression data: pre-processing and spatial mapping. The approach was
similar to that used in previous literature67,68. Human gene expression microarray
data were extracted from the AHBA with the abagen toolbox (https://github.com/
netneurolab/abagen)69 in JupyterLab Notebook through anaconda3 in Python
3.8.5. We mapped AHBA samples to the parcels of the Desikan–Killiany atlas,
including 83 brain regions across both brain hemispheres (34 cortical and seven
subcortical regions per brain hemisphere, plus brainstem). Genetic probes were
reannotated using information provided by Arnatkeviciute et al., 201970 instead of
the default probe information from the AHBA dataset to exclude probes that
cannot be reliably matched to genes. According to the existing guidelines for probe-
to-gene mappings and intensity-based ﬁltering70, the reannotated probes were
ﬁltered based on their intensity relative to background noise level; probes with
intensity less than background in ≥50% of samples were discarded. A single probe
with the highest differential stability, ΔS(p), was selected for each gene, where
differential stability was calculated as71 (Eq. 1):

where ρ is Spearman’s rank correlation of the expression of a single probe p across
regions in two donor brains, Bi and Bj, and N is the total number of donor brains.
This procedure retained 15,633 probes, each representing a unique gene.
Next, tissue samples were assigned to brain regions using their corrected MNI
coordinates (https://github.com/chrisﬁlo/alleninf) by ﬁnding the nearest region
within a radius of 2 mm. To reduce the potential for misassignment, sample-to-
region matching was constrained by hemisphere and cortical/subcortical divisions.
If a brain region was not assigned to any sample based on the above procedure, the
sample closest to the centroid of that region was selected in order to ensure that all
brain regions were assigned a value. Samples assigned to the same brain region
were averaged separately for each donor. Gene expression values were then
normalized separately for each donor across regions using a robust sigmoid
function and rescaled to the unit interval. Scaled expression proﬁles were ﬁnally
averaged across donors, resulting in a single matrix with rows corresponding to
brain regions and columns corresponding to the retained 15,633 genes.
The genes of interest list included data on all available GABAAR subunits and
inhibitory interneuron markers deﬁned according to the Petilla terminology13 and
the existing animal literature. These were: the GABA-synthesising enzymes GAD67
(GAD1) and GAD65 (GAD2)29, parvalbumin (PVALB)25, somatostatin (SST)30,
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)31, cholecystokinin (CCK), neuropeptide Y
(NPY)32, calbindin (CALB1)30, calretinin (CALB2)30, neuronal nitric oxide
synthase (NOS1)3, reelin (RELN)33, and the tachykinin precursor genes TAC1,
TAC3 and TAC434. The genes of interest that did not pass this intensity-based
thresholding were GABRA6, GABRP, GABRQ and GABRR1-3.
Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Hierarchical clus-
tering of genes by their expression across brain regions was performed with the
WGCNA package35 in R 4.0.3 for the gene expression dataset. The ‘signed’
WGCNA method was chosen to form clusters (modules) enriched in genes which
expression was positively correlated, indicating co-expression35. As we aimed to
identify the main features of GABAergic system organisation across the human
brain, the analysis included the whole-brain microarray dataset. Gene expression
correlation matrix was transformed into an adjacency matrix using the soft
threshold power of 14. This adjacency matrix contained pairwise correlations
between all genes in the dataset, uncorrected for multiple comparisons. The power
value was chosen as it was the ﬁrst value at which the network satisﬁed the free-
scale topology criterion at R2 > 0.8, therefore maximising mean network node
connectivity (Supplementary Fig. 5). The adjacency matrix was then transformed
into a dissimilarity measure matrix, representing both the expression correlation
between pairs of genes as well as the number of the genes they both highly cor-
related with positively35. Finally, average-linkage hierarchical clustering using the
dissimilarity measure was performed. Individual modules were identiﬁed through
the classic ‘tree’ dendrogram branch cut72.
Parametric map of [11C]Ro15-4513 binding. Ten healthy participants (four
females, mean age ± SD 25.40 ± 3.20, range 22–30) with no history of psychiatric
diagnoses, neurological illness or head trauma with loss of consciousness were
scanned with the radiotracer [11C]Ro15-4513. Scanning was performed on a Sig-
naTM PET-MR General Electric (3 T) scanner using the MP26 software (01 and 02)
at Invicro, A Konica Minolta Company, Imperial College London, UK. The study
was approved by the London/Surrey Research Ethics Committee. All subjects
provided written informed consent before participation, in accordance with The
Declaration of Helsinki. The radiotracer was administered through the dominant
antecubital fossa vein in a single bolus injection, administered at the beginning of
the scanning session. The mean ± SD amount of radiation administered was
307 MBq ± 71 (range: 173–405 MBq). PET acquisition was performed in 3D list
mode for 70 min and binned in the following frames: 15sx10, 60sx3, 120sx5,
300sx11. Attenuation correction was performed with a ZTE sequence (voxel size:
2.4 × 2.4 × 2.4 mm3, ﬁeld of view = 26.4, 116 slices, TR = 400 ms, TE = 0.016 ms,
ﬂip angle = 0.8o). A T1-weighted IR-FSPGR sequence was used for PET image co-
registration (voxel size: 1 × 1 × 1 mm3, ﬁeld of view = 25.6, 200 slices, TR = 6.992
ms, TE = 2.996 ms, TI = 400 ms, ﬂip angle = 11o).
Individual subject images were generated with MIAKAT v3413 in Matlab
R2017a. For each subject, an isotropic, skull-stripped IR-FSPGR structural image
normalised to the MNI template was co-registered onto an isotropic, motion-
corrected integral image created from the PET time series. Binding potential
parametric maps were estimated through a simpliﬁed reference tissue model using
the pons as the reference region and solved with basis function method73. The
individual parametric maps were averaged using SPM imCalc function and resliced
with the Co-register: Reslice function to match the dimensions of the
Desikan–Killiany atlas (voxel size 1 × 1 × 1 mm, number of voxels per direction
X = 146, Y = 182, Z = 155). Finally, the averaged parametric map of [11C]Ro15-
4513 binding was resampled into 83 regions of the Desikan–Killiany atlas space
using the fslmeants function from FSL.
Parametric map of [11C]ﬂumazenil binding. An averaged parametric map of
maximal binding of the [11C]ﬂumazenil ([11C]Ro15-1788) radiotracer was down-
loaded from an open-access dataset made available by the Neurobiology Research
Unit at Copenhagen University Hospital (https://xtra.nru.dk/BZR-atlas/). In brief,
16 healthy participants between 16–46 years old (nine females, mean age ± SD
26.6 ± 8) were scanned on a CTI/Siemens High-Resolution Research Tomograph.
Distribution volume parametric maps were obtained from blood-based Logan
graphical analysis and then normalised to post-mortem human brain [3H]diazepam
autoradiography data for absolute quantiﬁcation of benzodiazepine-sensitive

Statistics and reproducibility. WGCNA uses individual pairwise correlations for the
creation of a co-expression network and gene clustering. We used both the WGCNA
gene clusters and the complete gene expression dataset for our covariance analyses. To
illustrate how individual pairwise correlations between our genes of interest may be
represented in the respective covariance analyses, we performed and visualised a
bivariate correlation analysis in R 4.0.3 using the Hmisc and corrplot packages. All
available genes of interest were input into a bivariate correlation analysis. The p-value
threshold was set to p < 0.05. No correction for multiple comparisons was applied as
this was used for illustrative purposes.
Partial least squares regression (PLS) analysis was used to identify genes whose
expression was most strongly associated with either [11C]Ro15-4513 or [11C]ﬂumazenil
binding. The script used for this analysis is available elsewhere75 and was run using
Matlab R2017a. The approach was similar to that used in previous literature67,68. The
predictor variable matrix comprised gene expression per brain region in the left
hemisphere only since the AHBA only includes data from the right hemisphere for two
out of the six donors. The response variable matrices comprised [11C]Ro15-4513 and
[11C]ﬂumazenil binding, respectively, in the 42 brain regions of the left hemisphere. The
analysis was then repeated using the 52 WGCNA module eigengenes as the predictor
variables. Prior to each PLS analysis, both predictor and response matrices were Z-
scored.
The ﬁrst PLS component (PLS1) is the linear combination of the weighted gene
expression scores that have a brain expression map that covaries the most with the map
of radiotracer binding. As the components are calculated to explain the maximum
covariance between the dependent and independent variables, the ﬁrst component does
not necessarily need to explain the maximum variance in the dependent variable.
However, as the number of components calculated increases, they progressively tend to
explain less variance in the dependent variable. Here, we tested across a range of
components (between 1 and 15) and quantiﬁed the relative variance explained by each
component (Supplementary Fig. 4). The statistical signiﬁcance of the variance explained
by each component was tested by permuting the response variables 1000 times, while
accounting for spatial autocorrelation using a combination of spin rotations for the
cortical parcels and random shufﬂing for the subcortical ones. We decided to focus on
the component explaining the largest amount of variance, which in our case was always
the ﬁrst component (PLS1). The error in estimating each gene’s PLS1 weight was
assessed by bootstrapping, and the ratio of the weight of each gene to its bootstrap
standard error was used to calculate the Z-scores and, hence, rank the genes according
to their contribution to PLS1. The code used to implement these analyses can be found
in https://github.com/SarahMorgan/Morphometric_Similarity_SZ. Result visualisation
was performed with ENIGMA toolbox 1.1.1 (https://enigma-toolbox.readthedocs.io/) in
Matlab R2018b.
