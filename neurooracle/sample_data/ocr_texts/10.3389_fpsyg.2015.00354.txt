At 18 months, children show marked variability in their social-cognitive skill development,
and the preponderance of past research has focused on constitutional and contextual
factors in explaining this variability. Extending this literature, the current study examined
whether cumulative biomedical risk represents another source of variability in social
cognition at 18 months. Further, we aimed to determine whether responsive parenting
moderated the association between biomedical risk and social cognition. A prospective
community birth cohort of 501 families was recruited at the time of the child’s
birth. Cumulative biomedical risk was measured as a count of 10 prenatal/birth
complications. Families were followed up at 18 months, at which point social-
cognitive data was collected on children’s joint attention, empathy, cooperation, and
self-recognition using previously validated tasks. Concurrently, responsive maternal
behavior was assessed through observational coding of mother–child interactions. After
controlling for covariates (e.g., age, gender, child language, socioeconomic variables),
both cumulative biomedical risk and maternal responsivity signiﬁcantly predicted social
cognition at 18 months. Above and beyond these main effects, there was also a
signiﬁcant interaction between biomedical risk and maternal responsivity, such that
higher biomedical risk was signiﬁcantly associated with compromised social cognition
at 18 months, but only in children who experienced low levels of responsive parenting.
For those receiving comparatively high levels of responsive parenting, there was no
apparent effect of biomedical risk on social cognition. This study shows that cumulative
biomedical risk may be one source of inter-individual variability in social cognition
at 18 months. However, positive postnatal experiences, particularly high levels of
responsive parenting, may protect children against the deleterious effects of these risks
on social cognition.

Biomedical risk, parenting, and social cognition
is a fundamental component of social cognition. While social
cognition is broadly deﬁned and includes a number of cognitive
processes, it is generally well accepted that by the second year
of life children evince many basic social-cognitive competencies,
including an understanding of others’ goals (Csibra et al., 2003),
intentions (Behne et al., 2005), desires (Repacholi and Gopnik,
1997), emotions (Moses et al., 2001), and perhaps even beliefs
(Buttelmann et al., 2009). The ability to understand others’ men-
tal states manifests itself in a number of overt behaviors in the
second year of life, many of which are used to index early social
cognition. For instance, by 18 months children engage in regu-
lar bouts of joint attention (Tomasello et al., 2005; Tomasello and
Carpenter, 2007), empathy (Roth-Hanania et al., 2011), coopera-
tion (Brownell et al., 2006; Warneken et al., 2006; Warneken and
Tomasello, 2007), and self-recognition (Nielsen and Dissanayake,
2004; Brownell et al., 2007). These social-cognitive skills rely on
the capacity to diﬀerentiate self from other (Asendorpf et al.,
1996; Lewis, 2003), and it has been suggested that children’s emer-
gent aptitude for understanding intentions may play a critical role
in their ability to engage successfully in these behaviors (Moore,
2007; Knoblich and Sebanz, 2008).
Although social cognition develops progressively over child-
hood (Gergely and Csibra, 2003; San Juan and Astington, 2012;
Thoermer et al., 2012), there are important individual diﬀerences
in early social cognition that have a bearing on later skills such
as theory of mind (Legerstee, 2005; Aschersleben et al., 2008;
Wellman et al., 2008). This variability in social reasoning can also
be observed in adolescence (Moriguchi et al., 2007; Dumontheil
et al., 2010). Longitudinal studies show that individual diﬀerences
in social cognition are quite stable (Pons and Harris, 2005) and
are related to multiple developmental outcomes (Frischen et al.,
2007; Fiske and Taylor, 2013). For instance, theory of mind abil-
ity has been linked to children’s academic achievement (Blair and
Razza, 2007), behavioral problems (Hughes and Ensor, 2006),
and social competence (Razza and Blair, 2009). Accordingly, it
is important to identify sources of variability in early social cog-
nition, which may exert downstream eﬀects on multiple domains
of functioning.
To date, the preponderance of literature on predictors of social
cognition has focused on contextual factors such as family pro-
cesses and socioeconomic variables. For instance, Dunn et al.
(1991) have shown that mothers’ mental state discourse and fam-
ily socioeconomic status (SES) at 33 months are associated with
emotion understanding at 40 months. The eﬀect of socioeco-
nomic factors on individual diﬀerences in theory of mind has
been replicated in numerous investigations (Holmes et al., 1996;
Shatz et al., 2003). Moreover, the eﬀect of parenting behavior on
social cognition is one of the most robust ﬁndings in the lit-
erature on social cognition (Pears and Moses, 2003; de Rosnay
and Hughes, 2006; Ruﬀman et al., 2006). Also relevant are child-
level factors such as gender, with females demonstrating overall
better social cognition than males (Dunn et al., 1991). One of
the strongest factors associated with social cognition is language
ability (Astington and Jenkins, 1999; Cutting and Dunn, 1999;
de Rosnay and Harris, 2002; Pons et al., 2003), which may play
both a communicational and representational role in social cog-
nition (see Dunn and Brophy, 2005). Thus, there appears to be
a range of known environmental and child-speciﬁc factors that
contribute to individual diﬀerences in social cognition across
childhood.
Importantly, much of the existing literature has focused on
predictors of social cognition in preschool and school-age chil-
dren. Relatively less is known about the factors associated with
social cognition at earlier stages of development. However, recent
studies suggest that, as early as the second year of life, there
may be multiple inﬂuences on social cognition, such as cumula-
tive social disadvantage, maternal sensitivity, and language ability
(Wade et al., 2014c) as well as oxytocin genetic variability (Wade
et al., 2014b) and pregnancy hypertension (Wade and Jenkins,
2014). These results are consistent with the manifold biopsy-
chosocial correlates of social cognition observed in preschool
children. However, across all studies there remains a substan-
tial proportion of unexplained residual variance, suggesting the
presence of currently unspeciﬁed inﬂuences on social cognition.
The goal of the current study was to examine whether early
biomedical risk, or the occurrence of combined pre- and peri-
natal complications, represented another source of variability
in social cognition in the second year of life. Further, sup-
posing that such a relationship exists, and consistent with the
known eﬀects of contextual factors on social-cognitive develop-
ment, we aimed to determine whether positive postnatal inter-
personal experiences with caregivers (i.e., responsive parenting)
protected children against these potentially adverse biomedical
risks.
Speciﬁc biomedical risk factors for early social cognition have
been vastly understudied. In one recent study, Wade and Jenkins
(2014) demonstrated that pregnancy hypertension is associated
with lower social cognition at 18 months, as well as theory
of mind ability in the preschool period. Another recent study
showed that birth weight was positively associated with theory
of mind at age 4.5 in a typically developing sample (Wade et al.,
2014a). Together, these studies provide preliminary evidence that
pre- and perinatal factors may be involved in a mechanism
through which early fetal stress impinges on healthy brain devel-
opment that supports social cognition. Aside from these ﬁndings,
however, little is known about the role of biomedical factors on
social cognition in the second year of life.
Indirect evidence for a role of early medical complications on
social cognition comes from research showing that such factors
are related to the risk of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric dis-
orders characterized by deﬁcits in social cognition. For instance,
a comprehensive review by Kolevzon et al. (2007) revealed that
the most prominent obstetric complications associated with risk
for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) included birth weight, ges-
tational age, as well as intrapartum hypoxia. Obstetrical com-
plications have also been linked to the risk for schizophrenia
(Geddes and Lawrie, 1995; Verdoux et al., 1997), eating disorders
(Cnattingius et al., 1999), early onset aﬀective disorders (Guth
et al., 1993), substance abuse (Sydsjö, 2011), attention-deﬁcit
hyperactivity disorder (Milberger et al., 1997; Bhutta et al., 2002),
and conduct, oppositional, and internalizing problems (Cohen
et al., 1989). In a prospective follow-up study, Buka et al. (1993)
suggested that fetal hypoxia was the common underlying mech-
anism and was the strongest predictor of later cognitive and

psychiatric diﬃculties. Several maternal pathologies during preg-
nancy have been linked to perinatal hypoxia–ischemia, such as
infections, diabetes, hypertension, and thyroid problems (Shah,
2001; Kurinczuk et al., 2010; Teramo, 2010; Stanek, 2013). Thus,
it is conceivable that these biomedical factors increase the risk
of hypoxic-ischemic events which compromise development in
key social-cognitive domains that typify neurodevelopmental and
psychiatric conditions.
Two important points deserve consideration here. The ﬁrst
is that early biomedical complications likely produce a con-
tinuum of postnatal biopsychosocial-health variability, rather
than just the extremes of problems (Pasamanick and Knobloch,
1961). This means that we should expect to observe individ-
ual diﬀerences in discrete social, cognitive, and emotional phe-
notypes that characterize neurodevelopmental and psychiatric
conditions as a function of biomedical risk. Second, the exist-
ing research is limited in diﬀerentiating between the eﬀect of
diﬀerent types of prenatal/birth complications on developmen-
tal outcomes (Allen et al., 1998). Indeed, there are a variety of
biomedical complications that can occur during the pre-, peri-,
and neonatal period, including those related to maternal phys-
ical health (e.g., endocrine/inﬂammatory diseases), intrapartum
events (e.g., physical trauma), perinatal problems (e.g., low birth
weight, prematurity), and immediate postpartum factors (e.g.,
anoxia or hematological problems demanding use of specialized
care). However, it may be diﬃcult to ascertain the eﬀect of each
individual risk on children’s outcomes, particularly in epidemio-
logical samples where the prevalence of certain conditions may
be too low to provide powerful estimates and the measurement is
not suﬃciently detailed to eﬀectively partition risks. As a result,
one approach that may be useful is the cumulative risk approach.
The overarching idea behind cumulative risk measures is that,
rather than a single and speciﬁc risk, it is the aggregation of
multiple risks that compromises development (Dong et al., 2004;
Flouri and Kallis, 2007; Burchinal et al., 2008). Indeed, it has been
repeatedly demonstrated that cumulative risk indices are more
stable than individual risk measures (Burchinal et al., 2000), and
explain more variance in child outcomes than risks examined in
isolation (Deater-Deckard et al., 1998; Atzaba-Poria et al., 2004;
Flouri and Kallis, 2007; Evans et al., 2013).
While the cumulative risk approach has been applied widely
within the psychosocial domain, its application to prenatal/birth
risks is far less common. Nonetheless, existing research indi-
cates that the accumulation of biomedical risks in the pre- and
perinatal period is detrimental to children’s socioemotional, intel-
lectual, and motor functioning (Laucht et al., 1997), as well as
their visual memory (Levy-Shiﬀet al., 1994) and attentional con-
trol (Carmody et al., 2006). However, these studies have generally
assessed the eﬀect of medical complications in children born
preterm, which represents a group of already at-risk children who
may be particularly vulnerable to negative outcomes. The eﬀect of
biomedical risk (i.e., prenatal/birth complications) on social cog-
nition in the general community remains unexplored. Further,
no study has examined how enriched postnatal experiences may
protect against early biomedical risk on social cognition.
Parental inputs are believed to foster social cognition
owing to their role in providing children with the linguistic,
representational, and reﬂective material needed to understand
others’ minds (Fernyhough, 2008). Further, it has been demon-
strated that positive experiences with caregivers exert a protective
inﬂuence on children (Rutter, 1987; Brody et al., 2002; Burchinal
et al., 2006). Protective in this regard does not mean avoiding
risk, but persevering in the face of it. These ‘moderation’ models
are typically examined by determining whether the association
between two variables depends on the level of a third variable,
with the risk variable (e.g., biological risk) being less predictive
of the outcome when the presumed protective factor is present.
Surprisingly, there is little existing research on parenting as a pro-
tective factor in regard to the development of social-cognitive
capacities, or as a moderator of the association between biolog-
ical risk and children’s outcomes in general. The limited research
to date, however, does suggest that certain aspects of parenting
may buﬀer children against early biomedical risk. For example,
Laucht et al. (2001) found that responsive parenting moderated
the eﬀect of birth weight on school-aged children’s hyperkinetic
and internalizing problems, and Voigt et al. (2013) showed that
the eﬀect of neonatal distress on children’s negative aﬀectivity at
12 months depended on the level of parenting stress, with lower
levels of stress protecting against neonatal problems. Finally,
another interesting study examining children’s executive func-
tioning – a neurocognitive skill that is developmentally linked
to social cognition – showed that the eﬀect of neurobiological
risk (i.e., direct measurement from neonatal medical records,
e.g., need for oxygen/ventilation) on executive functioning was
most prominent in socioeconomically disadvatanged children
(Ford et al., 2011). Thus, to build on this literature, and in line
with risk-resiliency models of development (Luthar et al., 2000;
Masten et al., 2009; Jenkins et al., in press), the current study
aimed to determine whether, given an association between cumu-
lative biomedical risk and social cognition, responsive parenting
moderated this association. Speciﬁcally, it was hypothesized that
higher levels of biomedical risk would be associated with lower
social cognition at 18 months; however, if children received high
levels of responsive parenting, the eﬀect of biomedical risk on
social cognition would be attenuated.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants came from the intensive sample of the Kids, Families,
Places Study (iKFP; http://kfp.oise.utoronto.ca/). All women giv-
ing birth in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, between April
2006 and September 2007 were considered for participation.
Families were recruited through a program called Healthy Babies
Healthy Children. Parents of all registered newborns were con-
tacted within several days of the child’s birth. Inclusion crite-
ria for the iKFP study included the presence of an English-
speaking mother, a newborn >1500 g, at least two children
who are <4 years, and families agreeing to be ﬁlmed in the
home. Of those contacted, 34% of families agreed to take part
in the study. Reasons for non-enlistment included refusals and
an inability to contact families from public health’s informa-
tion. The University of Toronto Research Ethics Board approved

all procedures for this investigation, including informed con-
sent.
We compared our sample (N = 501) with the general pop-
ulation of Toronto and Hamilton using 2006 Census Data, lim-
iting the census to women between 20 and 50 years and having
at least one child. Families were compared based upon immi-
grant status, number of persons in the home, family structure,
maternal personal income, and educational level. Based on these
comparisons, iKFP was similar to the general population on
family size (M = 4.52, SD = 1.01 vs. M = 4.13, SD = 1.22)
and personal income (C$30,000–39,999 vs. census population
mean = C$30,504.16, SD = C$37,808.12). Since our sample was
recruited shortly after childbirth, there were predictably fewer
non-intact families than in the general population (5% vs. 16.8%
lone-parent families; 4.3% vs. 10.3% stepfamilies). The ratio of
Canadian-born to immigrants was somewhat higher in the iKFP
sample (57.7% vs. 47.6%), likely due to the language requirement
for participation. Also, more study mothers had earned a bache-
lor’s degree or higher in the iKFP sample (53.3% vs. 30.6%). The
sample was ethnically and socio-demographically diverse (see
Table 1).
At Time 1 (T1; Mage = 2.0 months; SD = 1.06), 501 families
were enlisted in the study. Due to sample attrition, 397 (79.2%)
families were followed up at Time 2 (T2; Mage = 1.60 years;
SD = 0.16). Attrition analysis showed that dropout, similar to
other longitudinal studies, was related to higher levels of social
risk: maternal depression at T1, χ2 (df = 1) = 7.2, p = 0.01,
being in a non-intact family, χ2 (df = 1) = 11.1, p = 0.002, immi-
grant status, χ2 (df = 1) = 13.5, p < 0.001, teenage parenthood,
χ2 (df = 1) = 6.7, p = 0.02, maternal education <high school,
χ2 (df = 1) = 10.5, p = 0.002, and family income< $20,000, χ2
(df = 1) = 7.1, p = 0.01. Of the 397 children remaining at T2,
no social-cognitive data were available for 24 children due to
non-compliance, lack of visibility (e.g., child went oﬀcamera),
parent intrusion (e.g., directing child), non-administration due
to family constraints (e.g., time limitations) or tester adminis-
tration error (e.g., not following the standardized protocol). This
resulted in a ﬁnal sample of 373 children providing data on social
cognition.

Procedure
The study design combined the strengths of epidemiological
methodology (large and diverse sample, multiple siblings, home
visits) with the strength of developmental methodology (tasks
developed in the laboratory, detailed microsocial observational
data). At each time point, two trained interviewers visited each
family’s residence for approximately 2 h. Data collection included
questionnaires, age-appropriate developmental tasks for target
children at T2, and observational measures of mother–child
interactions at T2.
Measures
Cumulative Biomedical Risk
At T1, mothers reported on their own pregnancy complications
and a variety of infant birth problems. A single item was used
to assess the presence/absence (0 = absent; 1 = present) of each
of the following: (1) pregnancy diabetes; (2) hypertension; (3)
thyroid problems (4) loss of fetal movement; (5) injury to the
abdomen; (6) infant need for intensive care after birth; (7) infant
need for oxygen/ventilation; and (8) infant need to be transferred
to a specialized hospital. Further, two additional continuous
perinatal risk factors were dichotomized based on pre-deﬁned
cut-points. These were: (9) low birth weight (<2500 g); and (10)
short gestation (<37 weeks). A count of these biomedical risks
was computed. The distribution of problems in the sample was
as follows: 0 problems (68.0%), 1 problem (25.0%), 2 problems
(4.4%), 3 problems (1.2%), 4 problems (1.2%), 5 problems (0%),
and 6 problems (0.2%). No individuals reported 7–10 problems.
Further, as few individuals existed in the upper tail of the distri-
bution, we combined 4–6 problems into a category of ‘4 or more’
problems (1.4% of the sample). Thus, this variable represented a
count of the number of biomedical risks/complications on a scale
from zero to ‘4 or more.’
Maternal Responsivity
Observational data were gathered at T2 on mother–child inter-
actions across three 5-min tasks: (1) unstructured free play with
no toys; (2) a structured cooperative building task (using Duplo
blocks to build a design from a picture); and (3) reading from
a wordless picture book. For all three tasks, three domains
of responsivity were coded using the Parent–Child Interaction
System of global ratings (PARCHISY, Deater-Deckard et al.,
unpublished) and the Coding of Attachment Related Parenting
(CARP, Matias, 2006). Sensitivity (from the CARP) measured
the degree to which the parent responded to the child’s verbal
and non-verbal signals, supported the child’s autonomy, showed
warmth, and demonstrated an ability to see things from the child’s
perspective. Mutuality (from the CARP) is a dyadic code and is
compatible with the concept of the ‘goal-corrected partnership’
(Bowlby, 1982). Mutuality was indexed by reciprocity in conver-
sation (e.g., a conversation that “goes somewhere” and is a gen-
uine dialog), aﬀect sharing, joint engagement in task, and open
body posture. Finally, positive control (from the PARCHISY) cap-
tures the parents’ positive means of getting the child to do some-
thing that she wanted him or her to do through the use of praise,
explanations, and open ended questions. Each of these three
domains – sensitivity, mutuality, and positive control – was rated

Biomedical risk, parenting, and social cognition
on a 7-point scale for each of the three tasks. Internal consistency
of the measures was high (α = 0.85). Thus, a composite measure
of ‘maternal responsivity’ was created by averaging the sensitiv-
ity, mutuality, and positive control scores across all three tasks.
Higher scores reﬂected higher levels of maternal responsivity.
Coders were trained to criterion and then 10% of the interactions
were double-coded. Reliability was checked throughout the cod-
ing period to guard against rater drift. Inter-rater reliability was
high (α = 0.94). Coders were blind to the biomedical history of
the children.
Social Cognition
This was measured at T2 (18 months) by four independent
observational tasks assessing children’s joint attention, empathy,
cooperation, and self-recognition. Each of these tasks was pre-
viously validated and widely used in laboratory studies, and we
adapted these for use in the home interviews. A complete descrip-
tion of these tasks can be found in Supplementary Material, as
well as Wade et al. (2014c). Brieﬂy, in the joint attention task
children were required to respond to an adult interviewer’s bids
for directing their attention (Mundy et al., 2003); in the empa-
thy task (Kochanska et al., 1994) children were assessed for their
ability to respond to the feigned distress of the interviewer; in
the cooperation tasks (Warneken et al., 2006) children had to
work collaboratively with the interviewer toward a shared goal;
and in the self-recognition task we evaluated children’s ability
to recognize the objectivity of their body using the mirror-rouge
paradigm (Amsterdam, 1972). Inter-rater reliabilities across tasks
were good: α = 0.94 for joint attention, α = 0.82 for empathy,
α = 0.86 for cooperation, and κ = 0.79 for self-recognition. Scores
on these measures were submitted to a conﬁrmatory factor analy-
sis (CFA), consistent with their ostensible coherence as indicators
of children’s latent social cognition (Wade et al., 2014c). Model
ﬁt for the social cognition factor was excellent in accordance
with Hu and Bentler’s (1999) recommended cut-oﬀs: root-mean-
square-error of approximation (RMSEA) = 0.023, comparative
ﬁt index (CFI) = 0.99, and standardized root-mean-square resid-
ual (SRMR) = 0.021. Model-estimated loadings were also positive
and signiﬁcant at the p < 0.001 level for all indicators. Factor
scores were saved and used as the primary outcome variable. The
social cognition factor was normally distributed with a mean of
zero.
Covariates
Based on previous studies demonstrating the association between
certain socio-demographic and constitutional factors and social
cognition, a number of variables were controlled for: (1) child
age in years; (2) child gender (0 = male; 1 = female); (3) annual
family income, assessed on a scale from 1 (‘no income’) to 16
(‘$105,000 or more’); (4) maternal education, assessed as the total
number of years of formal schooling, not including kindergarten;
(5) immigrant status of the mother (i.e., 0 = immigrant; 1 = born
in Canada); (6) maternal depression, assessed using the Center
for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D; Radloﬀ,
1977), a widely used self-report scale that assesses depression
in non-clinical populations; and (7) children’s language ability,
measured concurrent with social cognition (18 months) using
the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories
(CDIs; Fenson et al., 1994).
Statistical Analysis
First, all predictor and covariate variables were standardized,
and the interaction term between cumulative biomedical risk
and maternal responsivity was computed by multiplying the z-
scores of these two variables (Preacher and Rucker, 2003). We
then performed hierarchical multiple regression using MPlus
7.0. To handle variable amounts of missing data, we used full-
information maximum likelihood estimation (FIML), which pro-
duces unbiased parameter estimates and SEs when data are
missing at random (Enders and Bandalos, 2001). The model
was ﬁtted using the maximum likelihood with robust SEs esti-
mator (MLR), which gives parameter estimates with SEs and a
chi-square that are robust to non-normality (Yuan and Bentler,
2000). In the ﬁrst step of the multiple regression analysis, the
covariates were entered into the model. In the second step, the
covariates plus the main eﬀects of cumulative biomedical risk
and maternal responsivity were entered into the model. Finally,
in the third step, the interaction between biomedical risk and
maternal responsivity was added to the variables from all pre-
vious steps in order to determine whether the interaction term
predicted social cognition above and beyond covariates and main
eﬀects.
Results
Preliminary Descriptive Analysis
Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for all study vari-
ables, including bivariate associations. Notable associations in
Table 2 include the positive relationship between social cog-
nition and child age, female gender, family income, language
ability, and maternal responsivity, as well as the negative asso-
ciation between social cognition and cumulative biomedical risk.
Higher biomedical risk was also associated with lower socioeco-
nomic status (family income and maternal education), as well as
higher levels of maternal depression and lower levels of mater-
nal responsivity. Maternal responsivity was associated with nearly
all other study variables. A preliminary trend analysis showed

and their interaction on social cognition. These results are pre-
sented in Table 3. In the ﬁrst step of the model, covariates
that were shown to be signiﬁcant predictors of social cognition
at 18 months included age, female gender, and child language
ability. Family income was marginally associated with social cog-
nition. None of the other covariates were signiﬁcant predictors.
This step of the model accounted for a signiﬁcant 30% of the
variance in social cognition. In the second step of the model,
above and beyond covariates, there was, there was a signiﬁcant
main eﬀect of cumulative biomedical risk and a marginally sig-
niﬁcant main eﬀect of maternal responsivity on social cognition.
This model accounted for an additional 2.1% of the variance in
social cognition, or 32.1% overall. Finally, in the third step of the
model, over and above covariates and main eﬀects, the interaction
between cumulative biomedical risk and maternal responsivity
signiﬁcantly predicted social cognition. The main eﬀects of both
biomedical risk and maternal responsivity were reduced to non-
signiﬁcance upon inclusion of the interaction term. This model
accounted for a total of 32.8% of the variance in social cognition.
Follow-Up Analysis of Simple Slopes
To explicate the pattern of the interaction between biomedical
risk and maternal responsivity, we performed an analysis of sim-
ple slopes, which tests the relationship between biomedical risk
and social cognition at diﬀerent levels of the moderator (Aiken
and West, 1991). In the case of a continuous moderator (i.e.,
responsive parenting), the common approach to examine the
regression relationship at high (+1 SD) and low (−1 SD) levels
of the moderator (Cohen et al., 2013). The pattern of this inter-
action can be seen in Figure 1. This ﬁgure shows that, when
biomedical risk is low, there was a minimal eﬀect of respon-
sivity on social cognition (z = 0.38, p = 0.71). Alternatively,
at high levels of biomedical risk, responsivity was positively
related to social cognition (z = 2.66, p = 0.008). Examining
the converse associations, at low levels of responsivity, biomed-
ical risk was strongly negatively associated with social cognition
(z = −2.70, p = 0.002), while at high levels of responsivity,
biomedical risk was not associated with social cognition (z = 0.38,
p = 0.70).

Discussion
The aim of the current study was to investigate the associa-
tion between cumulative biomedical risk and social cognition at
18 months, and whether maternal responsivity moderated this
association. It was shown that, above and beyond covariates, both
maternal responsivity and cumulative biomedical risk indepen-
dently predicted social cognition at 18 months. Further, con-
sistent with study hypotheses, maternal responsivity was shown
to moderate the association between biomedical risk and social
cognition, with the eﬀect of biomedical risk only apparent at
low levels of maternal responsivity. Alternatively, at high lev-
els of maternal responsivity, there was no eﬀect of cumulative
biomedical risk on social cognition. These results provide the ﬁrst
empirical evidence that accumulating biomedical risk factors may
be one source of inter-individual variability in children’s social-
cognitive skills in the second year of life. Also, and consistent with
risk-resiliency models of development, these ﬁndings suggest that
postnatal socialization factors – speciﬁcally responsive caregiving
– may protect against the impact of early biomedical risk on child
outcomes.
Our ﬁnding that responsive parenting acts as a protective
factor against early biomedical complications is consistent with
intervention studies showing that cognitive and social outcomes
of perinatally at-risk children may be fostered through training
programs that build parents’ cognitive and aﬀective responsive-
ness (Landry et al., 1997, 2006, 2008, 2012). In general, these
studies show that intervention eﬀects on broad cognitive and
socio-emotional competence operate through changes in par-
enting behaviors, and these eﬀects are strongest in the most
biologically at-risk children (e.g., very low birth weight, preterm).
Within the context of these intervention studies, the current
ﬁndings are noteworthy for two reasons: ﬁrst, they show that,
in addition to individual biological insults such as low birth
weight, the accumulation of early biomedical risk factors may
also compromise children’s emerging social-cognitive skill devel-
opment, operationalized within a framework that posits under-
lying capacities for self-other diﬀerentiation and understanding
of intentions (see also Moore, 2007; Wade et al., 2014c); sec-
ond, they demonstrate that the protective role of responsive
maternal behaviors is also present within a normative, epidemi-
ological sample of children with varying degrees of biological
risk. Within such a sample, the presence of individual biomed-
ical risks are typically not powerful individual predictors of
child outcomes, either because these are low frequency events,
or because there are a host of identiﬁed or unidentiﬁed factors
that buﬀer the eﬀect of isolated risks. Rather, it may be that the
accumulation of multiple biomedical risks is what creates mean-
ingful diﬀerences in children’s social cognition within the general
population.
The mechanisms through which biomedical risks inﬂuence
children’s social cognition are presumed to involve changes
in infant brain development. However, little research exists to
support the idea that prenatal/birth insults speciﬁcally impact
the neural regions that support social cognition in humans.
The postnatal progression following such biomedical risks may
shed light on the mechanisms that underlie diﬀerences reported
here. Infants born with prenatal/perinatal complications are at
a higher risk for postnatal complications (e.g., metabolic com-
plications; Lubchenco and Bard, 1971; Hendderson et al., 2006).
Experimental evidence from animal models demonstrates that
all these factors can stimulate or precipitate neuronal death in
the infant brain resulting in volume loss in particular regions
within the brain (Bhutta and Anand, 2001). This is supported
by ﬁndings from Peterson et al. (2000), who examined brain
volume diﬀerences in 8-year-old children born with birth compli-
cations. This study demonstrated smaller volumes in the amyg-
dala, hippocampus, basal ganglia, and cortical regions, all of
which were associated with increased risk of ADHD and lower
cognitive scores. Some of these regions have also been impli-
cated in social cognition (Adolphs, 2001). Further, in a notable
study by Carmody et al. (2006), cumulative medical and envi-
ronmental risk was shown to be associated with lower cognitive
performance in adolescence, as well distinct patterns as brain
activation in temporal and parietal cortical regions. This is inter-
esting given that social cognition, including the capacity for
self-other diﬀerentiation and mental-state inference, is believed
to be supported by a distributed neural network that includes
temporal and parietal areas (Decety and Sommerville, 2003; Van
Overwalle, 2009). By extension, it is plausible that accumulating
biomedical risks are associated with social cognition by virtue
of their eﬀect on functional brain networks during in utero and
early postnatal development. Moreover, recent studies suggest the
possibility that the strongest associations between pre/perinatal
characteristics and brain development may exist within the nor-
mal range (Raznahan et al., 2012; Walhovd et al., 2013). The
current results show that, indeed, meaningful diﬀerences in
social cognition may exist as a function of normal variation in

summative biomedical complications. Despite these interest-
ing ﬁndings, the exact mechanism(s) connecting biomedical
risk, neural development, and social cognition require future
research.
Perhaps most interesting to the current study was the ﬁnd-
ing that responsive parenting moderated the association between
cumulative biomedical risk and social cognition. These results
are consistent with other observational studies on the protec-
tive eﬀect of positive caregiving on children’s varied behav-
ioral and mental health outcomes (Raine et al., 1994, 1997;
Landry et al., 1997; Laucht et al., 1997, 2001; Voigt et al.,
2013). Schore’s regulation theory suggests that positive parent–
child interactions help promote adaptive functioning through
regulation of neurobiological processes, including structural
and functional neuroanatomy (Schore, 1996, 2001). Moreover,
regulation theory posits a maturational process from prena-
tal to postnatal development, consistent with the notion that
there is substantial brain development over the ﬁrst 2 years
of life (Knickmeyer et al., 2008). The developing brain is
also very vulnerable to both environmental insult and enrich-
ment, the latter of which may promote some the protective
eﬀects of responsive caregiving. Interestingly, recent ﬁndings
from longitudinal studies show that the provision of early
responsive caregiving is associated with enhanced physiologi-
cal organization and resultant cognitive functioning over the
ﬁrst 10 years of life (Feldman et al., 2014). The precise role
of responsive parenting, including the speciﬁc forms of care
that foster neurobiological development and social cognition,
requires further investigation. However, collaborative evidence
from the ﬁelds of pediatrics, developmental psychology, and
social neuroscience point to the importance of early respon-
sive care in ameliorating the long-term sequelae of adverse
pre/perinatal events on neurological and cognitive morbidity.
Indeed, small variations in biological risk may create momen-
tous gaps in children’s social and cognitive development, and
these eﬀects may persist across the lifespan in the absence of
interventions that target foundational inter-personal transac-
tions with caregivers early in postnatal life (Walhovd et al.,
2014).
The results of this study should be considered in light of
several strengths and limitations. The strengths included the
prospective, multi-method, longitudinal design, large and diverse
sample, and use of detailed observational outcome data on 18-
month social-cognitive measures. Inclusion of numerous socio-
demographic confounding variables also adds to the robustness
of the current ﬁndings. In regard to limitations, the current
Canadian sample was more advantaged than the general popu-
lation, and participation was restricted to children born >1500 g.
These sampling factors may limit the generalizability of the
results. Also, each of the 10 biomedical risks was low frequency,
measured through maternal report, and typically dichotomous.
Agreement between self-report and criterion-standard medical
record data has been shown to be high for prenatal com-
plications (Okura et al., 2004) and other pre/perinatal events
(Lederman and Paxton, 1998; Tomeo et al., 1999). However,
future studies using more comprehensive information from
obstetrical records would strengthen these ﬁndings. Moreover,
additional information on the timing and severity of partic-
ular prenatal conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, thyroid
problems), as well as the speciﬁc reasons neonatal specialized
care was needed (e.g., ischemia, anoxia, hematological prob-
lems), would improve suggestions about the mechanisms at
play. More extensive records of prenatal care – which were
not available in the current epidemiological study – would
also shed light on the nature of these inﬂuences on child out-
comes. Also, although signiﬁcant, the eﬀects documented herein
were generally small in magnitude, suggesting that there are
additional sources of unexplained variability in social cogni-
tion worthy of future investigation. Likewise, biomedical risk
and responsive parenting were not completely independent
predictors of social cognition, leading to the possibility that
heightened biomedical risk may also predict variability in par-
enting. Possible mechanisms that link early biomedical risk
to both parenting and child behavior – for instance, through
the use of longitudinal cross-lagged mediation models – may
be useful in elucidating these pathways to social cognition.
On a related note, the fact that social cognition and mater-
nal responsivity were measured contemporaneously (i.e., both
at 18 months) precludes inferences about causality, and addi-
tional studies are warranted to determine the directionality of
eﬀects. Finally, although cumulative risk indices are powerful
measures for examining the extent of risk exposure on devel-
opmental outcomes, future studies comparing the utility of
these metrics to individual risk factors (measured through client
records or direct measurement of risk, e.g., degree of hypoxia,
level of hyperglycemia or hypertension, length of time in spe-
cialized care, etc.), are warranted based on these preliminary
results.
