BACKGROUND
The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) 
occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020. 
We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the 
epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.
METHODS
We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and 
illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by 
January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key 
epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth, 
we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.
RESULTS
Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years 
and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020, 
were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of 
the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence 
interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days. 
In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean 
serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was 
estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).
CONCLUSIONS
On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human trans-
mission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019. 
Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks 
if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission 
should be implemented in populations at risk. (Funded by the Ministry of Science

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
S
ince December 2019, an increasing 
number of cases of novel coronavirus 
(2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP) 
have been identified in Wuhan, a large city of 11 
million people in central China.1-3 On December 
29, 2019, the first 4 cases reported, all linked to 
the Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Whole-
sale Market, were identified by local hospitals 
using a surveillance mechanism for “pneumonia 
of unknown etiology” that was established in 
the wake of the 2003 severe acute respiratory 
syndrome (SARS) outbreak with the aim of al-
lowing timely identification of novel pathogens 
such as 2019-nCoV.4 In recent days, infections 
have been identified in other Chinese cities and 
in more than a dozen countries around the 
world.5 Here, we provide an analysis of data on 
the first 425 laboratory-confirmed cases in Wu-
han to describe the epidemiologic characteristics 
and transmission dynamics of NCIP.
Methods
Sources of Data
The earliest cases were identified through the 
“pneumonia of unknown etiology” surveillance 
mechanism.4 Pneumonia of unknown etiology is 
defined as an illness without a causative patho-
gen identified that fulfills the following criteria: 
fever (≥38°C), radiographic evidence of pneumo-
nia, low or normal white-cell count or low lym-
phocyte count, and no symptomatic improvement 
after antimicrobial treatment for 3 to 5 days 
following standard clinical guidelines. In re-
sponse to the identification of pneumonia cases 
and in an effort to increase the sensitivity for 
early detection, we developed a tailored surveil-
lance protocol to identify potential cases on 
January 3, 2020, using the case definitions de-
scribed below.1 Once a suspected case was iden-
tified, the joint field epidemiology team com-
prising members from the Chinese Center for 
Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) 
together with provincial, local municipal CDCs 
and prefecture CDCs would be informed to initi-
ate detailed field investigations and collect respi-
ratory specimens for centralized testing at the 
National Institute for Viral Disease Control and 
Prevention, China CDC, in Beijing. A joint team 
comprising staff from China CDC and local 
CDCs conducted detailed field investigations for 
all suspected and confirmed 2019-nCoV cases.
Data were collected onto standardized forms 
through interviews of infected persons, relatives, 
close contacts, and health care workers. We col-
lected information on the dates of illness onset, 
visits to clinical facilities, hospitalization, and 
clinical outcomes. Epidemiologic data were col-
lected through interviews and field reports. In-
vestigators interviewed each patient with infec-
tion and their relatives, where necessary, to 
determine exposure histories during the 2 weeks 
before the illness onset, including the dates, 
times, frequency, and patterns of exposures to 
any wild animals, especially those purportedly 
available in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Mar-
ket in Wuhan, or exposures to any relevant envi-
ronments such as that specific market or other 
wet markets. Information about contact with 
others with similar symptoms was also included. 
All epidemiologic information collected during 
field investigations, including exposure history, 
timelines of events, and close contact identifica-
tion, was cross-checked with information from 
multiple sources. Households and places known to 
have been visited by the patients in the 2 weeks 
before the onset of illness were also investigated 
to assess for possible animal and environmental 
exposures. Data were entered into a central data-
base, in duplicate, and were verified with EpiData 
software (EpiData Association).
Case Definitions
The initial working case definitions for suspected 
NCIP were based on the SARS and Middle East 
respiratory syndrome (MERS) case definitions, 
as recommended by the World Health Organiza-
tion (WHO) in 2003 and 2012.6-8 A suspected 
NCIP case was defined as a pneumonia that ei-
ther fulfilled all the following four criteria — 
fever, with or without recorded temperature; radio-
graphic evidence of pneumonia; low or normal 
white-cell count or low lymphocyte count; and 
no reduction in symptoms after antimicrobial 
treatment for 3 days, following standard clinical 
guidelines — or fulfilled the abovementioned 
first three criteria and had an epidemiologic link 
to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market or 
contact with other patients with similar symp-
toms. The epidemiologic criteria to define a sus-
pected case were updated on January 18, 2020, 
once new information on identified cases be-
came available. The criteria were the following: 
a travel history to Wuhan or direct contact with

n engl j med 382;13  nejm.org  March 26, 2020
1201
Early Transmission Dynamics of NCIP
patients from Wuhan who had fever or respira-
tory symptoms, within 14 days before illness 
onset.9 A confirmed case was defined as a case 
with respiratory specimens that tested positive 
for the 2019-nCoV by at least one of the follow-
ing three methods: isolation of 2019-nCoV or at 
least two positive results by real-time reverse-
transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) 
assay for 2019-nCoV or a genetic sequence that 
matches 2019-nCoV.
Laboratory Testing
The 2019-nCoV laboratory test assays were based 
on the previous WHO recommendation.10 Upper 
and lower respiratory tract specimens were ob-
tained from patients. RNA was extracted and 
tested by real-time RT-PCR with 2019-nCoV–spe-
cific primers and probes. Tests were carried out 
in biosafety level 2 facilities at the Hubei (pro-
vincial) CDC and then at the National Institute 
for Viral Disease Control at China CDC. If two 
targets (open reading frame 1a or 1b, nucleocap-
sid protein) tested positive by specific real-time 
RT-PCR, the case would be considered to be 
laboratory-confirmed. A cycle threshold value 
(Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive 
test, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined 
as a negative test. A medium load, defined as a 
Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required confir-
mation by retesting. If the repeated Ct-value was 
less than 40 and an obvious peak was observed, 
or if the repeated Ct-value was less than 37, the 
retest was deemed positive. The genome was 
identified in samples of bronchoalveolar-lavage 
fluid from the patient by one of three methods: 
Sanger sequencing, Illumina sequencing, or nano-
pore sequencing. Respiratory specimens were 
inoculated in cells for viral isolation in enhanced 
biosafety laboratory 3 facilities at the China CDC.3
Statistical Analysis
The epidemic curve was constructed by date of 
illness onset, and key dates relating to epidemic 
identification and control measures were over-
laid to aid interpretation. Case characteristics 
were described, including demographic charac-
teristics, exposures, and health care worker sta-
tus. The incubation period distribution (i.e., the 
time delay from infection to illness onset) was 
estimated by fitting a log-normal distribution to 
data on exposure histories and onset dates in a 
subset of cases with detailed information avail-
able. Onset-to-first-medical-visit and onset-to-
admission distributions were estimated by fit-
ting a Weibull distribution on the dates of 
illness onset, first medical visit, and hospital 
admission in a subset of cases with detailed in-
formation available. We fitted a gamma distribu-
tion to data from cluster investigations to esti-
mate the serial interval distribution, defined as 
the delay between illness onset dates in succes-
sive cases in chains of transmission.
We estimated the epidemic growth rate by 
analyzing data on the cases with illness onset 
between December 10 and January 4, because we 
expected the proportion of infections identified 
would increase soon after the formal announce-
ment of the outbreak in Wuhan on December 31. 
We fitted a transmission model (formulated with 
the use of renewal equations) with zoonotic in-
fections to onset dates that were not linked to 
the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and we 
used this model to derive the epidemic growth 
rate, the epidemic doubling time, and the basic 
reproductive number (R0), which is defined as 
the expected number of additional cases that 
one case will generate, on average, over the 
course of its infectious period in an otherwise 
uninfected population. We used an informative 
prior distribution for the serial interval based on 
the serial interval of SARS with a mean of 8.4 
and a standard deviation of 3.8.11
Analyses of the incubation period, serial in-
terval, growth rate, and R0 were performed with 
the use of MATLAB software (MathWorks). Other 
analyses were performed with the use of SAS 
software (SAS Institute) and R software (R Foun-
dation for Statistical Computing).
Ethics Approval
Data collection and analysis of cases and close 
contacts were determined by the National Health 
Commission of the People’s Republic of China to 
be part of a continuing public health outbreak 
investigation and were thus considered exempt 
from institutional review board approval.
Results
The development of the epidemic follows an ex-
ponential growth in cases, and a decline in the 
most recent days is likely to be due to under-
ascertainment of cases with recent onset and 
delayed identification and reporting rather than

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
a true turning point in incidence (Fig. 1). Spe-
cifically, the latter part of the curve does not 
indicate a decrease in the number of incident 
cases but is due to delayed case ascertainment at 
the cutoff date. Care should be taken in inter-
preting the speed of growth in cases in January, 
given an increase in the availability and use of 
testing kits as time has progressed. The major-
ity of the earliest cases included reported expo-
sure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, 
but there was an exponential increase in the 
number of nonlinked cases beginning in late 
December.
The median age of the patients was 59 years 
(range, 15 to 89), and 240 of the 425 patients 
(56%) were male. There were no cases in chil-
dren below 15 years of age. We examined char-
acteristics of cases in three time periods: the 
first period was for patients with illness onset 
before January 1, which was the date the Huanan 
Seafood Wholesale Market was closed; the sec-
ond period was for those with onset between 
January 1 and January 11, which was the date 
when RT-PCR reagents were provided to Wuhan; 
and the third period was those with illness onset 
on or after January 12 (Table 1). The patients 
with earlier onset were slightly younger, more 
likely to be male, and much more likely to report 
exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale 
Market. The proportion of cases in health care 
workers gradually increased across the three 
periods (Table 1).
We examined data on exposures among 10 
confirmed cases, and we estimated the mean 
Figure 1. Onset of Illness among the First 425 Confirmed Cases of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–Infected Pneumonia (NCIP) in Wuhan, 
China.
The decline in incidence after January 8 is likely to be due to delays in diagnosis and laboratory confirmation. China CDC denotes Chinese

incubation period to be 5.2 days (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0); the 95th percen-
tile of the distribution was 12.5 days (95% CI, 
9.2 to 18) (Fig. 2A). We obtained information on 
5 clusters of cases, shown in Figure 3. On the 
basis of the dates of illness onset of 6 pairs of 
cases in these clusters, we estimated that the 
serial interval distribution had a mean (±SD) of 
7.5±3.4 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19) (Fig. 2B).
In the epidemic curve up to January 4, 2020, the 
epidemic growth rate was 0.10 per day (95% CI, 
0.050 to 0.16) and the doubling time was 7.4 days 
(95% CI, 4.2 to 14). Using the serial interval 
distribution above, we estimated that R0 was 2.2 
(95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).
The duration from illness onset to first 
medical visit for 45 patients with illness onset 
before January 1 was estimated to have a mean 
of 5.8 days (95% CI, 4.3 to 7.5), which was 
similar to that for 207 patients with illness onset 
between January 1 and January 11, with a mean 
of 4.6 days (95% CI, 4.1 to 5.1) (Fig. 2C). The 
mean duration from onset to hospital admission 
was estimated to be 12.5 days (95% CI, 10.3 to 
14.8) among 44 cases with illness onset before 
January 1, which was longer than that among 
189 patients with illness onset between January 1 
and 11 (mean, 9.1 days; 95% CI, 8.6 to 9.7) (Fig. 
2D). We did not plot these distributions for pa-
tients with onset on or after January 12, because 
those with recent onset and longer durations to 
presentation would not yet have been detected.
Discussion
Here we provide an initial assessment of the 
transmission dynamics and epidemiologic char-
acteristics of NCIP. Although the majority of the 
earliest cases were linked to the Huanan Sea-
food Wholesale Market and the patients could 
have been infected through zoonotic or environ-
mental exposures, it is now clear that human-to-
human transmission has been occurring and 
that the epidemic has been gradually growing in 
recent weeks. Our findings provide important 
parameters for further analyses, including evalu-
ations of the impact of control measures and 
predictions of the future spread of infection.
We estimated an R0 of approximately 2.2, 
meaning that on average each patient has been 
spreading infection to 2.2 other people. In gen-
eral, an epidemic will increase as long as R0 is 
greater than 1, and control measures aim to re-
duce the reproductive number to less than 1. The

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
R0 of SARS was estimated to be around 3,12 and 
SARS outbreaks were successfully controlled by 
isolation of patients and careful infection con-
trol.13 In the case of NCIP, challenges to control 
include the apparent presence of many mild in-
fections14 and limited resources for isolation of 
cases and quarantine of their close contacts. Our 
estimate of R0 was limited to the period up to 
January 4 because increases in awareness of the 
outbreak and greater availability and use of tests 
in more recent weeks will have increased the 
proportions of infections ascertained. It is possi-
ble that subsequent control measures in Wuhan, 
and more recently elsewhere in the country as 
well as overseas, have reduced transmissibility, 
but the detection of an increasing number of 
cases in other domestic locations and around 
the world suggest that the epidemic has contin-
ued to increase in size. Although the population 
quarantine of Wuhan and neighboring cities 
since January 23 should reduce the exportation 
of cases to the rest of the country and overseas, 
it is now a priority to determine whether local 
transmission at a similar intensity is occurring 
in other locations.
It is notable that few of the early cases oc-
curred in children, and almost half the 425 cases 
were in adults 60 years of age or older, although 
our case definition specified severe enough ill-
ness to require medical attention, which may 
vary according to the presence of coexisting 
conditions. Furthermore, children might be less 
likely to become infected or, if infected, may 
show milder symptoms, and either of these situ-
ations would account for underrepresentation in 
the confirmed case count. Serosurveys after the

Early Transmission Dynamics of NCIP
first wave of the epidemic would clarify this ques-
tion. Although infections in health care workers 
have been detected, the proportion has not been 
as high as during the SARS and MERS out-
breaks.15 One of the features of SARS and MERS 
outbreaks is heterogeneity in transmissibility, 
and in particular the occurrence of super-spread-
ing events, particularly in hospitals.16 Super-
spreading events have not yet been identified for 
NCIP, but they could become a feature as the 
epidemic progresses.
Although delays between the onset of illness 
and seeking medical attention were generally 
short, with 27% of patients seeking attention 
within 2 days after onset, delays to hospitaliza-
tion were much longer, with 89% of patients not 
being hospitalized until at least day 5 of illness 
(Fig. 2). This indicates the difficulty in identify-
ing and isolating cases at an earlier stage of 
disease. It may be necessary to commit consider-
able resources to testing in outpatient clinics 
and emergency departments for proactive case 
finding, both as part of the containment strategy 
in locations without local spread yet as well as 
to permit earlier clinical management of cases. 
Such an approach would also provide important 
information on the subclinical infections for a 
better assessment of severity.
Our preliminary estimate of the incubation 
period distribution provides important evidence 
to support a 14-day medical observation period 
or quarantine for exposed persons. Our estimate 
was based on information from 10 cases and is 
somewhat imprecise; it would be important for

further studies to provide more information on 
this distribution. When more data become avail-
able on epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP, a 
detailed comparison with the corresponding 
characteristics of SARS and MERS, as well as the 
four coronaviruses endemic in humans, would 
be informative.
Our study suffers from the usual limitations 
of initial investigations of infections with an 
emerging novel pathogen, particularly during the 
earliest phase, when little is known about any 
aspect of the outbreak and there is a lack of di-
agnostic reagents. To increase the sensitivity for 
early detection and diagnosis, epidemiology his-
tory was considered in the case identification 
and has been continually modified once more 
information has become available. Confirmed 
cases could more easily be identified after the 
PCR diagnostic reagents were made available to 
Wuhan on January 11, which helped us shorten 
the time for case confirmation. Furthermore, the 
initial focus of case detection was on patients 
with pneumonia, but we now understand that 
some patients can present with gastrointestinal 
symptoms, and an asymptomatic infection in a 
child has also been reported.17 Early infections 
with atypical presentations may have been missed, 
and it is likely that infections of mild clinical 
severity have been under-ascertained among the 
confirmed cases.18 We did not have detailed in-
formation on disease severity for inclusion in this 
analysis.
In conclusion, we found that cases of NCIP 
have been doubling in size approximately every 
7.4 days in Wuhan at this stage. Human-to-human 
transmission among close contacts has occurred 
since the middle of December and spread out 
gradually within a month after that. Urgent next 
steps include identifying the most effective con-
trol measures to reduce transmission in the com-
munity. The working case definitions may need 
to be refined as more is learned about the epide-
miologic characteristics and outbreak dynamics. 
The characteristics of cases should continue to 
be monitored to identify any changes in epide-
miology — for example, increases in infections 
among persons in younger age groups or health 
care workers. Future studies could include fore-
casts of the epidemic dynamics and special stud-
ies of person-to-person transmission in house-
holds or other locations, and serosurveys to 
determine the incidence of the subclinical infec-
tions would be valuable.14 These initial inferences 
have been made on a “line list” that includes 
detailed individual information on each con-
firmed case, but there may soon be too many 
cases to sustain this approach to surveillance, 
and other approaches may be required.19
