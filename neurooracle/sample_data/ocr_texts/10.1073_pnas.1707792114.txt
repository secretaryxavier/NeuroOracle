Mycobacterium tuberculosis’ success as a pathogen comes from its
ability to evade degradation by macrophages. Normally macro-
phages clear microorganisms that activate pathogen-recognition
receptors (PRRs) through a lysosomal-trafficking pathway called
“LC3-associated phagocytosis” (LAP). Although M. tuberculosis ac-
tivates numerous PRRs, for reasons that are poorly understood
LAP does not substantially contribute to M. tuberculosis control.
LAP depends upon reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by
NADPH oxidase, but M. tuberculosis fails to generate a robust
oxidative response. Here, we show that CpsA, a LytR-CpsA-Psr
(LCP) domain-containing protein, is required for M. tuberculosis
to evade killing by NADPH oxidase and LAP. Unlike phagosomes
containing wild-type bacilli, phagosomes containing the ΔcpsA
mutant recruited NADPH oxidase, produced ROS, associated with
LC3, and matured into antibacterial lysosomes. Moreover, CpsA
was sufficient to impair NADPH oxidase recruitment to fungal par-
ticles that are normally cleared by LAP. Intracellular survival of the
ΔcpsA mutant was largely restored in macrophages missing LAP
components (Nox2, Rubicon, Beclin, Atg5, Atg7, or Atg16L1) but
not in macrophages defective in a related, canonical autophagy
pathway (Atg14, Ulk1, or cGAS). The ΔcpsA mutant was highly
impaired in vivo, and its growth was partially restored in mice
deficient in NADPH oxidase, Atg5, or Atg7, demonstrating that
CpsA makes a significant contribution to the resistance of M. tu-
berculosis to NADPH oxidase and LC3 trafficking in vivo. Overall,
our findings reveal an essential role of CpsA in innate immune
evasion and suggest that LCP proteins have functions beyond their
previously known role in cell-wall metabolism.

T
he pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) causes one of
the world’s deadliest infections. Mtb survives within macro-
phages by preventing its own delivery to the degradative, phag-
olysosomal compartment (1). Recent work distinguished two related
phagolysosomal pathways that are characterized by the association of
LC3 with the phagosomal membrane, macroautophagy (hereafter
autophagy) and LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) (2–5). Auto-
phagy involves the capture of cytoplasmic components by a double-
membrane compartment called the “autophagosome.” When this
process sequesters microorganisms, it is called “xenophagy.” In both
xenophagy and LAP, LC3-decorated organelles fuse with lysosomes,
resulting in bacterial degradation. However, neither pathway is ef-
fective against Mtb. Only a small fraction of Mtb colocalizes with
LC3, and autophagy-related (Atg) proteins that are required for both
LAP and xenophagy make only a modest contribution toward Mtb
control (6–13), suggesting that Mtb is able to circumvent both pro-
cesses. A number of host and bacterial factors contribute to Mtb’s
ability to evade autophagy (14–17). How Mtb inhibits LAP is unclear.
LAP is initiated by bacterial binding to pathogen-recognition
receptors (PRRs) (Fig. S1). LAP requires NADPH oxidase and
the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex, which gen-
erate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phosphatidylinositol 3-
phosphate [PI(3)P], respectively, at the incipient phagosome (2,
3, 5). ROS directly kill bacteria and, along with PI(3)P, recruit
the Atg conjugation systems that deposit LC3 on the phagosomal
membrane. Mtb activates numerous PRRs, so it is surprising that
Mtb does not robustly trigger LAP. This incongruity suggests
that Mtb has a LAP evasion strategy.
Here, we show that an exported Mtb protein, CpsA (Rv3484),
prevents clearance of Mtb by NADPH oxidase and LAP. CpsA
contains two domains: a LytR-CpsA-Psr (LCP) domain, which is
found widely in Gram-positive bacteria, and a LytR domain,
which has an unknown function. LCP domains can transfer cell-
wall teichoic acids from their lipid-bound precursors to pepti-
doglycan (PGN) (18–20). Although mycobacteria do not have
teichoic acid, arabinogalactan (AG) is linked to PGN in an
analogous manner. Mtb has three proteins with LCP and LytR
domains: Rv3267/Lcp1/CpsA1, Rv3484/CpsA/CpsA2, and Rv0822c.
Significance
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of the
disease tuberculosis, grows in macrophages, cells that normally
kill bacteria. Recent work has defined a macrophage pathway
called “LC3-associated phagocytosis” (LAP) that can eliminate
other microbes. LAP is characterized by the recruitment of
NADPH oxidase to phagosomes, followed by phagosomal as-
sociation with LC3 and delivery of the bacteria to a degradative
lysosome. Here, we show that LAP does not effectively clear
Mtb. The ability of Mtb to inhibit LAP and therefore cause
disease depends upon CpsA, a member of the LytR-CpsA-Psr
(LCP) protein family, which has previously been implicated in
cell-wall metabolism. We demonstrate that Mtb CpsA plays an
unexpected role in antagonizing host innate immunity by
inhibiting NADPH oxidase and LAP.

Rv3267 is highly conserved in mycobacteria and is the main li-
gase responsible for catalyzing the transfer of AG to PGN (21,
22). CpsA shares 36% sequence identity with Rv3267; however,
unlike Rv3267, CpsA is not conserved in rapidly growing, non-
pathogenic mycobacteria (23), and the ΔcpsA mutant does not
exhibit significant cell-wall defects (21). Here, we demonstrate
that Mtb CpsA plays an unexpected role in antagonizing host
innate immunity by inhibiting NADPH oxidase and LAP. Our
findings provide an explanation for the limited oxidative burst
seen in response to Mtb and establish a role for CpsA in inhib-
iting innate immune clearance of Mtb.
Results
CpsA Protects Mtb from Lysosomal Clearance. Previously, we screened
secreted Mtb proteins for interactions with human proteins using a
high-throughput yeast two-hybrid assay (24). CpsA was included in
this screen because it had a predicted signal peptide, and it had
been found in culture filtrate in mass spectrometry studies (25–27).
We found that CpsA interacts with T-cell leukemia virus type I
binding protein 1 (TAX1BP1) and nuclear dot protein 52 kDa
(NDP52), two paralogs involved in xenophagy (13, 28, 29). This
prompted us to delete cpsA from the WT H37Rv strain of Mtb to
characterize its effect on autophagy (Fig. S2). When we infected
LC3-GFP–expressing murine bone marrow-derived macrophages
(BMDMs), we found that the ΔcpsA mutant was three times more
likely to be in an LC3-GFP+ compartment than the WT strain at 4 h
postinfection (hpi) (Fig. 1 A and B). We quantified the mean
fluorescence intensity (MFI) around individual phagosomes using
automated image analysis, as previously described in detail (24). We
found a significant shift in ΔcpsA mutant phagosomes to brighter
GFP populations compared with WT Mtb phagosomes (Fig. 1C),
which closely approximated our visual scoring. The enhanced
colocalization of the mutant with LC3-GFP was restored to WT
levels in the complemented strain (ΔcpsA::cpsA) (Fig. 1C). As
shown previously, activating macrophages with IFN-γ before in-
fection enhanced LC3 association with WT Mtb (Fig. 1D) (7, 11, 30,
31). In contrast to the marked enhancement of LC3 association with
the ΔcpsA mutant in unactivated macrophages, there was little
difference between WT and ΔcpsA in IFN-γ–activated macro-
phages (Fig. 1D). Thus, CpsA inhibited LC3-associated trafficking
specifically in unactivated macrophages.
To determine whether enhanced LC3 trafficking resulted in
increased lysosomal delivery, we quantified the colocalization of
the ΔcpsA mutant with lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1
(LAMP1), a late endosomal and lysosomal marker. We found that
LAMP1 colocalized with the ΔcpsA mutant significantly more than
it did with WT Mtb at 4 hpi, similar to what was seen when
macrophages were pretreated with IFN-γ, which promotes lyso-
somal trafficking (Fig. 1 E–G). LAMP1 colocalization was restored
to WT levels in the complemented strain (Fig. 1F). There was no
increased association of LAMP1 with the ΔcpsA mutant relative to
WT Mtb in IFN-γ–activated macrophages, again suggesting that
the altered trafficking was predominantly seen in unactivated
macrophages (Fig. 1G). To determine whether the increased
phagolysosomal trafficking depended upon autophagy proteins, we
examined LAMP1 colocalization with Mtb in macrophages ge-
netically lacking Atg5, which is required for both xenophagy and
LAP (Fig. S1). In such macrophages, the enhanced association of
LAMP1 with the ΔcpsA mutant was abrogated (Fig. 1H).
Next, we examined whether the failure of the ΔcpsA mutant
to arrest lysosomal trafficking impaired its intracellular sur-
vival. We found that the ΔcpsA mutant, which grew normally in
liquid medium (Fig. S3A), was killed by murine BMDMs,
whereas WT Mtb and the complemented strain survived (Fig.
2A). IFN-γ–naive BMDMs cleared the ΔcpsA mutant to a
similar degree as IFN-γ–activated macrophages controlled WT
Mtb. We had similar findings in human THP-1 macrophages
(Fig. 2B). To evaluate whether ΔcpsA was killed as a consequence
of lysosomal trafficking, we used previously validated siRNA
pools to deplete Ras-related protein Rab-7a (RAB7) or tumor-
susceptibility gene 101 (TSG101), which are required for phag-
osome maturation (Fig. S4) (24, 32, 33). Silencing Rab7 or
Tsg101 before infection partially restored the intracellular sur-
vival of ΔcpsA (Fig. 2 C and D and Fig. S4). Combined, these
results suggested that CpsA protects Mtb from killing by an LC3-
associated lysosomal-trafficking pathway.
CpsA Protects Mtb from LAP. Both xenophagy and LAP depend
upon a common set of factors to deliver LC3 to the phagosomal
membrane, including BECLIN1, ATG7, ATG5, and ATG16L1
(Fig. S1). To determine whether these shared factors were im-
portant in clearing the ΔcpsA mutant, we examined macrophages
in which we silenced Atg7 or that were genetically lacking Atg5,
Atg16L1, or Beclin1 for their ability to kill the ΔcpsA mutant. In
all cases, macrophages defective in these core autophagy pro-
teins were impaired in clearing the ΔcpsA mutant relative to WT
macrophages (Fig. 3 A–D and Fig. S4). These results are con-
sistent with the idea that CpsA protects Mtb from killing by an
LC3-associated lysosomal-trafficking pathway, but they do not
distinguish whether that pathway is LAP or xenophagy. Recent
studies have defined distinct genetic requirements for xenophagy
and LAP (4). Xenophagy requires the autophagy initiation ma-
chinery (ULK1, ATG14, and others), which is dispensable for
LAP, whereas LAP requires the NADPH oxidase and RUBICON
(Fig. S1). When we examined Ulk1-silenced and Atg14-deficient
macrophages, we observed a large discrepancy between WT Mtb
and ΔcpsA survival (Fig. 3 E and F and Fig. S4). In addition, Mtb
xenophagy depends upon the cGMP-AMP synthetase (cGAS)
(12, 34–36). As we found with macrophages defective in the
xenophagy-specific components ULK1 and ATG14, the intracel-
lular growth defect of the ΔcpsA mutant was not rescued in
macrophages lacking cGAS (Cgas−/−) (Fig. 3G). In addition,
whereas Atg5 deficiency reversed the enhanced association of
LAMP1 with the ΔcpsA mutant, the absence of Cgas did not (Figs.
1H and 3H). Moreover, when we examined the transcriptional
response of macrophages infected with WT or ΔcpsA, there was
no difference in the magnitude of the transcriptional response
activated by cGAS (called the “cytosolic-surveillance pathway”)
(Fig. S5). These data suggested that xenophagy and the cGAS-
dependent pathway previously characterized during Mtb infection
were not responsible for clearing the ΔcpsA mutant.
One distinction between xenophagy and LAP is the role of
RUBICON, which inhibits autophagy and is required for LAP (4,
37, 38). In macrophages in which Rubicon was genetically absent or
silenced, the attenuation of ΔcpsA was nearly completely rescued
(Fig. 3 I and J and Fig. S4), consistent with the idea that ΔcpsA is
cleared by LAP. Examining all our data together revealed that the
ΔcpsA mutant was restored to ∼80% of WT levels in macrophages
selectively impaired in LAP (Rubicon) or jointly defective in
xenophagy and LAP (Beclin, Atg5, Atg7, or Atg16L1) (Fig. 3K). In
contrast, there was little rescue of the survival of the ΔcpsA mutant
in macrophages defective only in xenophagy (Atg14, Ulk1, and
cGAS) (Fig. 3K and Fig. S1). We conclude that LAP, not
xenophagy, plays the predominant role in clearing the ΔcpsA mutant.
CpsA Acts Upstream of NADPH Oxidase. In addition to a re-
quirement for RUBICON, LAP also depends upon NADPH
oxidase and ROS (4, 5), which are not required for xenophagy. To
see if NADPH oxidase also played a role in clearing the ΔcpsA
mutant, we examined its survival in Nox2-KO macrophages, which
lack the NADPH oxidase catalytic core (gp91phox). We compared
ΔcpsA to a mutant lacking katG, which encodes a catalase-
peroxidase. As previously described, the ΔkatG mutant was
attenuated in WT macrophages and survived in Nox2-KO mac-
rophages (Fig. 4A) (39). The ΔcpsA mutant behaved similarly; it
was attenuated in WT BMDMs, and its intracellular survival was
restored in Nox2-KO macrophages (Figs. 3K and 4A), consistent
with its being cleared by LAP. In contrast, there was no rescue of
ΔcpsA in BMDMs lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS2−/−)
(Fig. 3K). However, while both ΔkatG and ΔcpsA were similarly
susceptible to NADPH oxidase inside macrophages, the ΔcpsA
mutant was not nearly as susceptible to ROS in liquid medium

(Fig. S3B). Thus, we considered the possibility that ΔcpsA might
be susceptible to NADPH oxidase because it induced more ROS
during infection. To visualize ROS, we used 2′,7′-dichlorodihy-
drofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA), a cell-permeant derivative
of fluorescein that fluoresces upon oxidation. We found that
ΔcpsA infection generated substantially more phagosomal ROS
than WT Mtb in both murine BMDMs and human THP-1 cells
(Fig. 4 B–D). The observed H2DCFDA fluorescence was de-
pendent upon ROS, as it could be blocked by diphenyleneiodo-
nium (DPI), an inhibitor of superoxide production. Moreover, the
ROS generated by ΔcpsA was attributable to NADPH oxidase, as
it was largely absent in Nox2-KO macrophages (Fig. 4C). It has
been shown previously that NADPH oxidase lies upstream of the
Atg conjugation systems in LAP (Fig. S1) (4, 40). Consistent with
Fig. 1.

those findings, Atg5 was not required for the enhanced phag-
osomal ROS generated by the ΔcpsA mutant (Fig. 4E). Since the
ΔcpsA mutant can grow in macrophages lacking Atg5 (Fig. 3B)
even though there is enhanced ROS (Fig. 4E), it suggests that
ΔcpsA is not killed by ROS alone; clearance also depends upon
the Atg conjugation system and lysosomal trafficking. Combined,
these data demonstrate that CpsA protects Mtb from NADPH
oxidase and subsequent LAP-mediated killing.
CpsA Blocks NADPH Oxidase Recruitment to Mtb Phagosomes.
NADPH oxidase is composed of two integral membrane sub-
units (p22phox and gp91phox) that form flavocytochrome b558 and
a trimeric cytosolic complex (p40phox, p47phox, and p67phox).
NADPH oxidase activity requires membrane trafficking of fla-
vocytochrome b558 from recycling endosomes (41), assembly with
the cytosolic subunits, and activation, which is contingent upon
recruitment of GTP-bound Rac1/2 (42). Since the ΔcpsA mutant
elicited more ROS, we assessed NADPH oxidase trafficking and
assembly by examining recruitment of gp91phox, p40phox, and
p47phox to mycobacterial phagosomes. We found that the ΔcpsA
mutant colocalized with the membrane and cytosolic compo-
nents of NADPH oxidase substantially more than WT Mtb (Fig.
5 A–G). As expected, the enhanced association was abrogated in
Nox2-KO BMDMs (Fig. 5 C, E, and G). In contrast, enhanced
colocalization of the NADPH oxidase with the ΔcpsA mutant did
not depend upon Atg5 (Fig. 5 H–J), corroborating that ROS
generation did not depend upon the Atg conjugation system
(Fig. 4E). These findings demonstrate that CpsA blocks NADPH
oxidase recruitment to the mycobacterial phagosome.
CpsA Is Sufficient to Inhibit Phagosomal NADPH Oxidase Recruitment.
CpsA belongs to the LCP family of proteins that are implicated
in cell-wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. Recent work
demonstrated that in Actinobacteria LCP family members ligate
AG to PGN (21, 22). In Mtb, there are two other full-length LCP
members in addition to CpsA. Rv3267 plays the dominant role in
cell-wall biogenesis, while CpsA is thought to have a minor role.
Using GC/MS, we verified a slight decrease in AG attachment to
PGN in the ΔcpsA mutant in our strain background, as had been
seen in the CDC1551 strain background (Table S1). However,
this did not result in substantial differences in growth under a
variety of stress conditions (Fig. S3 B–F), as also is consistent
with previous findings in the CDC1551 strain background (21).
Although the ΔcpsA mutant appeared to have only a mild cell-
wall defect, we considered the possibility that even a mild per-
turbation in the cell wall might expose more pathogen-associated
molecular patterns (PAMPs), rendering the ΔcpsA mutant
hyperinflammatory and driving LAP. Since a number of Mtb
Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) ligands are exported lipoproteins,
we examined whether there was a difference in the proteins shed
by the ΔcpsA mutant in culture filtrate compared with WT and
the complemented strain. Mass spectrometry-based label-free quan-
titative analysis of the culture filtrate revealed no statistically signifi-
cant differences except CpsA itself (Fig. S6). Since activation by other
PAMPs was also possible, we next compared the transcriptional
signature of uninfected macrophages with those infected with the
ΔcpsA mutant and WT Mtb. At 4 hpi, thousands of genes were
differentially regulated between uninfected and infected macro-
phages. However, using a false-discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.05,
only one gene was differentially expressed between WT and ΔcpsA–
infected macrophages (TMA16, adjusted P = 0.04). Nonetheless,
Kyto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway anal-
ysis revealed a difference in the “Tuberculosis” response pathway
between WT and ΔcpsA–infected macrophages, which largely
reflected a difference in expression of NF-κB–regulated genes (Fig.
S5B). However, contrary to our idea that the ΔcpsA mutant might
drive LAP by virtue of being hyperinflammatory, the ΔcpsA mutant
elicited a diminished NF-κB response (Fig. S5 B–D).
Since enhanced PAMP signaling from an altered cell wall did
not appear to explain ΔcpsA’s ability to increase LAP, we won-
dered whether CpsA’s role in virulence reflected a function in-
dependent of its activity on the cell wall. To determine whether
CpsA was sufficient to alter intracellular trafficking in macro-
phages, we expressed a CpsA-GFP fusion protein in RAW264.7 cells,
a murine macrophage cell line. CpsA has a putative signal peptide
and is found in the culture filtrate as well as the cell envelope (Fig.
S2) (25–27). We expressed CpsA without its putative signal peptide
to mimic what would be exported from the bacteria and could gain
access to the mammalian cell. As a control, we expressed a chlor-
amphenicol acetyltransferase-fusion protein (CAT-GFP). We in-
cubated macrophages expressing CpsA-GFP or CAT-GFP with
zymosan, which has previously been shown to recruit the NADPH
oxidase and traffic through the LAP pathway (4). We found that
CpsA dramatically impaired recruitment of p47phox and p40phox to
zymosan-containing phagosomes as well as their delivery to a
LAMP1+ compartment (Fig. 6 A–F). Thus, CpsA is sufficient to in-
hibit recruitment of NADPH oxidase to fungal cargo and to block
lysosomal trafficking, demonstrating an activity beyond cell-wall
biogenesis. Moreover, when the transfected macrophages were in-
fected with the ΔcpsA mutant, CpsA expression inhibited recruitment
of NADPH oxidase to ΔcpsA-mutant phagosomes and partially
rescued the intracellular survival defect of the mutant, while WT Mtb
infection was not altered (Fig. 6 G and H). Combined, these data
support the idea that CpsA functions by acting on the host cell rather
than the mycobacterial envelop to alter intracellular trafficking.
CpsA Protects Mtb in Vivo. To assess whether cpsA is required in
vivo, we infected C57BL/6 mice with WT or ΔcpsA via low-dose
aerosol. After 17 d of infection, there was more than a two-log
reduction in cfu of ΔcpsA compared with WT Mtb in the lungs,
along with diminished consolidation in the lungs and defective
dissemination to the spleen (Fig. 7 A–C). Virulence was restored
to the ΔcpsA mutant by introduction of cpsA under control of its

native promoter (Fig. 7 A–C). Because the ΔcpsA mutant was
attenuated early in infection, it suggested that Mtb requires
CpsA to survive the innate immune response, consistent with our
findings in macrophages. To further evaluate this, we infected
SCID mice, which lack an adaptive immune response. Eight
weeks postinfection, all mice infected with a strain producing
CpsA died, whereas all ΔcpsA-infected mice survived (Fig. 7D).
Twenty weeks postinfection, we euthanized two of the ΔcpsA-
infected mice to examine the bacterial burden. Remarkably, we
could not recover any bacilli from the lungs. The remaining
ΔcpsA-infected mice were thriving 32 wk postinfection. These
results demonstrate that the innate immune response controls
the ΔcpsA mutant in vivo, whereas WT Mtb resists the innate
immune response, proliferates, and kills the host.
Previous work showed that catalase-deficient Mtb (ΔkatG)
grows equivalently to WT during the first 2 wk of infection in mice,
indicating that the bacilli are not experiencing oxidative stress
during this time. This observation led McKinney and colleagues to
speculate that delivery of NADPH oxidase to Mtb phagosomes is
blocked during acute infection (39). Our in vitro data suggested
that this might be mediated by CpsA. To determine whether CpsA
protects Mtb from NADPH oxidase during acute infection in vivo,

we infected Nox2-KO mice with the ΔcpsA mutant and compared
cfu in the lungs of these mice with that of C57BL/6 mice 17 d
postinfection. We found that ΔcpsA grew 0.5 log more in the
Nox2-KO mice than in WT mice (Fig. 7E), while Nox2 did not
significantly affect WT Mtb. There was a trend toward increased
growth of WT Mtb in mice lacking Atg5 in the myeloid com-
partment (Atg5flox/flox LysM-Cre+) compared with control animals,
while no difference was observed in mice lacking Atg7 (Atg7flox/flox
LysM-Cre+), consistent with findings by Kimmey et al. (8). In both
Atg5 and Atg7 mutants, we observed partial rescue of the ΔcpsA
mutant compared with Cre−littermate controls (Fig. 7 F and G).
Finally, in keeping with our in vitro data, Atg14 (Atg14flox/flox LysM-
Cre+) and cGAS-deficient mice failed to rescue the ΔcpsA mutant
(Fig. 7 H and I). Overall, our data demonstrate that CpsA protects
Mtb from NADPH oxidase and LAP in macrophages and mice.
Discussion
Mtb activates PRRs such as TLR2 and C-type lectin receptors
(CLRs) but resists immune control from NADPH oxidase and
LAP, which are normally activated by these PRRs. Our findings
establish a role for CpsA in evading these antimicrobial path-
ways. Our results are consistent with previous work showing that
NADPH oxidase fails to assemble on the mycobacterial phag-
osome and that the oxidative burst to Mtb is marginal (39, 43).
Previous studies also suggested that Mtb inhibits NADPH oxidase
in vivo during acute infection, since catalase-deficient Mtb grow
normally during that time (39). Our data demonstrate that CpsA is
a significant mediator of Mtb’s resistance to NADPH oxidase and
LAP in vivo, as the growth of the mutant is improved in mice
deficient in Nox2 or lacking Atg5 or Atg7 in hematopoietic cells, all
of which are required for LAP. While recent work has called into
question the role of autophagy in Mtb pathogenesis (8), our
findings suggest that Atg proteins involved in LAP are poised to
play a role but are subverted by the pathogen.
NAPDH oxidase and LAP are crucial in the battle of host and
pathogen, and our data demonstrate that CpsA plays an im-
portant role in Mtb’s ability to disarm the innate immune system.
The ΔcpsA mutant is highly attenuated early during infection
before the initiation of an adaptive immune response, and, re-
markably, SCID mice do not succumb to infection. Our data
highlight that even though Mtb is relatively resistant to ROS by
virtue of catalase, NADPH oxidase plays an additional role in
bacterial control by activating a potent lysosomal-trafficking
pathway. The importance of blocking LAP is demonstrated by
other pathogens as well. The growth of Salmonella typhimurium
is restricted by LAP (40), and Aspergillus and Leishmania inhibit
LAP (44, 45). In addition, a number of pathogens inhibit NADPH
oxidase (46–49), although the link to LAP has not been clearly
established. Even though Mtb can inhibit NADPH oxidase and
LC3-trafficking systems, it must do so imperfectly, as these host
mechanisms still play an important role in defense. For example,
individuals with chronic granulomatous disease who have muta-
tions in NADPH oxidase have increased susceptibility to myco-
bacterial diseases (50). We speculate that there may also be rare
individuals who are relatively resistant to infection because Mtb
cannot disarm their NADPH oxidase and LAP pathway.
Interestingly, the ΔcpsA mutant is less attenuated over time in
mice (Fig. 7A), and it survives similarly to WT Mtb in activated
macrophages (Fig. 2 A and B). These findings suggest that once
an adaptive immune response is initiated, different bacterial ef-
fectors compensate for the loss of cpsA or, alternatively, NADPH
oxidase and LAP take on a less important role during chronic
infection. We favor the idea that NADPH oxidase and LAP
become less important as iNOS and canonical autophagy are

stimulated under the influence of proinflammatory cytokines. At
the same time, there would presumably be a corresponding shift
in the virulence factors that Mtb needs to persist. Interestingly,
two bacterial factors that impair Mtb autophagy in vitro, Eis and
PE_PGRS47, do not play a role in acute infection in mice (16,
17). The PE_PGRS47-KO strain is attenuated during chronic
infection, perhaps reflecting a switch from LAP to canonical
autophagy as a dominant host response in the transition from
acute to chronic infection.
CpsA is absent from nonpathogenic mycobacteria, so it ap-
pears that duplication of an LCP protein allowed CpsA to ac-
quire an additional role in virulence. The evolution of critical
virulence factors from proteins that play a basic role in bacterial
physiology in environmental mycobacteria is a recurrent theme
in Mtb pathogenesis, perhaps reflecting the lack of horizontal
gene transfer. In Mycobacterium marinum, the close relative of
Mtb, a cpsA transposon mutant is also defective in arresting
phagosome maturation in macrophages and is attenuated in
zebrafish (51). Interestingly, however, in M. marinum cpsA seems
to have a prominent role in cell-wall biology that is starkly di-
minished in Mtb. The M. marinum cpsA mutant has numerous
phenotypes associated with a cell-wall defect, including an in
vitro growth defect, altered colony morphology, excess clumpi-
ness, increased susceptibility to certain antibiotics, and enhanced
uptake into macrophages (51). The Mtb ΔcpsA mutant did not
exhibit any of these phenotypes in our studies (Fig. 2 A and B
and Figs. S3A, S4 F–I, and S7), nor did we find differences in
cell-wall extractable lipids or biofilm formation (Figs. S7D and
S8). Likewise, it was recently reported that the ΔcpsA mutant in
the CDC1551 strain background did not exhibit significant dif-
ferences in growth, cording, antibiotic susceptibility, or total
lipids, mycolic acids, or cell-wall polysaccharides (21). Thus,
CpsA may play a diminished role in cell-wall biogenesis in Mtb
compared with M. marinum. Another explanation for the dif-
ferences is that the M. marinum mutation is caused by a trans-
poson insertion between the LCP and LytR domains, whereas
the Mtb studies used complete deletions. Thus, it is also possible
that the prominent cell-wall defects in M. marinum are a con-
sequence of an aberrant, truncated CpsA protein.
It remains to be determined how CpsA impairs NADPH oxi-
dase recruitment and LAP. It is possible that it does so as a
consequence of its cell-wall function. There is precedence for
such a possibility: in Aspergillus melanin inhibits recruitment of
the p22phox subunit of the NADPH oxidase to germinating conidia,

thereby protecting them from LAP (44). The most straightfor-
ward explanation for the macrophage phenotype of the ΔcpsA
mutant would be that loss of cell-wall integrity results in en-
hanced PRR signaling, driving LAP. However, our data argue
against that possibility. First, the cell wall-associated phenotypes
of ΔcpsA are subtle, and there were no differences in the pro-
teins shed into culture filtrate by the ΔcpsA mutant, arguing
against a major disruption to the cell wall. This does not rule out
a cell-wall role, but if CpsA inhibits LAP through a cell-wall
mechanism, it must carry out an immunologically important
but structurally minor modification. Importantly, however, we
did not detect any increase in host signaling pathways in response
to the ΔcpsA mutant to suggest that TLR or CLR signaling were
enhanced. In fact, we found the opposite, which may reflect the
known ability of NADPH oxidase to negatively regulate NF-κB
signaling (52). Thus, CpsA is likely to inhibit LAP downstream of
PRRs, raising the possibility that CpsA blocks NADPH oxidase
independently of its cell-wall activity. Consistent with this, we
found that CpsA dramatically inhibited NADPH oxidase re-
cruitment to zymosan particles, strongly supporting that idea that
CpsA has a function independent of the cell wall. In addition,
CpsA expression in macrophages partially restored survival of
the ΔcpsA mutant, arguing that any potential cell-wall defect is
not the sole basis of its attenuation.
LCP domain-containing proteins are found in nearly all Gram-
positive bacteria, but the paradigm that they play a role in cell-
envelope biogenesis is derived from only a few studies. Individual
bacterial species can contain up to 11 LCP proteins, and there is at
least one example in which an LCP protein serves as a glycosyl
transferase that modifies a protein, not PGN (53). Thus, we favor the
idea that CpsA has repurposed the LCP domain’s transferase activity
to target the host. Exactly how CpsA blocks LAP and its relationship
to NDP52 and/or TAX1BP1 binding (24) are under investigation.
In conclusion, our studies reveal that Mtb evades LAP, which
unexpectedly depends upon the LCP protein, CpsA. Since Mtb
strains that induce more ROS or LC3-associated pathways cor-
relate with more favorable treatment outcomes (54, 55), CpsA
might be an effective drug target, which could work in concert
with host-directed therapies aimed at increasing LC3-trafficking
pathways. Moreover, inhibitors that block multiple LCP family
members would be particularly attractive therapies, since they
would undermine both cell-wall homeostasis and virulence.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions. Mtb strain H37Rv was used to generate
ΔcpsA, ΔcpsA::cpsA, and ΔkatG. Mtb strains were grown at 37 °C in 7H9 medium
(Middlebrook 7H9 broth; Difco) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80 (Sigma),
BBL Middlebrook OADC Enrichment, and 0.2% glycerol (Sigma). The unmarked
ΔkatG strain was a gift from W. Jacobs, Jr., Albert Einstein College of Medicine,
New York. Middlebrook 7H10 or 7H11 agar (BD) was used for growth on solid
medium. ΔcpsA strain construction and antibiotic selection for plasmids are de-
scribed in SI Materials and Methods. Lysozyme, hydrogen peroxide, nitric oxide,
and SDS treatments are described in SI Materials and Methods.

Macrophages. Murine hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from the tibia
and femurs of 6- to 15-wk-old C57BL/6 mice (unless otherwise noted) as
described in SI Materials and Methods. THP-1 cells (American Type Culture
Collection) and RAW264.7 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were
grown as described in SI Materials and Methods. RNAi-mediated silencing
was performed as described in SI Materials and Methods.
Microscopy. Macrophages were infected with GFP- or DsRed-expressing Mtb
strains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of ∼5. After 4 h, macrophages were
washed and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde/PBS overnight. Immunostaining,
ROS visualization, and image acquisition were performed as described in SI
Materials and Methods.
For the zymosan-trafficking assay, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with
CpsA-GFP or CAT-GFP (as control) as described in SI Materials and Methods.
The transfected macrophages were challenged with Zymosan A Bioparticle
Alexa Fluor 594 conjugate (Z23374; Molecular Probes, Life Technologies).
Immunostaining, image acquisition, and analysis are described in SI Mate-
rials and Methods.
Intracellular Bacterial Survival Assays. To assess Mtb survival in vitro, BMDMs
from C57BL/6 mice, unless otherwise specified, were seeded 1 d before in-
fection and infected with a single-cell suspension of Mtb at a MOI of ∼3, as
previously described (24) and detailed in SI Materials and Methods. RAW264.7
cells were used when macrophages were transfected with CpsA as described
in SI Materials and Methods.
Protein Extracts, Western Blotting, Mass Spectrometry, and RNA-Sequencing.
Preparation of protein extracts, Western blotting, mass spectrometry, and
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) are described in SI Materials and Methods.
In Vivo Bacterial Infection. Mice (8–15 wk old) were infected by aerosol with
Mtb using the inhalation exposure system from Glas-Col as described in SI
Materials and Methods. Male and female mice were used except in the case
of the Nox2-KO mice, for which hemizygous mutant males were compared
with WT males. Approximately 100 cfus were administered per animal, ex-
cept in the case of SCID mice, to which ∼20 cfu were delivered.
Generation of Anti-CpsA Antisera. To generate polyclonal antisera against Mtb
CpsA, 250 μg of recombinant CpsA (amino acids 51–512) was produced in
Escherichia coli and injected into rabbits using TiterMax Gold adjuvant
(TiterMax), followed by boosts with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant contain-
ing 125 μg purified CpsA (Covance).
Glycosyl Composition of Cell Walls (Table S1). Cell walls from Mtb grown to log
phase were hydrolyzed with 2 M trifluoroacetic acid, and the derived alditol
acetates were subjected to GC/MS as described (21).
Statistical Analysis. The unpaired, two-tailed Student’s t test, one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, or Mann–Whitney test were
used to assess the statistical significance of the comparison of experimental
groups using GraphPad Prism software (www.graphpad.com). For analysis of
Kaplan–Meier curves, the Mantel–Cox (log-rank) survival analysis was used.
Violin plots were generated using ggplot2.
