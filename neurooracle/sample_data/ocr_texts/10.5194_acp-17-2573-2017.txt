Abstract. Knowledge of aerosol chemistry in densely popu-
lated regions is critical for effective reduction of air pollution,
while such studies have not been conducted in Changzhou,
an important manufacturing base and populated city in the
Yangtze River Delta (YRD), China. This work, for the ﬁrst
time, performed a thorough chemical characterization on
the ﬁne particulate matter (PM2.5) samples, collected dur-
ing July 2015 to April 2016 across four seasons in this
city. A suite of analytical techniques was employed to mea-
sure the organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), water-
soluble organic carbon (WSOC), water-soluble inorganic
ions (WSIIs), trace elements, and polycyclic aromatic hy-
drocarbons (PAHs) in PM2.5; in particular, an Aerodyne
soot particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SP-AMS) was de-
ployed to probe the chemical properties of water-soluble or-
ganic aerosol (WSOA). The average PM2.5 concentration
was found to be 108.3 µg m−3, and all identiﬁed species
were able to reconstruct ∼80 % of the PM2.5 mass. The
WSIIs occupied about half of the PM2.5 mass (∼52.1 %),
with SO2−
4 , NO−
3 , and NH+
4 as the major ions. On aver-
age, nitrate concentrations dominated over sulfate (mass ra-
tio of 1.21), indicating that trafﬁc emissions were more im-
portant than stationary sources. OC and EC correlated well
with each other and the highest OC / EC ratio (5.16) oc-
curred in winter, suggesting complex OC sources likely in-
cluding both secondary and primary ones. Concentrations of
eight trace elements (Mn, Zn, Al, B, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb) can con-
tribute up to ∼5.0 % of PM2.5 during winter. PAH concentra-
tions were also high in winter (140.25 ng m−3), which were
predominated by median/high molecular weight PAHs with
ﬁve and six rings. The organic matter including both water-
soluble and water-insoluble species occupied ∼21.5 % of the
PM2.5 mass. SP-AMS determined that the WSOA had av-
erage atomic oxygen-to-carbon (O / C), hydrogen-to-carbon
(H / C), nitrogen-to-carbon (N / C), and organic matter-to-
organic carbon (OM / OC) ratios of 0.54, 1.69, 0.11, and
1.99, respectively. Source apportionment of WSOA further
identiﬁed two secondary OA (SOA) factors (a less oxidized
and a more oxidized oxygenated OA) and two primary OA
(POA) factors (a nitrogen-enriched hydrocarbon-like trafﬁc
OA and a local primary OA likely including species from
cooking, coal combustion, etc.). On average, the POA contri-
bution outweighed SOA (55 % vs. 45 %), indicating the im-
portant role of local anthropogenic emissions in the aerosol
pollution in Changzhou. Our measurement also shows the
abundance of organic nitrogen species in WSOA, and the
source analyses suggest these species are likely associated
with trafﬁc emissions, which warrants more investigations on
PM samples from other locations.

Introduction
Aerosol particles are ubiquitous in the atmosphere and play
important roles in air quality, global climate, the biogeo-
chemical cycle, human health, etc. (e.g., Heal et al., 2012;
Cao et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2015). Aerosol pollution can also
inﬂuence remote territories via long-range transport. There-
fore, atmospheric aerosol has received extensive attention
from the government, the public, and academia (e.g., Zhang
et al., 2007a; Jimenez et al., 2009). In particular, much atten-
tion has focused on ﬁne particles (PM2.5, aerodynamic di-
ameters less than 2.5 µm), as they can go deeper into the res-
piratory system, causing more severe health problems than
coarse particles (Anderson et al., 2012). However, the con-
centrations, sources, chemical compositions, and formation
mechanisms of PM2.5 are complicated and can vary greatly
with meteorological conditions, seasons, regional/local to-
pography, etc. PM2.5 can contain a variety of species, i.e.,
organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), trace elements,
inorganic salts, and various organic species such as poly-
cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) (e.g., Wang et al.,
2015). In China, haze pollution has occurred frequently in
recent years, and a large number of studies regarding the
chemical characterization of ﬁne particles were carried out
in many locations (G. Wang et al., 2006), such as Shang-
hai (e.g., G. Wang et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2015), Beijing
(e.g., Sun et al., 2014, 2016; Hu et al., 2016), Nanjing (e.g.,
Zhang et al., 2016; Ding et al., 2013), Lanzhou (e.g., Fan et
al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014), Wuhan (e.g., Huang et al., 2016),
and other remote sites (Xu et al., 2015).
The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, located in eastern
China, is experiencing severe atmospheric pollution along
with the rapid economic development. Some studies carried
out in the YRD investigated different characteristics of the
ﬁne aerosols, including the mass loading, composition, hy-
groscopicity (e.g., Ye et al., 2011; Ge et al., 2015), size dis-
tribution, seasonal variation, source, formation pathway, and
their impacts on visibility and climate (e.g., Wang et al.,
2012). However, these studies were mostly limited to Nan-
jing (e.g., Hu et al., 2012; Y. Wang et al., 2016) and Shanghai
(e.g., Fu et al., 2012; Qiao et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2012).
Changzhou, situated in the western YRD region, between
Shanghai and Nanjing, is also a major city and an impor-
tant manufacturing base due to its geographical advantage.
The city has an area of about 4374 km2 with a population of
4.45 million. Due to elevated emissions of various pollutants,
the number of hazy days increased over the past few years in
Changzhou as well. To the best of our knowledge, no work
has been published speciﬁcally on chemical characteristics
and source apportionment of ﬁne particles in Changzhou.
Thus, it is scientiﬁcally and practically important to inves-
tigate the PM2.5 characteristics in order to provide efﬁcient
control strategies to reduce the PM pollution for Changzhou.
Among various PM2.5 constituents, organic aerosol (OA)
is a vital component, accounting for a signiﬁcant, even dom-
inant, fraction of PM2.5 in ambient air (Zhang et al., 2007a).
Thus, elucidation of its composition, properties, and sources
is essential. Correct apportionment of OA into different
sources is a critical step towards enabling efﬁcient air pol-
lution control strategies. Recently, Aerodyne aerosol mass
spectrometry (AMS) has been used extensively for quanti-
tatively characterizing ambient OA, and the wealth of mass
spectral data allows a better source analysis of OA (Cana-
garatna et al., 2007). In particular, positive matrix factor-
ization (PMF), as a standard multivariate factor analysis
method, has been widely applied to AMS datasets to dis-
tinguish and quantify the OA sources (Zhang et al., 2011).
Many previous studies (e.g., Ge et al., 2012a; Ng et al., 2011)
have deployed the AMS for online ﬁeld measurements since
AMS can provide real-time information on mass concentra-
tions and size distributions of aerosol particles with very ﬁne
time resolutions (several seconds to minutes). However, up to
now, AMS has typically been used for online measurements,
and only a few studies have made efforts to apply it to ofﬂine
ﬁlter sample analyses and source apportionment (Ge et al.,
2014; Daellenbach et al., 2016; Y. Sun et al., 2011; Bozzetti
et al., 2017; Mihara and Mochida, 2011; Huang et al., 2014;
Xu et al., 2015).
In this study, for the ﬁrst time, we systematically investi-
gated the chemical characteristics of ambient PM2.5 collected
in Changzhou across a nearly 1-year period, providing an
overview of the concentrations of PM2.5, water-soluble in-
organic ions (WSIIs), trace elements, carbonaceous species,
water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), PAHs, and the re-
lationships between these components. Seasonal variations
of different PM2.5 components were also discussed. Further-
more, we employed an Aerodyne soot particle aerosol mass
spectrometer (SP-AMS) (Onasch et al., 2012; Lee et al.,
2015; J. Wang et al., 2016b) to investigate the properties and
potential sources of OA on the basis of high-resolution mass
spectra determined by the SP-AMS. Findings from this study
also add knowledge to the framework of the Pan-Eurasian
Experiment (PEEX) (Kulmala et al., 2015).

Experiments
2.1
Sampling site and PM2.5 collection
The sampling site was set on the rooftop of a nine-story
building inside the campus of Jiangsu University of Technol-
ogy in Changzhou (31.7◦N, 119.9◦E), as shown in Fig. 1.
This site is located in the southwestern part of Changzhou,
surrounded by a residential area, approximately 0.5 km away
from an urban street, Zhongwu Road, and has no direct inﬂu-
ences from industrial emissions (14.7 km away from the clos-
est industrial plant – Bao Steel). Meteorological parameters
including temperature, relative humidity (RH), wind speed
(WS), wind direction (WD), and concentrations of gas-phase
species such as SO2 and NO2 are recorded by the air quality

monitoring station inside the campus, which is about 500 m
away from the site. The average meteorological parameters
of four seasons are shown in Table 1. The wind rose plots
of different seasons are shown in Fig. S1 in the Supplement.
The wind speed was generally low in Changzhou (on aver-
age, 1.1, 1.6, 0.9, and 0.9 m s−1 in spring, summer, fall, and
winter, respectively).
PM2.5 were collected onto 90 mm quartz ﬁber ﬁlters
(Whatman, QM-A) using a medium volume sampler (TH-
150 C, Wuhan Tianhong Ltd., China) with a ﬂow rate of
100 L min−1. The ﬁlters, wrapped in aluminum foil, were
prebaked at 450 ◦C for 4 h prior to sampling. The sampler
began to collect particles at 09:00 and stopped at 05:00
of the following day, ensuring a duration time for each
sample of 20 h. A total of 69 PM2.5 samples were col-
lected: 20 July–19 August 2015 (summer, 11 samples),
18 September–25 October 2015 (fall, 23 samples), 7 De-
cember 2015–15 January 2016 (winter, 24 samples), and
1 March–12 April 2016 (spring, 11 samples).
Before and after sampling, the ﬁlters were conditioned un-
der constant temperature (22 ± 1 ◦C) and relative humidity
(45 ± 5 %) for 48 h and weighted by a microbalance (preci-
sion of 0.01 mg). The ﬁlters were then wrapped and sealed in
aluminum foil envelopes separately, and stored in a freezer
at −20 ◦C until analysis. Note that ﬁlter-based measurements
are inevitably subjected to various sampling artifacts, includ-
ing evaporation of semi-volatile species and absorption of
gases. Nitrate in the form of ammonium nitrate may have
some evaporation loss as it is sensitive to temperature varia-
tions during sampling, and absorption of gases may inﬂuence
the quantiﬁcation of particle-bound polycyclic aromatic hy-
drocarbons (PAHs).

Chemical analysis
2.2.1
IC analysis
One-quarter of a ﬁlter was put into a glass tube and
25 mL deionized water (18.2 M cm−1) was then added. Af-
ter 45 min ultrasonic extraction, the solution was ﬁltrated
through an acetate-cellulose ﬁlter with 0.45 µm pore size.
Concentrations of the WSIIs in the aqueous extract, includ-
ing ﬁve anions (F−, Cl−, NO−
2 , NO−
3 , SO2−
4 ) and ﬁve cations
(Na+, NH+
4 , K+, Mg2+, Ca2+), were then measured by the
ion chromatograph (IC, Dionex ICS-600 for anions and ICS-
1500 for cations). The method detection limits (MDLs) were
determined to be 18.0, 7.3, 5.2, 6.3, 11.0, 18.7, 3.3, 4.6, 2.6,
and 11.5 µg L−1 for F−, Cl−, NO−
2 , NO−
3 , SO2−
4 , Na+, NH+
4 ,
K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, respectively, and all measured con-
centrations were above the MDLs. Note that the ﬁlter blanks
were treated in the same way, and all data for the samples
reported here were blank corrected; other analyses in the
following sections were also blank corrected unless speci-
ﬁed. The concentrations of all measured species in the PM2.5
sample were also converted to µg m−3 based on the mea-
sured concentrations and the air volume pulled through the
ﬁlter. The uncertainty of the IC measurements, calculated as
3 times the standard deviation of replicate measurements of
blank ﬁlters, is shown in Table 2.
2.2.2
ICP-OES analysis
Another quarter of a ﬁlter was cut and placed in a Teﬂon
vessel, digested with a 10 mL mixture of HNO3–HCl (1 : 1,
v : v) in a microwave system (XT-9900A, Shanghai Xintuo
Co.) for 45 min. After the digested solution cooled down to
room temperature, it was ﬁltered through a 0.45 µm acetate-
cellulose ﬁlter. The ﬁltrate was then diluted using deionized
water to 50 mL, and analyzed using Optima 8000 (Perkin
Elmer, USA) inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectrometry (ICP-OES) to determine the concentrations of
eight trace elements (Mn, Zn, Al, B, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb). It is
worth mentioning that we also tried to measure the concen-
trations of other trace elements such as Ti, Ni, and Ba, but
found that they were mostly below the detection limits, and
thus were not included in this work. All samples were deter-
mined in triplicate, and a difference within 5 % was consid-
ered acceptable. Measurement uncertainties for trace metals

2.2.3
OC / EC and WSOC analysis
The analysis procedure of OC / EC was similar to a previous
study (Zhao et al., 2015) . Brieﬂy, OC and EC were measured
by the DRI model 2001 thermal/optical carbon analyzer (At-
moslytic Inc., Calabasas, CA) using a 0.526 cm2 ﬁlter punch
for each sample, following the IMPROVE TOR protocol
(Chow et al., 2004). The ﬁlter was measured stepwise at tem-
peratures of 140 ◦C (OC1), 280 ◦C (OC2), 480 ◦C (OC3), and
580 ◦C (OC4) under a helium atmosphere, and 580 ◦C (EC1),
740 ◦C (EC2), and 840 ◦C (EC3) under a 2 % oxygen/98 %
helium atmosphere. OC is calculated as OC1+ OC2+ OC3+
OC4+ OP and EC as EC1+ EC2+ EC3−OP, where OP is
the optical pyrolyzed OC. The detection limit of OC was es-
timated to be 30–80 ng m−3 and EC was ∼30 ng m−3 based
on a previous study (Mirante et al., 2014).
The WSOC concentrations were determined by a TOC an-
alyzer (TOC-L, Shimazu, Japan) using a thermos-catalytic
oxidation approach. Instrument details and the procedure of
the WSOC analysis can be found in our previous work (Ge
et al., 2014). The MDL was 5.0 µg L−1 and measurement un-
certainties ranged from 3.4 to 6.0 %.
2.2.4
GC-MS analysis for particulate PAHs
Due to the limitation of samples, we only analyzed PAHs
for spring and winter samples. The analysis was conducted
following the standard procedure, similar to the work of
Szabó et al. (2015). One-quarter of a ﬁlter was treated by
Soxhelt extraction for 18 h using a 250 mL mixture of n-
hexane/ethylether (5 : 1, v/v). To determine the recovery
rates, 100 ng of deuterated surrogate standard solution con-
taining naphthalene-d8 and perylene-d12 (o2si, USA) was
added to the sample prior to extraction, and the average re-
covery rates of d8 and d12 were over 90 %. The extracts
were then concentrated to about 2 mL by a rotary evap-
orator, puriﬁed in a chromatography column (ﬁlled with
3 cm deactivated Al2O3, 10 g silica gel, and 2 cm deactivated
Na2SO4). The column was ﬁrst eluted with 25 mL n-hexane
and the eluate was discarded; then elution was carried out us-
ing 30 mL dichloromethane / n-hexane (1 : 1, v : v). Samples
containing PAHs were again concentrated to about 2 mL by
the rotary evaporation. Finally they were condensed to ex-
actly 1 mL under a gentle N2 steam in a 60 ◦C water bath.
The extracts are transferred into ampoule bottles and stored
in a refrigerator until analysis.
The PAH compounds in the ﬁnal extracts were analyzed
with a gas chromatography mass spectrometer (GC-MS)
(Agilent 7890-7000B, USA), using a DB-5ms capillary col-
umn (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.5 µm). The instrument conditions
were set as follows: injector at 200 ◦C; ion source at 230 ◦C;
the column was programmed at 40 ◦C for 2 min, then in-
creased to 100 ◦C at a rate of 10 ◦C min−1, held for 1 min,
then increased to 250 ◦C at 20 ◦C min−1, and ﬁnally held for
3 min at 250 ◦C. The mass selective detector was operated in
the electron impact mode using 70 eV. Multi-reaction moni-
tor modes were employed for the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁ-
cation of PAHs.
Before sample analysis, calibration standards at a se-
ries of concentrations were prepared from an aromatic
hydrocarbon standard (O2si, USA) containing 18 PAH
compounds (1000 mg L−1), which are naphthalene (NaP)
(C10H8), acenaphthylene (Acy) (C12H8), acenaphthene
(Ace) (C12H10), ﬂuorene (Flu) (C13H10), phenanthrene (Phe)
(C14H10), anthracene (Ant) (C14H10), ﬂuoranthene (Flua)
(C16H10), pyrene (Pyr) (C16H10), benzo(a)anthracene (BaA)
(C18H12), chrysene (Chr) (C18H12), benzo(b)ﬂuoranthene
(BbF) (C20H12), benzo(k)ﬂuoranthene (BkF) (C20H12),
benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) (C20H12), Benzo(e)pyrene (BeP)
(C20H12), benzo(j)ﬂuoranthene (BjF) (C20H12), benzop-
erylene (BghiP) (C22H12)
indeno(1,2,3-cd)pyrene (InP)
(C22H12),
and
dibenz(a,h)anthracene
(DBA)
(C22H14).
These PAHs can be classiﬁed by the number of aromatic
rings and molecular weights: low molecular weight (LMW)
PAHs containing two and three rings (NaP, Acy, Ace, Flu,
Phe, Ant), medium molecular weight (MMW) PAHs con-
taining four rings (Flua, Pyr, BaA, Chr), and high molecu-
lar weight (HMW) PAHs containing ﬁve and six rings (BbF,
BkF, BjF, BaP, BeP, InP, DBA, BghiP) (Wang et al., 2015;
Kong et al., 2015). The calibration was conducted twice prior

to analysis. Identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of each PAH are
based on its retention time and peak areas in the calibra-
tion curve and sample curve, and the total PAH concentration
(6PAH) was calculated as the sum of concentrations of all 18
individual PAHs. Figure S2 shows examples of the GC-MS
spectra of a few of the 18 PAH standards and two surrogate
standards (d8 and d12).
2.2.5
Ofﬂine SP-AMS analysis
The Aerodyne AMS is specially designed for online and real-
time measurements of the submicron aerosol particles. The
instrument has a very ﬁne time resolution and thus is pow-
erful in capturing the quick atmospheric processes that oc-
curred in the real atmosphere, while in this study we used the
SP-AMS for ofﬂine ﬁlter sample analyses. Compared with
the online measurements, there are a few advantages: (1) it
can greatly expand the application of the AMS because it is
often unrealistic to deploy the AMS for very long periods, as
it requires highly skilled personal to carefully maintain and
operate the instrument; (2) for some sites, it is not accessi-
ble or not suitable for AMS deployment; (3) AMS analysis
of organics can provide more details, for instance the ele-
mental composition and oxidation states, and thus can offer
useful insights into the origin of OA; (4) ofﬂine analysis may
introduce artifacts compared with the online measurements,
but on the other hand, it also expands the size range, as on-
line measurements were often limited in the submicron meter
range.
The SP-AMS analysis procedure for ofﬂine ﬁlters was
similar to that of Xu et al. (2013). Brieﬂy, for each sam-
ple, a 1/4 ﬁlter was extracted in 25 mL deionized water.
The liquid extracts were aerosolized using an atomizer (TSI,
Model 3076) and the mist passed through a silica-gel diffu-
sion dryer, leaving dry particles which were subsequently an-
alyzed by the SP-AMS. Note that the SP-AMS was operated
with the laser off, similarly to other AMS measurements; it
measured non-refractory organic species that can vaporize
fast at the oven temperature of 600 ◦C. The instrument em-
ploys the 70 eV electron impact (EI) ion generation scheme;
all vaporized species were broken into ion fragments with
speciﬁc mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios, and the time-of-ﬂight
mass spectrometer outputs the mass spectrum that records
the ions according to their signal intensities at different
m/z ratios. Ion fragments with m/z up to 300 amu were ana-
lyzed in this study. The SP-AMS mass spectra can well rep-
resent the total OA constituents, and the bulk OA properties
such as elemental ratios including oxygen-to-carbon (O / C),
hydrogen-to-carbon (H / C), and nitrogen-to-carbon (N / C)
ratios, and the organic mass-to-organic carbon (OM / OC)
ratio can be obtained. Note that although the SP-AMS is lim-
ited in molecular-level speciation analysis (Drewnick, 2012),
some compounds can be identiﬁed via recognition of their
corresponding ﬁngerprint ions, and particular sources can be
separated and quantiﬁed via further factor analyses.

ToFSoftware/index.html), and the analysis procedure was
similar to our previous work (Ge et al., 2012b). We did some
minor modiﬁcations on the fragment table. For example,
we set the organic CO+
2 signal equal to organic CO+, a
factor the same as Aiken et al. (2008), as the CO+
2 signal in
PM2.5 may come from non-carbonate organics, and since
we used Argon as a carrier gas so different from ambient
measurements, the CO+ signal can be well separated and
quantiﬁed from N+
2 at m/z 28 (example shown in Fig. S3).
Note that the scatter plot of the original CO+
2 vs. CO+
signals yielded a slope of 2.24. A recent AMS study using
argon as a carrier gas on PM1 ﬁlter samples also showed a
systematically higher CO+
2 signal than CO+, but much less
than the factor of 2.24, indicating that the CO+
2 signal from
the PM2.5 sample was inﬂuenced by CO+
2 from carbonates.
Accordingly, organic H2O+, HO+, and O+ were scaled
to CO+
2 using the ratios proposed by Aiken et al. (2008),
and the elemental compositions and H / C, N / C, O / C,
and OM / OC ratios of OA reported in this study were
determined according to the method of Canagaratna et
al. (2015).
2.3
Determination of WSOA, WIOA
Mass concentrations of WSOA were calculated by multiply-
ing the WSOC concentrations determined from the TOC an-
alyzer by the OM / OC ratios calculated from the SP-AMS
mass spectra (Fig. 2) (Eq. 1). As shown in Fig. 2, most
OM / OC values were within the range of 1.5–2.3, consis-
tent with the typical OM / OC ratios observed at other urban
sites. However, the O / C and OM / OC ratios have no signif-
icant seasonal differences, indicating that the WSOA sources
were likely similar.
The water-insoluble organic carbon (WIOC) mass was cal-
culated as the difference between the OC determined by the

OC / EC analyzer and the WSOC, and a factor of 1.3 sug-
gested by Y. Sun et al. (2011) was used to convert the WIOC
mass to the mass of water-insoluble organic aerosol (WIOA)
(Eq. 2). The total organic aerosol (OA) was treated as the
sum of WSOA and WIOA (Eq. 3).
WSOA = WSOC × OM/OCWSOA
(1)
WIOA = (OC −WSOC) × 1.3
(2)
OA = WSOA + WIOA
(3)
The measurement uncertainty of WSOA was calculated as
the sum of squares of uncertainties of OM / OC ratios and
WSOC, ranging from 6.9 to 8.5 % (Table 2).
2.4
Source apportionment of WSOA
In this work, we used the PMF Evaluation Toolkit v 2.06
(Ulbrich et al., 2009) and followed the protocol described by
Zhang et al. (2011) to conduct the PMF analyses. Typically,
inclusion of more samples can provide better PMF results
and more scientiﬁcally sound interpretation of the sources.
But applications of the PMF model to a limited number of
samples (much less than 100) were also reported previously
(e.g., Huang et al., 2014; Y. Sun et al., 2011) and proven to
be able to provide very valuable insights into the sources of
OA.
Prior to PMF execution, the following steps were per-
formed: data and error matrices for WSOA were ﬁrst ad-
justed based on Eq. (1); ions with a low signal-to-noise ratio
(S / N < 0.2) were removed, and ions with S / N ratios be-
tween 0.2 and 2 were downweighted by a factor of 2; two
runs with huge mass loading spikes were removed; all iso-
topic ions were removed since their signals are not measured
directly but scaled to their parent ions. The PMF solutions
were explored by varying the factors from 1 to 8 and the ro-
tational forcing parameter (fpeak) from −1 to 1 with an incre-
ment of 0.1. The four-factor solution with fpeak = 0 was cho-
sen as the best solution. The mass spectra of three-factor and
ﬁve-factor solutions were presented in Fig. S4. The three-
factor solution does not resolve the oxygenated OA factors
well, as many oxygenated ions were mixed with the primary
OA factors. The ﬁve-factor solution splits a primary OA fac-
tor into two factors with very similar mass proﬁles. Also, by
investigating the correlations of the factors with their corre-
sponding tracer ions, and sulfate, nitrate, etc., of the three-,
four-, and ﬁve-factor solutions, the four-factor solution was
found to be the most reliable and representative solution.

Results and discussion
3.1
Overview of PM2.5 concentrations and components
The annual and seasonal average concentrations of PM2.5,
OC, EC, OA, WSIIs, trace elements, and PAHs are summa-
rized in Table 3. As shown in Table 3, the PM2.5 concentra-
tions (in µg m−3) were on average (±1σ) 106.0 (±24.4), 80.9
(±37.7), 103.3 (±28.2), and 126.9 (±50.4) in spring, sum-
mer, fall, and winter, respectively, with an annual average
of 108.3 (±40.8), comparable to the PM2.5 concentrations
in Nanjing (106 µg m−3 in 2011) (Shen et al., 2014), Tian-
jin (109.8 µg m−3 in 2008) (Gu et al., 2010), and Hangzhou
(108.2 µg m−3 in 2004–2005) (Liu et al., 2015), but lower
than that in Jinan (169 µg m−3 in 2010) (Gu et al., 2014). The
PM2.5 concentrations were highest in winter and relatively
low in summer, similar to those found in most cities, such
as Tianjin (Gu et al., 2010) and Hangzhou (Liu et al., 2015).
Previous studies showed that low concentrations occurring
in summer were mainly due to the relatively high boundary
layer height, low RH, and high temperature (Cheng et al.,
2015; Huang et al., 2010). The temperatures and RH val-
ues were on average 32.1 ◦C and 61.1 % in summer during
the observation period (Table 1). Overall, the daily average
concentration of PM2.5 during the sampling period exceeds
75 µg m−3 – the second-grade national ambient air quality
standard (NAAQS) (GB3095-2012) – and on some heavily
polluted days, the PM2.5 mass loadings can even exceed 3
times the NAAQS standard.
Overall, the reconstructed PM2.5 mass estimated by the
sum of OA, EC, and WSIIs vs. gravimetrically determined
PM2.5 mass was shown in Fig. 3a–d. The mass proportions of
all measured components to the PM2.5 mass are illustrated by
ﬁve inserted pie charts representing the four seasons and the
whole year, respectively. On average, the quantiﬁed species
can occupy 78.6 % of the PM2.5 mass (note that trace ele-
ments and PAHs were not included as they were only deter-
mined for partial samples), and the mass closure appears to
be better for spring and winter samples. Overall, our results
are similar to some previous results, such as in Beijing (68 %)
(Zhang et al., 2013). Details and characteristics of individual
components are discussed in the following sections.
3.2
Water-soluble inorganic ions
The average concentrations (±σ) of total WSIIs were
66.5 (±17.2), 35.0 (±20.2), 51.0 (±17.2), and 66.8
(±23.6) µg m−3 in spring, summer, fall, and winter, respec-
tively, with an annual average of 56.4 (±22.9) µg m−3. The
level was lowest in summer, likely due to the conditions fa-
vorable for pollutant dispersion and the wet scavenging of
these ions under summer monsoon circulation and precipita-
tion. In total, all WSIIs can account for 62.7, 43.2, 49.3, and
52.6 % of PM2.5 mass in spring, summer, fall, and winter, re-
spectively, with the annual average WSIIs/PM2.5 percentage

species, sulfate concentrations showed no obvious seasonal
differences.
The cross-correlation relationships between different ions
can be used to infer their possible common sources. Fig-
ure 5 shows Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients (r) between
ions for four seasons, respectively. As illustrated, NH+
4 had
good correlations with SO2−
4
and NO−
3 (r > 0.70), and par-
ticularly high r values were found in winter (with SO2−
4 :
r = 0.90; with NO−
3 : r = 0.96) and summer (with SO2−
4 :
r = 0.98; with NO−
3 : r = 0.93), indicating these three ions
were mainly present in the form of ammonium nitrate and
ammonium sulfate. Moreover, the correlations between Na+
and Cl−varied largely with the seasons, poor in summer (r =
−0.19) and winter (r = 0.37), indicating different sources
for them. For chloride, the annual average Cl−/ Na+ mass
ratio was 1.58, larger than the 1.17 in seawater (Zhang et
al., 2013), indicating the important contributions of anthro-
pogenic activities to chloride (such as coal combustion) in
Changzhou, in particular in winter as the content of Cl−in
winter was signiﬁcantly elevated. By contrast, K+ and Cl−
had good correlations (r of 0.86, 0.76, 0.80, and 0.62 in
spring, summer, fall, and winter), suggesting that K+ may
co-emit with chloride. According to the correlation analysis
in Fig. 5, Mg2+ and Ca2+ had good relations, with r of 0.58,
0.80, 0.81, and 0.78 in spring, summer, fall, and winter, re-
spectively, indicating a similar source, likely crustal material,
of these two ions.
Acidity of PM2.5 can be evaluated by AE (anion equiv-
alence) vs. CE (cation equivalence), which is calculated by
converting the concentrations of anions and cations (µg m−3)
into molar concentrations (µmol m−3) using the following
equations.

0.95, 0.93, 0.87, and 0.75 in spring, summer, fall, and winter,
respectively, again verifying that (NH4)2SO4, NH4NO3, and
NH4Cl were the dominant forms of these ionic species.
In addition, the mass ratio of NO−
3 to SO2−
4
(NO−
3 / SO2−
4 )
can be used to determine whether mobile sources (vehicles)
or stationary sources (coal combustion) are dominant for
these ions (Y. Wang et al., 2006; Arimoto et al., 1996). When
the NO−
3 / SO2−
4
mass ratio exceeds 1, it means that particle
sources at the observation site are likely dominated by mo-
bile sources, while ﬁxed sources play major roles when the
ratio is below 1. In this study, the mass ratios of NO−
3 / SO2−
4
were 1.52, 0.43, 0.99, and 1.29 in the spring, summer, fall,
and winter, respectively, with an annual average ratio of 1.21
(Fig. 6b). The NO−
3 / SO2−
4
ratio varied largely with seasons.
Note that, in summer, a lower NO−
3 / SO2−
4
ratio may be also
ascribed to high temperature, which leads to the evaporation
of NH4NO3, yet the high NO−
3 / SO2−
4
in winter and spring is
more likely relevant to trafﬁc emissions from Zhongwu Road
near the sampling site (Fig. 1).
Previous studies (Xu et al., 2014) have indicated that the
nitrogen oxidation ratio (NOR = nNO−
3 / (nNO−
3 + nNO2);
n refers to the molar concentration) and the sulfur oxidation

4 /(nSO2−

mate the transformation of NO2 and SO2 to particle-phase
NO−
3 and SO2−
4 . The larger SOR and NOR values mean
more secondarily formed nitrate and sulfate. The seasonal
values for SOR and NOR are plotted in Fig. 6c–d. On aver-
age, the SOR value appeared to be a bit higher in summer,
indicating strong photochemical oxidation for sulfate forma-
tion, while NOR is relatively higher in spring, suggesting that
conversion of NOx into nitrate is more efﬁcient in spring in
Changzhou.
3.3
Trace elements
Eight trace elements (Mn, Zn, Al, B, Cr, Cu, Fe, Pb) for
samples collected during fall and winter were determined in
this study. The average concentrations (µg m−3) are shown
in Fig. 7a. The total concentrations were 6.38 µg m−3 and
2.77 µg m−3, accounting for 5.0 and 2.7 % of the total PM2.5
mass during winter and fall, respectively. These values were
relatively higher than those in other cities in China, such
as 1.74–2.04 % in Hangzhou (Liu et al., 2015). This prob-
ably can be explained by re-suspended dust from building
construction around the site during the sampling period. In
this study, the observed mean levels of trace elements in fall
were in the order Fe > Zn > B > Al > Cu > Mn > Pb > Cr,
and ranked Zn > Fe > B > Al > Cu > Mn > Pb > Cr during
winter (Fig. 7a). In fall, Fe accounted for 39.0 % of the total
trace metal mass, following by Zn (25.6 %), B (12.3 %) and
Al (9.2 %), while in winter Zn contributed the most (53.7 %),
following by Fe and B. Overall, Fe and Zn were the two most
abundant trace elements in PM2.5, accounting for over half
of the trace metal mass. Previous work also found that mass
loading of Zn was higher than other elements, even higher
than Al in Nanjing in 2013 (Qi et al., 2016b, a). Vehicle ex-
haust is likely one major contributor to the high concentration
of Zn.
In general, the correlations between various heavy metals
are weak, as depicted in Fig. 7b–d, indicating the complex
sources including both natural and anthropogenic sources for
the trace metals observed here. For instance, Cr, Cu, Pb, and
Zn can be released from lubricating oils, tail pipe emissions,
and brake and tire wear (Zhang et al., 2013); Fe and Mg are
primarily crustal elements, while Zn and Cu are mainly from
anthropogenic sources. Fe and Al were only moderately cor-
related (for example, in fall with r = 0.74, Fig. 7b), showing
that they are not from exactly the same sources.

3.4
OC and EC
As presented in Table 3, the annual average EC concentration
in Changzhou was 5.4 µg m−3, close to Nanjing (5.3 µg m−3)
(Li et al., 2015) and Tianjin (5.9 µg m−3) (Gu et al., 2010),
but lower than those in other cities, e.g., 22.3 µg m−3 in
Beijing (Duan et al., 2012), and higher than that observed
in Shanghai (2.8 µg m−3) (Feng et al., 2009). The season-
ally averaged OC concentrations were highest in winter
(18.3 µg m−3), followed by fall (13.2 µg m−3) and spring
(11.2 µg m−3), and lowest in summer (7.9 µg m−3). The an-
nual average OC concentration was 13.8 µg m−3, compa-
rable to those measured in other cities, such as Shanghai
(14.7 µg m−3) (Feng et al., 2009) and Tianjin (16.9 µg m−3)
(Gu et al., 2010).
The mass concentrations of total carbon (TC, the sum
of OC and EC) were 16.0, 12.1, 21.0, and 22.3 µg m−3 in
spring, summer, fall, and winter, respectively (Table 3); the
corresponding mass contributions to PM2.5 were 15.0, 15.0,
20.3, and 17.6 %, with an annual mean of 17.8 %. This
value was similar to those measured in other cities in China,
such as Jinan (10–15 %) (Gu et al., 2014), Shanghai (15 %)
(Zhao et al., 2015), and other cities (10–15 % in Tianjin,

OA concentrations exhibited similar seasonal variations to
PM2.5, and ranked in the order winter (31.2 ± 11.9) > fall
(21.6 ± 11.9) > spring (18.9 ± 4.1) > summer (14.0 ± 1.4).
The average mass fraction of OA in PM2.5 was 21.5 %, and
the WSOA contributed 77.7 % of the total OA mass, similar

to the results in Atlanta (approximately 88 % in rural Centre-
ville and 77 % in urban Atlanta) (Xu et al., 2017).
As illustrated in Fig. 8, the OC / EC ratios varied in dif-
ferent seasons and were largest in winter (5.16), followed
by spring (2.38), summer (1.88), and fall (1.75). The largest
OC / EC ratio occurred in winter, indicating that secondary
organic carbon (SOC) was likely a signiﬁcant component
of PM2.5 in winter (Chow et al., 2005); however, the high
OC / EC ratio may be inﬂuenced by biomass burning and/or
coal combustion emissions during wintertime too. A num-
ber of previous studies about the carbonaceous aerosols in
the YRD region also showed that the highest OC / EC ra-

tio occurred in winter, and the ratio was often larger than 2,
such as in Shanghai (6.35) (Zhao et al., 2015) and Nanjing
(2.8) (Li et al., 2015), consistent with our current results in
Changzhou.

Particulate PAHs analysis with GC-MS and
SP-AMS
The average concentrations of the 18 individual PAH and to-
tal PAHs (6PAHs) in winter and spring are listed in Table 4.
It can be seen that InP (% of total PAH: 12.6–14.8 %), BghiP
(10.8–12.3 %), and Chr (10.4–11.0 %) were the three most
abundant PAH species, followed by BbF (8.69–9.39 %), BaP
(7.37–8.29 %), BeP (5.83–8.61 %), and BaA (4.53–8.27 %).
The 6 PAHs in PM2.5 were found in the range of 14.0–
365.7 ng m−3 (mean: 140.25 ng m−3) and 8.9–91.3 ng m−3
(mean: 41.42 ng m−3) during winter and spring, respectively.
The 6PAHs concentrations in this study are higher than
those reported in Zhenzhou (39 and 111 ng m−3 in spring
and winter) (Wang et al., 2014) and Shanghai (13.7 ng m−3
in spring) (Wang et al., 2015), but lower than that reported
in Liaoning Province (75–1900 ng m−3) (Kong et al., 2010).
PAHs with medium (four rings) and high molecular weights
(ﬁve to six rings) (MMW and HMW) occupied the majority
of the PAHs (88.9 % in winter and 79.4 % in spring). It is
well known that MMW and HMW PAHs are usually asso-
ciated with coal combustion and vehicular emissions (Wang
et al., 2015). A prior study in Nanjing (He et al., 2014) also
showed the signiﬁcant contribution of trafﬁc exhaust to some
PAHs, including BbF, Chr, Flu, InP, BeP, and BghiP, which
in total accounted for more than 53 % of the total PAHs.
The
diagnostic
ratios
of
selected
PAHs,
including
BaP / BghiP,
Flua / (Flua+Pyr),
BaP / (BaP+Chr),
and
Phe / (Ant+Phe) can be used to further distinguish the
emission sources of PAHs (Szabó et al., 2015). As suggested
previously (Feng et al., 2015; Saldarriaga-Noreña et al.,
2015), the trafﬁc source was characterized by a ratio of
BaP / BghiP > 0.6, and ratios of Flua / (Flua+Pyr) < 0.4,
0.4–0.5, and > 0.5 suggest sources of petrogenic, fossil fuel
combustion, and coal/wood combustion, respectively. In
this work, the Bap / BghiP ratios of 0.61 (winter) and 0.76
(spring) and the Flua / (Flua+Pyr) ratios of 0.47 (winter)
and 0.50 (spring) all suggest that local vehicular/fossil fuel
combustion emissions could be a prominent contributor
to particulate PAHs, and the contribution from long-range
transport was thus minor. Meanwhile, BaP / (BaP+Chr)
ratios of 0.40 (winter) and 0.44 (spring) also point to the
source of gasoline emission (Khalili et al., 1995). However,
the Phe / (Ant+Phe) ratios of 0.89 (winter) and 0.86 (spring)
indicate that the coal combustion might also be an important
source of PAHs.
On the other hand, by using the SP-AMS, we also iden-
tiﬁed a series of PAH ions, i.e., C16H+
10 (m/z 202), C17H+
12
(m/z 216), C18H+

14
(m/z 326), and C26H+
16 (m/z 328) (Dzepina et al., 2007).
Note that many PAH ions identiﬁed by the SP-AMS were
not measured by the GC-MS, and the PAH compound DBA
which is determined by the GC-MS was not detected by the
SP-AMS. This result reﬂects the different sensitivities and re-
sponses to the particle-bound PAHs of these two techniques.
Table 5 shows the correlation (r) coefﬁcients of the concen-
trations of a few selected PAHs and the mass ratios of their
concentrations measured by both the GC-MS and SP-AMS
(results for the SP-AMS were based on measurements of all
samples, while results for the GC-MS were for 23 samples
in winter and spring). It can be seen that the concentrations
of GC-MS-determined PAHs correlated very well with each
other (r > 0.92), while the mass loadings determined by the
SP-AMS correlated relatively weakly. Also, the mass ratios
determined from these two instruments were different. The
inconsistencies may be for the following reasons: (1) SP-
AMS broke the parent PAH molecules into fragments due to
70 ev EI; thus, the concentration of a speciﬁc PAH ion from
the SP-AMS cannot represent its corresponding parent PAH
compound, while the GC-MS determined the concentration
of molecular PAH compound; (2) one PAH ion in the SP-
AMS high-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) may be a com-
bination of a few PAH compounds with the same molecular
weights; (3) sensitivities and responses to the different PAHs
of the SP-AMS may be different, and thus may lead to uncer-
tainties in the PAH quantiﬁcation. Nevertheless, combining
GC-MS and SP-AMS to improve the PAH measurements by
the SP-AMS is valuable, and will be the subject of our future
work.

Source apportionment of WSOA
3.6.1
WSOA mass spectral proﬁle
To gain further insights into the particulate OA characteris-
tics, we performed the SP-AMS analyses on the water ex-
tract of the PM2.5 samples, with a focus on OA. The averaged
HRMS of WSOA classiﬁed by six ion categories and ﬁve el-
ements are shown in Fig. 9, and the corresponding inset pie
charts represent the mass percentages of the ion families and
elements, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 9a, the CxH+
y ion
family accounts for 386.2 % of the WSOA HRMS, followed
by CxHyO+ (28.5 %), CxHyN+
p (17.7 %), and CxHyO+
2
(11.2 %). It is worth mentioning that we found that the
CxHyN+
p ions contributed signiﬁcantly, and the organic N
(ON) could occupy 6.4 % of the total WSOA mass (Fig. 9b).
The average concentration of water-soluble organic nitro-
gen (WSON) over the sampling period was 1.16 µg N m−3
(83.0 nmol N m−3), which is in fact much lower than those
measured in Beijing (226 nmol N m−3) (Duan et al., 2009),
Qingdao (129–199 nmol N m−3) (Shi et al., 2010), and Xi’an

(300 nmol N m−3) (Ho et al., 2015). The concentration of
water-soluble inorganic nitrogen (WSIN, N from ammo-
nium, nitrate, and nitrite) was 14.0 µg N m−3 based on Ta-
ble 3, and thus the WSON content corresponds to 7.7 % of
water-soluble nitrogen (WSN = WSON + WSIN). These
values are also much lower than those in Beijing (∼30 %)
(Duan et al., 2009), Qingdao (19–22.6 %), and Xi’an (22–
68 %) (Ho et al., 2015).
Nevertheless, the levels of ON measured here are a
few times higher than those observed in other locations
from AMS measurements (typically 1–3 %) (Xu et al.,
2014), likely for the following reasons. First, previous stud-
ies were online measurements on non-refractory submi-
cron aerosols, while it is likely that the supermicron ﬁne
particles (1–2.5 µm) contain signiﬁcant nitrogen-containing
species, as observed before for marine aerosols (Violaki
and Mihalopoulos, 2010). Secondly, we measured only the
water-soluble fraction of OA, which may concentrate more
nitrogen-containing species (partially from aqueous-phase
processing). Thirdly, a recent study reveals that fossil fuel
combustion-related emission can be a dominant source of
ammonia in urban areas (Pan et al., 2016); it thus can act

as a signiﬁcant contributor to amines, as amines are often
co-emitted with ammonia (Ge et al., 2011b); these amines
can be neutralized by inorganic or organic acids and, since
aminium salts are highly hygroscopic (Ge et al., 2011a),
they might be enriched in the WSOA and generate signif-
icant CxHyN+
p ions. Nevertheless, more AMS analyses on
the water-extracted PM2.5 samples collected from other lo-
cations should be conducted to further verify the abundance
of ON species in the AMS mass spectra of the WSOA.
Overall, the average elemental ratios of the WSOA are
0.54 for O / C, 1.69 for H / C, 0.11 for N / C, and 1.99
for OM / OC (Fig. 9a). WSOA is on average comprised of
50.2 % C, 7.1 % H, 36.1 % O, 6.4 % N, and a negligible frac-
tion (0.2 %) of S (Fig. 9b).
3.6.2
WSOA sources from PMF analysis
The PMF analysis of the WSOA HRMS matrix identiﬁed
four OA factors – including two primary OA (POA) factors,
named nitrogen-enriched hydrocarbon-like OA (NHOA) and
local primary OA (LOA), and two secondary OA factors,
which are a less oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA) and
a more oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA), as shown in
Fig. 10.
The NHOA factor had a low O / C ratio (0.19) and was
abundant in CxH+
y ions (33.8 %), and the NHOA time se-
ries also varied closely with those ions, representing its fea-
tures as trafﬁc-related OA. In particular, the factor was rich
in CxHyN+
p ions (43.1 %); as a result, it shows a much
higher N / C ratio (0.26, Fig. 10a) than other factors, and
correlated well with CHN+ (r = 0.91), CH4N+ (r = 0.95),
CH2N+ (r = 0.85), and C2H4N+ (r = 0.87) (Fig. 10b).
The N-containing ions in the NHOA MS were dominated
by the reduced ions (CxHyN+) rather than oxidized ones
(CxHyOzN+), suggesting that amino compounds were likely
the major ON species, and were inconsistent with our hy-
pothesis aforementioned in Sect. 3.6.1 that they were mainly
from fossil fuel combustion emissions. Nevertheless, future
studies should be conducted to investigate in detail the con-
tribution of fossil fuel combustion to the atmospheric ON
species.
Another primary OA factor was deﬁned as a local pri-
mary OA (LOA) which contains contributions from mixed
anthropogenic emissions, such as cooking and coal com-
bustion. LOA had a low O / C ratio of 0.19 and also con-
tained mainly reduced CxH+
y ions (60.8 %), verifying its pri-
mary origin. Note that its mass proﬁle is characterized by
peaks at m/z 55 (signiﬁcant C3H3O+) and m/z 57 (signif-
icant C3H5O+). The abundance of C3H3O+ at m/z 55 and
C3H5O+ at m/z 57 is a spectral feature of cooking OA, and
the overall COA MS and O / C ratios are also similar to the
COA factors reported in other studies, such as in Beijing.
The LOA time series also correlated well with other cooking-
related marker ions, such as C5H8O+(r = 0.76), C6H10O+
(r = 0.74), and C7H12O+ (r = 0.67), consistent with the
cooking OA from many previous studies (e.g., Y.-L. Sun et
al., 2011; Ge et al., 2012a). All these results indicate that the
LOA may have signiﬁcant contributions from cooking activ-
ities. However, the ratio of LOA / C6H10O+ (622.0) in this
study was much higher than that obtained in winter in Fresno
and New York City (∼180), and its mass fraction to the total
OA was also a few times higher than previous results, sug-
gesting that it contains species from other primary sources
rather than only cooking emissions.
The LO-OOA MS proﬁle exhibited characteristics of ox-
idized OA, with enhanced signals at m/z 29 (CHO+) and
m/z 43 (mainly C2H3O+) and other oxygenated ions. Tight
correlations between time series of LO-OOA and CHO+(r =
0.92), and C2H3O+ (r = 0.73), were also observed. More-
over, we also noticed relatively high signals of the BBOA
tracer ions C2H4O+
2 and C3H5O+
2 in the LO-OOA MS, and
found good correlations between LO-OOA and BBOA trac-
ers (r = 0.87 with C2H4O+
2 and r = 0.93 with C3H5O+
2 ), in-
dicating the possible inﬂuence of biomass burning. Thus, we
compared the mass fraction of LO-OOA to total OA in dif-
ferent seasons, assuming that LO-OOA contributions would
increase in straw-burning seasons given that it could be in-
ﬂuenced by BBOA. Figure S6 showed the mass fractions of
four factors during the straw-burning seasons (spring, sum-
mer) and the non-straw burning seasons (fall, winter). No
obvious difference for the LO-OOA fraction was found. Fur-
thermore, the O / C and OM / OC ratios were 0.53 and 1.95,
corresponding to 0.34 and 1.62 if calculated by using the
method of Aiken et al. (2008), well within the O / C range of
less-oxidized OA factors identiﬁed in other studies (Jimenez

et al., 2009), but beyond the O / C range of typical BBOA
(0.18–0.26) (He et al., 2010).
The MO-OOA factor had prominent peaks at m/z28
(mainly CO+) and m/z 44 (mainly CO+
2 ), and was dom-
inated by CxHyO+
1 (36.6 %) and CxHyO+
2 ions (29.0 %)
(Fig. 10a). As a result, MO-OOA had a very high O / C ratio
of 1.20, showing that it is a heavily aged and processed OA
component. Correspondingly, its time series correlated well
with the secondary OA tracer ions, such as CO+
2 (r = 0.93),
C2H4O+ (r = 0.67), and C2H3O+ (r = 0.73) (Fig. 10b).
The f44 (mass fraction of m/z 44 to the total OA) vs. f43
(mass fraction of m/z 43 to the total OA, deﬁned by Ng
et al., 2010) can be used to investigate the degree of oxy-
genation of the identiﬁed factors. As presented in Fig. 11a,
apart from NHOA, another three factors (LOA, LO-OOA,
and MO-OOA) all fall within the triangular region. MO-
OOA is located in the upper position with a higher f44 of
0.28, while LO-OOA is located in the lower position of the
plot, as it had a high fraction of f43 (0.09). This distribution
of the four factors is also consistent with other studies.
The mass contributions of the four factors to total WSOA
over the whole year are 23.9 % for NHOA, 31.2 % for LOA,
15.3 % for LO-OOA and 29.7 % for MO-OOA (Fig. 11b).
POA (= NHOA + LOA) overweighed SOA (= LO-OOA +
MO-OOA) mass, showing the dominant role of local anthro-
pogenic emissions in the aerosol pollution in Changzhou,
similar to that observed in Nanjing (J. Wang et al., 2016a).
However, during spring and winter, SOA contributions dom-
inated over POA, indicating signiﬁcant SOA formation, in
particular the MO-OOA during cold seasons, which is in
agreement with the OC / EC results.

Back trajectory clustering analysis
The Hybrid Single-particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory
(HYSPLIT) model (Draxler et al., 2012) was used to inves-
tigate the origins of air masses based on the meteorologi-
cal data available at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA) Global Data Assimilation System
(GDAS). The 72 h back trajectories of air parcels at 100 m
above ground level in Changzhou were calculated at 08:00
local time (LT) throughout the campaign, and the results
were presented in Fig. 12. The four-, ﬁve-, four-, and four-
cluster solutions were adopted for spring, summer, fall, and
winter, respectively. During summer, air masses from the
southeasterly, easterly, and westerly directions, passing over
Anhui and Jiangxi provinces and Shanghai, dominated the
trajectories’ (75 %) air masses. Westerly and northwesterly
air parcels dominated during winter, which may intercept air
pollutants from Mongolia, Beijing and Shandong Province.
Considering the relatively short sampling days in each sea-
son, a more detailed discussion that is useful for distinguish-
ing contributions of local, regional, and long-range transport
to the air pollution will be the subject of our future work.

Conclusions
We presented here the comprehensive characterization re-
sults on the PM2.5 samples collected across nearly 1 year in
Changzhou, located in the YRD region of China. The species
we quantiﬁed, including WSIIs, trace metals, EC, WSOA,
WIOA, and also PAHs, can reproduce on average ∼80 % of
the mass of the PM2.5 (108.3 µg m−3). WSIIs were the ma-
jor component, accounting for 52.1 % of PM2.5 mass, and

The organic matter (the sum of WSOA and WIOA) occupied
21.5 % of PM2.5 mass, and EC accounted for ∼5 % of PM2.5
mass. Trace metal elements accounted for ∼5 and ∼2.7 %
of PM2.5 mass during winter and spring. Total PAH concen-
trations were found to be at a relatively high concentration
of 140.25 ng m−3 in winter, above 3 times the average mass
loading of 41.42 ng m−3 in spring, both with InP, BghiP, and
Chr as the three most abundant PAHs. The average mass ra-
tio of NO−

was 1.21, suggesting a signiﬁcant role of
trafﬁc emissions, which is consistent with the source analysis
results based on the diagnostic ratios of the selected PAHs

(BaP / BghiP, Flua / (Flua+Pyr), and BaP / (BaP+Chr)). In
addition, a high Cl−/ Na+ ratio and the diagnostic ratio
of Phe / (Ant+Phe) also indicated a contribution from coal
combustion, in particular during winter.
In order to obtain further information regarding the parti-
cle source, we analyzed the WSOA using SP-AMS and con-
ducted PMF analyses of the HRMS of WSOA. Four OA fac-
tors, including NHOA, LOA, LO-OOA, and MO-OOA, were
identiﬁed. The mean mass contribution of POA was larger
than that of SOA, revealing that local anthropogenic activ-
ities are the major drivers of PM pollution in Changzhou.
Nevertheless, during cold seasons, SOA mass contribution
increased, indicating a signiﬁcant role of secondarily formed
species as well; thus, reduction of air pollution in Changzhou
should focus on the strict emission control of both primary
particles and the gaseous secondary aerosol precursors. One
interesting ﬁnding in this work is the enrichment of organic
nitrogen species in WSOA, and source analysis indicates that
trafﬁc emissions can be a signiﬁcant contributor to these
species, which warrants more detailed investigations in the
future. Also, more ofﬂine samples should be collected to
achieve a more robust PMF analysis. Simultaneous online
AMS measurement of the ﬁne particles and measurements
of gaseous species (SO2, NO2, O3, CO and some volatile or-
ganic compounds) are also essential to better understand the
aerosol characteristics and to implement proper measures to
abate the air pollution in this region.
