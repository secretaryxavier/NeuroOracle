Macrophages are central to host defense against microbes, but
intracellular pathogens have evolved to evade their antimicrobial
functions. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) has successfully ex-
ploited macrophages as its primary niche in vivo, but the bacterial
genome-wide requirements that promote its intracellular survival
remain undeﬁned. Here we comprehensively identify the MTB
genes required for survival by screening for transposon mutants
that fail to grow within primary macrophages. We identify mu-
tants showing decreased growth in macrophage environments
that model stages of the host immune response. By systematically
analyzing several biologically relevant data sets, we have been
able to identify putative pathways that could not be predicted by
genome organization alone. In one example, phosphate transport,
requiring physically unlinked genes, was found to be critical for
MTB growth in macrophages and important for establishing per-
sistent infection in lungs. Remarkably, the majority of MTB genes
found by this analysis to be required for survival are constitutively
expressed rather than regulated by macrophages, revealing the
host-adapted lifestyle of an evolutionarily selected intracellular
pathogen.
mutagenesis
U
p to one-third of humans world-wide harbor Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (MTB) in a latent asymptomatic state and are
thus at risk for tuberculosis when immune-compromised (1).
Macrophages are critical both for permitting the survival of
MTB and in linking innate and adaptive immunity in the host (2).
They promote T cell activation and recruitment, crucial for
containing MTB within granulomas in the lung. Virulent MTB
can replicate within the hostile environment of macrophages,
sequestered in poorly acidified phagosomes that fail to fuse with
lysosomes (3–5). Although phagocytosis by IFN--activated
murine macrophages results in some bacterial killing, in part via
nitric oxide-dependent mechanisms (6), MTB can evade mac-
rophage bactericidal function by inhibiting IFN--mediated sig-
naling (7). MTB is also reported to interfere with antigen
presentation, multiple signaling pathways, and transcriptional
responses within the macrophage (2). However, the mycobac-
terial genes involved are largely unknown.
We sought to systematically identify the MTB genes required
for growth in macrophages. We used transposon site hybridiza-
tion (TraSH) (8), a microarray-based technique that compre-
hensively identifies genes from large pools of transposon mu-
tants that are essential for growth under different conditions
(described in Fig. 1a). We devised screens to identify MTB
mutants that fail to survive prolonged infection of primary
murine macrophages and are thus attenuated for growth. We
have identified 126 genes as necessary for survival in macro-
phages under conditions that model the immune response.
Comparative analyses with biologically relevant data sets allow
association of genes into functional groups, provide insights into
gene regulation in mycobacteria, and highlight key gene products
for further detailed study. We show that one such group of genes
encoding a phosphate transport apparatus is important for
growth in macrophages and lungs of mice.
Methods
Macrophage Screens and TraSH to Identify Genes Required for Sur-
vival in Macrophages. A transposon mutant library was made in
MTB strain H37Rv by using the MycoMarT7 phage, as described
(8). Macrophages were derived from bone marrow precursors of
C57BL6 mice, grown in DMEMF12 medium with 10% FCS2
mM glutamine20% L cell conditioned medium2 ng/ml of rIL-3
for 8 days of differentiation. Cells were 99% CD11b and
90–95% F480 by FACS. Macrophages (107) were plated onto
T150 flasks and preactivated with 100 unitsml of IFN- for 16 h
before or after 8 h of infection followed by washing. Adherent
monolayers were infected with 107 mutants [multiplicity of
infection (moi) 1:1]. Bacteria were resuspended in DMEMF12
and sonicated for 5 sec 2 before addition. After 8 h, monolayers
were replaced with medium containing 200 gml of amikacin
for 1 h to kill extracellular bacteria and washed 4 with PBS. We
determined by microscopy and plating that the effective moi
after infection was one bacterium per 5–10 macrophages. On day
7, macrophages were lysed with PBS plus 0.05% Triton X-100
and the lysate pelleted. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in
1 ml of 7H9 medium and titered. Colony-forming units (cfu, 2 
105) were plated onto 7H10-kanamycin (20 gml) plates to
harvest surviving mutants. The in vitro pool was generated by
replating 2  105 cfu of library. Bacteria from the first round of
infection were used to similarly reinfect a fresh pool of macro-
phages. Genomic DNA was isolated from each pool, and Cy5- or
Cy3-labeled TraSH probes were generated and hybridized to the
microarray, as described (8). Each experimental condition (mac-
rophage condition, reinfection) was performed in duplicate;
probes from each pool were generated twice and analyzed on
duplicate microarrays. Data were collected by using GENEPIX
software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) and analyzed
by using GENESPRING software (Silicon Genetics, Redwood
City, CA).
Data Analysis. Data for each experiment were averaged and
filtered to include only those features with control or raw signal
300 whose ratios were significantly different from 1.0 (P  0.05
by t test). For most of the analyses presented, we excluded
mutants with ratios that differed from the median by 2.5-fold.
Thus mutants with in vitroin macrophage ratios 0.4 on a log
scale of normalized intensities (lowest intensity-dependent nor-
malization) were defined as attenuated for growth in macro-
phages. Hierarchical clustering was performed by using standard
correlation. Based on these clusters, 10-cluster k means cluster-
ing was performed by using GENESPRING software (Silicon
Genetics).

In Vitro Growth Assays in Low-Phosphate Medium. Strains were
grown to OD600 of 0.6 at 37°C in Middlebrook 7H9 medium
(Difco) containing OADC enrichment and 0.05% Tween 80
pelleted, and washed 3 in Sauton’s medium minus phosphate
(0.5 g of MgSo47 H2O, 2 g of citric acid, 0.05 g of ferric
ammonium sulfate, 60 ml of glycerol, 4.0 g of asparagine in 1,000
ml of H2O). Each strain was inoculated into 5 ml of Sauton’s
medium containing varying concentrations of phosphate
(KH2PO4) to a final OD600 0.05 for each strain. Strains were
grown at 37°C under agitation for 10 days. Data are represented
as fold increase over growth in zero-phosphate medium, as

Macrophage Survival Assays. To assess growth of wild-type,
pstA1::Tn, and phoT::Tn mutants and complemented strains over

Each strain was used for infection (in triplicate per time point)
at moi 1:1, passed through a 5-m filter, and sonicated before
infection. On days 0 (6 h after infection), 2, 5, and 7 postinfec-
tion, monolayers were lysed in 0.5% Triton in PBS and serial
dilutions plated onto 7H10 and 7H10 kanamycin plates for
colony-forming units.
Mouse Infection. C57BL6J mice (The Jackson Laboratory) were
infected by tail-vein injection with 2  106 colony-forming
units of each strain (three mice per time point). On day 1, weeks
2, 4, and 11 after infection, mice were killed and liver, spleen, and
lungs of each mouse harvested, homogenized, and serial
dilutions plated onto 7H10 and 7H10 kanamycin plates, as
described (9).

macrophages after 7 days and plated surviving bacteria. Mutants that failed
to survive this macrophage selection (macrophage pool) are absent in the

generated that was complementary to the chromosomal sequence ﬂanking

Results
To identify the MTB genes required for survival in macrophages,
we devised screens to identify MTB mutants that fail to survive
prolonged infection of primary murine macrophages and are
thus attenuated for growth (described in Fig. 1a). The infecting
pool of mutants represents transposon insertions in almost all of
the genes in the MTB genome except those mutations that are
lethal for growth in vitro (8). To enhance selectivity, fresh pools
of macrophages were reinfected with bacteria from the first
round of infection and TraSH analysis performed on each
passage. This enrichment improved sensitivity and reliability in
detecting attenuated mutants. Each mutated gene in the infect-
ing pool is represented by 25 different strains, each harboring
a transposon insertion in that gene.
We performed screens using macrophage culture conditions
that simulate three pivotal stages of tuberculosis progression.
Unactivated macrophages likely model initial or latent infection,
infection of macrophages preactivated with IFN- models the
ongoing immune response, and activating macrophages with
IFN- postinfection models the ability of MTB to modulate
IFN--mediated signaling (7). To measure the ratio of growth in
macrophages versus the growth in vitro for each mutant (see
Methods and Fig. 1a), we determined the ratios of fluorescence
intensity of TraSH probes generated under these two conditions
(Fig. 1b). Mutants attenuated for growth in macrophages have
ratios significantly 1.0, whereas those that grow better in
macrophages than in vitro have ratios 1.0 (Data Set 1, which is
published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). Fig.
1b depicts the subset of genes with log ratios significantly 0.4
or 4.0 after enrichment. By these criteria, 126 MTB genes were
identified that are required for growth in macrophages, under
any one of the three experimental conditions (Data Set 2, which
is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site).
Although the majority of mutants have attenuating phenotypes,
some mutations lead to enhanced growth in macrophages rela-
tive to in vitro growth. These include mutations in sseA and
moeA, encoding a putative thiosulfate sulfurtransferase and a
molybdopterin biosynthesis protein respectively. Production of
these enzymes might carry a genetic cost during in vitro growth
in culture medium.
TraSH Defines Functional Subsets of Genes Required for Survival in
Macrophages. To determine how mutant phenotypes can be
informative about MTB functions during the host immune
response, we adapted clustering tools developed for microarray
expression analyses that group genes according to similarities in
gene expression, thus providing clues to their functions (10).
Cluster analysis of data from the three different conditions using
hierarchical and supervised methods uncovered genes whose
functions depend on the macrophage environment. k means
clustering of the subset of 126 genes from unactivated IFN- pre-
and postinfection conditions is shown in Fig. 1c, with each cluster
represented by a different color. Although some mutants appear
to be strongly attenuated under all three conditions, other genes
are seen to be critical for surviving within a specific environment
(Fig. 1c).
Genes within a tight cluster appear to have shared functions.
A significant proportion of the genes within one large cluster
correspond to members of putative operons. Products encoded
by genes within operons often interact with one another or
participate in common pathways (11). We find that individual
members of several putative operons are each required for
macrophage survival (listed in Table 1). For example, genes of
the fadE28 locus appear to be critical (Table 1). These genes have
been proposed to be involved in lipid transport and degradation
and likely function in assimilating exogenous lipids from host cell
membranes (12, 13). Notably, mutants in most of the 100 genes
annotated as involved in -oxidation and fatty acid degradation
(12) do not show similar phenotypes. MTB also requires the
mce1 locus to survive within macrophages under all three
conditions. The four mce gene clusters (mce1–4) are 12-gene
operons, each with similar gene organization, which may assem-
ble into an apparatus for transport of molecules between bacteria
and host. Genes of the mce1 and mce4 loci were previously
reported to be important for growth in mice, whereas those of
the mce1 locus appear to play a role in modulating macrophage
environments.
Comparative Analysis of Genes Required for Growth in Macrophages
and in Vivo. The data derived from macrophage experiments
serve to illuminate results from our previous experiments per-
formed in mice (14). Hierarchical clustering of genes required
for survival in macrophages under any condition with genes
required for in vivo growth in mouse spleens revealed three main
categories. The first includes genes that have cell-autonomous
functions, represented by those required for both macrophage
and in vivo survival (Fig. 2). Some of these appear to play a role
in early stages of infection when innate immunity operates. For
example, genes of the sugABC-lpqY system, thought to encode an
ABC-type disaccharide importer, are essential for surviving
unactivated macrophages and are important for growth in vivo
as early as 1 week after infection. Thus, although lipid metab-
olism in vivo is a major energy source for MTB (13), we find
evidence that carbohydrate acquisition is also necessary for
intracellular growth. Other genes correlate with specific tempo-
ral patterns of in vivo infection, and we can infer functions
related to adaptive immunity. For example, Rv2808 is important
for growth in macrophages that are preactivated with IFN- and
those activated postinfection (see Data Sets 1 and 2). The
corresponding mutant is compromised for growth only after 2
weeks of in vivo infection, which coincides with the initiation of
the T cell immune response and remodeling of the host envi-
ronment. The mutant recovers its ability to grow at 4 and 8 weeks
(14), when there is probably less immune flux in the host. In
contrast, Rv3805c is required to resist killing by macrophages
treated with IFN- postinfection at late stages in infection (8
weeks) (14) and may be involved in maintaining persistence in
the host.
A second set of genes is necessary for in vivo infection but
dispensable for survival in macrophages, suggesting that they
function independently of intracellular replication, for example
by promoting dissemination within the host. A third cluster
comprises genes that are crucial for survival in macrophages but
not identified in the in vivo study. These genes could play
important roles in intracellular adaptation but might not be

modeled in the murine model. The in vivo infection model
studied growth of bacteria in the spleen, whereas bacteria are
largely confined to the lung in human disease (7). Thus, some of
the macrophage-specific genes we identified might be required
for the initial interaction with alveolar macrophages or contin-
ued intracellular growth of bacteria in the lung.
Phosphate Transport Genes Are Physically Unlinked but Functionally
Associated. Using data clustered from multiple experiments
permits some functional predictions about genes, even those not
physically linked. pstA1, pstC2, and pstS3, members of a putative
operon, are each essential for growing in macrophages under all
three conditions. The encoded proteins show homology to three
of four components of ABC transporters that are thought to
import inorganic phosphate during phosphate starvation (15).
Upon clustering our macrophage data, we found that these genes
share a cluster with phoT, located elsewhere in the genome and
encoding a protein with homology to nucleotide-binding domain
proteins of phosphate transporters. Guinea pigs and possums are
less susceptible to Mycobacterium bovis phoT mutants than to
wild type (16). We hypothesized that the phagosome is limiting
in phosphate, which is acquired via a transport system encoded
by these four unlinked genes.
We isolated two transposon mutants, pstA1::Tn and phoT::Tn,
and found both to be more sensitive to phosphate limitation in
their growth media than wild type (Fig. 3a). Both mutants grew
poorly in resting and activated macrophages, and we could
partially complement this phenotype by overexpressing the
wild-type gene in trans (Fig. 3b). Interestingly, a second pst
operon (pstB, pstS1, pstC1, and pstA2) present in MTB appears
not to be required for virulence in either macrophages or mice
and is unable to substitute functionally. Parenthetically, this
second pst locus encodes pseudogenes in the related pathogen
Mycobacterium leprae (17), whose genome has undergone re-
ductive evolution. To test in vivo requirements for phosphate
transport, we assessed the growth of wild-type, phoT::Tn and the
complemented strain in mice (Fig. 3c). phoT appears to be
critical for growth in mouse lungs, suggesting that alveolar
macrophages represent a phosphate-starved environment, and
transport of phosphate is critical for establishing infection. phoT

was not found to play a role in growth in the splenic infection
model (14), indicating that many mutants identified as important
in the macrophage screen may have lung-specific phenotypes
during in vivo infection.
Gene Expression Analysis Is Poorly Predictive of Requirements for
Survival in Macrophages. The expression of many genes important
for virulence is regulated during infection (18). To test whether this
is true for genes required for MTB growth in macrophages, we
compared our TraSH survival data with expression profiling per-
formed in infected macrophages (19). Surprisingly, we see little
correlation between gene expression in macrophages and require-
ments for survival (Fig. 4). Although some genes are found in both
analyses (e.g., Rv0790 and genes of the mce1 operon), the majority
of genes necessary for growth in macrophages are not regulated.
For example, many of the MTB genes that are highly induced in
macrophages and in response to NO stress and hypoxia, including
genes controlled by the regulator dosR (19–21), appear not to be
required for intracellular growth under comparable conditions. In
contrast, a significant number of MTB genes that are essential for
growth in macrophages are constitutively expressed. Unlike patho-
gens with environmental reservoirs like Salmonella typhi or Vibrio
cholerae (22, 23), MTB never resides outside of the human host and
depends exclusively on transmission between humans for its con-
tinued survival (1). Constitutive expression of genes required for
survival may be a necessary adaptation to a complex lifestyle in the
host milieu. For example, expression of the pst operon in MTB is
not induced upon macrophage infection (19), unlike in Salmonella
typhimurium (24). In contrast to the related actinomycete Coryne-
bacterium glutamicum (25), these genes were not induced upon
phosphate starvation in vitro but were constitutively expressed in
both phosphate-sufficient and limiting conditions, as assessed by
quantitative PCR (data not shown). Regulation may occur at the
protein level, because secretion of PstS3 protein is induced upon in
vitro phosphate starvation in M. bovis bacillus Calmette–Gue´rin
(26). Regulation at the protein level would ensure rapid mobiliza-
tion of protein complexes and may be widely used in MTB.
Discussion
MTB is a human pathogen that has successfully exploited macro-
phages as its primary niche in vivo. To understand how MTB
interferes with macrophage function, we comprehensively identi-
fied the MTB genes required for intracellular survival. By screening
for transposon mutants that fail to grow within primary macro-
phages, we identified mutants with decreased growth within mac-
rophage environments. We are able to associate these genes into
functional groups using clustering tools and find that individual
members of several putative operons are each required for mac-
rophage survival (Table 1). These data lend support to many
operon predictions and indicate shared biochemical or regulatory
functions. This also provides functional phenotypes for mutants in
uncharacterized genes. For example, glnB mutants are attenuated
mostly in the IFN- preinfection condition, implying that glnB,
encoding a putative nitrogen regulatory protein, is important for
resisting the IFN--activated macrophage milieu.
Comparison of macrophage survival data with those from
mouse experiments leads to several predictions of gene function,
providing insights into MTB’s intracellular lifestyle. For exam-
ple, we implicate genes in defense against innate or adaptive
immunity (Rv2808 and Rv3805). We also highlight physically
unlinked genes important in phosphate transport, as required for
survival within macrophages. Thus, pstA1, pstC2, and pstS3,
members of a putative operon encoding phosphate-transport
proteins, are likely to associate with phoT, which is found within
the same functional cluster. phoT appears to be critical for
growth in mouse lungs, suggesting that lung macrophages rep-
resent a phosphate-starved environment, and transport of inor-
ganic phosphate is critical for establishing infection.
One striking unexpected result was the finding of little or no
correlation between how essential a gene is for survival and its
expression. Bacterial virulence factors are commonly held to
be highly regulated, and many of the methods designed to
identify them rely on their up-regulation upon infection.
Although this appears true for important genes in other
pathogens like Salmonella, we show this is not universally true.
Our findings emphasize the complementary nature of the two

experimental approaches and reveal the complexity of patho-
gen–host interactions. Studying gene expression is powerful
for gauging bacterial responses to the host but may reflect
short-term adaptations to changing host environments. Mi-
croarray expression analyses measure transcript abundance,
which for some essential genes may be only briefly altered and
thus missed by the sampling intervals chosen. In contrast, the
survival we measure by TraSH is the cumulative effect of a
mutation over time during prolonged intracellular growth.
Still, those mutants that are complemented in trans by either
bacterial or host factors might not be detected. Our systematic
comparison of gene essentiality and expression and other
recent observations suggest that expression screens may have
limited value for identifying virulence genes in host-dependent
and adapted pathogens like MTB (27).
Conclusion
We have shown that combining data from complementary
genome-wide approaches, coupled with the use of analytic
clustering tools, can lead to new insights into adaptations unique
to intracellular pathogens. Further, using a tractable ex vivo
model of macrophage infection allows more detailed functional
analysis of genes than can be performed in whole-animal exper-
iments alone.
