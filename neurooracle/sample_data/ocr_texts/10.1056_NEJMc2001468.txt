Transmission of 2019-nCoV Infection  
from an Asymptomatic Contact in Germany
To the Editor: The novel coronavirus (2019-
nCoV) from Wuhan is currently causing concern 
in the medical community as the virus is spread-
ing around the world.1 Since identification of the 
virus in late December 2019, the number of cases 
from China that have been imported into other 
countries is on the rise, and the epidemiologic 
picture is changing on a daily basis. We are re-
porting a case of 2019-nCoV infection acquired 
outside Asia in which transmission appears to 
have occurred during the incubation period in 
the index patient.
A 33-year-old otherwise healthy German busi-
nessman (Patient 1) became ill with a sore throat, 
chills, and myalgias on January 24, 2020. The 
following day, a fever of 39.1°C (102.4°F) devel-
oped, along with a productive cough. By the 
evening of the next day, he started feeling better 
and went back to work on January 27.
Before the onset of symptoms, he had attended 
meetings with a Chinese business partner at his 
company near Munich on January 20 and 21. 
The business partner, a Shanghai resident, had 
visited Germany between January 19 and 22. 
During her stay, she had been well with no signs 
or symptoms of infection but had become ill on 
her flight back to China, where she tested posi-
tive for 2019-nCoV on January 26 (index patient 
in Fig. 1) (see Supplementary Appendix, available 
at NEJM.org, for details on the timeline of symp-
tom development leading to hospitalization).
On January 27, she informed the company 
about her illness. Contact tracing was started, 
and the above-mentioned colleague was sent to 
the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical 
Medicine in Munich for further assessment. At 
presentation, he was afebrile and well. He re-
ported no previous or chronic illnesses and had 
no history of foreign travel within 14 days before 
the onset of symptoms. Two nasopharyngeal 
swabs and one sputum sample were obtained 
and were found to be positive for 2019-nCoV on 
quantitative reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-
chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) assay.2 Follow-up qRT-
PCR assay revealed a high viral load of 108 copies 
per milliliter in his sputum during the following 
days, with the last available result on January 29.
On January 28, three additional employees at 
the company tested positive for 2019-nCoV (Pa-
tients 2 through 4 in Fig. 1). Of these patients, 
only Patient 2 had contact with the index patient; 
the other two patients had contact only with 
Patient 1. In accordance with the health au-
thorities, all the patients with confirmed 2019-
nCoV infection were admitted to a Munich infec-
tious diseases unit for clinical monitoring and 
isolation. So far, none of the four confirmed 
patients show signs of severe clinical illness.
This case of 2019-nCoV infection was diag-
nosed in Germany and transmitted outside Asia. 
However, it is notable that the infection appears 
to have been transmitted during the incubation 
period of the index patient, in whom the illness 
was brief and nonspecific.3

tential sources of 2019-nCoV infection may war-

rant a reassessment of transmission dynamics of 
the current outbreak. In this context, the detec-
tion of 2019-nCoV and a high sputum viral load 
in a convalescent patient (Patient 1) arouse con-
cern about prolonged shedding of 2019-nCoV 
after recovery. Yet, the viability of 2019-nCoV 
detected on qRT-PCR in this patient remains to 
be proved by means of viral culture.
Despite these concerns, all four patients who 
were seen in Munich have had mild cases and 
were hospitalized primarily for public health 
purposes. Since hospital capacities are limited 
— in particular, given the concurrent peak of 
the influenza season in the northern hemi-
sphere — research is needed to determine 
whether such patients can be treated with ap-
propriate guidance and oversight outside the 
hospital.
