ABSTRACT
Intracellular parasites (e.g., Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Toxoplasma gondii, and some Chlamydiae) may
promote their survival within the host by acting from within
phagosomes to prevent phagolysosome formation, thus avoiding
exposure to the lysosomal hydrolases. The present studies
demonstrate that when sulfatides of M. tuberculosis (anionic
trehalose glycolipids largely responsible for the neutral red re-
activity of virulent strains) are administered to cultured mouse
peritoneal macrophages, they accumulate in the secondary ly-
sosomes, which are rendered incompetent for fusion with
phagosomes containing suitable target particles such as viable
yeasts. This antifusion effect is also exhibited when small
amounts of sulfatide are introduced directly into phagosomes
by attachment to the target yeasts prior to their ingestion. The
sulfatides evidently exert a selective inhibitory influence on
membrane fusion, analogous to what occurs typically when
macrophage cultures are infected with tubercle baci li. This
effect may be due to ionic interaction between the polyanionic
micelles of bacterial sulfatide and organelle membranes,
modifying the latter and inducing dysfunction.
The sulfatides of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (1) have been
characterized as several closely related glycolipids-more
specifically, multiacylated trehalose 2-sulfates (2). Because a
significant correlation has been established between production
of strongly acidic lipids, including sulfatides (SL), and order
of "infectivity" (3) or virulence (4) for some 40 strains of M.
tuberculosis, it was inferred that these substances might be a
factor in the virulence of these organisms.
We have previously speculated that in parasitized host cells
the glycolipids might influence phagosomal or lysosomal
membranes, so as to interfere with their capability to fuse and
form phagolysosomes (4). Such interference could underlie a
survival mechanism for some intracellular parasites, as exhibited
by viable virulent tubercle bacilli during infection of cultured
macrophages (5, 6j. A similar failure of lysosomes to fuse with
phagocytic vacuoles containing viable Chlamydiae (7) or
Toxoplasma gondii (8) has also been established.
Our present studies with purified sulfatides from M. tuber-
culosis strain H37Rv show that they are potent inhibitors of
phagolysosome formation in cultured mouse peritoneal mac-
rophages. The inhibition may involve dysfunction in either
phagosomal or lysosomal membranes-or both. We present a
preliminary report of these investigations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Tissue Culture and Related Procedures. Unelicited peri-
toneal macrophages of normal female mice of the albino P
strain were maintained as coverslip monolayers in Chang me-
dium (9) in Leighton tubes as described previously (5, 10). The
monolayers were used after about 10 days in culture.
Sulfatides of M. tuberculosis. Thirty-day surface cultures
of strain H37Rv were harvested and the principal sulfatide
(SL-I), a 2,3,6,6'-tetraacyl trehalose 2'-sulfate (molecular weight
about 2400), was recovered and purified as previously described
(11). [1-14C]propionate, which is readily incorporated into
unique methyl-branched substituents in SL (2), was included
in the culture medium to effect a light radiolabeling.
Sulfatide Emulsions. Very fine aqueous dispersions of SL
of prolonged stability were prepared (without emulsifying
agents) by modifications of a method developed by M. Kato for
preparing aqueous emulsions of cord factor (6,6'-dimycoloyl
trehalose) (12).
Attachment of Sulfatides to Yeast Cells. Fresh yeasts were
suspended in 0.3 M glucose to give 108 cells per ml; 0.5 ml of
suspension was mixed with 0.1 ml of aqueous emulsion con-
taining 400 ,ug of SL-I. After 10-15 min, 20,l of 5% aqueous
postassium alum (about 2 ,umol of Al3+) in the, tip of a pasteur
pipette were inserted below the surface of the suspension and
the mixture was rapidly aspirated back and forth. After
standing for 15 min, the suspension was made up to 1.5 ml with
0.3 M glucose.
Radioassay. Uptake of radioactive SL by macrophage mo-
nolayers was determined by scintillation counting. Fixing the
washed monolayer in 5 ml of absolute ethanol for several hours
extracted the sulfatide quantitatively for recovery and counting
in toluene-Triton X-100 scintillation fluid.
Phagolysosome Formation: Observation by Fluorescence
Microscopy. A recent application of dark-field vital fluores-
cence microscopy (13) was used. Macrophage secondary lyso-
somes are prelabeled with acridine orange (AO) and thus ac-
quire a bright orange-red fluorescence due to concentration of
the dye (14). The phagocytes are then permitted to ingest live
baker's yeast cells (Saccharomyces ceretvsiae). The progress
of lysosome-phagosome fusion, giving rise to phagolysosomes,
is recognized from passage of the fluorescent marker into the
yeast-containing phagosomes. The latter exhibit vivid orange
confluent "rims" of fluorescence at early stages (e.g., after 45
min at 370); this is followed by progressive coloration of the
yeast cells (at first green and later red) as increasing levels of
AO and mixed lysosomal contents accumulate in the phagoly-
sosomes. However, in the absence of fusion, the phagosomes
appear as dark spaces against a background of fluorescent ly-
sosomes. Results derived from fluorescence microscopy were
confirmed at the ultrastructural level, using ferritin as the ly-
sosomal marker.
Electron Microscopy and Ferritin Prelabeling of Lyso-
somes. Basic procedures, applied to experimental and control
cultures, were as described previously (5, 13, 15); and, to achieve
optimal visualization of intracellular membranes, included

routine fixation by the Hirsch-Fedorko technique (16). To assess
the extent of phagosome-lysosome fusion, monolayers were first
pulse-labeled with ferritin; on the next day half of the cultures
were exposed for 20 hr at 370 to SL-I, the remainder serving
as controls. After the monolayers were washed, live yeasts were
added to all cultures, which were reincubated for 50 min prior
to fixation.
RESULTS
Uptake and lysosomotropism of sulfatide
In cultures of macrophages treated with relatively high con-
centrations (200-400 ,ug/ml) of SL-I in the medium for 24 hr
at 370 the cells became enlarged and visibly foamy. More
prolonged exposure, up to 72 hr, usually provoked further
swelling, rounding, generalized vacuolation, and a tendency
to aggregate. These morphological changes were less marked,
or absent, after exposure doses of 100 .ug/ml or less for 20 hr.
Assessment of the phagocytic capability towards yeasts of
SL-treated macrophages (100 Ag/ml for 20 hr) showed no ap-
preciable difference from that of untreated controls. Sulfatide
is probably adsorbed at least in part at the macrophage surface:
thus, normal macrophage monolayers showed little or no af-
finity, after formalin fixation, for neutral red, but cells exposed
to SL were almost uniformly stained by this cationic dyestuff,
resembling the complexing of the dye which is shown by vir-
ulent tubercle bacilli themselves, and which is believed to be
associated with peripherally located sulfatide (1, 2, 4).
Electron micrographs of sectioned macrophages after ex-
posure to SL (at 100-300 Ag/ml) provided evidence of lysoso-
motropism. Typical thin sections (Fig. la) revealed that at high
dose levels the normal population of lysosomal dense granules
had been replaced by a profusion of membrane-bound vesicular
structures throughout the cytoplasm, containing both granular
material and large numbers of electron-lucent droplets, each
with an opaque margin or interface; the droplets varied in size
up to around 350 nm in diameter. In experiments in which the
lysosomes had been labeled with ferritin before SL treatment
(Fig. lb), ferritin particles and these droplets were located
within the same vesicular profiles, the ferritin being usually
displaced to the periphery. Droplets were also recognized
regularly within small pinocytic vacuoles, some profiles of
which were evidently fusing with lysosomes; but droplets were
never found free in the cytoplasm, nor in the nucleus or mito-
chondria. From these ultrastructural features it is inferred that
after entering the macrophages by endocytosis, the sulfatide
(or some derivative thereof) becomes concentrated selectively,
in droplet form, within distended secondary lysosomes; this
alone could account for the cellular swelling described
above.

rounded by bright intraphagosomal fluorescent "rims" (R), and others showed an intense overall fluorescence (Y), indicating diffusion of the
lysosome-marker dye into the yeast cell. This is the normal pattern of phagosome-lysosome fusion response. (From a color micrograph: bar
represents 10 Am.)
Effects of sulfatide on phagolysosome formation
SL-loaded macrophage monolayers examined by the AO
technique after ingestion of yeast cells showed a virtually total
failure of the lysosomes to fuse with yeast-containing phago-
somes during the period of observation. Control AO-labeled
monolayers, examined 45 min after addition of the yeasts,
showed numerous phagolysosomes at various stages of fusion
(Fig. 2). In striking contrast (Fig. 3), as late as 2 hr after the
ingestion of the yeasts by the SL-treated macrophages (240
Asg/ml for 18 hr), the phagocytic vacuoles appeared as black
nonfluorescing spaces amidst a brightly fluorescing background
of lysosomal granules. In subsequent experiments, exposure of
monolayers to smaller doses of SL (e.g., 100 MAg/ml for 20 hr,
or 40-100 ,gg/ml for 30 min followed at once by offer of the
yeasts) resulted in a similar inhibitory effect on phagosome-
lysosome fusion. It may be added that after 100 Mug/ml for 30
min the uptake of SL, judged by radioassay, is of the order of
1 gg per monolayer; and none of the gross morphological
changes mentioned earlier were apparent.
Interrupted serial thin sections of yeast-containing ferritin-
prelabeled macrophages, with and without SL-I pretreatment
(100 1Ag for 20 hr), were surveyed systematically by electron
microscopy, and the evidence of lysosome-phagosome fusion
was compared quantitatively (5). in the absence of SL (i.e., in
control cultures) ferritin marker was found in abundance within
80% of the 175 yeast-containing phagosomes that were scored
(see Fig. 4), and profiles of lysosomes in the process of fusion
were common, as described elsewhere (5, 13). In cultures pre-
treated with SL, however, any evidence that lysosomal fusion
had occurred was restricted to 20% of the yeast-containing
phagosomes (260 scored). In the population of phagosomes that
remained unfused following SL treatment (i.e., 80% of the total)
the phagosomal membrane was in most cases applied closely
to the contained yeasts (Fig. 5), as in the control macrophages
where fusion was the rule; but about one in five exhibited a
much wider, clear space around the contained yeasts, so re-
sembling the "loose" phagosomes reported previously in the
case of suramin-induced nonfusion (13). It was also evident (see
Fig. 5) that after the prior exposure to moderate doses of SL the
lysosomal accumulation of the droplets was markedly reduced
in comparison with larger dose levels as illustrated in Fig. 1.
Ingestion of yeast cells coated with sulfatide
In further experiments normal macrophages, prelabeled with
AO or ferritin, were permitted to ingest yeast cells to which
sulfatide droplets had been attached.through the intervention
of small amounts of Al3+. Introduced thus, directly into
phagosomes with the target yeasts, sulfatide again induced al-

most total suppression of phagolysosome formation as judged
by fluorescence microscopy. Electron microscopy revealed that
about one third of the yeast-containing phagosomes had failed
altogether to fuse with the ferritin-labeled lysosomes, and that
in most others the fusion was minimal. In contrast, abundant
fusion was observed in almost 100% of yeast-containing
phagosomes in control macrophages that had ingested yeasts
pretreated with alum alone. Close inspection revealed, in ad-
dition, that in these experiments with "coated" yeasts a few
lipid-like droplets (identical to those described above after
SL-loading) were present inside some of the secondary lyso-
somes, more particularly those in close proximity to yeast-
containing phagosomes. The source of such lysosomal droplets
is uncertain; however, perhaps surprisingly, profiles strongly
suggesting the occurrence of endocytic transportation of
droplets from phagosome to lysosome were occasionally also
identified.
DISCUSSION
Our findings indicate that the sulfated trehalose glycolipids
from a typical virulent strain of M. tuberculosis are lysoso-
motropic; further, that after mouse peritoneal macrophages are
exposed to even very small amounts of SL these products of the
tubercle bacillus somehow prevent or delay phagosome-lyso-
some fusion, as shown towards ingested yeast cells which nor-
mally promote a massive fusion response. The evidence suggests
the possibility that the fusion-inhibiting property of the sulfatide
may contribute to the similar dysfunction observed (5, 6) during
tuberculous infection of cultured macrophages, and so possibly
assist the pathogen to survive and multiply within the host cell.
This suggestion is strengthened by the observation that fusion
inhibition occurs not only when the macrophages have se-
questered SL in the secondary lysosomes before ingestion of the
target yeasts, but also when the glycolipid is introduced via the
phagosomes, attached to the yeasts. However, it is not yet clear
how far the latter necessarily indicates a direct effect of SL on
the phagosomal membrane, for, as we have noted, sulfatide-like
droplets were sometimes to be seen simultaneously within the
nearby secondary lysosomes. Hence caution is necessary in
interpreting sulfatide activity even in the yeast-coating ex-
periments in terms of the mycobacterial model, though the
parallels seem impressive; also, use of ferritin as the indicator
of lysosomal fusion, though precise and very reliable (5), nec-
essarily confines observations at this time to the population of
secondary lysosomes.
Since the inhibitory influence of SL on phagolysosome for-
mation is regularly associated with lysosomal accumulation of
droplets, it is reasonable at this stage to consider the lysosomes,

we should be confronted with a paradox. For if SL droplets
enter the cell by endocytosis, as strongly suggested by electron
microscopy, why are successive pinosomes themselves not
prevented from fusing with the secondary lysosomes? The sit-
uation is clearly different from that reported after treatment
of macrophages with the plant lectin concanavalin A, which
inhibits pinosome-lysosome fusion (17). It would be necessary
to propose that the SL effect depends on some peculiarity of the
lysosomal membrane, or perhaps on structural changes af-
fecting the SL molecule that occur only in the lysosomal envi-
ronment. An alternative hypothesis is that sulfatide, and perhaps
suramin likewise (13), may exert its effects not by rendering
membranes as such physically incapable of fusion, but through
a more subtle disturbance of the recognition processes that in
normal circumstances promote selective fusion of macrophage
lysosomes with the membranes of internalized phagosomes.
Finally, extrapolation from the observations with suramin
(a hexasulfonate) and sulfatide (in aqueous dispersion a micellar
"polysulfate") suggests that polyanionic character could be a
structural common denominator provoking the kind of mem-
brane dysfunction we report-whether directly or through a
mediator. Further, as yet unpublished experiments employing
nontoxic levels of dextran sulfate and other substances with
polyanionic structural features lend support to this idea.
