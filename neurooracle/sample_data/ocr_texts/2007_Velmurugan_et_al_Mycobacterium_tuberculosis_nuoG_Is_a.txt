The survival and persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis depends on its capacity to manipulate multiple host
defense pathways, including the ability to actively inhibit the death by apoptosis of infected host cells. The genetic
basis for this anti-apoptotic activity and its implication for mycobacterial virulence have not been demonstrated or
elucidated. Using a novel gain-of-function genetic screen, we demonstrated that inhibition of infection-induced
apoptosis of macrophages is controlled by multiple genetic loci in M. tuberculosis. Characterization of one of these loci
in detail revealed that the anti-apoptosis activity was attributable to the type I NADH-dehydrogenase of M.
tuberculosis, and was mainly due to the subunit of this multicomponent complex encoded by the nuoG gene.
Expression of M. tuberculosis nuoG in nonpathogenic mycobacteria endowed them with the ability to inhibit apoptosis
of infected human or mouse macrophages, and increased their virulence in a SCID mouse model. Conversely, deletion
of nuoG in M. tuberculosis ablated its ability to inhibit macrophage apoptosis and significantly reduced its virulence in
mice. These results identify a key component of the genetic basis for an important virulence trait of M. tuberculosis and
support a direct causal relationship between virulence of pathogenic mycobacteria and their ability to inhibit
macrophage apoptosis.

Introduction
Tuberculosis is an infectious disease of enormous and
increasing global importance. Currently, about one third of
all humans are latently infected with its etiologic agent,
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), and an estimated 2.5 million
people die of tuberculosis annually [1]. After infection of a
mammalian host, Mtb is able to resist innate host defenses
sufﬁciently to increase the local bacterial burden and
disseminate throughout the body. With the onset of the
adaptive immune response, however, the bacterial numbers
are controlled in over 90% of infected individuals. Never-
theless, the host is not able to completely clear the bacterial
burden, thus leading to persistence of Mtb within the lungs
and other tissues of healthy individuals. These latent
infections can be reactivated to generate full-blown disease,
a process that is accelerated by immunocompromised states
resulting from senescence, malnutrition, and co-infection
with HIV, which is a major source of morbidity and mortality
associated with the current HIV epidemics in many countries
[2–5].
Programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays an important role
in the innate immune response against pathogens and
comprises an evolutionarily conserved defense strategy that
extends even into the plant world [6,7]. It is therefore
essential for persisting intracellular pathogens to have strong
anti-apoptosis mechanisms [8–12]. While a few studies have
suggested that under some conditions Mtb may induce host
cell apoptosis [13–16], a substantial body of evidence points
strongly to the expression of strong anti-apoptotic mecha-
nisms by Mtb and other closely related virulent bacteria.
Furthermore, this capacity is not found in avirulent species,
suggesting a causal link between virulence and inhibition of
macrophage apoptosis [17–19]. This hypothesis is supported
by the recent discovery that the genetic predisposition of
different inbred mouse strains to mycobacterial infections is
linked to the capacity of their macrophages to undergo
apoptosis or necrosis upon infection, with the former
response imparting a resistant and the latter a susceptible
host phenotype [20].
Further conﬁrmation of the ﬁndings that Mtb inhibits host
cell apoptosis is provided by a number of studies that have
addressed its molecular mechanism. The importance of Mtb-
induced upregulation of anti-apoptosis genes in infected
macrophages for apoptosis inhibition was supported by
functional data using either anti-sense oligonucleotides to

knock down mcl-1 expression [19] or A1 knock-out mice
lacking the anti-apoptosis gene A1 [21,22]. These results
implicate the intrinsic (mitochondria-mediated) apoptosis
pathway as a target for Mtb-mediated apoptosis inhibition,
because mcl-1 and A1 are both members of the large family of
Bcl-2–like proteins that localize prominently to mitochon-
dria. However, this is contradicted by the ﬁnding that
overexpression of Bcl-2 (another mitochondrial anti-apop-
totic protein) could not rescue cells from undergoing
apoptosis after infection with nonvirulent mycobacteria, thus
suggesting that the extrinsic pathway (death receptor–
mediated) is involved in the infection-induced apoptosis
[23]. Consistently, virulent Mtb strains could inhibit FasL-
induced apoptosis in Fas-expressing cells [18]. The same
group reported very recently that lipoglycans of the Mtb cell
wall stimulate the activation of NF-kB via TLR-2 and that the
subsequent upregulation of cellular FLIP leads to inhibition
of FasL-mediated apoptosis [24]. Furthermore, it was sug-
gested that Mtb stimulated the secretion of soluble TNF-R2,
which led to the reduction of bioactive TNF-a in the medium
and therefore less stimulation of the TNF-R1 [25]. Altogether,
it seems that virulent Mtb is able to inhibit induction of host
cell apoptosis via multiple pathways, and probably encodes
mechanisms to interfere with both intrinsic and extrinsic
pathways for initiation of programmed cell death.
The inhibition of macrophage apoptosis by Mtb is believed
to provide a number of advantages to the bacterium in its
struggle to resist the host immune response. These include
preservation of a favorable host cell environment during
growth and persistence [26,27], evasion of apoptosis-linked
bactericidal effects [28,29], and avoidance of efﬁcient
cytotoxic T cell priming via the detour pathway of antigen
cross-presentation [15,30–32]. This last point is of potential
importance to the improvement of tuberculosis vaccines,
because attenuated mycobacterial strains that induce higher
levels of host cell apoptosis would be expected to stimulate
more robust cellular immunity, as suggested by a recent study
using recombinant M. bovis Bacille Calmette-Gue´rin (BCG)
expressing listeriolysin [33,34]. Therefore, the identiﬁcation
of mycobacterial genes required for prevention of apoptosis
could lead to speciﬁc strategies for designing more efﬁcacious
forms of BCG or other attenuated mycobacterial vaccine
strains.
In order to clarify the role of mycobacteria in host cell
apoptosis and to address its importance for bacterial
virulence, we sought to identify anti-apoptosis genes via a
gain-of-function genetic screen. Using this approach, we
successfully identiﬁed two independent genomic regions of
virulent Mtb (strain H37Rv) that mediate the inhibition of
host cell apoptosis by the facultative pathogen M. kansasii.
The analysis of a deﬁned set of bacterial mutants of M.
kansasii in immunocompromised (SCID) mice demonstrated a
causal relationship between inhibition of apoptosis and
virulence. These ﬁndings were conﬁrmed via a loss-of-
function strategy using the newly identiﬁed anti-apoptosis
gene, nuoG, and demonstrated attenuation of Mtb nuoG
mutants in immunocompromised and immunocompetent
mice. Altogether our ﬁndings allowed, to our knowledge for
the ﬁrst time, the demonstration of a causal relationship
between inhibition of host cell apoptosis and virulence of
mycobacteria.
Results/Discussion
Gain-of-Function Genetic Screen for Anti-Apoptosis Genes
in Mtb
To identify genes in Mtb responsible for anti-apoptotic
effects, we established a gain-of-function genetic screen using
the nonpathogenic M. smegmatis mc2155 strain, which is a fast-
growing mycobacterium that is extremely efﬁcient for trans-
formation [35]. The human cell line THP-1 was chosen for use
as the host cells for this screen because published work
indicates that these cells provide an accurate model for the
apoptotic response of Mtb-infected primary human alveolar
macrophages [23]. Our initial studies established that M.
smegmatis infection of THP-1 cells induced strong apoptosis
after 1.5 d of infection when compared to BCG-infected
macrophages, as assessed by disruption of the cell monolayer
and by staining for DNA strand breakage using the TUNEL
assay (Figure 1A). The failure of BCG to induce apoptosis
seems to contradict the report by Kean et al. [17] in which
seven different species of mycobacteria were compared for
their capacity to induce apoptosis in primary human alveolar
macrophages, and BCG was among the apoptosis-inducing
mycobacterial species. Nevertheless, in that study, no fast-
growing species were included, and all apoptosis assays were
performed after 5–7 d of infection. In an independent study,
we demonstrated that M. smegmatis and other nonpathogenic
mycobacteria like M. fortuitum have a very strong capacity to
induce apoptosis with rapid kinetics, even when compared to
facultative pathogenic mycobacteria like M. kansasii and BCG
(A. Bohsali and V. Briken, unpublished data). Therefore, the
induction of apoptosis by M. smegmatis had to be analyzed very
early after infection (16–36 h; Figure 1A and 1B), and at this
time point, little or no induction of macrophage apoptosis by
BCG could be observed.
The gain-of-function screen was performed using a library
of 312 M. smegmatis clones containing Mtb genomic DNA
fragments on an episomal cosmid. Two clones (designated J21
and M24) containing cosmids with separate nonoverlapping
Mtb genomic DNA inserts gave signiﬁcantly reduced levels of

Virulence of Mtb and Macrophage Apoptosis
Author Summary
The infection-induced suicide of host cells following invasion by
intracellular pathogens is an ancient defense mechanism observed
in multicellular organisms of both the animal and plant kingdoms. It
is therefore not surprising that persistent pathogens of viral,
bacterial, and protozoal origin have evolved to inhibit the induction
of host cell death. M. tuberculosis, the etiological agent of
tuberculosis, has latently infected about one third of the world’s
population and can persist for decades in the lungs of infected,
asymptomatic individuals. In the present study we have identified
nuoG of M. tuberculosis, which encodes a subunit of the type I NADH
dehydrogenase complex, as a critical bacterial gene for inhibition of
host cell death. A mutant of M. tuberculosis in which nuoG was
deleted triggered a marked increase in apoptosis by infected
macrophages, and subsequent analysis of this mutant in the mouse
tuberculosis model provided direct evidence for a causal link
between the capacity to inhibit apoptosis and bacterial virulence.
The discovery of anti-apoptosis genes in M. tuberculosis could
provide a powerful approach to the generation of better attenuated
vaccine strains, and may also identify a new group of drug targets
for improved chemotherapy.

apoptosis and were selected for detailed study. To conﬁrm
that the observed effects on apoptosis were due to the
cosmids contained in these clones, the episomal cosmid DNA
was extracted and re-transfected into M. smegmatis. In both
cases, the re-transformed clones had the same phenotype as
the original clones, showing an approximately 50% reduction
of apoptosis of infected THP-1 cells (Figure 1B). It is
important to note that our screening was designed to
emphasize speciﬁcity rather than sensitivity, as it focused
on the clones showing the strongest and most reproducible
suppression of apoptosis. Thus, it is very likely that other
regions with anti-apoptosis capacity may remain to be
identiﬁed.
Although the effects of cosmids M24 and J21 on reducing
the apoptosis induced by M. smegmatis were highly reprodu-
cible, the magnitude of this effect was relatively modest. Most
likely, this reﬂected the very strong capacity of M. smegmatis to
induce apoptosis when compared to other mycobacteria
(Figure 1 and unpublished data), and we assessed this by
testing the effects of the Mtb cosmids on apoptosis induction
by another mycobacterial species, M. kansasii. This opportun-
istic pathogen is known to be a strong inducer of apoptosis,
but it shows slower host cell killing than M. smegmatis, with
signiﬁcant levels of apoptosis being observed only after 5–7 d
of infection [17]. We transformed the cosmids into M. kansasii
to generate clones Mkan-J21 and Mkan-M24, and also
generated an M. kansasii control strain using the empty
cosmid vector pYUB415 (Mkan-CO). Based on FACS analysis
of TUNEL staining, wild-type M. kansasii and Mkan-CO
induced comparable high levels of apoptosis at 5 d post
infection (95% and 86% apoptosis, respectively), whereas
Mkan-J21 and Mkan-M24 showed markedly reduced levels
(16% and 19% apoptosis, respectively) (Figure 1C). The
transfection of the two cosmid clones did not affect the in
vitro growth of either M. smegmatis or M. kansasii (unpublished
data).
Inhibition of Apoptosis Caused an Increase in Virulence of
Nonpathogenic M. kansasii
Apoptosis of infected macrophages has been reported to
directly kill ingested bacteria [29], and killing of bacteria
within apoptotic bodies is also facilitated as a result of
enhanced phagocytosis by activated bystander macrophages
[28]. Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of apoptosis
is important for mycobacterial evasion of the host’s innate
immune response. This was tested by infecting groups of
SCID mice (BALB/c background) with the M. kansasii cosmid
transformants or with Mtb H37Rv. As expected, H37Rv was
highly virulent in these mice that lack adaptive immunity
(median survival 15 d), whereas Mkan-CO showed only
modest virulence even in these immunodeﬁcient animals
(median survival .200 d) (Figure 2A). Remarkably, Mkan-J21
and Mkan-M24 showed signiﬁcantly increased virulence in
SCID mice, with median survival times of 44 d or 60 d,
respectively (p ¼ 0.0002 compared to Mkan-CO for both
Figure 1. Identification of Regions in the Mtb Genome Mediating
Inhibition of THP-1 Cell Apoptosis
(A) M. smegmatis (Msm) induced more cell death in infected THP-1 cells
than BCG or uninfected cells (UI) as observed by bright field microscopy
(left panels) and fluorescence microscopy of TUNEL staining (right
panels; red fluorescence is TUNEL staining, and green fluorescence is
GFP-labeled bacteria).
(B and C) M. smegmatis was transfected with an episomal cosmid library
of Mtb genomic DNA, and individual clones were screened for their
capacity to inhibit apoptosis. The cosmid DNA of two selected clones
(J21 and M24) was purified and used to re-transfect M. smegmatis,
resulting in clones J21-b and M24-b. These clones, along with the
original transformants (M24 and J21), uninfected (UI) cells, M. smegmatis
(Msm), and BCG were tested for induction of apoptosis by infection of
THP-1 cells followed by TUNEL staining at 16 h after infection and flow
cytometry (C). The J21 and M24 cosmids and empty vector cosmid (CO)
were transfected into M. kansasii, and the induction of apoptosis by the
bacteria was compared to uninfected and Mtb-infected THP-1 cells using
a TUNEL assay as in (B), except that cells were harvested after 5 d of
infection. Results in (B and C) are averages of three independent
experiments and error bars represent 6 standard deviation (SD).

type M. smegmatis in (B) or M. kansasii in (C) is indicated as follows: *,

Virulence of Mtb and Macrophage Apoptosis

survival times by log-rank test). Tissue bacterial burdens in
SCID mice infected with the various mycobacteria were
consistent with the survival data, based on colony-forming
units (CFUs) in the lung, liver, and spleen at various time
points after infection (Figure 2B). Histopathology of the lungs
revealed that after 35 d, airways in the lungs of Mkan-J21–
infected mice were almost completely consolidated, and in
Mkan-M24–infected mice the lungs showed signiﬁcant inﬁl-
tration of inﬂammatory cells. In contrast, lungs of mice
infected with Mkan-CO had normal morphology (Figure 2C).
In order to correlate the virulence of the different strains
with their capacity to inhibit apoptosis, lung sections
obtained 14 d after infection were stained for apoptotic cells
using a TUNEL-based assay and analyzed by microscopy as
described in the Materials and Methods section. This revealed
minimal levels of apoptosis in situ for lung tissue infected
with H37Rv (2%), Mkan-J21 (5%), and Mkan-M24 (7%)
compared to signiﬁcantly higher levels in Mkan-CO–infected
(27%) lungs (Figures 2D and S1). Overall, these results
conﬁrmed the anti-apoptotic activity of genes contained in
cosmids J21 and M24, and strongly supported the importance
of apoptosis inhibition for the virulence of mycobacteria.
Identification of nuoG as an Anti-Apoptosis Gene of Mtb
Cosmids J21 and M24 both contained about 30 mycobacte-
rial genes, and therefore it could not be completely excluded
that the effect on bacterial virulence was in part or totally
caused by another gene or genes linked to those responsible
for the anti-apoptosis effects. As Mkan-J21 showed the
strongest enhancement of virulence in SCID mice, we
selected cosmid J21 for additional studies to determine the
precise gene or genes required for inhibition of apoptosis by
M. tuberculosis. Sequencing of J21 cosmid DNA (unpublished
data) showed that its insert corresponded to bp 3511794
through bp 3545572 of the Mtb genome, according to the
standard annotation for strain H37Rv [36]. This interval
contains the intact open reading frames of 31 annotated
genes, including a large operon that encodes the 14 subunits
of the Mtb type I NADH dehydrogenase complex (NDH-1),
along with other genes that encode a variety of different
known or predicted functions (Figure S2).
To identify which gene or genes in this region were
important for the anti-apoptosis activity, a series of deletion
mutants spanning different regions within the genomic
interval corresponding to J21 was created in Mtb H37Rv
using specialized transduction [37] (Figures S2 and S3). These
mutants were analyzed by using SCID mice to test for
reduction in bacterial virulence (Figure S4A), and by using
THP-1 cells to test for loss of apoptosis inhibition (Figure
S4B). Although several of the deletions showed modest
effects, only one mutant, Mtb DRv3151, which corresponded
to the deletion of the nuoG subunit of NDH-1, gave both
statistically signiﬁcant extension of survival in SCID mice and
enhanced apoptosis in THP-1 cells relative to parental Mtb.
The gain-of-function experiments described in Figures 1 and
2 using the episomal cosmids relied on the proper function of
the endogenous gene promoters in transfected M. smegmatis
or M. kansasii. To conﬁrm that nuoG was actually transcribed
on the J21 cosmid in M. smegmatis, reverse transcription–PCR
with primers speciﬁc for Mtb nuoG was performed and
clearly demonstrated that the nuoG gene was transcribed
(Figure S4C). These experiments implicated nuoG, and
potentially the complete functional NDH-1 complex, in
mediating most or all of the anti-apoptotic properties of
cosmid clone J21.
To conﬁrm that nuoG deletion was responsible for the pro-
apoptotic phenotype and to exclude signiﬁcant polar effects
of the deletion on other nearby genes, the mutant was
complemented with a plasmid carrying a copy of nuoG behind

Virulence of Mtb and Macrophage Apoptosis

a constitutively active promoter that integrates into the Mtb
chromosome at the unique attB site [38]. This gave full
complementation for the in vitro apoptosis assays (Figure 3),
although there was a residual increase in apoptosis induction
observed in vivo (Figure 4B and 4F) that may have been due to
some minor polar effects on the transcription of other
members of the nuo-operon. The mutant (MtbD), comple-
mented mutant (MtbDC), and wild-type Mtb were analyzed
for the capacity to grow in vitro, which demonstrated that the
nuoG deletion had no effect on aerobic growth rate (Figure
3A), conﬁrming a previous report that NDH-1 is not essential
for mycobacterial growth in culture [39]. This is most likely
due to the fact that Mtb has two additional NADH
dehydrogenases, which are the non-proton pumping type II
NADH dehydrogenases encoded by the ndh and ndhA genes
[40].
To conﬁrm the pro-apoptotic effect of nuoG deletion, we
compared levels of apoptotic cell death in cultures of
differentiated THP-1 cells and extended the analysis to
include detection of apoptosis in bone marrow–derived
macrophages (BMDMs) from BALB/c mice following infec-
tion. The Mtb nuoG mutant induced signiﬁcantly more
apoptosis than the complemented strain or the wild-type
Mtb in human and mouse macrophages (Figure 3B and 3C).
This phenotype of the nuoG mutant was also conﬁrmed in
BMDMs from C57BL/6 mice (unpublished data). The differ-
ence in apoptosis induction was not due to a reduced
phagocytosis of the nuoG mutant, which was demonstrated by
comparing rates of infection via acid-fast staining (Figure 3D)
and CFU determination (unpublished data). These results
show that nuoG was necessary for Mtb to inhibit apoptosis of
primary murine macrophages or the human macrophage-like
THP-1 cells. The nuoG Mtb mutant still induced less apoptosis
(Figure 3B) when compared to M. kansasii–infected cells
(Figure 1C), which probably reﬂects the fact that virulent Mtb
expresses multiple anti-apoptosis genes. Therefore, the
deletion of only one gene does not completely abolish the
capacity of the bacterium to inhibit apoptosis. Since nuoG is
part of a multi-subunit NDH-1 complex that is present in the
cosmid J21, it was of interest to determine if nuoG alone
could confer the gain-of-function in M. kansasii or if, in
contrast, expression of the whole nuo-operon was needed.
Therefore, Mtb-nuoG was constitutively expressed in M.
kansasii and the capacity to induce host cell apoptosis was
analyzed (Figure 3E). This demonstrated that expression of
Mtb-nuoG alone very signiﬁcantly reduced apoptosis induc-
tion by M. kansasii when compared to that of wild-type and
empty vector-transfected bacteria (Figure 3E).
Most of the sequenced genomes of mycobacteria contain a
nuoG gene within a nuo-operon containing 14 genes that code
for the NDH-1. The one exception to date is M. leprae, in
which the whole operon is deleted except for a nuoN
pseudogene [41]. nuoG of M. kansasii was cloned using PCR
and sequenced in order to allow protein sequence compar-
ison of all the nuoGs in the mycobacterial strains used in our
study. Comparison of the nuoG protein sequences among
virulent mycobacteria revealed a high degree of homology
(99% identity, Figure S9). Interestingly, nuoG of BCG is also
highly homologous (99%) to nuoG of virulent mycobacterial
species, which is consistent with our unpublished data
demonstrating that the deletion of nuoG in BCG also
increases the potential of the bacteria to induce apoptosis.
These ﬁndings suggest that the vaccine strain BCG retained
this virulence mechanism from its parental M. bovis strain,
although overall it may still induce more apoptosis than fully
virulent mycobacteria. In contrast, nuoG of M. smegmatis is
only 70% identical (Figure S9) and nuoG of M. kansasii is only
34% identical to nuoG sequences of virulent mycobacterial
species. The latter nuoG protein is truncated due to a stop

Virulence of Mtb and Macrophage Apoptosis

codon introduced at codon 295, and thus nuoG of M. kansasii
is missing about 512 of the C-terminal amino acids.
Interestingly, the M. kansasii nuoG is quite homologous up
to amino acid 288 (94%). In conclusion, it seems likely that
both nuoG of M. smegmatis and M. kansasii have lost their
apoptosis-inhibiting function within the NDH-1 complex,
and therefore the overexpression of Mtb nuoG is able to
restore the capacity of the bacteria to inhibit host cell
apoptosis. It will be of great interest to explore this
hypothesis further by examining the expression of the various
nuoG proteins in the nuoG deletion mutant of Mtb and
analyzing the apoptosis induction of these complemented
bacteria.
How does nuoG mediate apoptosis inhibition? For nuoG to
have a direct effect on host cell apoptosis pathways, one
would assume that it needs to be secreted in order to interact
with host cell proteins or lipids. However, if the structure of
the NDH-1 complex of Mtb is similar to that of other
bacterial NDH-1 complexes, nuoG will be located in the
cytosol of the bacterium [42]. To determine whether Mtb
nuoG is secreted experimentally, we created a phoA-nuoG
fusion protein. phoA can convert a colorless substrate into a
blue product, but only if it is secreted by the bacterium [43].
This assay failed to detect secretion of nuoG (Figure S7),
which is consistent with the absence of a signal peptide and
the predicted cytosolic localization of this component of
NDH-1. Altogether, it thus seems unlikely that nuoG is
secreted, and a direct effect of nuoG onto the host cell can
also be judged to be unlikely.
The disruption of the NDH-1 system in the nuoG mutant
might have a very profound impact on the metabolism and
proteome of the mycobacterium, which might result in an
indirect effect on host cell apoptosis induction. Nevertheless,
the absence of an in vitro growth defect in the nuoG mutant
(Figure 3A) would argue against a profound effect of the
deletion on bacterial metabolism. In order to address the
effect of the nuoG mutation on the proteome of the
mycobacteria, the proteins of wild-type and mutant Mtb
were separated via 2-D gel electrophoresis. This revealed that
the nuoG mutation did not induce a major change in the
proteome (Figure S8). Thus, we found that the deletion of
nuoG did not have a major impact on the general bacterial
metabolism or its proteome. Instead, we propose that nuoG
exerts its anti-apoptotic and virulence-promoting function
via the enzymatic activity of the NDH-1 complex in a more
speciﬁc way.
Importance of Inhibition of Host Cell Apoptosis for
Virulence of Mtb
Regardless of the remaining questions about the potential
mechanism of the nuoG/NDH-1–mediated apoptosis inhib-
ition, our identiﬁcation of an apoptosis-inducing mutant of
Mtb allowed us to analyze the importance of apoptosis
inhibition for bacterial virulence. First, the importance of
host cell apoptosis inhibition in innate immune defense was
analyzed by infecting immunodeﬁcient SCID mice. The
median survival times for mice infected with Mtb wild-type
or the complemented strain were not signiﬁcantly different
(14 d and 16.5 d, respectively). In contrast, mice infected with
DnuoG Mtb survived twice as long as those infected with wild-
type bacteria (median survival of 27.5 d, p , 0.0001, log-rank
test; Figure 4A), even though all mice received similar initial
bacterial doses as conﬁrmed by CFU counts at day 1 after
infection (Figure S10). Consistently, the amount of apoptosis
induced in lung sections of these mice was signiﬁcantly
increased from less than 1% with wild-type bacteria to about

Virulence of Mtb and Macrophage Apoptosis

13% in mutant bacteria (p , 0.05) (Figures 4B and S5). The
complemented bacteria still showed increased apoptosis
(6%), but this was signiﬁcantly reduced compared to the
nuoG mutant (p , 0.05). Therefore, the deletion of nuoG
signiﬁcantly increased the induction of apoptosis in the lungs
of SCID mice. These results corroborated the ﬁndings
presented in Figure 2 by using a loss-of-function approach,
and together both sets of experiments point towards an
important role of infection-induced apoptosis in the innate
immune response. This statement is supported by the recent
results linking the capacity of host cell macrophages to
undergo apoptosis upon mycobacterial infection to the
susceptibility of different mouse strains [20].
The importance of nuoG-mediated apoptosis inhibition for
bacterial virulence in immunocompetent mice was analyzed
using BALB/c mice (Figure 4C–4F). Again, the mutant
signiﬁcantly (p , 0.004) delayed the death of infected mice
when compared to wild-type (median survival 175 d) and
complemented bacteria (median survival 193 d, p ¼ 0.16
compared to wild-type) (Figure 4C). Measurement of bacterial
CFUs showed that the growth of the mutant in the lungs of
BALB/c mice was signiﬁcantly reduced by approximately 0.8
log at week 20, after similar initial growth during the ﬁrst 3
wk of infection (Figure 4D). In contrast, the bacterial loads in
spleen and liver were not signiﬁcantly different at 3, 10, or 20
wk post infection (unpublished data). Comparison of the
histopathology of lung sections of infected BALB/c mice
demonstrated an obvious reduction in granulomatous in-
ﬂammation at week 20 in animals infected with the DnuoG
mutant (Figure 4E). Although lung histopathology appeared
similar in wild-type and DnuoG mutant–infected BALB/c mice
at 3 wk (Figure 4E), staining of lung sections at this time point
for TUNEL reactivity revealed a signiﬁcant increase of
greater than 10-fold in apoptotic cells in mice infected with
the DnuoG mutant compared to mice that were uninfected, or
infected with wild-type or complemented bacteria (Figures 4F
and S6).
Taken together, our results demonstrate that nuoG is an
anti-apoptosis gene of Mtb that is important for bacterial
virulence in both immunocompromised and immunocompe-
tent mice and thus strongly support the general hypothesis
that the inhibition of host cell apoptosis is important for
virulence of mycobacteria. The challenge ahead is to
determine the molecular mechanism by which a bacterial
NADH dehydrogenase can manipulate host cell apoptosis
induction. It is intriguing to speculate that perhaps the NDH-
1 complex of virulent bacteria has taken on a separate
function in modifying apoptotic responses of infected
macrophages from its original purpose of energy generation,
which is now mainly performed by the type II dehydrogenases
ndh and ndhA, which are both essential genes. One of the
unique features of NDH-1, as opposed to the NDH and
NDHA dehydrogenases of M. tuberculosis, is its capacity to
pump protons across the bacterial membrane. We therefore
hypothesize that these protons, in conjunction with the
secreted bacterial superoxide dismutases (SodA and SodC),
could serve to neutralize the superoxide anions generated
within the phagosome by an activated NOX2 complex to
generate hydrogen peroxide, which is then further catabol-
ized to water and oxygen by bacterial catalase (KatG).
Superoxide anions are a known trigger for apoptosis in a
variety of biological systems, so the involvement of NDH-1
and nuoG in their elimination may interrupt a critical signal
that initiates the host cell apoptosis response. Our hypothesis
would predict that other NDH-1 subunits involved in proton
translocation, such as nuoL and nuoM [42], will have the same
apoptosis phenotype as the nuoG mutant, a prediction that
has not yet been tested experimentally. This proposed
general mechanism for inhibition of apoptosis is further
supported by other studies implicating SodA as an anti-
apoptotic factor in Mtb ([44,45]). The discovery of nuoG and
NDH-1 as anti-apoptosis factors encoded by speciﬁc Mtb
genes suggests new strategies for improving currently used
and novel tuberculosis vaccines, and could also provide
targets for development of antimicrobial drugs for treatment
of persistent disease.
Materials and Methods
Bacteria and culture conditions. M. smegmatis (mc2155) has been
previously described [35], and M. kansasii strain Hauduroy ( ATCC
12478) and Mtb strain H37Rv (ATCC 25618) were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (http://www.atcc.org/). M. bovis
BCG Pasteur strain was obtained from the Trudeau Culture
Collection (Saranac Lake, New York, United States). GFP-expressing
BCG and M. smegmatis were generated by subcloning the enhanced
GFP gene (Clontech, http://www.clontech.com/) into the mycobacte-
rial episomal expression vector pMV261. The resulting plasmid
(pYU921) was transfected into competent cells by electroporation as
previously described [35]. M. smegmatis was cultured in LB broth with
0.5% glycerol, 0.5% dextrose, and 0.05% TWEEN-80. Mtb H37Rv and
M. kansasii were grown in 7H9 broth with 0.5% glycerol, 0.5%
dextrose, 0.05% TWEEN-80, and 10% OADC enrichment (DIFCO,
http://www.bd.com/ds/). For selective media, 50 lg/ml hygromycin or
40 lg/ml kanamycin were added.
Cell culture conditions and infection. Human myelomonocytic cell
line THP-1 (ATCC TIB-202) was cultured and differentiated using
phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (Sigma, http://www.sigmaaldrich.
com/) as described [46]. Bone marrow macrophages were derived
from the femur and tibia of BALB/c mice as described [46]. Bacteria
were grown to an OD600 ranging from 0.5 to 0.8, sonicated twice for
20 s using a cup horn sonicator, and allowed to settle for 10 min. The
infection was carried out at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10:1
(10 bacilli to 1 cell) for 4 h in triplicate wells, after which extracellular
bacteria were removed by four washes with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS). The cells were incubated in DMEM (Invitrogen, http://www.
invitrogen.com/) with 20% human serum (Sigma) and 100 lg/ml
gentamicin (Invitrogen), and an apoptosis assay was performed after
the indicated periods of culture.
Apoptosis assay. The TUNEL assay was performed to reveal
apoptosis-induced DNA fragmentation in either tissue culture cells
or lung sections of infected mice using the In Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit, Fluorescein (for cultured cells) or In Situ Cell Death
Detection Kit, POD (for lung sections) (Roche Applied Science, http://
www.roche-applied-science.com/). The assay was carried out as
described by the manufacturer and the percentage of stained cells
was analyzed using ﬂow cytometry for cultured cells or quantiﬁcation
via light microscopy for the animal tissue sections.
Construction of Mtb genomic DNA library. The strategy for
generation of the Mtb genomic library in cosmid vector pYUB415
has been previously described [47]. Brieﬂy, Mtb (strain Erdman)
genomic DNA was puriﬁed and partially digested with Sau3A. DNA
fragments of about 40 kbp were selected by agarose gel puriﬁcation
and ligated into arms of cosmid vector pYUB415 digested with
BamH1 as previously described [47]. DNA was packaged in vitro with
Gigapack XL (Stratagene, http://www.stratagene.com/) and Escherichia
coli were transduced and selected on LB plates containing 100 lg/ml
ampicillin. Over 105 independent clones were pooled, and DNA for
transformation was obtained using standard alkaline lysis method.
Transformation and gain-of-function screen. Transformations
were performed by electroporation of competent mycobacteria as
described [35]. For the initial screen, M. smegmatis was transformed
with the genomic DNA cosmid library described above, and 312
cosmid clones were picked and grown in liquid medium containing
50 lg/ml hygromycin. Assuming random distribution of Mtb
sequences among the cosmid transformants and an average insert
size of about 40 kbp, the 312 cosmid clones represented 3-fold

coverage of the entire Mtb genome. After three successive screens
using bright ﬁeld microscopy or ﬂow cytometry to assess levels of cell
death, 12 clones were selected for quantitative assessment using
TUNEL staining followed by ﬂow cytometry. This identiﬁed three
clones of greatest interest (M24, J21, and I16), and their cosmid DNA
was puriﬁed and screened by restriction digest (not shown). This
revealed that the inserts of M24 and I16 were identical, but different
from the insert of J21. For cosmid J21, the 59 and 39 ends of the insert
DNA were sequenced and aligned with the published genomic Mtb
DNA sequence (Figure S2), and subsequently the whole insert was
sequenced to conﬁrm that is corresponded to the sequence published
data.
Specialized transduction for construction of deletion mutants in
Mtb. Speciﬁc genes of Mtb were disrupted using specialized trans-
duction as described [37]. To create the nuoG::hyg-null allele, the
hygromycin resistance cassette was introduced between the ﬁrst 4 bp
of the nuoG 59 end and the last 163 bp of the 39 end of the open
reading frame. The successful deletion of the gene was demonstrated
by Southern blotting as described previously (Figure S3). For
complementation of the DnuoG mutation, nuoG was ampliﬁed by
PCR and cloned behind the hsp60 constitutive promoter into the
plasmid pMV361, which allows integration of a single copy into the
genome of Mtb [38].
Animal studies. BALB/c or SCID/Ncr (BALB/c background) mice (4-
to 6-wk-old females) were infected intravenously through the lateral
tail vein with 13106 bacteria. For survival studies, groups of ten mice
were infected, and after 24 h, three mice per group were sacriﬁced to
determine the bacterial load in the organs. In order to follow the
bacterial growth, an additional three mice per time point were
infected. The organs (lung, spleen, liver) were homogenized sepa-
rately in PBS/0.05% TWEEN-80, and colonies were enumerated on
7H10 plates grown at 37 8C for 3–4 wk. For histopathology, tissues
were ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in parafﬁn; 4-lm
sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. TUNEL staining
was performed on the parafﬁn-embedded tissue sections using the In
Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, POD (Roche Applied Science) per the
manufacturer’s protocol. Quantiﬁcation was performed on coded
specimens by a blinded observer by counting the number of
apoptotic nuclei per ;200 total nuclei in eight separate areas of
two lung sections for each of the three mice per group. All animals
were maintained in accordance with protocols approved by the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine and University of Maryland
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.
