Abstract
Previous behavioral and scanning studies have suggested that handedness is associated with differences in brain
morphology as well as in anatomical and functional lateralization. However, little is known about the topological
organization of the white matter (WM) structural networks related to handedness. We employed diffusion tensor
imaging tractography to investigate handedness- and hemisphere-related differences in the topological organization
of the human cortical anatomical network. After constructing left hemispheric/right hemispheric weighted struc-
tural networks in 32 right-handed and 24 left-handed healthy individuals, we analyzed the networks by graph the-
oretic analysis. We found that both the right and left hemispheric WM structural networks in the two groups
possessed small-world attributes (high local clustering and short paths between nodes), ﬁndings which are consis-
tent with recent results from whole-brain structural networks. In addition, the right hemisphere tended to be more
efﬁcient than the left hemisphere, suggesting a high efﬁciency of general information processing in the right hemi-
sphere. Finally, we found that the right-handed subjects had signiﬁcant asymmetries in small-world properties (nor-
malized clustering coefﬁcient c, normalized path length k, and small-worldness r), while left-handed subjects had
fewer asymmetries. Our ﬁndings from large-scale brain networks aid in understanding the structural substrates un-
derlying handedness-related and hemisphere-related differences in cognition and behavior.

Introduction
H
andedness has been considered not only a natural and
non-invasive marker of functional asymmetry but also a
hallmark of human evolution. Population bias toward right
handedness is one of the most striking characteristics of hu-
mans. Although the various existing theories have studied
the etiological factors leading to handedness, however, no
consistent conclusions have been reached. Witelson et al.
(1991) found that weaker axon loss during development
enhanced the likelihood of left handedness and established
more bilateral functional networks. Other studies reported
that hand preference was probably determined by heredity
(Annett, 1973; Hopkins, 2006; Szaﬂarski et al., 2002), by
the sociocultural environment (Falek, 1959; Fears et al.,
2011), and by fetal position (Churchill et al., 1962).
Anatomical asymmetries in the human brain may aid in
understanding lateralized functions, such as hemispheric lan-
guage dominance and hand preference (Beaton, 1997;
Geschwind and Levitsky, 1968; Toga and Thompson,
2003). Both behavioral and scanning studies have statisti-
cally associated handedness with differences in brain mor-
phology (Amunts et al., 2000; Tuncer et al., 2005) as well
as in cerebral anatomical and functional lateralization (Cuz-
zocreo et al., 2009; Tremblay et al., 2004). Research into lat-
eralization has indicated that the left hemisphere is dominant
for language in right handers but that left handers may have a
more variable lateralization of language, which is primarily
characterized by rightward asymmetry (Haberling et al.,
2011; Herve et al., 2013; Knecht et al., 2000) or bilateral
speech representations (Rasmussen and Milner, 1977). Stein-
metz et al. (1996) found that normal left handers showed a

less left-lateralized planum temporale (a posterior temporal
lobe region and component of Wernicke’s language area)
than normal right handers. Amunts et al. (2000) demon-
strated that consistent right-handed individuals had a signif-
icantly deeper central sulcus in the left hemisphere than in
the right hemisphere and that the anatomical asymmetry
decreased signiﬁcantly from consistent right- to mixed- to
consistent left handers. Furthermore, volumetric analyses
revealed a leftward asymmetry in right handers, which was
found to be less marked in left handers (Herve et al.,
2006). Using cortical thickness analyses, Luders et al.
(2006) revealed a generally thicker cortex in the left hemi-
sphere. Although previous studies have established hemi-
spheric differences in sulcal depth, gray matter volume,
and cortical thickness, little is known about the topological
asymmetry of the human brain with regard to handedness.
Small-world topology is characterized by a high degree of
local clustering and short path lengths linking individual net-
work nodes (Achard et al., 2006; Bullmore and Sporns, 2009;
Sporns et al., 2004). Several analyses of brain structural net-
works have used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) techniques (Hagmann et al., 2008; Iturria-
Medina et al., 2008) and concurrent differences in the vari-
ous morphological regional indices (Bassett et al., 2008;
Chen et al., 2008; He et al., 2007) to investigate large-
scale connection patterns in the brain. Similarly, a number
of studies used functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) (Achard et al., 2006) or electroencephalogram
(Ferri et al., 2007; Stam et al., 2007) to investigate functional
connectivity networks. These studies at the whole-brain level
have suggested that the human brain is structurally and func-
tionally organized by small-world architecture. To date, only
two studies have reported hemisphere-related differences in
the topological organization of brain networks. Using struc-
tural brain networks, Iturria-Medina et al. (2011) found that
the right hemisphere was more efﬁcient and interconnected
than the left hemisphere. In addition, employing resting-
state functional MRI, Tian et al. (2011) found that men
had a higher normalized clustering coefﬁcient in a right hemi-
spheric network than women. However, hemisphere-related
differences in the topological organization of structural
brain networks in handedness (especially in left handers) re-
main largely unknown.
In this article, we used diffusion-weighted MRI tracto-
graphy and graph theoretical approaches to investigate
hemisphere- and handedness-related differences in the orga-
nizational patterns of hemispheric structural networks in the
human brain. We investigated (1) whether each hemispheric
structural network would exhibit small-world attributes and
high network efﬁciency, and (2) whether their topological
properties (normalized clustering coefﬁcient, normalized
characteristic path length, small worldness, global efﬁciency,
local efﬁciency, and nodal efﬁciency) would show hemi-
sphere- or handedness-related differences.
Materials and Methods
Participants
The present study was approved by the local ethics com-
mittee of Tianjin Medical University. Written informed con-
sent was obtained from each participant before any study
procedure was initiated. Young healthy volunteers were
recruited for this study and came primarily from the student
population at Tianjin Medical University. Thirty-four right
handers and 32 non-right handers (left handers and ambidex-
trous) participated in the MRI examinations, which were per-
formed at Tianjin Medical University. Handedness was
deﬁned according to the criterion of the Chinese revised ver-
sion of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Oldﬁeld, 1971)
(see the Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary Data are
available online at www.liebertpub.com/brain, for details).
The handedness score S ranged from 100 to 100. Left hand-
edness was indicated by S < 40, right handedness by S > +
40, and ambidexterity by 40 £ S £ + 40. Our study only in-
cluded consistently right- and left-handed subjects. Thus, 24
left-handed (10 women; age: 24.2 – 2.5 years old, range: 22–
30; education: 17.3 – 2.7 years, handedness score: 67.08 –
11.60) and 32 right-handed participants (15 women; age:
25.8 – 1.9 years old, range: 19–29; education level: 18.4 –
1.6 years, handedness score: 95.3 – 8.79) were studied.
None of the participants had any history of neurological or
psychiatric problems.
Image acquisition
MR images were acquired using a Signa HDx 3.0 Tesla
MR scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). Tight, but
comfortable, foam padding was used to minimize head mo-
tion, and earplugs were used to reduce scanner noise. First,
sagittal 3D T1-weighted images were acquired by a brain
volume (BRAVO) sequence (TR/TE = 8.1/3.1 msec; FA =
13; FOV = 256 · 256 mm; matrix = 256 · 256; slice thick-
ness= 1 mm, no gap; 176 slices). Then, the diffusion-weighted
images were obtained using a spin echo-based echo planar
imaging sequence in contiguous axial planes, including 50
volumes with diffusion gradients applied along 50 non-
collinear directions (b = 1000sec/mm2) and 3 volumes without
diffusion weighting (b = 0 sec/mm2). Each volume consisted
of 70 contiguous axial slices covering the whole brain
(TR = 15,000 msec; TE = 72.9 msec; FA = 90; FOV = 256 ·
256 mm; matrix = 128 · 128; slice thickness = 2 mm, no gap).
Network construction
The deﬁnition of nodes and edges is a critical step, because
they are the two basic elements of a network (Sporns et al.,
2005). Since no gold standard exists for the deﬁnition of net-
work nodes and edges, we deﬁned the network nodes and
edges as described in previous studies (Gong et al., 2009a;
Shu et al., 2011).
Network node deﬁnition.
The procedure for deﬁning the
nodes has been previously described (Iturria-Medina et al.,
2008; Lo et al., 2010; Shu et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2011).
We used the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas
(Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002), which includes both cortical
and subcortical regions, to segment the cerebral cortex into
90 regions of interest (45 for each hemisphere, Table 1),
each of which represented a node of the cortical network.
The individual T1-weighted images were ﬁrst coregistered
to the b0 (non-diffusion-weighted) images in the diffusion-
weighted MRI native space using a linear transformation.
Then, the T1-weighted images were spatially normalized to
the T1 template of ICBM152 in the Montreal Neurological
146
LI ET AL.

Institute (MNI) space. The derived transformation parame-
ters (T) were inverted and used to warp the AAL atlas
from the MNI space to diffusion-weighted native space,
resulting in a subject-speciﬁc AAL mask in the DTI native
space (Fig. 1). All the image preprocessing, including
image registration, spatial normalization, and participant-
speciﬁc mask creation, was performed using Statistical Para-
metric Mapping 8 (SPM8; www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/).
Diffusion MRI tractography.
To reconstruct the whole-
brain white matter (WM) tracts, we performed deterministic
tractography to trace the ﬁber pathways using the following
steps. First, the eddy current distortions and the motion arti-
facts in the DTI data set were corrected by using an afﬁne
registration of the diffusion-weighted images to the b0 im-
ages using FMRIB’s Diffusion Toolbox in FSL (FMRIB’s
Software Library, www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Then, the diffu-
sion tensor mode was calculated voxel by voxel by solving
the Stejskal and Tanner equation (Shu et al., 2011; Westin
et al., 2002), and diagonalization was performed to get
three eigenvalues and three eigenvectors. The fractional an-
isotropy (FA) of each voxel was calculated as well (Guo
et al., 2012a,b). DTI tractography was carried out in DTI na-
tive space using a linear propagation approach, which was
dubbed ﬁber assignment by continuous tracking (FACT).
Here, the ﬁber bundles of the whole brain were reconstructed
with the streamline algorithm embedded in the Diffusion
Toolkit (Mori et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2007). For each
voxel, the orientation of the largest principal axis was as-
sumed to deﬁne the direction of the dominant ﬁber bundles.
Tracking in the data set was initiated from the center of each
seed voxel with an FA > 0.2 and iterated along its diffusion
orientation. This tracking procedure continued until either
a voxel turned an angle that exceeded 35 or reached a
voxel with an FA < 0.2.
Network edge deﬁnition.
Two nodes were considered to
be linked through an edge if at least one ﬁber connected
them (Yan et al., 2011). For each edge, we calculated the
mean FA value along the ﬁber bundles that connected the
end nodes as its weight (Shu et al., 2011). After the nodes
(anatomic brain regions) and edges (WM links and weights)
were deﬁned, whole brain-weighted networks were created
for each of the subjects. Then, each whole-brain network
was segmented into left and right hemispheric networks (re-
moving the interhemispheric connections), with each one
containing the same number of homolog regions (Fig. 1).
Once the brain connectivity information was extracted
from the neuroimaging data, the following network analyses
were based on the two sets of weighted matrices for each

Network analysis
Graph theoretical analysis.
The human brain is a com-
plex network that enables the segregation and integration
of information processing. Graph theoretical analysis provi-
des a simple but powerful mathematical tool for characteriz-
ing the topological properties, such as modularity, efﬁciency,
and hubs, of brain networks, (Bullmore and Sporns, 2009; He
et al., 2007). Here, we ﬁrst deﬁned a graph G with N nodes
and E edges (N = 45 in this study).
The weighted clustering coefﬁcient of a node i, Cw
i , which
expresses the likelihood that the neighborhoods of node i are
connected (Onnela et al., 2005), is deﬁned as
Cw
i =
1
ki(ki  1) +
j, h2N
(WijWihWjh)1=3,
where ki is the degree of node i, and Wij is the weight between
nodes i and j in the network. The weighted clustering coefﬁ-
cient of a network is the average of the clustering coefﬁcients
of all nodes:
Cw
net = 1
N +
i2N
Cw
i ,
which quantiﬁes the extent of the local clustering or cliquish-
ness of a network.
The path length between nodes i and j is deﬁned as the sum
of the edge lengths along the path, where each edge’s length
is obtained by computing the reciprocal of the edge weight,
1=Wij The weighted shortest path length Lw
ij between node i
and node j is the length with the shortest path between the
two nodes. The weighted characteristic shortest path length
Lw
net of a network is measured by a ‘‘harmonic mean’’ length
between pairs, which is the reciprocal of the average of the
reciprocals of all the nodes in the network (Zhang et al.,
2011). We calculated the Lw
net as follows:

where Lw

cies of the subgraph Gi in the graph, which is deﬁned as fol-
lows:
Eloc = 1

which measures the fault tolerance of a network, indicating

where Lw

Small-world networks should meet the following crite-
ria: the normalized clustering coefﬁcient c = Creal
p =Crand
p

and normalized characteristic path length k = Lreal
p =Lrand
p

where Crand
p
and Lrand
p
are the mean clustering coefﬁcient
and characteristic shortest path length of 100 matched ran-
dom networks that preserve the same number of nodes,
edges, and degree distribution as the real network (Sporns
and Zwi, 2004). Furthermore, the two metrics can be in-
tegrated to form the small-worldness index r = c/k > 1
(Humphries et al., 2006). Small-world networks also
have high global and local communication efﬁciency
(Achard and Bullmore, 2007; Latora and Marchiori,
2001), providing them with a good balance between
local necessities and wide-scope interactions (Iturria-Med-
ina et al., 2011). In this study, in order to better understand
the small-world properties of the hemispheric structural
networks, we primarily focused on six network parame-
ters: normalized clustering coefﬁcient (c), normalized
characteristic path length (k), small worldness (r), global
efﬁciency (Eglob), local efﬁciency (Eloc), and nodal efﬁ-
ciency (Emodal).
Threshold selection.
In this study, we repeatedly thresh-
olded each weighted matrix over a range of sparsity values
(S) from 0.17 to 0.47 at intervals of 0.01, including between
17% and 47% of the 990 possible edges in a network of 45
nodes. The minimum threshold (S = 0.17) calculated from
the average degree over all the nodes should be at least
2 · log(N) (Bassett et al., 2008; Liao et al., 2011). The max-
imum threshold (S = 0.47) was selected to assure that each
network was fully connected with N = 45 nodes (Liu
et al., 2008; Stam et al., 2007). Then, we calculated the
area under the curve (AUC) for each network index, provid-
ing a summarized scalar for the topological characteriza-
tion of the resulting brain networks, independent of any
single threshold selection. The integrated AUC of a net-
work metric Y was computed over the sparsity threshold
range from S1 to Sn with an interval of DS, which was de-
ﬁned as follows:
YAUC = +
n  1
k = 1
[Y(Sk) þ Y(Sk þ 1)] · DS=2
Lateralization index
Asymmetry of a given network was characterized by a
measure called the lateralization index (LI), which is deﬁned
as in Benson et al. (1999) and Tian et al. (2011):
LI(X) = f · X(R)  X(L)
X(R) þ X(L) ,
(f = 200)
where X(R) and X(L) denote the topological properties of the
right and left hemispheric networks, respectively. f is a scal-
ing factor that indicates the range of LI, here f is 200. A pos-
itive LI indicates a right hemisphere bias, and a negative LI
indicates a left hemisphere bias.
Statistical analysis
To determine whether signiﬁcant differences between the
four subgroups (2 hemisphere · 2 handedness) could be iden-
tiﬁed in any of the ﬁve global parameters (c, k, r, Eglob, Eloc),
we performed a two-way repeated-measures analysis of var-
iance (ANOVA) with handedness (right hander and left
hander) as a between-subject factor and hemisphere (right
hemisphere and left hemisphere) as a within-subject factor.
p < 0.05 was accepted as the signiﬁcance level. Similar statis-
tical methods were used to assess regional nodal efﬁciency.
The Bonferroni correction was applied for the ANOVA anal-
ysis of nodal efﬁciency using a statistical signiﬁcance level
of p < 0.001.
Results
Hemispheric small-world anatomical networks
We constructed two anatomical weighted networks based
on the right and left hemispheres for each participant and
found that all the four subgroup (2 hemisphere· 2 handed-
ness)
networks
exhibited
higher
clustering
coefﬁcients
(c > 1) but almost identical characteristic path lengths (k&1)
over the sparsity range of 17–47% compared with matched
random networks. In addition, the small-worldness r was
> 1 (Fig. 2), suggesting the presence of small-world attributes
in anatomical weighted networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998).
The ﬁndings indicated that the human brain’s anatomical
hemispheric networks also support local and distributed infor-
mation processing. The results are consistent with previous
hemisphere-related brain network studies (Iturria-Medina
et al., 2011; Tian et al., 2011).
HANDEDNESS AFFECTS THE HEMISPHERIC BRAIN NETWORKS
149

Handedness- and hemisphere-related topological
organization of hemispheric brain networks
Neither the handedness effect nor the interaction between
handedness and hemisphere was found to be signiﬁcant on
any of the global or regional network properties ( p < 0.05).
However, we found a signiﬁcant main effect of hemisphere
on certain small-world parameters: normalized clustering co-
efﬁcient c (F = 13.40, p = 0.001), normalized path length k
(F = 8.49, p = 0.005), and small worldness r (F = 10.08,
p = 0.002) (Table 2). A signiﬁcant hemisphere effect on the
nodal efﬁciency ( p < 0.001) was detected in 16 regions. Spe-
ciﬁcally, eight brain regions showed greater nodal efﬁciency
in the right than in the left hemisphere, and eight regions
showed greater efﬁciency in the left than in the right hemi-
sphere (Fig. 3, see more details in Table 3).
The lateralization index
The structural LIs were evaluated between the right
and left hemispheric networks across ﬁve global and one
regional network properties. The obtained LIs showed sig-
niﬁcant (paired t-test, p < 0.05) lateralization of the topolog-
ical properties in the right handers but no signiﬁcant
lateralization in the left handers (Fig. 4, see more details
in Table 4).
The LI of the nodal efﬁciency showed more asymmetric
regions in the right-handed group than in the left-handed
FIG. 2.

malized characteristic path length,
and small worldness, respectively.
They were evaluated using the
subjects’ hemispheric networks.
The four hemispheric networks had
an average gamma > 1, an average
lambda of nearly 1, and small-
worldness sigma of > 1, which in-
dicate small-world properties.

Discussion
We studied 24 left-handed and 32 right-handed subjects
using DTI tractography and graph theoretical approaches to
investigate handedness- and hemispheric-related differences
in the topological organization of the brain. Our analyses of
the four weighted hemispheric networks focused on small-
world attributes and efﬁciencies. The main ﬁndings were
as follows: (1) All four hemispheric WM structural networks
exhibited small-world attributes (high clustering and short
path length); (2) the right hemisphere was more efﬁcient
than the left hemisphere; and (3) asymmetries of topological
properties (c, k, r, Enodal) were found to be pronounced in
right-handed subjects but not in left-handed subjects. Our
ﬁndings indicate that the topological organization within
the hemispheric structural networks is not equally distributed
in right- and left-handed subjects.
Small-world properties of human brain
hemispheric networks
Human brain networks have been widely shown to have
small-world properties, which enable them to have both
global and local parallel information processing (Bassett
and Bullmore, 2006; Watts and Strogatz, 1998). The evi-
dence for this has come from both structural brain networks
(Gong et al., 2009a; He et al., 2007) and functional brain net-
works (Achard and Bullmore, 2007; Bassett and Bullmore,
2006; Ding et al., 2011; van den Heuvel et al., 2008).
Here, we showed that the hemispheric structural brain net-
works of left-handed and right-handed individuals had a
small-world topology (Fig. 2), indicating that the fundamen-
tal organization of each cerebral hemisphere is in highly
clustered sub-networks, combined with a high level of global
connectivity. The small-world topology of the hemispheric
structural networks observed in the current study is in line
with a previous hemispheric functional study (Tian et al.,
2011) which suggested that the efﬁciency of information pro-
cessing in the separate hemispheres is similar to that in the
whole brain.
Hemisphere related differences in global properties
The right hemisphere showed signiﬁcantly stronger small-
world topological properties (normalized clustering coefﬁ-
cient c, normalized path length k, and small-worldness r)
than the left hemisphere (Table 2), indicating that the right
hemisphere may be more efﬁcient in information processing.
Although the left and right hemispheres are in continual
communication with each other, differences between the
two hemispheres have commonly been reported. In particu-
lar, the left hemisphere is dominant for language (Friederici,
2012; Hull and Vaid, 2007; Price, 2012) and the right hemi-
sphere is dominant for attention (Corbetta and Shulman,

HANDEDNESS AFFECTS THE HEMISPHERIC BRAIN NETWORKS

2011; Corbetta et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2013). However, a
few studies have reported differences in the topological prop-
erties of human hemispheric brain networks. Recently, Itur-
rial-Medina et al. (2011) showed that the right hemisphere
was signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient, with consistent rightward
global efﬁciency and local efﬁciency, than the left hemisphere
in right-handed individuals. In addition, a signiﬁcant right-
ward asymmetry in WM volume was also reported in healthy
subjects (Barrick et al., 2005). Both of the whole-hemisphere
scale studies cited earlier suggested that, compared with the lead-
ing role of specialized processing in the left hemisphere (such
as language and motor actions), the right hemisphere has a
leading role in general information processing (such as inte-
gration tasks) (Barrick et al., 2005; Iturria-Medina et al.,
2011). Small-world networks are known to show a robust net-
work architecture in which information is transformed and in-
tegrated with a high level of efﬁciency (Latora and Marchiori,
2001; Sporns et al., 2004). In our study, we found that the
small-world parameters were signiﬁcantly rightward. Thus,
our hemisphere-scale study also suggested a high efﬁciency
of general information processing in the right hemisphere,
supporting a previous study (Iturria-Medina et al., 2011).
Hemisphere-related differences in nodal efﬁciency
Nodal efﬁciency is a regional network parameter that indi-
cates the variable cost during information processing
(Achard and Bullmore, 2007). Our study revealed 16 nodes

that were signiﬁcantly asymmetric with regard to nodal efﬁ-
ciency ( p < 0.05, Bonferroni correction; Fig. 3 and Table 3).
Such lateralization may play important roles related to hemi-
sphere-speciﬁc functional specialization.
Eight nodes (the MFG, the MOG, the IOG, the IPG, the
ITG, the SFGorb, the REG, and the MCC) exhibited leftward
asymmetries. These ﬁndings align closely with a cortical
thickness investigation (Luders et al., 2006) that showed sig-
niﬁcant leftward asymmetries in the anterior temporal lobe,
including the ITG, the IPG, and superior frontal regions
extending in the orbital gyrus (SFGorb). A thicker cortex in-
dicates denser cell packing or an increased number of corti-
cal neurons (Eickhoff et al., 2005), either of which could
facilitate information transfer. In addition, signiﬁcant left-
ward asymmetries of the betweenness centrality in the IOG
and the MCC (Iturria-Medina et al., 2011) have been
reported, as well as signiﬁcant left-greater-than-right FA val-
ues in the cingulum bundle (Gong et al., 2005). Both studies
indicated a more coherent connectivity or ﬁber organization
in the left hemisphere in regions that correspond to our ﬁnd-
ings. The leftward asymmetries in the occipital regions that
we observed also agree with many previous functional and
structural imaging studies (Gong et al., 2009a; Tian et al.,
2011; Toga and Thompson, 2003).
Signiﬁcant rightward asymmetries were found primarily
in four temporal regions (the INS, the LING, the STG, and
the MTG) as well as in the SMG, the PreCG, the PUT, and
the PoCG. Our ﬁnding of a right skew in the PreCG
and PoCG was inconsistent with a number of reports of
left asymmetry based on various techniques (Amunts et al.,
2000; Luders et al., 2006; Petit et al., 2009). Further studies
should focus on more precise parcellations or tractography
algorithms. Previous studies suggested that the INS is in-
volved in the right-lateralized attentional system and exhibits
signiﬁcant rightward structural or functional asymmetries
(Tian et al., 2011; Watkins et al., 2001). The STG has been
repeatedly reported to show rightward asymmetry (Luders
et al., 2006; Tian et al., 2011), and a rightward asymmetry
for the volume of the MTG was observed in a postmortem
study (Highley et al., 1999). Thus, our ﬁndings of signiﬁcant
rightward asymmetries in the INS, the STG, and the MTG
conﬁrmed previous studies. Rightward nodal efﬁciency in
the SMG is an additional interesting result, which is agree-
ment with the documented rightward lateralization in the
SMG in healthy humans using the betweenness centrality
(Iturria-Medina et al., 2011). The right hemisphere plays a
dominant role in the implementation of visuospatial attention
(Corbetta and Shulman, 2011; Shulman et al., 2010; Smith
et al., 2013), and lesions in the right SMG may cause visuo-
spatial attentional neglect (Halligan et al., 2003; Husain and
Rorden, 2003; Leibovitch et al., 1998). The observed right-
ward asymmetry in the SMG using the nodal efﬁciency of
the WM network further indicates why the widely investi-
gated phenomenon of visuo-attentional neglect is more com-
monly a consequence of right hemisphere damage.
The LIs of brain networks
The topological properties, including the normalized cluster-
ing coefﬁcient c, the normalized path length k, and the small-
worldness r, were signiﬁcantly asymmetric in the right-handed
subjects. However, the differences in these topological proper-
ties between the left and the right hemispheres in the left hand-
ers were inconspicuous (Fig. 4 and Table 4). To the best of our
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study that reported asymmetric
trends in brain structural topology in left-and right handers.
Although there is no signiﬁcant handedness-hemisphere inter-
action, the results provide novel insights into previously
reported anatomical and functional asymmetries from a
large-scale network perspective. In addition, the average Edin-
burgh Handedness score of our left handers was only 67.1,
which indicates a weak degree of ( >  80) left handedness;
whereas the average score of the right handers was 95.3, sug-
gesting a strong degree of ( > 80) right handedness. Recruiting
much stronger left-handed participants, similar to our right
handers, will be necessary for future studies.
Potential limitations
Several limitations in the current study should be noted.
First, we assessed the handedness according to the Chinese
revised version of the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory. A
longer questionnaire with a wider response format seems to
be required, if the primary aim is to investigate handedness
as the chief phenomenon of interest. Second, the edges of
the structural connectivity networks were deﬁned using de-
terministic streamline tractography, as has been done in
other studies (Shu et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011). This
tracking procedure always stops when it traces through re-
gions of crossing ﬁbers, assumes a Gaussian diffusion, and
also assumes that only a single ﬁber exists per voxel (Desco-
teaux et al., 2009). However, some of WM voxels contain
more than one ﬁber bundle orientation, leading to an inaccu-
rate depiction of the tract and a premature stop in regions
with isotropic tensors (Behrens et al., 2007). Thus, determin-
istic tractography favors short connections, which may bias
the measure of efﬁciency. On the other hand, probabilistic
tractography (Gong et al., 2009b) is able to overcome ﬁber
crossing through complex orientation ﬁelds and can better
deal with partial volume averaging effects and noise in the
estimated ﬁber directions. However, the connectivity maps
from probabilistic tractography are harder to interpret visu-
ally and tend to leak into unexpected regions of the brain
WM (Qazi et al., 2009). Of the two families of tractography
algorithms, probabilistic tractography techniques may prove
to be helpful for addressing more sophisticated questions and
may provide accurate results in future work. Third, the AAL
atlas was used to parcellate the whole brain into 90 regions
in this study. However, recent studies indicated that differ-
ent parcellations or different spatial scales generated differ-
ent results (Hayasaka and Laurienti, 2010; Zalesky et al.,
2010). Thus, further studies should determine which brain
parcellation or spatial scale is most appropriate for studying
the human brain. Finally, the big differences (24 vs. 32) in
this small sample size may limit the translational value of
our results. In the future, a more nearly equal and a larger im-
aging dataset will be necessary to conﬁrm our ﬁndings.
Conclusion
Using DTI tractography and graph theoretical methods,
we examined the relationships between the structural con-
nectivity patterns of human hemispheric networks and hand-
edness/hemisphere. We found that the right hemisphere had
signiﬁcantly greater small-world attributes, implying a

hemisphere main effect. Moreover, we demonstrated that left-
and right-handed individuals have different lateralization pat-
terns in their topological properties. Unlike previous studies,
the present study provides a large-scale network perspective
for understanding how the human cortical neuroanatomy is as-
sociated with handedness and hemisphere. Further studies
should be conducted to explore whether left preference or de-
creased asymmetry at either the global or regional level are
markers for intellectual, temperament, or behavioral differ-
ences, as well as for the relative risk of speciﬁc brain diseases.
