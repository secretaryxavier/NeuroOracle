Running head: 
behaviour and school performance after brain injury

Abstract 
 
Primary Objective: To examine the relationship between behavioural problems and 
school performance following traumatic brain injury (TBI) 
 
Methods and Procedures:  Subjects: 67 school-age children with TBI (35 mild, 13 
moderate, 19 severe), and 14 uninjured matched controls.  Parents and children were 
interviewed at a mean of two years post-TBI.  Teachers reported on academic 
performance and educational needs.  Children were assessed using the Vineland 
Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS) and the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children 
(WISC-III). 
 
Main Outcomes and Results:  Two-thirds of children with a TBI exhibited significant 
behavioural problems, significantly more than controls (p=0.02).  Children with 
behavioural problems had a mean IQ approximately 15 points lower than those without 
(p=0.001, 95% CI:7 to 26.7).  At school, 76%(19) of children with behavioural problems 
also had difficulties with schoolwork.  Behavioural problems were associated with social 
deprivation and parental marital status (p ≤ 0.01).  
 
Conclusions:   
Children with TBI are at risk of developing behavioural problems which may affect 
school performance.  Children with TBI should be screened to identify significant 
behavioural problems before they return to school.

Introduction 
 
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem and a significant cause of 
mortality and permanent disability amongst children and adolescents.[1-3]  In the United 
Kingdom it has been estimated that approximately 3000 children acquire significant new 
neurological or cognitive disability as a result of TBI each year.[4] 
 
Children with brain injury are at risk of developing cognitive, emotional and behavioural 
impairments which may persist or even worsen over time.[5-12]  A variety of 
behavioural problems have been reported after paediatric TBI.  These include 
impulsivity and social disinhibition, [13,14] hyperactivity,[14,15] poor temper control,[15] 
mood swings,[16] and psychiatric disorders [13].  High rates of post-injury behaviour 
problems have been observed amongst children with both mild and severe TBI.[17]  
 
TBI has been associated with a decline in academic functioning and school 
performance.[9,16]  Scott Jupp and colleagues found that children with brain injury were 
significantly disadvantaged compared with controls in terms of information processing 
and classroom performance.[18]  They reported that teachers were particularly 
concerned about memory and attentional deficits, cognition, behaviour and personality 
problems.  It has also been reported that children who underachieve at school are often 
those who are easily distractible.[19,20].  Children with head injuries may therefore 
present with a variety of complex difficulties and problems, all of which may interact to 
affect their school performance.[21] 
 
For children with TBI, a return to mainstream school is associated with good recovery. 
However, the classroom environment, typically with one teacher to ~30 pupils, is likely 
 
3

to place at a disadvantage those children who are less able to focus and sustain 
attention.[22]  Despite this, many children return to school after brain injury without 
adequate assessment or support.[18,23] 
 
Children who return to school following a TBI may therefore have residual cognitive and 
behavioural deficits which prevent them from performing at previous educational levels.  
Several studies have identified behavioural problems after paediatric TBI, but the effect 
of these problems on subsequent educational performance has received little attention. 
Consequently, there is a need to examine the relationship between behavioural 
problems and school performance after mild, moderate and severe brain injury. 
 
The current study was designed to investigate the prevalence of behavioural problems 
amongst children who have suffered a TBI and to relate these to intellectual and school 
performance, taking account of the perspectives of both parents and teachers.

Methods 
 
Participants 
 
Eighty-two children admitted to North Staffordshire Hospital NHS Trust with brain injury, 
between November 1992 and December 1998, aged 5-15 years at injury. Recruitment 
was prospective for those injured during 1998, and retrospective for the remainder.  All 
were of school-age at the time of the interviews and consented to their teachers being 
contacted by the research team. 
 
Injury severity was determined according to the British Society of Rehabilitation 
Medicine classification [24]: Severe = an injury causing unconsciousness for >6 hours 
and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) [25] after initial resuscitation of 3-8; Moderate = an 
injury causing unconsciousness between ≥15 minutes and <6 hours and a GCS after 
initial resuscitation of 9-12; Mild = an injury causing unconsciousness for <15 minutes 
and a GCS after initial resuscitation of 13-15.  In the study group, 21 (25.6%) had 
severe brain injuries, 16 (19.5%) moderate, and 45 (54.9%) mild.  
 
Interviews 
 
Interviews and assessments took place between October 1998 and April 1999.  
Children and their families were interviewed face-to-face in their own homes by a 
trained interviewer using a semi-structured questionnaire.  Areas covered included 
behaviour, emotion, cognition, schoolwork and school problems.  Parents and children 
 
5

identified the head teacher of the child’s school and a key teacher who knew the child 
well. 
 
Control group 
 
Sixty-two families identified a child to act as a control, who was of the same age, sex 
and social background, and was working at a similar educational level (i.e. attending the 
same school class) as the injured child.  Thirty-one control children agreed to participate 
in the study, none had a history of head injury nor any neurological impairment, and 
none had any known disorders likely to affect behaviour.  The control group was of 
similar size to the moderate and severe TBI groups, with approximately the same age 
profile.  Control families were interviewed between November 1998 and June 1999.  
Twenty control children, and their parents, gave permission for the research team to 
contact their teachers. 
 
Teacher Questionnaires 
 
Questionnaires were sent to the head teacher of each child’s school with a request to 
pass it to the teacher who knew the child best, as nominated by the child and his/her 
family, usually the form teacher.  Teachers who failed to return the questionnaire were 
telephoned and reminded.  Of the 82 questionnaires posted, 67 were completed and 
returned, giving a response rate of 81.7%.  The response rate was highest for teachers 
of children with severe TBI (90.5%,19 teachers) and lowest for teachers of children with 
mild TBI (77.8%,35 teachers).  Questionnaires were sent to the head teachers of 20 
control children, 14 were completed and returned giving a response rate of 70%. 
 
 
6

Teachers were asked if pupils had any difficulties with school work, paid attention in 
class, had problems with behaviour, had been formally disciplined for behavioural 
problems, been excluded from school, or had special educational needs.  Teachers 
were also asked to rate this pupil against the ability of his/her peers in the class. 
 
Ethical approval 
 
This study was approved by the Local Research Ethics Committee.  Informed, written 
consent was obtained from the parent, and for children aged ≥13 from the child 
him/herself, prior to their participation in the study. 
 
Measures 
 
The King’s Outcome Scale for Childhood Head Injury (KOSCHI) [26] was used to 
measure clinical outcomes following the TBI.  KOSCHI scores were derived from 
interviews with parents and children.  All children were scored by one member of the 
team (CH), experienced in the use of the KOSCHI.  The KOSCHI contains five main 
categories: 1 = death, 2 = vegetative, 3 = severe disability, 4 = moderate disability, and 
5 = good recovery.  Categories 3, 4 and 5 are sub-divided into a) more disability and b) 
less disability. 
 
Social deprivation 
 
The Townsend Deprivation Index [27] was used to measure social deprivation amongst 
the study group, using postcodes.  The higher the positive score the more deprived an 
 
7

area, and the higher the negative score the more prosperous.  For the UK, the mean 
score is zero, for North Staffordshire the mean score is –0.49.  
 
Behaviour 
 
The Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales (VABS) Interview Edition, Survey Form [28] 
were used to assess maladaptive behaviour amongst children with TBI and controls.  
The VABS relies on parental report, and interviews with parents were carried out by 
trained clinical psychology assistants supervised by a consultant clinical 
neuropsychologist.  Raw scores on the Maladaptive Behaviour Domain were converted 
into age-adjusted maladaptive levels according to published norms.  Individuals were 
categorised into one of three maladaptive levels: ‘Non-significant’ (scores at or below 
the 50th percentile of a standardized population); ‘Intermediate’ (scores within the 51st-
84th percentile range of a standardized population); and ‘Significant’ (scores at or above 
the 85th percentile of a standardized population).[28] 
 
Intellectual ability 
 
The Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – Third Edition UK (WISC-III) [29] 
assessed general intelligence.  The seven index scores were used in analyses:  Full 
Scale Intellectual Quotient (FSIQ), Verbal IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ), Verbal 
Comprehension (VC), Perceptual Organisation (PO), Processing Speed (PS) and 
Freedom from Distractibility (FD). 
 
Statistical analyses 
 
 
8

Analyses were performed on data for children with completed teacher questionnaires, 
67 in the TBI group and 14 in the control group.  Descriptive statistics including means 
and standard deviations were calculated for continuous variables.  Where appropriate, 
means were compared using the independent samples t-test.  Cross-tabulations were 
carried out on categorical data and the Pearson Chi-Square statistic calculated, all 
using SPSS Version 9.0.   
 
 
Results 
 
Characteristics of the Study Group 
 
Characteristics of the school study group are shown in table 1.  Townsend deprivation 
scores were calculated for 62 families in the TBI group, postcodes were missing for 5.  
The majority of families lived in areas with positive scores (40, 64.5%).  Nine families 
(14.5%) lived in considerably deprived areas (scores of ≥+3.55), 10 families (16.1%) 
lived in affluent areas (scores of ≤–2.4), the remainder (43, 69.4%) lived in middle-range 
areas (scores between -2.3 and +3.54).  In the control group, eight families (57.1%) 
lived in areas with positive scores.  One family (7.1%) lived in a considerably deprived 
area, four families (28.6%) in affluent areas, and nine in middle-range areas.

The majority of children in the TBI group (68.7%) had moderate disability following the 
injury, 19 (28.4%) made a good recovery, and one child made a full recovery with no 
discernable sequelae.  KOSCHI scores are shown in table 2.  There were no significant 
differences between severity groups.

Psychological input following the TBI 
 
Parents of all 67 children were asked whether their child had been assessed by a 
psychologist following the TBI.  Three children in the severe group, none in the 
moderate group and three in the mild group had been assessed and had received 
clinical input from a psychologist.  One child in the mild group was currently seeing a 
psychiatrist for behavioural problems and one child had been assessed by an 
educational psychologist. 
 
Behaviour and school difficulties reported by teachers and parents  
 
The results of the teachers’ questionnaire are shown in table 3.  Approximately one third 
of children with TBI were identified by teachers as having current behavioural problems, 
and half had difficulties with their schoolwork.  In separate interviews, parents reported 
these problems for a similar proportion of children, as shown in table 4.

Special educational needs 
 
Teachers reported that 16 children in the TBI group (23.9%) were currently on the 
school’s Special Educational Needs (SEN) Register.  Seven of these (43.8%) were on 
the Register prior to the TBI.  General intellectual functioning was measured by the 
WISC-III for the 16 children identified as having SENs, and 54 children (TBI and control) 
without SENs.  A significant relationship was observed between IQ and provision of 
SENs.  The mean FSIQ was 79.6 (SE=2.4) for children with SENs, and 96.0 (SE=2.2) 
for children without SENs (p=0.0001, 95%CI: 9.8-23.0).  
 
Behaviour 
 
In the TBI group, 25 children (37.3%) were identified by their teachers as having 
behavioural problems within the school environment.  Most of these children exhibited 
disruptive behaviours (19, 76%), the remaining children were very withdrawn (6, 24%). 
There were no significant differences between the severity groups.  
 
For the study group (TBI and control), there was a significant association between the 
number of children identified by teachers as having behavioural problems, and the 
number identified by parents (p=0.0001, X2=21.38, df=1, n=81).  Teachers and parents 
agreed in 84% of cases for children without behavioural problems, and 68% agreed for 
children with behavioural problems.  In the TBI group (n=67), 16 children (23%) 
exhibited behavioural problems at both home and school, eight (11.9%) only at home, 
nine (13.4%) only at school, and 34 (50.7%) had no behavioural problems at home or 
school. 
 
 
11

A significant relationship was observed between school difficulties and behaviour 
(p=0.04, X2=4.33, df=1).  Of the 25 children with TBI identified by teachers as having 
behavioural problems, 76% (19) were also identified as having some school difficulties.  
 
A significant association was observed between behavioural problems at school and 
parental marital status (p=0.002, X2=9.31, df=1).  In the TBI group, 27 children had 
parents who were divorced or separated.  Of these, 16 (59.3%) exhibited behavioural 
problems at school compared to only nine (22.5%) of the 40 children whose parents 
were not divorced or separated.   
 
The Maladaptive Behaviour Scale, part of the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales 
(VABS), was used as a more objective measure of behavioural problems for 63 children 
with TBI and 11 control children.  The results are shown in table 5.  There was a 
statistically significant difference in the number of children with TBI exhibiting 
‘Significant’ behavioural problems compared to controls (p=0.02, X2=7.98, df=2).  
 
Table 5 about here please. 
 
For those children scoring at the ‘Significant’ level on the maladaptive behaviour domain 
of the VABS, their parents and teachers had identified behaviour as a specific problem 
in only 50% of cases.  However, for those children whose parents did identify behaviour 
as a particular problem during the interview, 87.5% scored at the ‘Significant’ level on 
the VABS.  This suggests that parents tend to report behaviour as a problem only when 
it is of considerable importance.  Furthermore, all of the children excluded from school 
scored at the ‘Significant’ level on the VABS.  A strong association was also observed 
 
12

between KOSCHI scores and VABS scores.  The lower (worse) the KOSCHI score, the 
higher (worse) the VABS score (p=0.002, X2=25.0, df=8).   
 
Social deprivation and behaviour 
 
For the study group (TBI and control), there was a significant relationship between 
social deprivation and behavioural problems measured by the VABS.  Children from 
deprived areas were more likely to exhibit significant behavioural problems than children 
from less deprived areas (p=0.012, t = -2.62, 95%CI: -3.97 to –0.52, n=74).  Children 
with significant behavioural problems had a mean Townsend score of +1.72 (SD=2.82), 
and those without significant behavioural problems had a mean score of  
–0.53 (SD=2.56). 
 
 
Intellectual ability and behaviour 
 
The WISC-III assessed general intelligence for 53 children with TBI and 14 controls 
(table 6).  Children with severe TBI had a mean FSIQ 13.5 points lower than controls 
(p=0.03, 95%CI: 1.7 - 25.1).  Children with mild to moderate TBI had a mean FSIQ 6 to 
8 points lower than controls (not significant). 
 
Table 6 about here please 
 
In the TBI group, intellectual ability was compared with behavioural problems identified 
by teachers (table 7), and with significant behavioural problems identified by the VABS 
(table 8).  Children with behavioural problems, however identified, had a mean FSIQ 
 
13

score approximately 15 IQ points lower than children without behavioural problems 
(p=0.001).

Discussion 
 
In the TBI group, almost two-thirds of children were currently exhibiting significant 
behavioural problems as measured by the VABS.  At least some maladaptive 
behaviours were identified for over 80% of children in the moderate and severe groups 
and 73% of children in the mild group.  Significantly more children with TBI had 
behavioural problems compared to controls (p=0.02).  There was also a significant 
relationship between social deprivation and behavioural problems.  There was a strong 
relationship between clinical outcome assessed by the KOSCHI and maladaptive 
behaviours assessed by the VABS. In the TBI group, 16 children (23%) exhibited 
serious behavioural problems at both home and school, 8 (11.9%) only at home, 9 
(13.4%) only at school.  Children with behavioural problems had a significantly lower 
mean FSIQ than children without behavioural problems (p=0.001).  There was a strong 
link between school performance and behavioural problems, 76% (19) of the 25 children 
identified by teachers as having serious behavioural problems also had difficulties with 
schoolwork.  Special Educational Needs (SENs) were identified for 16 children in the 
TBI group (24%), of these, the majority had been placed on the SEN register following 
the TBI.  Few children had been formally assessed following the TBI.  However, seven 
children in the TBI group (10.5%) had been formally disciplined by the school for 
 
14

problem behaviour and five (7.5%) had been permanently excluded from school since 
the TBI.   
 
Behavioural problems were frequently reported within our TBI group, even several years 
post injury, which is consistent with the findings of other investigators.[6,14]  The 
incidence of behavioural problems reported within the mild group is higher than reported 
by some other studies.[9,13]   A possible explanation is that our mild group were at the 
more severe end of the spectrum of ‘mild’ TBI as all our subjects had been admitted to 
hospital following the injury.  It is also possible that parents participated in this research 
because of their concerns about the behaviour of their child.  However, other 
researchers have also found high rates of behavioural and academic problems amongst 
children with mild TBI.[30] 
 
The VABS gives a global measure of maladaptive behaviours and correlates well with 
other measures of behavioural problems, it has also been found to be an appropriate 
measure of behaviour within a TBI population.[31]  On the VABS, children with TBI 
demonstrated significantly higher levels of maladaptive behaviour than controls, yet 
there were no significant differences between the mild, moderate and severe TBI 
groups, a finding consistent with other studies.[30]  Two thirds of children, up to 5 years 
post-TBI, were exhibiting ‘significant’ maladaptive behaviour compared to 18% of 
controls.  The majority of children in the moderate and severe groups (82-85%) 
exhibited some maladaptive behaviours.  This is consistent with the findings of Green et 
al who found that 79% of their children with acquired brain injury had impaired 
behaviour.[31]  The authors of the VABS recommend that children who score in the 
‘Significant’ range should be offered further clinical assessment.[28]  Parents were 
given copies of the results of all assessments carried out for this study to share with 
 
15

their general practitioner (GP) or school as they wished, and were invited to discuss the 
results with a psychologist. 
 
Not all of the parents of children scoring at the ‘significant’ level on the VABS 
maladaptive behaviour domain had identified behaviour as a particular problem at the 
interview.  However, when parents did report that their child had behavioural problems, 
most of those children scored at the ‘significant’ level on the VABS.  It is possible that 
some parents reported behavioural problems only if they were causing concern.  These 
findings suggest an element of under-reporting amongst parents, which has also been 
noted by other investigators.[6]  Some parents may have accepted their child’s 
challenging behaviours and may not perceive them as abnormal, particularly if there are 
no other children in the family for comparison.  Another factor may be that some 
unusual behaviours were identified only when parents were asked specific questions as 
part of the VABS assessment, for example: ‘is your child negativistic or defiant?’, or ‘is 
your child stubborn or sullen?’. 
 
According to parents, only three children in the severe group, and three in the mild 
group had been assessed and had received clinical input from a psychologist following 
the TBI.  One of these children was seeing a psychiatrist for behavioural problems.  This 
left 34 children currently exhibiting significant maladaptive behaviours who had 
apparently never received a psychological assessment following their TBI until this 
research project was carried out.  Indeed, for several parents, the fact that their child 
would be formally assessed was perceived as an advantage of taking part in this study. 
 
We found that not all teachers knew about the TBI, particularly if it occurred over a year 
ago.  Consequently, teachers rarely associated behavioural problems and poor school 
 
16

performance with the TBI, and allowances were often not made.  If left unresolved, 
behavioural problems could lead to the child being formally disciplined by school-
teachers.  Teachers gave the following examples of difficult children: “A is very difficult 
to cope with in class, argues, is late, refuses to work, inappropriate behaviour, singing, 
laughing, loud, mood swings”; “B can be very disruptive and aggressive, he will attack 
other pupils without provocation”; “C can be disruptive, calling out, argumentative; he 
finds it difficult to accept praise or help”, “D is disruptive, lacks co-operation, is 
aggressive, has inability to complete work”; “E has a poor attention span, is very quick 
to retaliate to small things i.e. hits someone for calling him a name”; “F is withdrawn at 
times, non-responsive, with occasional violence”. 
 
Behavioural problems could lead to permanent exclusion from school.  This was often 
due to poor anger management coupled with violence.  Teachers gave examples of the 
reasons for permanent exclusion: “X: attack on acting head and class teacher”; “Y: 
extreme rudeness to staff, refused to work in class”; “Z: extreme violence towards 
another pupil.” 
 
The children in this study were of differing ages, therefore it was not possible to use the 
results of standard school examinations and assessments to measure school 
performance.  However, teachers reported that the majority of children in the severe 
group (79%), and half of the children in the mild and moderate groups, were having 
difficulties with their schoolwork, and approximately 40% of those with a TBI of any 
severity were performing below the average level for the class.  It is possible that, 
following a brain injury, some school-children may develop behavioural problems 
because they have difficulties keeping up with schoolwork, and may respond by 
becoming rude and disruptive in class.[32]  Other children may respond by becoming 
 
17

withdrawn, or avoiding school by truanting.  Although it was not possible within the 
limitations of this study to identify cause and effect, it is likely that cognitive and 
behavioural issues are inter-related.  Such a relationship is also noted by Ylvisaker and 
colleagues [33] who suggest that behaviour problems may be associated with general 
cognitive weakness, particularly if parents and teachers have inappropriate expectations 
for the child. 
 
There is evidence from the literature to suggest that pre-morbid characteristics of 
children suffering from TBI may have a significant effect on subsequent outcome.[13]  
Many of the children participating in this study had been injured more than one year 
before the interviews, consequently pre-morbid characteristics were difficult to ascertain 
with complete accuracy.  It was therefore not possible to clearly differentiate between 
behavioural problems which existed pre-morbidly and those which were caused by the 
TBI, and this is a limitation of the current study.  However, none of the children were 
described by their parents as having significant behavioural problems prior to the TBI.  
Special Educational Needs (SENs) had been identified for seven children (10.5%) in the 
TBI group prior to the injury, indicating some pre-morbid learning difficulties. This figure 
is not particularly high as, for England and Wales, on average approximately 20% of 
children aged 2-19 are identified as having some special educational needs.[34]  
 
At the time of the interviews almost half the children in the mild group, and one third of 
children in the severe group, had parents who were not living together.  Although 
attempts were made to match the control group to the TBI group according to number of 
parents, many single parents who were approached to join the control group did not 
wish to be interviewed.  Behavioural problems at school were reported by teachers for 
over half the children with divorced or separated parents.  Five of these marital 
 
18

breakdowns occurred after the child’s TBI.  High levels of stress have been observed 
amongst parents of children after TBI which may contribute to marital breakdown.[35]  
Kinsella et al found that the presence of two parents in a household was associated with 
lower ratings of behaviour problems in the child.[36]  Therefore the absence of one 
parent may place a child with TBI vulnerable to the development of behavioural 
problems.   
 
A limitation of this study is the small number of parents and children in the control group 
who permitted the research team to contact teachers.  However, the WISC-III, VABS 
and Townsend Index all have published normative values which permit comparison of 
the TBI group with a normal population of young people.  
 
Although the WISC-III is often used in studies of intellectual recovery after TBI, it is not 
particularly sensitive to neuropsychological sequelae of TBI.  It has been suggested that 
WISC scores may remain relatively high after TBI because of the nature of the test, part 
of which measures previously learned material, and because of the structured way in 
which it is administered whereby distractions are minimised, unlike in real-world 
situations.[37]  Therefore, although the mean WISC scores of our mild and moderate 
TBI groups were not significantly different from those of control children, this does not 
necessarily imply that these children were intellectually unimpaired.  It is therefore 
important that when individual children are being assessed, particularly with a view to 
the planning of therapeutic or educational interventions, a wide range of 
neuropsychological assessments should be used.[38]   
 
The development of behaviour problems can be affected by numerous factors, as 
described by Ylvisaker and colleagues [33], including academic failure, vulnerability 
 
19

related to the environment, pre-injury characteristics such as communication difficulties, 
post-injury interventions or expectations, social relationships and family relationships.  
In this study, we found associations between behavioural problems following TBI and 
school performance, intellectual ability, social deprivation and parental marital status. It 
was not possible to identify exactly how these elements are inter-related.  Behavioural 
problems after TBI have been linked with pre-injury behavioural and family functioning 
by several authors [16,39,40] and with social deprivation.[30]  Ewing-Cobbs et al [37] 
emphasise the importance of assessing the impact of moderator variables such as 
family environment and socioeconomic background on both cognitive and behavioural 
outcomes after TBI.  It is likely, therefore, that social deprivation and parental separation 
are risk factors for behavioural problems.  Future research should examine these issues 
in more detail using a group of children recruited prospectively.     
 
Children with behavioural problems disrupt not only their own education, but also that of 
their classmates.[22]  Consequently, it is important that children at risk of these 
problems are identified and supported.  In the USA, Ylvisaker and colleagues have 
proposed a school-based system for monitoring academic and behavioural performance 
amongst children with TBI as part of a school re-entry programme, designed as a safety 
net to avoid the potential downward spiral of academic failure and negative behaviours 
in response to such failure.[32,41]  The findings of the current study provides some 
evidence for the need for such a programme in the UK. 
 
Conclusions 
 
Children who have significant behavioural problems after TBI tend to perform poorly at 
school compared to their classmates, and are more likely to be excluded from school.  
 
20

They are likely to have experienced parental separation or are being cared for by a 
single parent.  They are also likely to come from an area with some degree of social 
deprivation.  We identified a large group of children, currently exhibiting significant 
maladaptive behaviours, who had never received a psychological assessment following 
their TBI.  It is recommended that children are screened for behavioural problems prior 
to their return to school, and school-teachers informed of the TBI, to ensure that these 
children receive the support they need to prevent failure at school and a possible 
deterioration in behaviour and academic performance.
