The purported advantages of second-generation or ‘atypical’ antipsychotics relative to first-generation antipsychotics have not been
examined in patients with a first episode of schizophrenia. This flexible-dose study examined efficacy and safety in a randomized, double-
blind, 52-week trial, comparing chlorpromazine (CPZ) and clozapine (CLZ) in treatment naive patients experiencing their first episode of
schizophrenia. In all, 160 inpatients with first-episode schizophrenia or schizophreniform disorder were randomized to CPZ or CLZ and
followed them for 52 weeks or until dropout. The primary efficacy measure was time to first remission and proportion of time remaining
in remission. The analysis was supplemented by comparisons on a profile of clinical symptoms and side effects. Of these first-episode
patients, 80% achieved remission within 1 year (79% CPZ, 81% CLZ). The Kaplan–Meier estimated median time to first remission was 8
weeks for CLZ vs 12 weeks for CPZ (w2(1) ¼ 5.56, p ¼ 0.02). Both the rate of first achieving remission and the odds for being in
remission during the trial were almost doubled for the CLZ group in comparison with the CPZ group. At 12 weeks, CLZ was superior
on many rating scale measures of symptom severity while CPZ was not superior on any. These symptom differences remained significant
when controlling for EPS differences. By 52 weeks many of the symptom differences between groups were no longer significantly
different. Generally, CLZ produced fewer side effects than CPZ, particularly extrapyramidal side effects. There was no significant
difference between treatments in weight change or glucose metabolism. For each prior year of untreated psychosis, there was a 15%
decrease in the odds of achieving remission (OR ¼ 0.85; CI 0.75–0.95). A high proportion of first-episode patients remitted within 1 year.
We detected no difference in the proportion of first-episode patients receiving CLZ or CPZ that achieved remission. However, first-
episode patients receiving CLZ remitted significantly faster and remained in remission longer than subjects receiving CPZ. While the CLZ
group showed significantly less symptomatology on some measures and fewer side effects at 12 weeks, the two treatment groups
seemed to converge by 1 year. Longer duration of untreated psychosis was associated with lower odds of achieving remission.

INTRODUCTION
Historically, the prognoses of patients diagnosed with
schizophrenia were considered variable and pessimistic
(Kraeplin, 1919). This is because schizophrenia was believed
to be a brain disorder that was expressed in abnormal
mental functions, which characteristically appeared in the
late second and third decades of life, and usually led to a
chronic or recurrent course that produced clinical dete-
rioration in the form of persistent symptoms, impairments
in social and work functions, and erosion of the personality
(McGlashan, 1988).
Following their introduction in the 1950s, conventional
antipsychotic medications, or neuroleptics, were shown to
suppress the acute psychotic symptoms of the disorder and
prevent their recurrence. However, many patients were
found to be unresponsive to neuroleptics and it was
generally believed that, despite their ability to suppress
symptoms, they did not change the long-term course of the
disorder or improve the outcome (Hegarty et al, 1994). In
addition, neuroleptics were associated with high rates of
neurological side effects (ie acute extrapyramidal signs
(EPS) and tardive dyskinesia (TD)), which compromised
the therapeutic effects of treatment and impelled many

patients to discontinue treatment, which led to higher
relapse rates.
In contrast, studies of patients in the first episode of their
illness demonstrated high rates of therapeutic response and
symptomatic remission in comparison with chronic pa-
tients with multiple prior episodes (Lieberman et al, 1993,
1998; Sheitman et al, 1997; Lieberman et al, 1998). At the
same time, they also experienced high rates of neurological
side effects to neuroleptic drugs (Chatterjee et al, 1995;
Chakos et al, 1996). In general, first-episode patients
appeared to be more sensitive to the pharmacologic effects
of antipsychotic drugs than older chronic patients in that
they exhibited higher rates of recovery, more frequent
extrapyramidal side effects, and required lower drug doses
(Lieberman et al, 1998; McEvoy et al, 1991). However,
following their recovery first-episode patients experienced
a high rate of psychotic relapse particularly if they
discontinued antipsychotic medication (Crow et al, 1986;
Robinson et al, 1999).
The
advent
of
the
second-generation
or
so-called
‘atypical’ antipsychotic drugs was heralded as a therapeutic
advance in the treatment of schizophrenia and related
psychotic disorders. It was claimed that atypical antipsy-
chotics had a different mechanism of action and were more
effective and safer than conventional antipsychotics (Kinon
and Lieberman, 1996). However, these claims are only
partially supported by empirical data, and there is a
substantial variation in opinion among researchers and
clinicians about their comparative effectiveness (Leucht et
al, 1999; Geddes et al, 2000; Chakos et al, 2001). Since their
introduction into clinical practice, atypical antipsychotic
drugs
have
been
examined
in
comparison
with
the
conventional antipsychotics in heterogeneous patient sam-
ples predominantly comprising chronically ill patients
whose symptoms may have been (partially) resistant to
treatment. The question of the comparative efficacy and
safety of these two classes of antipsychotic drugs has not
been examined in first-episode patients beyond short-term
trials (Emsley, 1999; Sanger et al, 1999). Indeed this
question has considerable importance, since first-episode
patients are highly responsive to pharmacologic treatment,
and the first treatment intervention in drug naive patients is
a critical therapeutic opportunity that has the potential to
influence the course and outcome of what could be a
lifelong illness (Lieberman, 1996). This is particularly the
case because longer duration in the first episode of
psychosis has been associated with poorer treatment
response and outcome (Norman and Malla, 2001). Thus,
the rapidity and maintenance of treatment response, as well
as tolerability, which is associated with treatment adher-
ence, may be important factors in determining the outcome.
Our hypothesis was that clozapine (CLZ), the prototypical
second-generation antipsychotic, had superior efficacy in
first-episode patients when compared to a representative
conventional antipsychotic. When this study was conceived,
CLZ was the only second-generation antipsychotic mar-
keted in any part of the world. By the mid-1990s, CLZ was,
depending on the location, the first or second most
commonly used antipsychotic in China (Wu and Wu,
1995; Phillips, 2001). Although in most Western countries
CLZ is used as a second-line treatment because of its
hematological toxicity (Herz et al, 1997), in China it is often
used in the first episode of illness. Given this set of
circumstances, we felt it was experimentally feasible and
clinically justifiable to examine the efficacy of CLZ in first-
episode patients in China.
METHODS
Setting
The study was conducted at the Beijing Hui Long Guan
Hospital, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in China,
which is located 30 km from central Beijing and serves a
catchment area population of 13 million people. Dr Phillips
has worked in the PRC since 1985 and is the Director of the
Research Center of Clinical Epidemiology at the Hui Long
Guan Hospital. The study protocol was designed by the first
and
second
authors
(JL
and
MP).
It
conformed
to
international
standards
for
research
ethics
and
was
approved by the Research Review Board of the Beijing
Bureau of Health prior to its initiation and monitored
annually while in progress. Funding for the study and
medication
supplies
were
provided
by
the
Novartis
Pharmaceutical Company. The authors had unrestricted
access to the data; company personnel were not involved in
the analysis of the data nor did they have any authority over
publication.
Subjects
All hospital admissions were screened from October 1995 to
December 1998 for patients who met the following criteria:
(1) diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophreniform dis-
order; (2) duration of symptoms not longer than 60 months;
(3) no prior treatment with antipsychotic medication or, if
previously treated, a total lifetime usage of less than 14 days;
(4) between 16 and 40 years of age; and (5) current
psychotic
symptoms
of
moderate
severity
or
greater
measured by one of the five psychotic items in the Brief
Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Patients meeting these
criteria, and their families, provided written informed
consent to participate.
Procedures
Patients’ diagnoses were based on the results of the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID) using the
criteria of the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual (DSM-IV), physical exams and routine chemistry,
and hematology laboratory tests. Attending-level psychia-
trists used a Chinese translation of the SCID to interview
patients and their family members, and were given freedom
to ask additional questions if respondents did not under-
stand the standard probes. There are no major difficulties in
employing DSM IV criteria to diagnose schizophrenia in
China; current Chinese diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia
are similar to ICD-10 criteria, but many locations also use
DSM IV criteria. Patients were randomized to treatment
with CLZ plus benztropine (BZ) placebo or chlorpromazine
(CPZ) and BZ under double-blind conditions. Medication
dosages were increased using a standardized regimen
during the first 28 days of admission (to a maximum of
400 mg/day of CLZ or 600 mg/day of CPZ) and then adjusted

based on the clinical response and side effects. Patients
taking CPZ were also given 2 mg BZ twice a day and those
on CLZ were given the corresponding placebos. Patients
received inpatient care for 12 weeks (a typical length of stay
in Chinese psychiatric hospitals), and were then followed as
outpatients on a monthly basis for the subsequent 9
months. After the initial 12-month study period, patients
were eligible to enter a double-blind extension phase of the
study that is still under way.
Patients dropped out of the study because of withdrawal
of consent by patients or family members, failure of
treatment to relieve symptoms, or severe side effects.
Detailed treatment adherence information was recorded;
all patients in the study continued the clinical and side
effect evaluations as per schedule even if noncompliance
occurred, in order to ensure the completeness of data on the
total sample.
Assessments
Patients were evaluated using the Chinese version of the
BPRS (Phillips et al, 1990), the Chinese version of the Scale
for Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), (Phillips et
al, 1991), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), Global
Assessment of Function Scale (GAF), the Simpson Angus
Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (SAESS) (with sialorrhea
omitted because of its well-known connection with CLZ)
and for side effects at study entry, weekly for weeks 1–6,
biweekly for weeks 6–12, at hospital discharge, and at 3-
monthly intervals following discharge. Side effects were
recorded using the Coding Symbol and Thesaurus for
Adverse
Event
Terminology
(COSTART)
classification
terms at each assessment visit. EKGs were performed at
study entry, weeks 12 and 52. All patients underwent
venipunctures to monitor white blood counts (WBC) weekly
while inpatients and monthly after discharge. Serum glucose
was assessed under fasting conditions at study entry, week
12, and every 3 months after discharge. Weight was not
measured regularly by the protocol or hospital procedure.
Consequently, only subgroups of patients in this trial had
baseline and follow-up weights. Moreover, most of the
follow-up weights were taken after the 52-week period of the
formal trial and were not standardized in terms of
frequency and time intervals. Since patients who success-
fully completed the trial were continued on their study
medication in a blinded follow-up phase of the study
thereafter, we included the first available follow-up weight
of each patient in the analysis (n ¼ 57 for CPZ and n ¼ 58
for CLZ).
Statistical Methods
The primary measure for treatment efficacy is remission,
which was defined a priori as a 50% reduction in total BPRS
score from baseline with no score greater than mild (3) on
the 5 BPRS psychosis items (unusual thought content,
suspiciousness, hallucinations, conceptual disorganization,
mannerisms, and posturing) and a CGI-severity item of
mild (3) or less. Using an intent-to-treatment (ITT)
population, we compared the time to first remission
between the two treatments using Kaplan–Meier estimates
for their survival curves, and refined the model by
controlling for baseline BPRS, gender, duration of untreated
psychosis (DUP), and age of onset in Cox proportional
hazard regression. Owing to the recurrence of remissions
and relapses, we identified the week-by-week remission
status for each patient during the first 12 weeks of treatment
and then monthly thereafter evaluated the overall remission
status by taking the proportion of weeks on remission over
the total number of weeks followed for each individual, and
modeled it using generalized estimating equation (GEE)
logistic regression with robust standard error estimates for
the possible overdispersion caused by correlated responses
within patients.
For secondary efficacy measures, we looked at the BPRS,
SANS, CGI, and GAF scores at the end of inpatient
treatment (12 weeks) and at the end of the study (52
weeks). We compared the CPZ and CLZ groups using
ANCOVA models controlling for baseline, gender, duration,
and age of onset of psychotic symptoms. The possible
interactions between treatment and covariates were tested
and explored in further detail if significant. The comparison
was conducted using both the completers at the time point
(observed cases (OC)) and the ITT patient population with
missing values filled in from the last available observation
(last observation carried forward (LOCF)).
The clinical and laboratory parameters (percentage of
polymorphonuclear neutrophils and lymphocytes, WBC,
glucose, heart rate, and EKG QT interval) and severity of
side effects (total SAESS score and parkinsonism subscale)
were compared between the two groups using ANCOVA
models
similar
to
those
for
the
continuous
efficacy
measures. For recurrent adverse events (COSTART terms),
we recoded all the ranking scales (0–3) higher than 0 for the
presence of the side effects. The transformation from
ranking to binary scale was conservative; however, by
pooling sparse observations of higher rank responses, we
were able to get more reliable estimates of odds ratios. The
proportion of visits recorded with occurrence was then
modeled for each adverse event using the GEE logistic
regression similar to that for remission.
The test on primary outcome used a two-sided alpha-level
of 0.05. Other tests on numerous clinical measures and side
effects were conducted as secondary analysis to supplement
our major finding. Our focus was on the efficacy and safety
profiles of CLZ and CPZ, instead of on any specific score. p-
Values from the tests for the 14 subscale scores considered
were reported and no multiple comparison adjustment was
applied.
RESULTS
Description of Study Cohort
Of 2708 patients screened for the study, 171 met the criteria
for first-episode patients. Of these, 164 patients consented
to study participation, 81 were randomized to CLZ, and 83
to CPZ. However, one patient in the CLZ and three in the
CPZ group withdrew before the first administration of
medication. Thus, the valid number of patients in each
treatment group was 80 (Figure 1).
The two treatment groups were comparable in age,
gender, diagnosis, baseline symptom severity, and duration
and age of onset of psychotic symptoms. Patients ranged in

age from 15 to 42 (mean[SD], 28.7[6.9]) years; 48% were
female, all were Chinese. (Some patients older than the
enrollment criteria were included because their actual age
(by their birth certificate) was greater than the age they
reported at the time of admission.) Among them 52.5% were
diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia; 23.1% with un-
differentiated schizophrenia; and 24.4% with schizophreni-
form disorder. The first psychotic symptom occurred at the
mean age of 27.2[6.5] (median ¼ 26.9) in this group of
patients. At the time of study entry, patients had had
psychotic symptoms for an average of 18.4[17.8] months
(median ¼ 10.7). At baseline, the average symptom severity
score was 43.8[5.1] for total BPRS, 5.6[0.6] for CGI, and
35.8[7.8] for GAF.
The median doses (mg/day) at 12 weeks and at the end of
1-year follow-up were 400 and 300, respectively, for CLZ,
and 600 and 400 for CPZ. Nine CPZ- and 10 CLZ-treated
patients withdrew their consent and dropped out of the
study. Three patients were withdrawn for lack of efficacy in
the CPZ group. Six CPZ-treated and two CLZ-treated
patients were withdrawn for adverse effects. No severe
noncompliance occurred during the acute inpatient phase,
but 26 of 72 (36%) CPZ and 23 of 71 (32%) CLZ patients
took less than 50% of their prescribed medications, as
determined by pill counts, for more than 1 month after
discharge. The overall attrition rates were similar at week 12
for CPZ and CLZ groups at 10% and 11%, respectively. By
the end of study, more patients had dropped out or been
withdrawn in CPZ (22.5%) than in CLZ (15%) group, but
this difference was not statistically significant (Figure 1).
Efficacy
Remission. In all, 79% of patients (63/80) on CPZ and 81%
(65/80) on CLZ had remitted before leaving or completing
52 weeks in the study.

(w2(1) ¼ 4.10, p ¼ 0.04 by Log-Rank test). It took 8 weeks of
treatment for half the patients in the CLZ group to achieve
their first remission compared to 12 weeks in the CPZ group
(w2(1) ¼ 5.56, p ¼ 0.02 by Wilcoxon test). The Cox-regres-
sion model adjusting for baseline total BPRS, patient sex,
DUP, and age of first psychotic symptoms found that the
remission rate was almost twice as fast in the CLZ group as
in the CPZ group (hazard ratio ¼ 1.69, 95% CI (1.18, 2.44),
p ¼ 0.005).
The GEE logistic regression model found that patients
in the CLZ group spent a significantly larger propor-
tion of time in remission than the CPZ group. Con-
trolling for gender, baseline total BPRS, DUP, and age
of onset of psychotic symptoms, the odds for being
in remission was almost doubled for the CLZ group
than
the
CPZ
group
(odds
ratio ¼ 1.73(1.20, 2.50),
p ¼ 0.003). The model also identified a significant effect
for the DUP on remission status. With a 1-year increase in
untreated psychosis, the odds of being in remission were
reduced by nearly 15% (odds ratio ¼ 0.85 (0.75, 0.95),
p ¼ 0.006).
BPRS and other clinical measurements at the end of
inpatient treatment. In the completer analysis, controlling
for baseline, gender, DUP, and age of onset, patients who
completed 12 weeks of inpatient treatment in the CLZ group
experienced significantly greater reductions in psycho-
pathology than CPZ on multiple rating scales including
total BPRS, the BPRS Anergia Factor, total SANS, SANS
Affective, Poverty of Speech, Avolition, and Anhedonia
subscales, CGI severity and the GAF scales. In the LOCF
analysis, CLZ evidenced significantly superior efficacy in
the BPRS Anergia Factor, total SANS, SANS Affective and
Avolition subscales, and was almost significant on the GAF
scale (Table 1).
The analysis also found that patients with longer prior
illness duration had higher total BPRS scores at 12 weeks
(F(1,138) ¼ 6.83, p ¼ 0.01, OC) after controlling for their
baseline scores, indicating a relation between DUP and
therapeutic response. Similar findings supporting worse
psychopathology with longer duration of untreated psycho-
tic symptoms were found in other BPRS and SANS
subscales (BPRS Anergia Factor (F(1,138) ¼ 8.02, po0.01,
OC;
F(1,154) ¼ 5.93,
p ¼ 0.02,
LOCF),
total
SANS
(F(1,138) ¼ 6.95, p ¼ 0.01, OC; F(1,154) ¼ 8.55, po0.01,

Anhedonia (F(1,138) ¼ 6.52, po0.01, OC; F(1,154) ¼ 8.46,
po0.01, LOCF), and attention deficit (F(1,138) ¼ 17.01,
po0.01, OC; F(1,154) ¼ 16.69, po0.01, LOCF).
Since the major efficacy advantage of CLZ at 12 weeks was
on negative symptom scores, to rule out the possibility that
they were because of worse EPS in the CPZ group, we
repeated the analysis of symptom reduction by treatment
controlling for 12-week Parkinsonism severity. The changes
in major findings were minimal. A significant efficacy
advantage of CLZ over CPZ at week 12 was shown on BPRS
total (F(1,137) ¼ 3.89; p ¼ 0.05), SANS total (F(1,137) ¼ 6.17;
p ¼ 0.01), affective flattening (F(1,137) ¼ 10.52; po0.01),
avolition (F(1,137) ¼ 4.45; p ¼ 0.04), CGI (F(1,137) ¼ 5.48;
p ¼ 0.02), and GAF (F(1,137) ¼ 5.28; p ¼ 0.02) using OC
population; and on BPRS anergy (F(1,153) ¼ 4.00; p ¼ 0.05)
and SANS affective flattening (F(1,153) ¼ 10.48; po0.01)
with all ITT population using LOCF.
At 52 weeks there were no differences between the
treatment groups on measurements of symptoms. Since the
attrition rates were different in the two groups (22.5% in
CPZ and 15% in CLZ), an exploratory analysis was
conducted that compared BPRS total scores at discharge
between the patients who dropped out during follow up vs
those remaining on treatment. The dropouts in the CPZ

group had significantly higher BPRS scores (26.0[7.5]) at
discharge than the other three groups (22.1[5.0] for CPZ on-
treatment, 20.6[4.1] for CLZ on-treatment, and 20.3[2.5] for
CLZ dropouts). The dropout of sicker patients on CPZ may
have contributed to the lack of a persistent difference
between the two groups in the LOCF analysis at 52 weeks.
There were 14 rehospitalizations in weeks 13–52. Five
patients on CPZ had a total of seven rehospitalizations while
six patients on CLZ had seven rehospitalizations. There
were no known suicide attempts by any study participants
in the 1st year of the study.
Safety
Extrapyramidal symptoms. The means for the total SAESS
and Parkinsonism are listed in Table 2. Despite the use
of prophylactic BZ, the CPZ group consistently showed
more EPS than the CLZ group. At both weeks 12 and 52,
patients receiving CPZ had significantly higher total scores
on the Simpson Angus Scale and the Parkinsonism subscale
with OC analysis. The LOCF analysis corroborated the
significant difference at 12 weeks, but the 52 weeks
comparison was again not significant. The ANCOVA model
also found that females had more severe Parkinsonism than
males
at
week
12
(F(1,138) ¼ 5.51,
p ¼ 0.02,
OC;
F(1,154) ¼ 5.30, p ¼ 0.02, LOCF), but the difference was
not significant at week 52.
Other side effects. Individual adverse events with significant
treatment effects are listed in Table 3. Over the course of
study follow up, the CLZ treatment group was at a
significantly lower risk for developing side effect symptoms
such as dystonia, blurred vision, muscle tension, dry mouth,
akathisia, objectively observed restlessness, and decreased
urine production, and showed an increased risk for
sweating and a marginally increased risk for depressed
affect. As stated earlier, eight patients were withdrawn
because of adverse effects; six from CPZ (constipation,
hyperthermia, ileus, dermatitis, neutropenia, EPS) and two
from CLZ (hyperthermia, hypotension). One patient (35-
year-old male) died at week 10 of treatment with CPZ while
in the hospital after developing hyperthermia (41.5 C) and
leukocytosis (16 300 with 78% neutrophils) but no rigidity
or marked alteration of consciousness. The cause of death
was determined to be hyperthermia possibly because of
viral encephalitis. (This event occurred in summer during a
heat wave in Beijing.)
At study entry the CLZ and CPZ groups had similar total
WBC
(7887[2270]),
percentages
of
polymorphonuclear
neutrophiles (64%[8%]) and lymphocytes (36%[8%]), fast-

there were no significant differences between the two drugs
for total WBC or glucose level. OC analysis found a lower
percent of neutrophiles and higher lymphocytes at week 12
for patients taking CLZ (F(1,102) ¼ 5.75, p ¼ 0.02 and
F(1,102) ¼ 5.12, p ¼ 0.03, respectively), but it was not
supported by the LOCF analysis, nor were the significant
findings maintained at week 52 by OC or LOCF analysis.

at 52 weeks (F(1,60) ¼ 6.88, p ¼ 0.01, OC; F(1,149) ¼ 6.70,
p ¼ 0.01, LOCF).
Weight. Baseline and follow-up weights were obtained for
72% of subjects (71% for CPZ and 73% for CLZ). The
median times for the first weight measurement during
follow-up were 131 weeks after starting medication for CPZ
vs 137.5 weeks after starting medication for CLZ. For the
available data, the mean weights were 60.3 kg (9.7) for CPZ
and 61.6 kg (10.1) for CLZ at baseline; and 68.8 kg (12.0) and
71.5 kg (13.3) for CPZ vs CLZ at the first follow-up, which
was significant by an ANCOVA model of weight change
(controlling for gender, baseline weight, age of first onset
and duration of psychotic symptoms and follow-up); weight
increases
from
baseline
to
follow-up
(F(1,108) ¼ 36.6,
po0.01). However, the difference in the mean weight gain
for CPZ (6.5 kg) and CLZ (9.9 kg) was not statistically
significant (F(1,108) ¼ 1.10, p ¼ 0.30).
DISCUSSION
This study is the first to examine the long-term outcome of
treatment-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients in
response to atypical and conventional antipsychotic drugs
in the context of a randomized double-blind controlled trial.
These results are consistent with prior studies in Western
countries, which demonstrated that first-episode patients
are capable of having good therapeutic responses to
antipsychotic medications (Lieberman et al, 1993; Sheitman
et al, 1997; Robinson et al, 1999). Moreover, the demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of the sample, including
the duration of prior psychotic symptoms, were comparable
to those of patients in prior studies from Western countries
further indicating the generalizability of these findings
(Sanger et al, 1999; Crow et al, 1986; Loebel et al, 1992;
Johannesen et al, 2001). The slightly later age of onset
reported by patients in this study (mean 27.2 years) relative
to that reported in Western countries is an interesting
finding that deserves further investigation. The relation
between increased duration of psychosis with poorer
treatment outcome is consistent with most (Loebel et al,
1992; Wyatt, 1999; Szymanski et al, 1996) but not all (Beng-
Choon et al, 2000; Craig et al, 2000; Barnes et al, 2000) prior
studies. The study’s results also suggest that CLZ, the
prototype of atypical drugs, may have superior benefits to
conventional medications reflected by faster treatment
responses, significantly improved better short-term efficacy,
more time spent in remission, reduced EPS and other

adverse side effects, and better retention of patients in
treatment. The prophylactic use of 4 mg per day of BZ in the
CPZ group may have contributed to some of the antic-
holinergic side effects. At the same time, CLZ was associated
with more sweating and increased heart rates. Sialorrhea
was not assessed in this study but is known to be common
with CLZ use. In spite of the previously reported association
of CLZ and other atypical antipsychotic drugs on glucose
metabolism
(Henderson
et
al,
2000),
there
were
no
significant differences between treatments in this trial.
Although weights were not systematically obtained, both
CPZ and CLZ were associated with substantial weight gain
consistent with previous studies (Allison et al, 1999).
Cholesterol and triglyceride elevations, which have also
been associated with CLZ treatment, were not assessed
(Henderson, 2000). CLZ -treated patients had higher heart
rates, but this did not cause any impairment to patients or
lead to treatment discontinuations.
Although the rapidity and amount of time in remission
was greater for CLZ, the two drugs did not differ on
symptom ratings at 52 weeks. The high degree of treatment
responsiveness of patients early in the course of schizo-
phrenia may make the demonstration of differences in
treatments on the long-term outcomes using traditional
measures of psychopathology difficult. Despite the potential
‘ceiling effect’, CLZ produced significantly better symptom
reductions than CPZ at 12 weeks. The failure to sustain the
significant differences in symptom reduction between CLZ
and CPZ beyond 12 weeks could have been because of more
posthospitalization dropouts among less responsive pa-
tients in the CPZ group than the CLZ group, thereby
decreasing the differences in improvement seen at 52 weeks
as suggested by the exploratory analysis. Thus, long-term
follow-up of all patients who entered the study including
those who dropped out would be informative. In addition, it
may be necessary to employ additional measures of
outcome beyond symptom ratings to characterize more
fully the treatment effects of antipsychotic drugs and
discern the potential advantages of CLZ as representative
of the atypicals. However, it is also debatable to what extent
the effects of CLZ in this patient population would
generalize to the other atypical agents. If, as these results
suggest, atypical drugs produce faster rates of symptom
remission, cause fewer side effects, and are associated with
better treatment adherence compared to conventional
drugs, then follow-up studies longer than 1 year may be
necessary to demonstrate putative benefits reflected by
reduced relapse rates, illness progression, changes in
cognitive functions, and cumulative morbidity. The full
extent of the potential superiority in treatment effects of the
atypical antipsychotic drugs may only be appreciated in the
context of very long-term outcome studies or after extensive
clinical
experience
with
these
compounds
in
a
new
generation of patients who receive them from the beginning
of their illness.
