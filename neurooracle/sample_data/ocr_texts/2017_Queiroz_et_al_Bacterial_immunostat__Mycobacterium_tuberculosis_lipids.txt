Abstract
The lipid-rich cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a dynamic structure that is involved in the regulation of the transport 
of nutrients, toxic host-cell effector molecules, and anti-tuberculosis drugs. It is therefore postulated to contribute to the long-
term bacterial survival in an infected human host. Accumulating evidence suggests that M. tuberculosis remodels the lipid 
composition of the cell wall as an adaptive mechanism against host-imposed stress. Some of these lipid species (trehalose 
dimycolate, diacylated sulphoglycolipid, and mannan-based lipoglycans) trigger an immunopathologic response, whereas 
others (phthiocerol dimycocerosate, mycolic acids, sulpholipid-1, and di-and polyacyltrehalose) appear to dampen the immune 
responses. These lipids appear to be coordinately expressed in the cell wall of M. tuberculosis during different phases of 
infection, ultimately determining the clinical fate of the infection. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on the 
metabolism, transport, and homeostatic or immunostatic regulation of the cell wall lipids, and their orchestrated interaction with 
host immune responses that results in bacterial clearance, persistence, or tuberculosis. 
Keywords: Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Lipids. Immune response.
INTRODUCTION
Tuberculosis remains an important underlying cause of death 
from lung disease worldwide. Exposure to Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis, a causative agent of tuberculosis, can result in 
immediate clearance, establishment of latent tuberculosis 
infection, a rapidly progressive disease, or reactivation disease1. 
More than 90% of otherwise healthy individuals who become 
newly infected with M. tuberculosis do not develop an active 
disease1. However, about 60% fail to eliminate the bacteria and 
they may remain infected for life1. It is currently not known 
why only a subset of those with latent tuberculosis infection 
progresses to develop active disease. Progression from latent 
infection to active disease mostly occurs in individuals without 
any obvious conditions related to the host. Furthermore, a subset 
of those who develop tuberculosis and complete a course of 
treatment will relapse. In human, the rate of relapse varies 
between 8-13%, depending on the prevalence of multidrug-
resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) in that population2. Various 
M. tuberculosis factors, as well as host factors, have been 
proposed to affect these clinical outcomes, but in this review, 
we discuss the possible role of M. tuberculosis cell wall lipids 
in determining these outcomes. 
During a pulmonary infection, aerosolized M. tuberculosis 
enters the lungs and encounters the alveolar air space. The 
alveolar air space is shaped by type I and II pneumocytes. 
Type I pneumocytes cover about 96% of the alveolar surface 
area, whereas type II cells cover about 4%3. Traditionally, 
it was thought that M. tuberculosis is engulfed by alveolar 
macrophages after entering the lungs, but the cellular 
architecture of the alveolar space suggests that M. tuberculosis 
will most likely interact with these pneumocytes ¿rst3. Later, 
macrophages and lymphocytes migrate to the site of infection 
and form a granuloma (reviewed in)4. 
One unique feature of M. tuberculosis is its lipid-rich envelope 
(Figure 1)5,6. About 40% of its cell-wall dry weight is comprised 
of lipids and, as such, a large portion of the coding capacity 
of the bacterial genome is devoted to lipid biosynthesis and 
degradation7. Several cell wall lipids are associated with a distinct 
host innate immune response during the early phase of infection. 
Differential expression of these lipids determines whether or not 
M. tuberculosis will enter a chronic phase of infection.
The ability of M. tuberculosis to persist within a host 
appears to rely on its beta-oxidation and glyoxylate metabolic 
cycles. In mouse, the bacterium utilizes fatty acids as an 
exclusive carbon source8. During the beta-oxidation cycle, 
even chain fatty acids are catabolized into acetyl coenzyme A 
(acetyl-CoA), and odd chain fatty acids into acetyl-CoA and

propionyl-CoA8,9. The bacillus prevents toxic accumulation 
of propionyl-CoA by synthesizing methylmalonyl-CoA-based 
lipids [phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), sulpholipid-1 
(SL-1), and di- and polyacyltrehalose], as suggested by Muñoz-
Elías et al.10. Glyoxylate cycle converts acetyl-CoA molecules 
derived from fatty acid beta-oxidation into tricarboxylic acid 
cycle intermediates11. In addition, acetyl-CoA is a substrate 
for mycolic acid (MA), a malonyl-CoA-based lipid11,12. 
M. tuberculosis adjusts its lipid metabolism as it encounters 
limiting nutrient conditions imposed by the host. By 
alternatively activating the two pathways, the bacteria synthesize 
both methylmalonyl- and malonyl-based lipids, which allow  
M. tuberculosis to establish persistence. 
Here, we will ¿rst review the effect of other M. tuberculosis 
cell wall lipids [trehalose dimycolate (TDM) and mannan-
based lipoglycans] during the early, innate immunity phase of 
interaction with the host. Then, we will review the interaction 
between the products of lipid beta-oxidation and the host that 
becomes important during the transition into a chronic infection 
phase when host adaptive immunity sets in. These lipid-induced 
immune responses are summarized in Table 1.
EARLY PHASE OF INFECTION AND 
MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS  
LIPID METABOLISM
The innate immune system comprises the first line of 
host defense against M. tuberculosis. As part of this initial 
response, pattern recognition receptors Toll-like receptor 
(TLR)-2 and TLR-4 on alveolar macrophages and dendritic 
cells (and probably also on pneumocytes) engage in recognizing 
TDM (6,6'-dimycoloyl-α-d-trehalose) and mannosylated 
lipoarabinomannan of M. tuberculosis13,14.
Trehalose dimycolate
Trehalose dimycolate, formerly referred to as cord factor, 
is a glycolipid where a disaccharide is linked to two mycolyl 
chains. Its precursor, trehalose monomycolate (TMM), has only 
one mycolate chain.
The cord factor has long been described as a virulence factor 
of M. tuberculosis. Division of the H37 strain into highly virulent 
(H37Rv) and avirulent (H37Rva) variants according to speci¿c 
culture characteristics led Middlebrook et al.15 to link bacterial 
morphology in liquid and solid media to strain virulence. A 
parenteral injection of the cord factor was toxic to mice and 
inhibited leukocyte migration16. The toxic compound was later 
identi¿ed as TDM17. Injection of TDM into mouse lungs elicited 
granulomatous response18.
Cell wall MAs are normally covalently linked to other 
molecules, such as TDM and arabinogalactan. Recently, 
Cantrell et al.19 and Ojha et al.20 reported that M. tuberculosis 
cell wall contains unattached MA (free MA or FM)  
(Figure 1). One potential source of FM is the hydrolysis of 
TDM. Ojha et al.21 identi¿ed a gene Msmeg_1529 that encodes 
a cutinase-like serine carboxyesterase responsible for TDM 
hydrolysis in Mycobacterium smegmatis. The enzymatic 
activity of Msmeg_1529 was speci¿c for puri¿ed TDM from 
M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis21. Among seven cutinase-
like proteins with esterase activities previously described in  
M. tuberculosis, the authors suggested that Rv3452 is a possible 
TDM hydrolase in M. tuberculosis because of its closest 
relatedness to Msmeg_152921. Indeed, it was shown later that 
Rv3452, and also Rv3451, share > 50% amino acid similarity 
with Msmeg_152922. Experiments revealed that Rv3451 is the 
primary TDM hydrolase in M. tuberculosis22. Thus, TDM may 
be one source of FM. In fact, Yang et al.22 estimated that about 
20% of FM in the cell wall may be derived from the hydrolysis 
of TDM.
Ishikawa et al.23 showed that macrophage inducible C-type 
lectin (Mincle) is a receptor for mycobacterial TDM. The 
activation of Mincle leads macrophages to produce nitric oxide 
and induce the production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and 
MIP-2 (also called CXCL2), and a subsequent granuloma 
formation23.
An alternative model for macrophage activation involves a 
myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent response 
to TDM14,24,25. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) 
from MyD88-knocked out were not able to produce pro-
inÀammatory cytokines in response to TDM-coated polystyrene 
microspheres24. Bowdish et al.25 proposed a model, where 
macrophage receptor with collagenous structure (MARCO), a 
class A scavenger receptor, cooperates with TLR-2 and cluster 
of differentiation 14 (CD14) in TDM recognition and signaling 
to mount an ef¿cient inÀammatory response to M. tuberculosis. 
Using deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) microarrays, Sakamoto  
et al.14 evaluated a transcriptional response of BMMs to TDM-

coated microspheres and showed that matrix metalloproteinases 
(MMPs) 8, 9, 12, 13, 14, and 19, were up-regulated in a 
MyD88-dependent manner after stimulation with TDM. Matrix 
metalloproteinases are a family of enzymes implicated in 
tissue remodeling and chronic inÀammation conditions, and 
are involved in granuloma formation, cavitation, and ¿brous 
granuloma capsule breakdown26.
Mycolic acids
Originally, MAs have not been described as lipids that 
play a role in the early phase of immune response to infection. 
However, it has been since suggested that some FMs in the 
bacterial cell wall are derived from the hydrolysis of TDM22 
and may interact with host cells to induce some type of innate 
immune response.
In fact, MAs are the major lipids of a protective layer 
of cell wall, serving as structural units of the cell wall and 
envelope (Figure 1). They exist in homologous series of fatty 
acids differing by 28 atomic mass units (a two-carbon unit). 
In M. tuberculosis, these are extremely hydrophobic C54–C63 
fatty acids with C22–C24 α side chains27. Three classes of  
M. tuberculosis MAs exist, alpha, keto, and methoxy-MA27,28; 
they differ in the functional groups attached to the meromycolate 
portion of the molecule.
Mycolic acid induces the accumulation of cholesterol inside 
peritoneal and alveolar macrophages. Macrophages containing 
cholesterol and lipid droplets resemble foamy macrophage 
derivatives observed in tuberculous granulomas29. InÀammatory 
response to intratracheal instillation of different doses of MA or 
TDM was compared; TDM was less effective in inducing the 
production of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-12. However, TDM was 
very effective in inducing tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), 
a unique property of this glycolipid. Experiments with TLR-
2- and TLR-4-de¿cient mice yielded similar results, excluding 
these receptors as potential pattern recognition targets of MA29. 
Recently, Sequeira et al.30 showed that FM can inhibit TLR-2-
mediated pro-inÀammatory response in RAW 264.7 cells and 
in human lung epithelial cells (A549).
Indeed, MA may constitute a scaffold for the stimulation 
of CD1-restricted T cells by mycobacterial lipid antigens31. 
When the antigenicity of glycerol monomycolate (GroMM) was 
evaluated, the hydroxyl group of glycerol and MA chain length 
were shown to be critical for triggering T cell responses31. It was 
previously demonstrated that FM stimulates CD1b-restricted 
T cells, indicating that this structure might form stimulatory 
complexes with CD1b32.
Minor structural alterations of trehalose-attached MA have 
a profound effect on murine pro-inÀammatory response. MA 
cyclopropane ring is required for virulence and long-term 
persistence of pathogenic mycobacteria in mice33,34. Also, the 
relative differences in the amounts of keto- and methoxy-MA 
inÀuence the intra-macrophage growth rate of M. tuberculosis35 
and the absence of keto- and methoxy-MA is associated with 
bacterial attenuation in mice36.
The abundance of MA in M. tuberculosis cell wall appears 
to affect the course of tuberculosis in infected people. The 
putative mycobacterial transporter mce1 might play a role in 
the regulation of cell wall MA abundance in M. tuberculosis. 
M. tuberculosis has four homologs of mce operon (mce1–4) 
encoding ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) 
possibly involved in lipid import7,37,38. Cantrell et al.19 and 
Forrellad et al.39 reported that disruption of mce1 operon results 
in a M. tuberculosis mutant that accumulates several-fold 
more FM in its cell wall than wild type bacteria. Both groups 
suggested that the operon might encode an importer system 
involved in recycling of MA. Also, disruption of the mce1operon 
renders the cells hypervirulent in mice40,41. The mutant is unable 
to induce a strong T-helper 1 (Th1) type T cell immune response 
and organized granuloma formation in lungs41. Taken together, 
these observations suggest that the mce1 operon is involved in 
the remodeling of M. tuberculosis cell wall, dampening pro-
inÀammatory response in mouse that is associated with rapid 
progression to death40,41. The operon is not expressed in the wild 
type strain during the ¿rst 4-8 weeks of infection in mouse42, 
suggesting that the M. tuberculosis cell wall lipid pro¿le can be 
altered according to the course and/or time of infection.
Free mycolic acid (FM), a major compound involved in 
bio¿lm formation20,21, is released from TDM at some point in 
late infection; the latter is recognized for its ability to activate 
the innate immune response14,23. At that infection stage, (1) the 
capacity of M. tuberculosis to induce pro-inÀammatory response 
is diminished; (2) the bacterium becomes drug tolerant22; and 
(3) nutrient uptake increases as the host imposes bacterial 
starvation22.
Queiroz et al.43 used high-resolution quantitative time-of-
Àight liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and identi¿ed 
26 acyl forms of lipid species whose levels were either decreased 
or increased in mce1 mutant compared with wild type. The 
mutant strain showed lower levels of different acyl forms of 
diacyltrehalose (DAT), diacylated sulphoglycolipids (Ac2SGL), 
PDIM, and phosphatidylethanolamine; and increased levels 
of acyl forms of alpha-, keto-, and methoxy-MA species and 
hydroxyphthioceranic acid43. These cell wall changes appeared 
to profoundly affect the host response, perhaps ultimately 
determining the clinical outcome in an infected host. 
Mannan-based lipoglycans
Cell wall-associated lipids, such as phosphatidyl-myo-
inositol mannosides (PIM), and the glycolipids lipomannan 
(LM) and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), play a key role in 
modulating the host response during infection by interacting 
with different receptors on macrophages and dendritic cells44. 
The structure and biosynthesis of PIM, LM, and LAM have 
already been reviewed45,46,47.
Much of the literature focuses on the role of these molecules 
in maintaining mycobacterial cell wall integrity48 and growth49, 
but PIMs, LM, LAM, and mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan 
(Man-LAM) (Figure 1) also play an important role in host 
defense, and hence, induction of host responses. Interestingly, 
LM, LAM, Man-LAM, and PIMs  distinctly modulate the host 
immune response. Both phospho-myo-inositol-dimannoside 
(PIM2) and phospho-myo-inositol-hexamannoside (PIM6) have

been described as agonists of TLR-250,51; Dao et al.52 showed 
that LM but not PIM2 strongly induces IL-12 production and 
apoptosis. On the other hand, LAM inhibits IL-12 production 
by human dendritic cells and modulates M. tuberculosis-induced 
macrophage apoptosis53. Man-LAM mimics a mammalian cell 
mannose receptor, which enables M. tuberculosis to evade 
host defense mechanisms, inhibiting phagosome maturation by 
suppressing the production of IL-12 and TNF and increasing 
IL-10 production by dendritic cells or monocytic cells54.
Dao et al.52 postulated that the LM: LAM ratio in the 
mycobacterial cell wall can directly affect the virulence of  
M. tuberculosis and the outcome of an infection. LM  activates 
the inÀammatory response of the host. LM, but not LAM, 
activates the macrophages by eliciting the expression of 
co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 in a TLR-2- and 
MyD88-dependent manner. The signaling pathway leading to 
cytokine production appears to be independent of TLR-4 and 
TLR-655. Similarly, Dao et al.52 demonstrated that LM induces 
cell signaling speci¿cally through TLR-2 ligation. Based on 
a structure-function evaluation, these authors suggested that 
the addition of arabinan to LAM masks the activity of the 
LM mannan core, preventing LAM from inducing apoptosis 
and IL-12 expression. Interestingly, although PIM2 is the lipid 
anchor of LM, it does not play a role in this induction. Since 
PIM2 contains only two mannose residues, Dao et al.52 suggested 
that increased mannose content is required for the stimulation 
of IL-12 expression52. 
Krishnan et al.56 evaluated the response of BMMs, dendritic 
cells, and mice to whole lipid extracts from the six major genetic 
lineages of M. tuberculosis and concluded that the distinct 
cell envelope lipid pro¿les affect mycobacterial virulence 
and immune innate response. These data reinforce the role of  
M. tuberculosis cell wall lipid components as a determining 
factor in the outcome of early phase M. tuberculosis infection.
MYCOBACTERIAL LIPIDS DURING 
TRANSITION TO THE CHRONIC PHASE 
OF INFECTION
Once M. tuberculosis survives the early assaults from 
antimicrobial host effector cells and molecules, it enters a 
chronic infection phase. This transition involves yet another 
set of mycobacterial lipids. The host’s adaptive immune 
response at this stage of infection comprises the formation of 
T cell-dependent granulomas designed to contain the bacilli 
to prevent their spread and facilitate their elimination57. 
The control of M. tuberculosis depends on a joint effort of T 
cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells58, and M. tuberculosis 
survives within macrophages inside the granulomas. Major 
histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules are 
loaded with mycobacterial peptides that are presented to CD4 
T cells. CD8 T cell stimulation requires the loading of MHC I 
molecules by mycobacterial peptides in the cytosol, by egression 
of mycobacterial antigens into the cytosol59. 
The MHC class I-like CD1 antigen-presenting molecules 
recognize the abundant and diverse set of lipid-containing 
antigens and present these amphipathic antigens for recognition 
to T cell receptors (reviewed by Barral and Brenner60). Many 
lipid species expressed by M. tuberculosis can be presented 
by CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c, including MA, lipoglycans 
(such as LAM) and PIMs, lipopeptides, mannosyl-β-1-
phosphomycoketides, and sulpholipids60. Other cell wall lipids 
that have been described as activating/modulating the immune 
response include PDIM, DAT, and polyacyltrehalose (PAT)61.
Accumulating evidence suggests that the beta-oxidation 
pathway is a source of lipids that protect M. tuberculosis against 
host-imposed stress during the chronic phase of infection62. 
As described below, these lipids play a role in dampening the 
host immune response or protecting the tubercle bacilli against 
bactericidal intermediates. These beta-oxidation products 
include DAT, PAT, sulpholipid-1 (SL-1), and PDIM.
Di-and polyacyltrehalose
Mycobacterium tuberculosis glycolipids (DAT, PAT, and 
triacyltrehaloses) are located in the outer layer of the cell wall 
(Figure 1) and contain di- and tri-methyl branched fatty acids, 
only found in pathogenic species of mycobacteria. Hatzios 
et al.63 suggested that acyl transferase PapA3 ¿rst acylates 
the 2-position of one of the trehalose glucose residues with 
a palmitoyl group, to form trehalose 2-palmitate (T2P). A 
mycolipenoyl group, synthesized by the polyketide synthase 
Pks3/4, a product of the mas-like gene (msl3)64,65, is then 
transferred to the 3-position of T2P by PapA3 to generate 
DAT66. DAT may either be transported to the cell surface or 
serve as a biosynthetic intermediate that is further elaborated 
with mycolipenic acids to yield PAT. Gene mmpL10, which 
encodes a putative lipid transporter and clusters with papA3 and 
pks3/4 genes, may encode a transporter of PAT or its precursor 
(Figure 1). DAT may be transported to the cell surface without 
further modi¿cations63. Thus, the extracellular synthesis of PAT 
from DAT might constitute yet another mechanism by which 
M. tuberculosis protects itself against the bactericidal activities 
of the host during infection.
DAT extracted from M. tuberculosis H37Rv and  
M. fortuitum ATCC 6841 inhibits the proliferation of mouse  
T cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro, which suggests that 
this glycolipid could play a role in T cell hyporesponsiveness 
and immunosuppression associated with M. tuberculosis 
infections67. The disruption of the M. tuberculosis msl3 gene 
provided additional information about the role of polyacylated 
trehaloses in mycobacterial virulence. A msl3 mutant does not 
produce mycolipanoic and mycolipenic (phthienoic) acids 
required for the synthesis of DAT and PAT. In the absence 
of glycolipids to anchor the trehalose at the cell surface, this 
mutant forms bead-like aggregates with no discernable decrease 
in growth rate. Capsule attachment is probably defective in the 
mutant, and, consequently, the hydrophobic core of the wall 
might be exposed64,68. The msl3 mutant infects both activated 
and resting macrophages derived from BALB/c mice two- to 
fourfold more effectively than H37Rv, and is more ef¿ciently 
taken up by the macrophages68. However, the ability of the msl3 
mutant to replicate and to persist within macrophages is not 
altered, suggesting that DAT and PAT are unlikely involved in 
the survival of M. tuberculosis within phagocytic cells68.

Sulpholipid-1
Since the discovery of sulpholipids by Middlebrook et al. 69 in the 
early 1950s  many in vivo and in vitro studies have suggested that these 
complex lipids play a role in the virulence of the tubercle bacillus. 
SL-1 comprises a trehalose-2-sulfate (T2S) core decorated with 
four acyl groups: a straight chain fatty acid (palmitate or stearate) 
and three multiply methyl-branched (hydroxy) phthioceranoic 
acids. The sulphotransferase Stf0 initiates SL-1 biosynthesis 
by sulfating the abundant disaccharide trehalose to form T2S70. 
The acyltransferase PapA2 then catalyzes the esteri¿cation of 
T2S at the 2-position to generate a monoacylated intermediate 
monoacylated-SGL71. The polyketide synthase Pks2 synthesizes 
methyl-branched (hydroxy) phthioceranoyl65 and PapA1 
transfers the product of Pks2 to the 3-position of monoacylated-
SGL, yielding Ac2SGL71. MmpL8 may Àip Ac2SGL across the 
plane of the cell membrane, allowing it to be further modi¿ed 
to mature SL-1 before delivery to the cell wall72 (Figure 1). 
Acylation of Ac2SGL with a phthioceranic acid group and another 
hydroxyphthioceranic acid group completed the biosynthesis of 
SL-170.
The role of Ac2SGL and SL-1 in immunopathogenesis of  
M. tuberculosis has been described73,74. SL-1 is the most 
abundant lipid on the M. tuberculosis surface and absent in 
nonpathogenic Mycobacterium species. SL-1 and its precursor, 
Ac2SGL, are thus important targets in biomarkers studies. 
Goren et al.73 showed that SL-1 puri¿ed from M. tuberculosis 
strain H37Rv is a potent inhibitor of phagolysosome formation 
in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages. The authors 
suggested that the sulfatide impairs either the phagosomal or 
lysosomal membranes. SL-1 also directly inhibits macrophage 
priming, which results in reduced superoxide anion (O2
–) 
release, reduced phagocytosis, and reduced release of IL-175, and 
affects neutrophil signal transduction pathways76. Nevertheless, 
the role of SL-1 in the virulence of M. tuberculosis remains 
questionable77. 
Kato and Goren78 showed that SL-1 damages the 
mitochondrial structure in synergy with TDM, but no toxic 
effect was noted in mice injected intraperitoneally with SL-1 
alone. Later72,79, the construction of mmpL8 and pks2 mutants 
clari¿ed the role of SL-1 and its precursors in the pathogenesis 
of M. tuberculosis. MmpL8 is a member of a family of 13 
predicted lipid transporters and pks2 has high homology to 
the mycocerosic acid synthase (mas) gene, whose product is 
involved in the synthesis of a class of multiple methyl-branched 
fatty acids65. M. tuberculosis mmpL8 mutant is unable to produce 
SL-1 and accumulates Ac2SGL in the cytoplasm. The pks2 
mutant that synthesizes neither SL-1 nor Ac2SGL grows at rates 
indistinguishable from those of the wild type in the spleen, liver, 
and lung, indicating that SL-1 is not required for the growth 
of M. tuberculosis in vivo. In contrast, the mmpL8 mutant 
was attenuated in all these organs72. These results suggest that 
Ac2SGL is the immunogenic metabolite of the SL-1 pathway. 
Gilleron et al.74 confirmed these findings by showing 
that Ac2SGL binds to the MHC-like lipid receptor CD1b 
and stimulates the expression of interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-2 
in CD8+ T cells obtained from tuberculin skin test-positive 
donors74. Thus, since the biosynthesis of SL-1 is completed 
by acylation of Ac2SGL with a phthioceranic acid group and 
another hydroxyphthioceranic acid group, it is possible that  
M. tuberculosis uses these two fatty acids in a balanced fashion 
to modulate the host immune response to bacterial advantage74.
Phthiocerol dimycocerosate
By using signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM), Cox et al.80 
isolated three M. tuberculosis transposon mutants unable to 
replicate within the mouse lung. These transposons disrupted 
the mas, fadD28 and mmpL7 genes which encode enzymes and 
proteins implicated in the synthesis, assembly and, subcellular 
localization of PDIM80. Also, by using a cell-free system, Trivedi 
et al.81 delineated the enzymology of PDIM assembly and the 
precise roles of several proteins involved in the biosynthesis of 
this lipid. Some genes described as involved in PDIM synthesis 
are located within 50kbp pps locus82.
The observation that a PDIM-de¿cient M. tuberculosis 
H37Rv mutant replicates less well and elicits fewer lung surface 
tubercles than a PDIM-producing H37Rv strain in a guinea 
pig model suggested for the ¿rst time that PDIMs may play 
a role in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis83. In their study, Cox  
et al.80 also showed that M. tuberculosis mutant strains unable 
to synthetize PDIM were attenuated in mice. These strains were 
defective in cell wall biosynthesis, displayed strikingly altered 
colony morphology on solid medium, compared with the wild 
type, and their growth in mouse lungs was impaired80. 
Phthiocerol dimycocerosate may be also involved in cell 
wall permeability. Insertion mutants unable to synthesize 
or subcellular translocation of PDIM have higher cell wall 
permeability and are more sensitive to detergents than the 
wild-type strain. Chenodeoxycholate is a negatively-charged 
hydrophobic probe used for the evaluation of the Àuidity of 
mycobacterial cell wall lipids84. Its uptake by M. tuberculosis 
strain devoid of PDIM was signi¿cantly higher than in the  
wild type85.
Compared with mice infected with wild-type M. tuberculosis, 
bacterial loads in the lungs and spleen of mice over a 4-month 
period were reduced in animals intranasally infected with a 
PDIM-de¿cient mutant86. The differences in bacterial loads 
during the acute phase of infection are probably caused by a 
delay in granuloma formation in mice infected with PDIM-
de¿cient mutant. M. tuberculosis PDIMs do not contribute to the 
inhibition of phagolysosome fusion within resting macrophages 
but contribute to the protection against bactericidal activity of 
reactive nitrogen intermediates86. Finally, the PDIM-de¿cient 
mutant induced the secretion of higher amounts of TNF-α and 
IL-6 by macrophages and dendritic cells, 48 and 72h after 
infection, than the wild type86. Also, Astarie-Dequeker et al.87 
showed that PDIM interferes with phagocytosis and blocks 
phagosomal acidi¿cation in a cholesterol-dependent manner. 
These data suggest that M. tuberculosis uses PDIM for the 
modulation of the early host immune response and to dampen 
the bactericidal activity of macrophages86. Thus, PDIM appears 
to affect the infection outcome at both early and chronic phases 
of disease.

LIPID SYNTHESIS CONTROL AND 
A BACTERIAL IMMUNOSTAT
Mycobacterium tuberculosis manages its cell wall lipid 
content in order to modulate the host immune response over 
the course of infection. Analysis of the lipid-induced immune 
response generated from the products of beta-oxidation pathway, 
suggests that DAT/PAT, SL-1, and PDIM collectively contribute 
to diminishing the immunopathologic response induced by M. 
tuberculosis. Jain et al.9 showed that PDIM and SL-1 syntheses 
are coupled via metabolic flux of a common precursor, 
methylmalonyl-CoA. The overexpression of methylmalonyl-
CoA mutase, which catalyzes the conversion of the citric acid 
cycle intermediate succinyl-CoA to methylmalonyl-CoA, led 
to a decrease in the total abundance of PDIM and SL-1 in vivo; 
this suggested that during chronic infection, M. tuberculosis 
preferentially uses the beta-oxidation pathway and not the 
citric acid cycle as a source of methylmalonyl-CoA9. The 
beta-oxidation of even chain fatty acids exclusively yields 
acetyl-CoA units, while beta-oxidation of odd chain fatty acids 
yields both acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA10. Thus, during the 
later phase of infection and after the activation of host immune 
response, M. tuberculosis uses the beta-oxidation pathway to 
metabolize intracellular odd chain lipids to synthetize DAT/
PAT, SL-1, and PDIM. During this phase of infection, local 
immunosuppression induced by these lipids may contribute to 
the establishment of a long-term M. tuberculosis infection. This 
notion is supported by a recent study by Mendum et al.62, who 
showed that M. tuberculosis survival in dendritic cells depends 
on multi-gene loci associated with speci¿ c functional groups, 
such as the synthesis of PDIM, phenolic glycolipids, and SL-1, 
and cholesterol metabolism.
The manner in which M. tuberculosis regulates the cell 
wall lipid content during the course of infection and how the 
temporal lipid pro¿ le determines the fate of infection remain 
to be clari¿ ed. Perez et al.88 described the possible contribution 
of PhoP–PhoR, a bacterial two-component signal transduction 
system involved in an adaptive response to a variety of stimuli. 
Disruption of this system markedly affects the ability of the 
tubercle bacillus to replicate in cellular and animal models88. 
PhoP positively regulates the synthesis SL-1, DAT, and PAT89. 
Also, Galagan et al.90 proposed a regulatory network model 
that operates during hypoxia where PhoP regulates whiB3, with 
both PhoP and WhiB3 regulating PAT/DAT and SL-1. WhiB3 is 
involved in the maintenance of redox homeostasis by regulating 
fatty acid metabolism, and modulates the biosynthesis of PAT, 
DAT, SL-1, PDIM, and triacylglycerol91.
Another suggestion concerning M. tuberculosis cell wall 
homeostasis comes from studies of the putative lipid transporter 
system encoded by mce operons. It has been long recognized that 
the thickness of the cell wall of M. tuberculosis cells changes 
during stationary phase of growth92. Cantrell et al.19 and Forrellad 
et al.39 independently reported increased abundance of FM in 
the cell wall of M. tuberculosis mce1 mutants, suggesting that 
the increased thickness of the cell wall may be attributed to 
such lipids. Such cells may become impermeable to the host’s 
effector molecules, albeit they may also experience the stress 
of nutrient starvation. Uchida et al.42 observed that during the 
¿ rst 8 weeks of infection in mouse, the mce1 operon in wild-
type M. tuberculosis is repressed by a negative transcriptional 
regulator Mce1R, which is similar to the constitutive lack of 
expression in the mce1 mutant. During this nutrient-limited 
state, M. tuberculosis may down-regulate the propionyl-CoA/
methylmalonyl-CoA pathway involved in the synthesis of SL-
1, DAT, and PAT, while increasing the synthesis of MA, which 
has even lower pro-inÀ ammatory activity8,30. Dunphy et al.93 
proposed that the mce1 operon is involved in MA import. A 
prolonged starvation of the cells with thickened cell wall may 
serve as a signal to de-repress the mce1 operon to allow the 
importation of FM, a carbon source. The starvation signal may 
also trigger the synthesis of MA via the acetyl-CoA/malonyl-
CoA pathway27. Queiroz et al.43 showed that the beta-oxidation 
cycle might prefer the acetyl-CoA over the propionyl-CoA 
pathway in the mce1 operon mutant, as evidenced by decreased 
levels of SL-1, DAT, and PDIM precursors, with a concomitant 
increase in MA levels. The mce1 operon thus appears to play 
an important role in regulating MA abundance and utilization, 
allowing bacterial persistence (Figure 2).
In conclusion, M. tuberculosis appears to have developed 
an elaborate system for a homeostatic regulation of its cell wall 
lipid composition. It comprises a dynamic adaptive mechanism 
for the establishment of persistence in the host. Factors that 
disturb this homeostasis lead to disease on one side or bacterial 
clearance on the other. Collectively, the cell wall lipids serve 
FIGURE 2 - A bacterial immunostat model of lipid-regulated host 
immunopathologic response. 
Relative abundance of TMM, TDM, PIM, LM, and LAM in the cell wall leads to 
enhanced pro-inÀ ammatory host response, while an increase in DAT, PAT, PDIM, 
SL-1, and MA leads to dampened immunopathologic response. Maintenance of 
cell wall lipid homeostasis allows Mycobacterium tuberculosis persistence in the 
host (latent TB infection). Disruption of this homeostasis in favor of unregulated 
expression of pro-inÀ ammatory lipids ultimately leads to tuberculosis, while continued 
dampened response, especially in the presence of anti- Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
drugs, leads to bacterial clearance. DAT: diacyltrehalose; PAT: poliacyltrehalose; 
PDIM: dimycocerosate; SL-1: sulphoglycolipid; MA: mycolic acid; TMM: trehalose

as a type of immunologic thermostat (immunostat model, as 
depicted in Figure 2) in an infected host.  Given this model, 
the big questions that can be asked are, 1)  Which changes in 
the Mycobacterium tuberculosis cell wall lipid content that 
occur during progression to active tuberculosis can be targeted 
by drugs to prevent reactivation TB in those who are latently 
infected?  2) What host immunological signals are recognized 
by Mycobacterium tuberculosis that induce the bacterium to 
modulate its cell wall lipid contents for its persistence?  And 
3) Can we identify a vaccine or an immunomodulator  that can 
shift the equilibrium state towards elimination of the bacteria 
in a host? Better understanding of the interaction between  
M. tuberculosis lipids and the immune response could lead to 
the development of such immunomodulators distinct from the 
traditional protein antigen-based vaccines, or the development of 
drugs against novel targets in M. tuberculosis to tip the balance 
in favor of the host.
