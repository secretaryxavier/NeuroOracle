Abstract 
1 
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease. However, the 
2 
causal relationship of risk factors, such as genetic predisposition or experience of augmented stress, 
3 
remain unknown. Numerous studies in humans and rodents have implicated brain-derived 
4 
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in MDD pathology, as a genetic risk factor and a factor regulated by stress. 
5 
Until now, the majority of preclinical studies have employed genetically modified mice as their model 
6 
of choice. However, mice display a limited behavioural repertoire and lack expression of circulating 
7 
BDNF, which is present in rats and humans. Therefore, heterozygous BDNF (BDNF+/-) rats were tested 
8 
for affective behaviours and accompanying expression of key genes associated with affective disorders 
9 
in the brain. We found that BDNF+/- rats, which have reduced BDNF levels in brain and plasma, displayed 
10 
symptoms of anhedonia, a core symptom of MDD, and anxiety-like behaviour, but no behavioural 
11 
despair or cognitive impairments. This was accompanied by changes in the expression of genes that are 
12 
implicated in modulation of the stress response and affective disorders. Hence, glucocorticoid receptor, 
13 
neuregulin 1 and disrupted-in-schizophrenia 1 gene expression were upregulated in the prefrontal 
14 
cortex of BDFN+/- rats, whereas FK506 binding protein 5 levels were decreased in the hippocampus. We 
15 
conclude that a reduction in BDNF levels alters expression of genes associated with affective disorders, 
16 
which may contribute to the development of depressive-like symptoms.  
17 
Introduction 
18 
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide affecting 300 million 
19 
people and their socio-economic environment (World Health Organisation 2018). Stressful life events, 
20 
such as sustained stress load at work or family disharmony, can trigger MDD development, in particular 
21 
in predisposed individuals (Kessler 1997; Kendler et al. 1999; de Kloet et al. 2005; Heim & Binder 2012). 
22 
By implication, MDD pathology emerges from a gene x environment interaction eliciting a 
23 
heterogeneity of symptoms (Otte et al. 2016). Heritability of MDD is presumed to be 30–40% (Sullivan 
24 
et al. 2000). However, many genes which exert  small effects on their own may interact to contribute 
25 
to the overall pathogenesis of MDD (Hyman 2014); confounding the identification of MDD-specific 
26 
candidate genes. Furthermore, MDD patients display high comorbidities with other neuropsychiatric 
27 
diseases, such as anxiety disorders, which additionally enhances the complexity of MDD (Kessler et al. 
28 
2003; De Carlo et al. 2016). Hence, the aetiology of MDD pathogenesis is still insufficiently understood, 
29 
which precludes the tailoring of antidepressant treatment and reduces drug efficacy. 
30 
 
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BNDF), involved in neural circuit function and plasticity (Park 
31 
& Poo 2013), was identified as a possible contributor to MDD pathogenesis and drug efficacy (Angelucci 
32

3 
et al. 2005; Sen et al. 2008). In humans, the BDNF polymorphism Val66Met, linked to reduced BDNF 
1 
activity (Egan et al. 2003; Hosang et al. 2014), was shown to have a strong interaction with stressful life 
2 
events in MDD pathogenesis (Hosang et al. 2014). Moreover, stress, which is known as a major 
3 
environmental risk factor for MDD development across species (Kessler 1997; Kendler et al. 1999; 
4 
Martis et al. 2018), reduces BDNF levels in the hippocampus (HPC) in preclinical studies (Smith et al. 
5 
1995; Murakami et al. 2005). The HPC is a brain region that also shows reduced plasticity in 
6 
environmentally-induced preclinical MDD models (Jayatissa et al. 2006) and atrophy in humans with 
7 
MDD (Bremner et al. 2000). Furthermore, reduced BDNF levels in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and HPC were 
8 
found in post-mortem tissue of MDD patients (Dwivedi et al. 2003); whereas MDD patients medicated 
9 
with antidepressants showed elevated BDNF levels in the HPC post-mortem (Chen et al. 2001). Similarly, 
10 
serum BDNF was decreased in depressed patients and elevated following medication (Shimizu et al. 
11 
2003; Karege et al. 2005; Sen et al. 2008). Moreover in preclinical studies, infusion of BDNF in the 
12 
midbrain induced an antidepressant-like effect in the learned helplessness paradigm (Siuciak et al. 
13 
1997) and antidepressant drug efficacy was shown to be BDNF level dependent (Castrén & Rantamäki 
14 
2010; Autry et al. 2011; Björkholm & Monteggia 2016). Hence, these findings promoted preclinical 
15 
research into MDD using mice with genetically reduced BDNF expression. 
16 
 
However, these preclinical studies resulted in inconsistent findings with genetically-reduced 
17 
levels of BDNF provoking depressive-like phenotypes in only a limited proportion of mouse studies 
18 
(Chourbaji et al. 2004; Castrén & Rantamäki 2010; Autry & Monteggia 2012). One possible explanation 
19 
may be that mice, unlike humans and rats, do not express peripheral BDNF (Klein et al. 2011). Peripheral 
20 
administration of BDNF in mice altered gene expression in the brain and produced an antidepressant-
21 
like and anxiolytic behavioural response, although the precise mechanism of action remains to be 
22 
determined (Schmidt & Duman 2010). Furthermore, peripheral BDNF levels in humans are a potential 
23 
biomarker for MDD and antidepressant treatment (Karege et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2007; Sen et al. 2008). 
24 
Thus, peripheral BDNF levels might contribute to the pathogenesis and treatment of depression and 
25 
highlight that rats may be a more appropriate species to investigate the relationship between BDNF 
26 
and MDD. Furthermore, rats exhibit a more extensive behavioural repertoire than mice and are 
27 
considered translationally more relevant to humans (Hirst et al. 2003; Klein et al. 2011; Czéh et al. 2016; 
28 
Ellenbroek & Youn 2016). Finally, most behavioural tests are designed to characterize rat behaviour 
29 
(Czéh et al. 2016), making the interpretation of BDNF mouse studies difficult. Rats heterozygous for the 
30 
BDNF gene (BDNF+/-) express lower BDNF levels in the brain and periphery (Harris et al. 2016) and may 
31 
be a more relevant preclinical model, overcoming the inconsistent findings in mice and generating more 
32 
translational results. Indeed, BDNF+/- rats display impaired fear related learning which correlates with 
33

4 
altered brain processing as demonstrated by functional magnetic resonance imaging (Harris et al. 
1 
2016). 
2 
 
Therefore, the present study aimed to determine the direct effect of reduced BDNF levels on 
3 
behavioural alterations and affective disease-related gene expression levels in the brain. Rats 
4 
heterozygous for the BDNF gene were behaviourally phenotyped for anxiety and depressive-like 
5 
behaviours as well as cognitive performance. Reduced plasticity and altered release of hypothalamic 
6 
neuropeptides in response to lower BDNF levels might impair the homeostasis of the hypothalamic-
7 
pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is an important regulator of the stress response and often altered in 
8 
patients with affective disorders (Tapia-Arancibia et al. 2004; de Kloet et al. 2005; Alexander et al. 2010; 
9 
Bains et al. 2015). Thus, we measured the expression of genes involved in regulating the stress response 
10 
(the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), corticotropin releasing hormone 
11 
(Crh), and FK506 binding protein 5 (Fkbp5)) and expression of genes relevant in neuropsychiatric 
12 
diseases (disrupted in schizophrenia-1 (Disc1), glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (Gsk3b) and neuregulin 
13 
1 (Nrg1)). We hypothesized these genes would be differentially regulated in BDNF+/- rats compared to 
14 
controls and be associated with depressive- and/or anxiety-like behaviours.  
15 
Material and Methods 
16 
Animals 
17 
All animal experiments were approved by the University of Edinburgh Ethical Review Committee and 
18 
studies were carried out in strict accordance with the UK Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) 
19 
Act 1986 and the European Communities Council Directive of 22 September 2010 (Directive 
20 
2010/63/EU). 
21 
 
Animals were generated by crossing male Sprague-Dawley (Hsd:SD) rats that were 
22 
heterozygous for a BDNF knockdown mutation (HET, SD-BDNFtm1sage; generated using zinc finger 
23 
nuclease technology, SAGE®Labs, St Louis, MO, USA) with control female SD rats (SAGE®Labs, St Louis, 
24 
MO, USA). Litters comprised of BDNF+/+ wild type rats (WT) and BDNF heterozygous rats (BDNF+/-) and 
25 
were bred in-house. BDNF+/- (n = 13) and WT rats (n = 14) were 11–12 weeks old and weighed an 
26 
average of 384 ± 49 g at the beginning of behavioural testing (except for Morris water maze (MWM) 
27 
test). For the MWM test, a separate cohort of 5 WT and 10 BDNF+/- rats were employed (30 weeks of 
28 
age). Another group of 10 BDNF+/- and 9 WT rats at 11–13 weeks of age were used for testing brain 
29 
gene expression levels. Only male animals were used and housed in mixed genotype groups of 3–4. 
30 
Rats had free access to food and water and were kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:00 am). 
31

5 
All of the following behavioural tests are listed in the order that they were conducted and took place in 
1 
the first half of the light cycle (except for sucrose preference test (SPT) which was assessed over 48 h).  
2 
 
The behavioural test battery was conducted in the following order: sucrose preference test, 
3 
elevated-plus-maze, novelty induced hypophagia, spontaneous alternation behaviour, open field and 
4 
forced swim test. This order was chosen to minimize the interference of stressful tests with other tasks 
5 
with more robust tests at the end of the test battery. 
6 
Sucrose preference test 
7 
The sucrose preference test (SPT) measures the hedonic state of each animal (Muscat & Willner 1992). 
8 
Rats were habituated to drink a palatable sucrose solution (1.5%) for two days. A bottle of water and a 
9 
bottle of the sucrose solution were made available in the animals’ home cage. One and a half days after 
10 
habituation, animals were single-housed and exposed to two bottles, one with water and one with the 
11 
sucrose solution, for 48 h. Bottle position (left/right) was counterbalanced across cages and switched 
12 
after 24 h during habituation and test phase. Water and sucrose solution consumption, body weight 
13 
and food intake were measured after 48 h. 
14 
Elevated plus-maze 
15 
Anxiety-related behaviour was assessed in the elevated plus-maze (EPM) 3–5 days after the SPT. Rats 
16 
were habituated in their home cage to the experimental room 1 h prior to testing. The EPM consisted 
17 
of a maze shaped like a plus sign (arm size: 10 cm width, 45 cm length) and elevated 66 cm from the 
18 
floor. Two opposing arms, the closed arms, were enclosed with high walls (50 cm height), the two other 
19 
arms were open, leaving a central area (10 x 10 cm) in the middle of the EPM. Illumination in the closed 
20 
arms was 2.5 lux and 45 lux in the open arms. In a randomized order, rats were positioned in the centre 
21 
of the EPM facing a closed arm. Each rat was allowed to explore the maze for 5 min. EPM was cleaned 
22 
with 70% ethanol between animals. Distance travelled and time spent in open or closed arms as well 
23 
as head dips and rearing were recorded using ANY-maze automatic tracking software (ANY-maze, 
24 
Stoelting Co.,Wood Dale, IL, USA). 
25 
Novelty induced hypophagia 
26 
The novelty induced hypophagia (NIH) task tested anhedonic-like behaviour (decreased motivation to 
27 
consume a reward) and anxiety-related behaviour (fear of eating in a novel and open environment) 
28 
(Wyrwoll et al. 2015). Eight days after the EPM test, rats were habituated to eat a chocolate chip (280 
29 
mg; Milk chocolate chips, Wm Morrison Supermarket PLC, Bradford, UK) in their home cage on four 
30 
consecutive days. On the following day, the animals were moved to the experimental room 30 min prior 
31

6 
to testing. The room illumination was adjusted to approximately 65–70 lux. After acclimation to the 
1 
experimental room, a chocolate chip was positioned at the one end (35 lux) of an experimental box (66 
2 
cm length, 28 cm width, 40 cm height, non-transparent) and the rat was placed at the other end of the 
3 
box (24–25 lux). Latency to consume the chocolate chip was manually scored from recorded videos. 
4 
Rats which did not consume the chocolate chip within the time limit were listed with the full 
5 
experimental duration of 15 min. Two animals were tested in parallel and boxes were cleaned with 70% 
6 
ethanol between animals. 
7 
Spontaneous alternation behaviour test 
8 
The spontaneous alternation behaviour (SAB) task assesses working memory in rodents (Henningsen et 
9 
al. 2009). The SAB test was carried out 5 days after the NIH task and according to K. Henningsen, 
10 
Woldbye, & Wiborg (2013). Animals were acclimatized to the testing room 45 min prior to testing. Light 
11 
intensity was 10–13 lux in the arms (49 cm length, 17 cm width, 32 cm height) and 17 lux in the 
12 
triangular centre of the Y-shaped maze (120° angles). Each rat was placed at the end of the same arm 
13 
facing the back wall and allowed to explore the Y-maze for 10 min. Arm entries (all four paws in arm) 
14 
were recorded using ANY-maze automatic tracking software (ANY-maze, Stoelting Co.,Wood Dale, IL, 
15 
USA). The primary readout was alternation ratio, which was calculated by the number of alternations 
16 
(visiting all three arms consecutively) divided by the maximum possible alternation score (number of 
17 
arm entries minus two). A high alternation ratio shows that the rat is not re-entering an arm that was 
18 
previously visited, indicating intact working memory. The apparatus was cleaned with 70% ethanol 
19 
between animals. 
20 
Forced swim test and open field 
21 
The forced swim test (FST) is primarily used to investigate immobility behaviour (floating with minimum 
22 
movements to keep the head above water) indicating a rat’s propensity to surrender to a seemingly 
23 
hopeless situation. On the contrary, swimming (horizontal movements throughout the cylinder) or 
24 
struggling (vertical movements with the forepaws, usually against to cylinder wall) are counted as active 
25 
escape attempts of the situation. Increased immobility is associated with a depressive-like phenotype 
26 
(Slattery & Cryan 2012). The two-day FST protocol included OF testing (Abildgaard et al. 2017; 
27 
Liebenberg et al. 2018) to assess locomotor activity, an important cofounder of the FST. On day one of 
28 
the FST, 4 weeks after the SAB test, rats were acclimatized to the testing room (150 lux) 1 h prior to 
29 
testing. In parallel, two rats were immersed in transparent cylinders (20 cm diameter, 50 cm height) 
30 
filled with water (38 cm depth; 24  ± 1 °C) for 15 min. The water was renewed between rats. On the 
31 
following day, locomotor activity was assessed in the open field (OF). Rats were acclimatized to an 
32

7 
adjacent room with dim illumination containing an OF (97 x 97 cm) for 1 h. The OF was divided into a 
1 
centre area (31 cm from the edge, 30 lux), an outer area (within 12 cm from edge, 25 lux) and a middle 
2 
area in between the centre and the outer area. Each rat was placed in the centre of the OF and tracked 
3 
using ANY-maze automatic tracking software (ANY-maze, Stoelting Co.,Wood Dale, IL, USA) for 10 min. 
4 
Time spent and distance travelled in each zone as well as number of fecal boli were measured. After 
5 
the OF test, the rat was transferred to the room of the FST and exposed to 7 min of forced swimming. 
6 
Predominant behaviour (immobility, swimming or struggling) was scored manually from recorded 
7 
videos of the second swim with time-sampling technique (5 sec) by an examiner blindfolded to group 
8 
identity until score reliability was within 10%. Diving was scored as struggling. 
9 
Morris water maze 
10 
Spatial learning and memory, as well as reversal learning was examined in the MWM (2 m diameter, 
11 
0.5 m height) (Vorhees & Williams 2006) with a naïve cohort of rats (5 WT, 10 BDNF+/-). Rats were 
12 
trained to find a hidden Atlantis escape platform (12 cm diameter; Ugo Basile, Italy) for five days with 
13 
two trials per day. Each rat was released from one of four release points in a pre-determined random 
14 
order. Rats were allowed up to 120 s to find and mount the platform and were guided there if they 
15 
failed to find it. Latency, swim speed and distance were recorded using Actimetrics Watermaze 
16 
software (Actimetrics, IL, USA). On day six (24 h after the last test), each rat received a 60 s probe trial 
17 
in which the escape platform was absent, but rose up after 60 s (to prevent extinction of the location). 
18 
During the probe trial, % time spent in quadrant, % thigmotaxis (swimming within 15 cm of the pool 
19 
edge), swim speed and number of platform crossings were analysed.  On day seven and eight, 
20 
perseverant behaviour was assessed using a reversal protocol in which the platform was moved to a 
21 
randomly determined location (middle of one of the four quadrants). Rats received two swims on day 
22 
seven and one swim on day eight.  
23 
To assess visual ability, a trial in which the platform was visible (i.e. the water level was lowered) was 
24 
conducted two weeks after the probe trial with curtains pulled around the maze to hide spatial cues 
25 
(both groups reached the platform in under 12 ± 2 s; data not shown). 
26 
Tissue collection and RT-qPCR 
27 
Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to investigate the cerebral expression of genes associated with 
28 
neuropsychiatric disease and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis regulation. Naïve WT (n = 9) 
29 
and BDNF+/- rats (n = 10) were sacrificed by decapitation. The HPC and PFC were quickly removed from 
30 
the right hemisphere, immediately frozen on dry ice and stored at -80 °C. Approximately 70–80 mg 
31 
(PFC) and 50–60 mg (HPC) of tissue was homogenised in Qiazol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen GmbH, North 
32

8 
Rhine-Westphalia, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was then isolated from 
1 
the supernatant using the RNase MiniKit (250) (Qiagen GmbH) with an on column DNAse step to reduce 
2 
possible sample contamination with DNA (Qiagen GmbH). RNA quantification and integrity (absorbance 
3 
at 280/260 nm > 2.10, 260/230 nm > 1.45) was analysed by Nanodrop (Spectrophotometer ND-1000, 
4 
Software ND-1000 V3.8.1; NanoDrop Technologies Inc., Delaware, USA). High-Capacity cDNA Reverse 
5 
Transcription Kit (4368814, Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher, Massachusetts, USA) was used for 
6 
reverse transcription PCR, by adding 500 ng of RNA to 10 μl of reverse transcription reagent, resulting 
7 
in a final volume of 20 μl. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, 120 min at 37°C, 5 min at 85 °C, 
8 
cooled down to 4 °C and stored at -20 °C. For the qPCR, cDNA was diluted 1:20 with diethyl 
9 
pyrocarbonate treated water and triplicates of 2 μl of the sample and 8 μl of master mix (Roche, 
10 
LightCycler 480 Probes Master, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) with TaqMan Gene expression Assays 
11 
(Applied Biosystems, ThermoFisher) were used. Reference genes and target genes are listed in Table 1. 
12 
The thermal conditions for the qPCR were 5 min at 95 °C, followed by 50 cycles of 10 s denaturation at 
13 
95 °C and 30 s annealing at 60 °C. Finally, qPCR was completed with 30 s extension at 40 °C. 
14 
 
A standard curve of eight two-fold dilutions was run for each target and reference gene on the 
15 
same plate as the respective samples. PCR efficiency was calculated from the standard curve’s slope 
16 
and outliers within the triplicate were excluded if standard deviation (SD) of the triplicates was > 0.4. A 
17 
combination of reference genes were chosen based on good correlation with other reference genes 
18 
and low variance within the reference gene across groups and tissue. Hence, an average of the relative 
19 
concentration of Actb and Hprt1 (Silver et al. 2008) were used to normalise target genes.

Welch’s unequal variance t-test if the assumption of homogeneity of variance was violated. Normality 
4 
was assessed with QQ-plots and Shapiro Wilk test, and if violated, data was log-transformed or non-

because their total fluid intake was < 5 g within 48 h, which could be due to a measurement error. To 
7 
reduce the type 1 error rate, qPCR results were corrected with the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure (Q 
8 
= 25%). Repeated measurement data of the MWM was analysed with multivariate repeated measures 
9 
ANOVA. Outliers were removed according to Grubb’s (α = 0.05, two-sided) or ROUT test (Q = 1%; 
10 
GraphPad Prism 6, GraphPad Software Inc., California, USA). Data analysis was carried out in Stata (Stata 
11 
14.0, StataCorp, Texas, USA). Graphs were created with GraphPad Prism 5.

BDNF+/- rats exhibit anhedonic-like behaviour but not behavioural despair 
16 
Forced swim test reveals no difference in behavioural despair 
17 
The FST assesses behavioural despair indicated by a longer time spend passively coping, i.e. immobile, 
18 
relative to actively coping behaviours, i.e. swimming or struggling, in an unescapable situation. No 
19 
difference between genotypes was observed for time spent immobile, engaged in swimming or 
20 
struggling behaviour. Salient is the bimodal distribution in the WT group for struggling behaviour and 
21 
the low immobility scores of the WT group (nearly 40% of WT animals have a lower immobility score 
22 
than the minimum score for BDNF+/-; Fig. 1).

BDNF+/- rats exhibit anhedonic behaviour in the sucrose preference test 
5 
The SPT assesses the hedonic state of the rats by measuring the preference for a sucrose solution over 
6 
water intake. No significant difference was observed in total fluid intake between the WT and BDNF+/- 
7 
rats (Fig. 2a). Sucrose preference (i.e. sucrose solution consumption normalised to total fluid intake) 
8 
was significantly different between groups (t(14.61) = 2.82, P = 0.013) with BDNF+/- animals exhibiting a 
9 
lower sucrose preference than WT animals (Fig. 2b), thus indicating increased anhedonic-like behaviour 
10 
of the BDNF+/- rats compared to WT controls. Food intake and relative change in body weight (both 
11 
normalised to body weight) were not significantly different between the genotypes during single-
12 
housing.

Novelty induced hypophagia is similar between genotypes

In the NIH test, the drive to consume a palatable chocolate reward competes with the fear of a novel 
2 
environment and thus assesses anxiety- as well as anhedonic-like behaviour (Dulawa & Hen 2005). No 
3 
significant difference was found for reward collection latency between WT (254.69 ± 183.40 s, Median 
4 
= 220) and BDNF+/- rats (344.00 ± 334.54 s, Median = 202). These data suggest there is no difference 
5 
between WT and BDNF+/- rats in a combined readout of anhedonic-like behaviour and anxiety-related 
6 
behaviour. However, three BDNF+/- rats did not consume the chocolate reward within the time limit 
7 
(900 s) and hence the time limit was used as their collection latency although the true value could have 
8 
been much higher.

BDNF+/- rats display anxiety-like behaviour in open field test 
10 
BDNF+/- rats display normal anxiety-like behaviour in the elevated plus-maze 
11 
Anxiety-like behaviour was evaluated in BDNF+/- and WT rats since MDD is often accompanied by 
12 
anxiety. The % distance travelled in the open arms, % time spent in the open arms and % number of 
13 
open arm entries was similar across genotypes (Fig. 3).

However, WT rats (10.37 ± 3.13 m) travelled a significantly greater total distance (t(25) = 2.37, P = 0.026) 
21 
in the EPM than BDNF+/- animals (7.56 ± 3.04 m). This effect is likely due to WT rats (7.32 m ± 2.61 m) 
22 
travelling a greater distance compared to BDNF+/- rats (5.17 ± 2.55 m) in the closed (t(25) = 2.16, P = 
23 
0.041), but not in the open arms. A trend in number of entries to the closed (U = 1.779, P = 0.075), but 
24 
not open arms, was observed between WT (14.46 ± 7.11 entries, Median = 11) and BDNF+/- animals 
25 
(9.08 ± 5.25 entries, Median = 8). A trend (t(25) = 1.98, P = 0.059, data log-transformed) in rearing

behaviour was observed with WT animals (6.42 ± 10.12 s, Median = 11.8) spending more time rearing 
1 
than their BDNF+/- littermates (10.79 ± 8.25 s, Median = 9.05). Time spent head dipping into open arms 
2 
was similar between groups. WT rats (2.77 ± 3.00 boli, Median = 2) produced significantly more faecal 
3 
boli (U = 2.371, P = 0.018) than BDNF+/- rats (0.31 ± 0.63 boli, Median = 0) during testing on the EPM. 
4 
Body weight of the animals, which can influence behaviour in the EPM, was not significantly different 
5 
between genotypes at the time of testing. In sum, the primary readouts of the EPM suggest equal 
6 
anxiety-like behaviour between genotypes, but decreased locomotor activity in the BDNF+/- rats.  
7 
BDNF+/- rats show increased anxiety-like behaviour in open field test 
8 
The open field (OF) test assesses the conflict between anxiety-related behaviour (fear of open and lit 
9 
areas) and a desire to explore. Furthermore, the OF allows assessment of locomotor activity, which 
10 
could be a cofounder for behavioural testing, such as the FST (Slattery & Cryan 2012). BDNF+/- rats 
11 
(Median = 2.10 s) spent less time in the centre than their WT littermates (Median = 9.70 s; t(12.13) = 3.31, 
12 
P = 0.006; Fig. 4a). BDNF+/- rats (21.29 ± 16.97 s) also spent less time in the middle zone (t(25) = 2.28, P 
13 
= 0.031) than WT rats (41.29 ± 27.70 s). Accordingly, BDNF+/- rats (574.59 s ± 21.14, Median = 574.85) 
14 
spent more time in the outer zone (t(16.39) = -2.38, P = 0.030) than WT animals (540.76 ± 47.05 s, Median 
15 
= 564.80). However, WT animals travelled a greater total distance (t(25) = 3.21, P = 0.004) than BDNF+/- 
16 
animals in the OF test (Fig. 4b) suggesting decreased locomotor activity in BDNF+/- animals than in WT 
17 
rats. Since locomotor activity could interfere with the time spent in a zone, % distance travelled in each 
18 
zone was analysed. Similarly to time spent in a zone, BDNF+/- rats (Median = 2.60%) travelled less in the 
19 
centre zone (U = 1.99, P = 0.047; Fig. 4c) than their WT littermates (Median = 4.55%); and less distance 
20 
in the middle zone (t(25) = 2.36, P = 0.027; BDNF+/-: 10.31 ± 6.68%; WT: 16.19 ± 6.27%). Subsequently, 
21 
BDNF+/- rats (86.95 ± 8.90%) travelled more in the peripheral zone (t(25) = -2.47, P = 0.021) compared to 
22 
WT rats (78.38 ± 9.10%). These data support greater anxiety-like behaviour in the BDNF+/- rats than in 
23 
their WT littermates. No significant difference between genotypes was found for number of faecal boli 
24 
in the OF.

2 
The alternation ratio (number of sequentially alternating arm entries normalised to the possible 
3 
alternation score), a readout of spatial working memory, did not differ between the genotypes (WT: 
4 
70.97 ± 7.54%; BDNF+/-: 67.13 ± 16.89%). Results were not cofounded by the non-significant difference 
5 
in total number of arm entries between WT (21.31 ± 7.02 entries) and BDNF+/- (15.57 ± 8.68 entries) 
6 
rats. No difference in distance travelled in the Y-maze was observed between the two groups (WT: 
7 
19.32 ± 4.84 m; BDNF+/-: 17.42 ± 7.60 m). Hence, this data suggest no difference in working memory or 
8 
locomotor activity between BDNF+/- and WT rats. 
9 
BDNF+/- rats show normal performance in the Morris water maze 
10 
Spatial learning and memory performance, as well as perseverance behaviour was assessed in the 
11 
MWM task because cognitive deficits have been frequently reported in depression. BDNF+/- rats showed 
12 
a similar learning curve as WT controls. Both groups improved performance over time by decreasing 
13 
their latency to find the platform in the water [(F4,55.27) = 13.55, P < 0.0001; Fig. 5a]. When the platform 
14 
was removed the day after acquisition, BDNF+/- and WT controls showed comparable performance for 
15 
% time in target quadrant (WT: 34.33 ± 10.51%; BDNF+/-: 37.00 ± 7.53%), number of platform crossings 
16 
(WT: 2.4 ± 2.07 crossings; BDNF+/-: 1.3 ± 1.16 crossings), thigmotaxis (WT: 15.4 ± 8.99%; BDNF+/-: 21 ± 
17 
12.58%), and swim speed (WT: 21.60 ± 3.85 cm/sec; BDNF+/-: 22.63 ± 1.92 cm/sec). Both groups 
18 
improved performance during reversal learning [(F2,27) = 18.68, P < 0.0001], but no difference in reversal 
19 
learning latency was found between groups (Fig. 5b). WT (39.00 ± 7.93%) and BDNF+/- (39.20 ± 13.03%) 
20 
rats spent similar time in the original target quadrant during reversal learning. Thus, BDNF+/- rats display 
21 
intact spatial learning and memory as well as normal reversal learning, i.e. absence of perseverative 
22 
behaviour.

Locomotor activity 
5 
As many of the tests in behavioural mazes can be confounded by the general locomotor activity of the 
6 
rats, it is important to determine if there is an alteration in general activity between genotypes. There 
7 
was no difference in the total distance travelled in the Y-maze (section 3.3.1) or swim speed in the 
8 
water maze (section 3.3.2) suggesting similar locomotor activity across genotypes. However, BDNF+/- 
9 
rats moved less in the OF (Fig. 4b) and in the EPM (section 3.2.1) compared to the WT controls. Thus, 
10 
when altered locomotor activity between genotypes was present in tasks, it was accounted for in the 
11 
respective analysis. 
12 
Gene expression 
13 
To test whether reduced BDNF levels alter expression patterns of a selection of genes thought to 
14 
underpin the depressive phenotype, we investigated expression of genes involved in affective disorders 
15 
and relevant for an appropriate stress response in the PFC and HPC of naïve WT and BDNF+/- rats. Gene 
16 
expression was upregulated in the PFC of BDNF+/- rats compared to WT animals for GR (t(17) = -2.30, P = 
17 
0.035), Nrg1 (t(17) = -2.25, P = 0.038) and Disc1 (t(17) = -4.71, P = 0.0002), displayed in Fig. 6. There were 
18 
no significant differences between the mRNA levels of MR, Crh, Fkbp5 and Gsk3b in the PFC of WT and 
19 
BDNF+/- rats (Supplementary Table 1). In the HPC, Fkbp5 mRNA expression was reduced in BDNF+/- 
20 
animals compared to WT animals (t(9.45) = 3.09, P = 0.012; Fig. 6). However, no significant difference in 
21 
HPC mRNA expression was identified for GR, MR, Crh, Nrg1, Disc1 and Gsk3b between WT and BDNF+/- 
22 
rats (Supplementary Table 1).

Discussion 
5 
In the present study, we showed that BDNF+/- rats display depressive-like behaviour, signs of anxiety, 
6 
and altered expression of genes associated with mood disorders in the PFC and HPC compared to WT 
7 
animals. However, behavioural despair and cognition was similar for BDNF+/- and WT littermates. 
8 
 
9 
Depressive-like behaviour was assessed by testing for anhedonia, a core symptom of MDD. Sucrose 
10 
consumption is frequently used to evaluate the hedonic state of an animal (Willner 1997). In the present 
11 
study, BDNF+/- rats consumed less sucrose solution in favour of a higher water intake compared to WT 
12 
controls. Hence, reduced BDNF levels resulted in an anhedonic-like state and, thus, BDNF+/- rats exhibit 
13 
a depressive-like phenotype. It is possible that changes in sucrose preference may be the result of 
14 
altered gustatory signalling or altered metabolic signalling in BDNF+/- rats. However, equal food intake 
15 
between the groups in our experiment does not support this. Furthermore, BDNF+/- rats display changes 
16 
in hedonic state in non-gustatory tasks (St. Laurent et al. 2013) and studies altering BDNF levels 
17 
extraneous to the gustatory system observe changes in sucrose consumption as well (Schmidt & Duman 
18 
2010; Taliaz et al. 2010). Thus, BDNF+/- rats express an anhedonic-like phenotype, which is in accordance 
19 
with the literature (Schmidt & Duman 2010; Taliaz et al. 2010; Ye et al. 2011). 
20 
 
The NIH test evaluates the conflict between avoidance of open and lit areas and the desire for 
21 
consuming a food reward (Dulawa & Hen 2005), reflecting depressive-like and/or anxiety-like 
22 
behaviour. There was no difference between BDNF+/- rats and WT controls regarding the time to collect 
23 
the reward. However, all WT rats consumed the reward, whereas 20% of the BDNF+/- group did not.

16 
This might indicate increased anxiety or, alternatively, decreased motivation or sensitivity for the 
1 
reward in BDNF+/- rats, consistent with the anhedonic-like phenotype that we found in the SPT. 
2 
Interestingly, Schmidt & Duman (2010) observed a shortened collection latency in the NIH test in WT 
3 
mice after peripherally administering BDNF, but unaltered behaviour in the sucrose consumption test 
4 
in these mice, suggesting an anxiolytic effect of BDNF administration with no effect on the hedonic 
5 
state. These opposite effects compared to the present study might be due to differences in 
6 
methodology, such as the nature of the reward or the duration of testing, as well as peripheral 
7 
administration versus knockdown (KD) of BDNF. Lower BDNF levels throughout life may alter 
8 
developmental processes and allow compensatory mechanisms to emerge, whereas acute changes in 
9 
BDNF do not succumb to such effects, and thus, the different approaches possibly lead to divergent 
10 
results. Also the model, mouse versus rat, could affect how BDNF influences behaviour, since mice do 
11 
not naturally express peripheral BDNF, which can influence brain gene expression and affective 
12 
behaviour (Schmidt & Duman 2010). The importance of the model is further emphasized by the findings 
13 
that temporal KD of BDNF in the dentate gyrus of rats (Taliaz et al. 2010) but not mice (Adachi et al. 
14 
2008) during adulthood resulted in a decrease of sucrose consumption. Finally, reduced reward 
15 
sensitivity in BDNF+/- rats was also shown in a test of cocaine seeking behaviour (St. Laurent et al. 2013), 
16 
strengthening the results of the present study.  
17 
 
In this study, no difference in anxiety-related behaviour was found in the EPM. In mouse studies 
18 
using the EPM, peripheral BDNF administration was shown to have an anxiolytic effect (Schmidt & 
19 
Duman 2010) but comparison of BDNF+/- to WT mice generated inconsistent results (MacQueen et al. 
20 
2001; Chen et al. 2006). However, another study with BDNF+/- rats, failed to observe altered anxiety 
21 
behaviour in the EPM (Gururajan et al. 2014) hence substantiating our results. Nevertheless, in the 
22 
present study, BDNF+/- rats spent less time in the centre or middle area of the OF, and significantly more 
23 
time in the periphery than their WT littermates. Although this behaviour was accompanied with 
24 
decreased locomotor activity in BDNF+/- rats, the % distance travelled in each zone reflected the findings 
25 
of time spent in a specific zone. Our OF results are supported by another study (Gururajan et al. 2014), 
26 
in which BDNF+/- rats spent less time in the centre of the OF and showed decreased locomotor activity. 
27 
This suggests that the phenotype observed in the OF is not due to the stress of the FST carried out 24 
28 
h prior to OF testing. However, to confirm the anxiety-like phenotype, further tests of anxiety, such as 
29 
the light-dark box, should be carried out to exclude the possibility that task-dependent adaptive traits 
30 
have occurred in the BDNF+/- rats. Thus, findings in BDNF+/- rats support anxiety-like behaviour in the 
31 
OF, but not in the EPM in accordance with the literature.  
32 
 
In the present study, BDNF+/- rats did not show behavioural alterations compared to controls in 
33 
the FST, which is a common test used in preclinical depression research. However, the FST was 
34

17 
developed to assess antidepressant drug efficacy rather than depression symptomatology and is 
1 
sensitive to acute antidepressant treatment while only chronic treatment is efficacious in MDD patients 
2 
(Slattery & Cryan 2012). Therefore, the FST may not be the most appropriate test for assessing the 
3 
permanent effects of genetic manipulations on depressive-like behaviour. 
4 
 
Cognitive impairments are often seen in MDD patients (Rock et al. 2014) and reduced BDNF 
5 
levels have been implicated with impaired spatial short-term memory in rats (Gururajan et al. 2015). 
6 
Similarly, spatial working memory was also impaired in response to stress exposure in a preclinical MDD 
7 
model (Henningsen et al. 2009). We found that spatial working memory was intact in the BDNF+/- group 
8 
compared to WT rats as examined in the SAB test. Furthermore, these results are supported by our 
9 
finding that BDNF+/- rats displayed intact spatial learning and memory as well as normal reversal learning 
10 
in the MWM test. A limitation of our MWM study is the small sample size of WT rats used. While a 
11 
larger sample size would provide a greater level of confidence in our conclusions, the performance of 
12 
WT rats in our study is comparable to those reported in other studies (Spencer et al. 1995; Vorhees & 
13 
Williams 2006), hence we tentatively conclude that spatial cognition is not impaired in BDNF+/- rats. 
14 
 
To understand the neurobiological underpinnings of the behavioural alterations observed in 
15 
the BDNF+/- rats, we investigated mRNA levels of key genes associated with affective disorders. Reduced 
16 
BDNF levels in our model partially mimic the consequence of stress exposure (Smith et al. 1995) and, 
17 
thus, expression of glucocorticoid-regulated genes might be effected in our model. The PFC and HPC 
18 
are key regions affected both by stress as well as in psychiatric disorders (Sheline 2000; Rogers et al. 
19 
2004; Czéh & Lucassen 2007; Dias-Ferreira et al. 2009). Furthermore BDNF mRNA levels were found 
20 
decreased in depressed suicide victims in these regions (Dwivedi et al. 2003).  In the PFC, we found that 
21 
GR mRNA is increased, in combination with Nrg1 and Disc1, in BDNF+/- rats compared to WT controls.   
22 
Viral Knockdown of GR in the PFC is associated with stress hyper-responsivity, reduced stress-
23 
induced affective behaviour (McKlveen et al. 2013), and increased sensitivity to antidepressant 
24 
treatment (Hussain & Jacobson 2015). However, in the non-stressed situation the plasma 
25 
corticosterone levels were normal in these rats. We therefore postulate that the increased GR 
26 
expression in BDNF+/- rats may be a compensatory mechanism to retain normal control of the HPA axis 
27 
and GR signalling in the PFC. This interpretation is supported by the finding that BDNF+/- have a similar 
28 
HPA axis response to WT rats during mild stress exposure (Harris et al. 2016). 
29 
NRG1 was identified as a susceptibility gene in neuropsychiatric diseases in humans, it drives 
30 
neuronal plasticity and is associated with cognitive impairments (Duffy et al. 2010). However, in the 
31 
chronic unpredicatable stress (CUS) model of depression in rats, NRG1 protein was significantly 
32 
increased in the PFC (Dang et al. 2016). This increased PFC NRG1 expression parallels the results found 
33

18 
in our BDNF+/- model and implies increased PFC Nrg1 expression may contribute to the observed 
1 
depressive-like phenotype in our model. 
2 
In schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and MDD, translocation and loss of function of DISC1 was 
3 
shown (Millar 2000; Lipina et al. 2011; Sigurdsson & Duvarci 2016). Overexpression of Disc1 in the 
4 
mouse ventral HPC resulted in a depressive-like phenotype (Sauer et al. 2015). In our study, we found 
5 
that Disc1 expression was elevated in the PFC of the BDNF+/- rats. Viral knockdown of Disc1 solely in the 
6 
PFC increased susceptibility to stress-induced PFC dysfunction (Gamo et al. 2013), which may explain 
7 
why patients with DISC1 mutations are especially vulnerable to stress. Conversely, when DISC1 is 
8 
overexpressed, mimicking a failure of DISC1 proteostasis, characteristics of mental disorders are found 
9 
in behaviour, brain structure and in synaptic processes including membrane trafficking and synaptic 
10 
organisation (Sialana et al. 2018). Therefore, PFC Disc1 overexpression in BDNF+/- rats is potentially 
11 
consistent with underpinning an increased risk of schizophrenia and depression. DISC1 regulates GSK3B 
12 
and altered expression pattern in the latter one was associated with neuropsychiatric diseases, such as 
13 
MDD and anxiety disorder (Ochs et al. 2015). Furthermore, reduced Gsk3b expression can be found in 
14 
the HPC following stress exposure in mice (Brydges et al. 2014), whereas altered GSK3B in the PFC 
15 
affects mood and is suggested relevant for the antidepressant response (Del’Guidice et al. 2015). 
16 
However, in this study Gsk3b expression was not altered in the BDNF+/- rat brain. 
17 
The hippocampus is a region of the brain known to be important for regulation of the HPA axis 
18 
and also is very sensitive to the action of glucocorticoids, which affect cognitive and affective 
19 
behaviours. BDNF+/- rats exhibited normal expression of GR, but a decrease in hippocampal Fkbp5 
20 
mRNA. FKBP5 is a heat shock protein 90 co-chaperone and the complex competes with glucocorticoids 
21 
for binding to GR and, thus, modifies GR sensitivity and its function as a transcription factor (Binder 
22 
2009; Schmidt et al. 2012). Furthermore, GR activity increases FKBP5 expression, providing an ultra 
23 
short feedback loop for GR sensitivity (Binder 2009). Polymorphisms in FKBP5 leading to an increased 
24 
expression of the gene were found in MDD patients and associated with a prolonged stress response 
25 
(Binder 2009). However, as HPA axis response (Harris et al. 2016) and hippocampal GR, MR and Crh 
26 
mRNA levels are normal in the BDNF+/- rats, the mechanistic relevance of the decreased Fkbp5 mRNA 
27 
expression remains to be determined. The unexpected finding that expression of key genes, known to 
28 
be regulated in depressive-like phenotypes, were not regulated in the hippocampus of BDNF+/- rats is 
29 
surprising. However, as the hippocampus is a large heterogeneous structure (Fanselow & Dong 2010), 
30 
it is possible that using whole hippocampal samples in this study precludes detecting subtle differences 
31 
in gene expression levels that may only be present in specific hippocampal subregions. 
32 
We have previously demonstrated that BDNF+/- rats exhibit 30-70% reduced brain and plasma 
33 
levels of BDNF protein (Harris et al. 2016), but due to the ZFN technology used to engineer this genetic 
34

19 
modification, this is not reflected in a change of BDNF mRNA levels. Unfortunately, this precludes 
1 
determination of correlations between regional brain BDNF mRNA levels in BDNF+/- rats with 
2 
behavioural outcomes or key genes measured in this study. 
3 
 
4 
Overall, we have shown that a genetically induced reduction of BDNF levels lead to a depressive-like 
5 
phenotype as well as to alterations in expression levels of genes that are relevant for psychiatric 
6 
disorders. In future studies, testing of female rats should be included due to sex differences observed 
7 
in MDD prevalence in humans (Van de Velde et al. 2010). Furthermore, a combination of stress and 
8 
genetic manipulation might be ideal to provoke a more differentiated phenotype. However, the present 
9 
study established a solid basis for future research, with the rat as a better model for preclinical studies 
10 
than the abundantly studied mouse, due the similarity of BDNF expression in rats and humans and the 
11 
reproducibility of findings in the rat but not in the mouse. Moreover, our study suggests a link of 
12 
decreased BDNF levels with the MDD core symptom of anhedonia. It is also demonstrated that changes 
13 
in BDNF signalling result in altered expression of Disc1, Nrg1, GR and Fkbp5 genes, relevant in affective 
14 
disorders and a healthy stress response. Thus, the present study adds to the complex field of entangling 
15 
the role of BDNF in the development and pathology of MDD.
