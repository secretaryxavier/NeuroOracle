Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) synthesizes a variety of atypical lipids that are exposed
at the cell surface and help the bacterium infect macrophages and escape elimination
by the cell’s immune responses. In the present study, we investigate the mechanism of
action of one family of hydrophobic lipids, the phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM/PDIM),
major lipid virulence factors. DIM are transferred from the envelope of Mtb to host
membranes during infection. Using the polarity-sensitive ﬂuorophore C-Laurdan, we
visualized that DIM decrease the membrane polarity of a supported lipid bilayer put
in contact with mycobacteria, even beyond the site of contact. We observed that
DIM activate the complement receptor 3, a predominant receptor for phagocytosis
of Mtb by macrophages. DIM also increased the activity of membrane-permeabilizing
effectors of Mtb, among which the virulence factor EsxA. This is consistent with previous
observations that DIM help Mtb disrupt host cell membranes. Taken together, our data
show that transferred DIM spread within the target membrane, modify its physical
properties and increase the activity of host cell receptors and bacterial effectors, diverting
in a non-speciﬁc manner host cell functions. We therefore bring new insight into the
molecular mechanisms by which DIM increase Mtb’s capability to escape the cell’s
immune responses.

INTRODUCTION
The envelope lipids, phthiocerol dimycocerosates (DIM/PDIM) are among the major virulence
factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Apart from their structural role as components of the
mycobacterial envelope, DIM are harnessed by the bacteria to manipulate host immune functions,
especially during the early steps of infection, when Mtb encounters macrophages (Rousseau et al.,
2004; Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009; Cambier et al., 2014; Passemar et al., 2014; Barczak et al.,
2017; Quigley et al., 2017). However, there is still a great deal of uncertainty about the molecular
mechanisms of DIM-mediated eﬀects in host cells.

Augenstreich et al.
Phthiocerol Dimycocerosates Modulate Membrane Effectors
Our group has reported that DIM are transferred from the
mycobacterial envelope to the membranes of host macrophages,
and that this transfer increases the phagocytosis of bacteria
(Augenstreich et al., 2019). Further investigations indicated that
once inserted in the host membrane, DIM adopt a conical
shape which disturbs the organization of membrane lipids
(Augenstreich et al., 2019). We hypothesize that this has
functional consequences for the activity of membrane-associated
contributors to phagocytosis. Phagocytosis occurs through the
recognition of Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs)
present at the bacterial surface by receptors expressed in the
host cell plasma membrane. In the case of Mtb, phagocytosis
involves multiple receptors, including the complement receptor
3 (CR3, also named CD11b/CD18 or Mac-1) (Schlesinger,
1993; Stokes et al., 1993; Cywes et al., 1996). Interestingly,
blocking CR3 with antibodies signiﬁcantly reduces the entry
of a DIM-proﬁcient Mtb strain into macrophages without
aﬀecting the uptake of a DIM-deﬁcient mutant (Astarie-
Dequeker et al., 2009), suggesting that the disorganizing eﬀects
of DIM on host cell membranes could target the activity
of CR3.
DIM also cause membrane damage, such as phagosomal
rupture and cell death (Augenstreich et al., 2017; Quigley et al.,
2017). Previous work has shown that DIM act in concert
with the type VII secretion system ESX-1 (T7SS/ESX-1), in
a manner that involves the 6-kDa early secreted antigenic
target (ESAT-6, also known as EsxA) (Augenstreich et al., 2017;
Barczak et al., 2017). EsxA has been predicted to insert into
membranes and to lyse artiﬁcial and biological membranes (Hsu
et al., 2003; Gao et al., 2004; De Jonge et al., 2007; Smith
et al., 2008; Ma et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2016). Interestingly,
the membranolytic activity of EsxA was found to depend on
the lipid composition and on membrane ﬂuidity (Augenstreich
et al., 2017; Ray et al., 2019). The mechanism by which DIM
and EsxA collaborate remains unclear. Barczak and colleagues
proposed that the secretion of EsxA requires DIM (Barczak
et al., 2017). However, previous ﬁndings indicated that the
DIM-deﬁcient mycobacterial strains, which are aﬀected in their
membranolytic activity, secrete similar amounts of EsxA as
the parental strains (Augenstreich et al., 2017; Quigley et al.,
2017). Recently, our group reported that the incorporation of
DIM in the membrane of model liposomes enhanced EsxA
activity (Augenstreich et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the origin of the
membrane-disrupting activity of DIM remains obscure. Indeed,
their potentiating eﬀect on EsxA’s activity is independent of
their ability to rigidify membranes and is limited to membranes
containing lipids extracted from macrophages (Augenstreich
et al., 2017). Moreover, the membranolytic activity of EsxA
itself was called into question by Conrad and colleagues who
showed that the hemolytic activity of recombinant EsxA obtained
from the same source was due to residual detergent used in the
puriﬁcation protocol (Conrad et al., 2017). Thus, the capacity
of Mtb to permeabilize host membranes is more complex than
initially thought.
It therefore remains of importance to determine how DIM
contribute to the phagocytosis of Mtb and to the membranolytic
activity of bacteria at the molecular level.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Antibodies and Reagents
The 2LPM19c mouse antibody directed against the CD11b
subunit of human CR3 (IgG1, dilution 1:20) and normal mouse
IgG1 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The
CBRM1/5 mouse antibody raised against an activation-speciﬁc
epitope on the CD11b subunit of human CR3 (IgG1, dilution
1:50) was from eBiosciences. POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine) was from Avanti Polar Lipids. THP-1
lipids were extracted from THP-1 cells as described previously
(Augenstreich et al., 2017). C-Laurdan was synthesized as
described in Mazeres et al. (2014). DIM (average mw = 1,432
g/mol) were puriﬁed from Mycobacterium canetti (Augenstreich
et al., 2019). Stock solutions of 40 mg/mL were prepared
by dissolving the dried lipids in chloroform: methanol (2:1,
vol/vol) (Augenstreich et al., 2019). For cell treatment, DIM
were dispersed in culture medium at a ﬁnal concentration of
0.1 mg/mL corresponding to 70 µM. The other reagents were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions
The unmarked mas mutant (H37Rv△mas), the ppsE mutant
(H37Rv△ppsE),
the
esxA
mutant
(H37Rv△esxA)
of
Mtb
and the mas mutant (BCG△mas), the spontaneous fad26
mutant (BCG△fad26), the pks15/1 mutant (BCG△pks15/1) of
Mycobacterium bovis BCG were characterized in Figure S1a
and in previous work (Constant et al., 2002; Astarie-Dequeker
et al., 2009; Simeone et al., 2010; Augenstreich et al., 2017). The
recombinant BCG strains complemented with the ESX-1 system
in DIM-proﬁcient or DIM-deﬁcient strains (BCG::ESX-1 and
BCG△mas::ESX-1) were constructed as previously mentioned
(Augenstreich et al., 2017). Bacteria were rendered ﬂuorescent
by transferring the plasmid pMV361H gfp (Astarie-Dequeker
et al., 2009) or the plasmid pMVmCherry derived from a plasmid
pMV361eH harboring the mCherry encoding gene (Burbaud
et al., 2016). All strains were cultured at 37◦C as previously
described (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009; Augenstreich et al.,
2017).
Phagocyte Culture
The human promonocytic cell line THP-1 (ECACC 88081201;
Salisbury, UK) was cultured and diﬀerentiated in macrophages
with PMA, as mentioned in Augenstreich et al. (2019). Human
blood purchased from the Etablissement Français du Sang
(Toulouse, France) was collected from fully-anonymous non-
tuberculous donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
human monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDM) were prepared
as previously described (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009).
Phagocytosis Assay
Single bacteria suspensions were prepared from exponentially
growing strains as previously described (Astarie-Dequeker et al.,
2009; Tabouret et al., 2010). The concentration of bacteria was
estimated from the optical density at 600 nm (OD600 = 0.1 for 2
× 107 bacilli/mL). hMDM cultured in RPMI on glass coverslips
were incubated at 37◦C for 1 h with GFP-expressing bacteria at a
multiplicity-of-infection (MOI) of 10:1 or with zymosan at MOI

30:1. Phagocytosis was assessed by ﬂuorescence microscopy as
previously reported (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009; Augenstreich
et al., 2019).
Expression and Puriﬁcation of
Recombinant EsxA
Recombinant Mtb EsxA (rEsxA) was prepared according to the
step-by-step protocol provided by BEI Resources (available at
csu-cvmbs.colostate.edu/Documents/dobos-rp004.pdf). The C-
terminally His-tagged protein was expressed in Escherichia coli
BL21(DE3)pLysS using the plasmid pMRLB.7 containing Mtb
esxA (NR-50170, BEI Resources). rEsxA was then puriﬁed
according to the BEI protocol, adapted by omitting the washing
step with ASB-14. The protein was checked for purity by
SDS/PAGE followed by Coomassie staining, and dialyzed using
3,500-MWCO dialysis tubing in 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate,
lyophilized and stored at −20◦C. For the calcein leakage
experiments, a small amount of rEsxA was weighed and
solubilized in PBS at a ﬁnal concentration of 2 mg/mL.
Assay for Measurement of Membrane
Polarity
We characterized membrane polarity using the membrane dye
C-Laurdan, whose ﬂuorescence spectrum shifts toward lower
wavelengths when the membrane becomes more apolar (Mazeres
et al., 2017). A supported lipid membrane of phospholipid
POPC labeled with 1% C-Laurdan was formed on a Ø25 mm
microscope coverslip using the method of vesicle fusion
(Mascalchi et al., 2012). The membrane was put in contact with a
suspension of 2 × 106 bacteria, centrifuged at 1,500 g for 5 min at
room temperature to sediment the bacteria onto the membrane,
and further incubated for 20 min at room temperature. We took
two-photon microscopy images on a Zeiss LSM710 inverted
confocal microscope using a 40× water immersion objective.
The membrane polarity was characterized by the Generalized
Polarization (GP), a ratiometric measure given by GP = (I440–
I490)/(I440+I490) where I440 and I490 are the ﬂuorescence
intensities of C-Laurdan at 440 and 490 nm, respectively.
Calcein Leakage Assays
The membranolytic activity of compounds was evaluated on
liposomes using a calcein leakage assay, as previously described
(Augenstreich et al., 2017). The liposomes were composed of
POPC or of THP-1 lipids supplemented or not with 10%
(mol/mol) of DIM and contained a solution of 50 mM calcein.
Contact Dependent Hemolytic Activity of
Mycobacterium spp
Lytic activity of Mycobacterium spp was detected by a hemolysis
assay. Exponentially-growing mycobacteria in 7H9-ADC-Tween
80 0.05% were pelleted by centrifugation and washed twice
in PBS (Smith et al., 2008; Conrad et al., 2017). Fresh blood
was centrifuged and the pellet was resuspended in isotonic
NaCl solution and washed twice with PBS. The ﬁnal red blood
cells (RBC) suspension containing 1 × 107 cells was mixed
with bacteria at MOI of 50:1, centrifuged and incubated at
37◦C for 48 h. The pellet was resuspended, centrifuged and
the supernatant was recovered. The absorbance at 415 nm
(A415) was measured on a CLARIOstar 96-well microplate
reader. The supernatants of cells treated with PBS or lysed
with 0.1% Triton X-100 were used as reference values for 0
and 100% hemolysis, respectively. The percentage of hemolysis
was calculated using the formula: % hemolysis = (A415,sample-
A415,PBS)/(A415,TritonX100-A415,PBS).
Statistics
All results are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
(SEM) for the indicated number of experiments (n). Statistical
analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad
Software Inc.) and presented in ﬁgure legends. Diﬀerences were
considered signiﬁcant if p < 0.05.
RESULTS
DIM Contribute to the Membrane Polarity
Decrease in a Lipid Bilayer Beyond the Site
of Interaction With Mycobacteria
We previously reported that DIM are transferred from M. bovis
BCG to the macrophage (Augenstreich et al., 2019) and decrease
its overall membrane polarity (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009).
We investigated whether this decrease is restricted to the site of
contact between the bacilli and the host membrane, or extends
beyond it, as the pleiotropic eﬀects of DIM suggest. A supported
POPC membrane labeled with the polarity-sensitive ﬂuorophore
C-Laurdan was put in contact with mCherry-expressing bacilli,
either wild-type M. bovis BCG (BCG WT) or a DIM-deﬁcient
isogenic M. bovis BCG mutant, BCG1mas, with a deleted
mas, encoding an enzyme essential for DIM synthesis (Azad
et al., 1996). POPC is a physiologically representative lipid
forming ﬂuid membranes at room temperature. Using mCherry
ﬂuorescence and transmission images, we ﬁrst searched for
bacteria immobilized on the membrane (Figure 1A, left). The
majority of bacteria remained in suspension and diﬀused in the
buﬀer (blurred spots in Figure 1A). By two-photon microscopy,
we then imaged the C-Laurdan around immobile bacteria.
Bacteria absorbed C-Laurdan from the bilayer (Figure 1A, right),
implying that the C-Laurdan ﬂuorescence spectrum at the point
of contact contained contributions both from the membrane
and the bacteria. We discerned no diﬀerence in C-Laurdan
ﬂuorescence intensity between the two strains (Figure S1b). We
enlarged the bacterial contour, determined from the C-Laurdan
ﬂuorescence, three times by 5 pixels (520 nm), thus deﬁning three
concentric bands around the immobile bacterium (C1, C2, and
C3 in Figure 1B image). From the average ﬂuorescence spectrum
in these bands, we calculated the corresponding Generalized
Polarization (GP) values to characterize the membrane polarity
in each band. The value of GP increases when the membrane
becomes more apolar. We subtracted the intrinsic GP of the
membrane, averaged over three zones outside C1, C2, and C3
and far from all bacteria, from the GP of the diﬀerent bands
to quantify the GP diﬀerence (1GP) around bacteria. GP was
increased inside the bacterial contour for both strains, reﬂecting
the apolar nature of the mycobacterial envelope. We noticed

and incubated with 2 × 106 M. bovis BCG::mCherry or BCG1mas::mCherry for 20 min. Two-photon microscopy images were taken on an inverted confocal
microscope equipped with a femto second pulsed laser (Chameleon Vision II) and with a 561 nm DPSS laser for mCherry ﬂuorescence and transmission imaging. A
build-in spectrometer allowed the acquisition of a ﬂuorescence spectrum in each pixel. C-Laurdan was excited at 720 nm; its ﬂuorescence spectrum was collected in
18 channels between 418 and 593 nm (channel width 9.7 nm), resulting in a λ-stack of 18 images. The acquisition time per image was 31 s (A) Immobilized bacteria
were ﬁrst selected by mCherry and transmission microscopy (left panel), then the C-Laurdan spectrum was acquired around an immobile bacterium by two-photon
microscopy (right panel). (B) (left panel) Contour and concentric bands around an immobile bacterium. 1GP was calculated in these bands using the average GP of

a small and similar increase in GP in zone C1 with respect
to the membrane for both strains (1GP above 0) (Figure 1B).
However, further away from the bacteria in band C2 and C3,
1GP remained positive for BCG WT, whereas GP returned to the
membrane reference value for BCG1mas (Figure 1B). Hence,
the mean GP increase was both higher and observed over a larger
distance for the DIM-producing BCG WT strain than for the
DIM-deﬁcient BCG1mas mutant (Figure 1B). The membrane
was therefore more apolar around BCG WT than around
BCG1mas. Given the resolution of the microscope (around
250 nm), the observed GP increase in C1 might be caused
by bacterial ﬂuorescence extending into C1. Importantly, this
increase persisted up to zone C3 for BCG WT corresponding to
1–1.5 µm from the edge of the bacteria (Figure 1B). This distance
is too big to be caused by an optical resolution eﬀect. In M.
bovis BCG, the deletion of mas induces not only DIM deﬁciency
but also the loss of the structurally similar phenolic glycolipids
(PGL). We therefore made a smaller-scale test with BCG mutants
deﬁcient for DIM or PGL only. BCG1fad26 mutant with a
spontaneous mutation in the fad26 gene involved in DIM, but
not PGL, biosynthesis (Simeone et al., 2010), displayed a lower
mean 1GP than the WT BCG strain (Figure S1c). In contrast,

FIGURE 2 | DIM and PMA trigger the entry of the DIM-deﬁcient H37Rv mutant and of zymosan into macrophages through a CR3-dependent process. (A)
Macrophages were either left untreated (gray square) or treated at 37◦C for 1 h with 70 µM DIM (red square) or the corresponding volume of chloroform:methanol (Ø
vehicle control, gray square) or for 15 min with 50 nM PMA (green square) or the corresponding volume of DMSO (Ø vehicle control, gray square). Cells were then
incubated for a further 30 min with either the non-relevant IgG1 or 10 µg/mL anti-CR3 blocking antibody 2LPM19c and put in contact for 1 h with zymosan at MOI
30:1. (B) Macrophages were successively incubated with 50 nM PMA (green symbol) or the corresponding volume of DMSO (Ø vehicle control, gray symbol) and with
IgG1 or 10 µg/mL 2LPM19c and then exposed to GFP-expressing H37Rv (circle) or H37Rv△ppsE (triangle) at MOI 10:1 for 1 h. (A,B) At the end of infection, cells
were rinsed, ﬁxed and processed for the quantiﬁcation of infected macrophages using a Leica 43 DM-RB epiﬂuorescence microscope. For each set of conditions, the
experiments were performed in duplicate, and at least 100 cells were counted per slide. The percentage of cells having ingested at least one bacterium, or one
particle, was determined. The values are mean ± SEM of 3–7 separate experiments. The signiﬁcance of difference between control and treatment was evaluated

behaves similar to the WT BCG strain (Figure S1c). Together,
our data indicate that DIM, and not PGL, contribute to the
decrease in membrane polarity which extends around the site of
bacterial contact over at least 1–1.5 µm. They also suggest that
after transfer to the host membranes, DIM diﬀuse laterally in
the membrane.
DIM Induce the Activation of Complement
Receptor 3 for an Optimal Invasion of
Macrophages
We
then
asked
whether
this
DIM-induced
membrane
perturbation could aﬀect the phagocytic activity of CR3, the
main receptor for Mtb entry in human macrophages. To address
this question, we used zymosan, a yeast-derived polysaccharide
particle, as a phagocytic prey for CR3 (Le Cabec et al., 2000).
Macrophages were pre-incubated with exogenously added
DIM or with a corresponding volume of chloroform:methanol
dispersed in culture medium. We then evaluated the eﬀect
of the CR3-speciﬁc blocking antibody 2LPM19c on the
ability of macrophages to internalize zymosan (Figure 2A).
In the absence of DIM, zymosan uptake was not signiﬁcantly
aﬀected by adding 10µg/mL 2LPM19c, indicating that the
CR3-dependent phagocytosis of zymosan is poorly eﬃcient in
resting macrophages (Figure 2A). Treatment of macrophages
with DIM increased zymosan uptake by around 50% above
the level without DIM (Figure 2A). We previously related this
augmentation to the conical shape of DIM (Augenstreich et al.,
2019). Here, we found that this DIM-induced increase was
almost completely blocked by adding 2LPM19c (Figure 2A),
supporting the proposal that DIM promote the engagement of
CR3 in the phagocytosis of zymosan.
We then examined whether DIM aﬀect surface expression
of CR3. Using ﬂow cytometry, we found no diﬀerence in
the expression of CD11b subunit of CR3 between untreated
macrophages and macrophages treated with DIM (Figure S2a).
The functionality of CR3 also depends on the activation state
of the receptor (Wright and Silverstein, 1982). We showed
that treating the macrophages with 50 nM phorbol myristate
acetate (PMA), a known agonist activating CR3 (Diamond and

Augenstreich et al.

Springer, 1993), increased phagocytosis of zymosan compared
to control cells (Figure 2A). This eﬀect is reduced by roughly
50% in the presence of 2LPM19c. The eﬀect of PMA
on phagocytosis therefore resembles that of puriﬁed DIM,
supporting the hypothesis that DIM activate CR3 and facilitate
zymosan phagocytosis.
Finally, we looked at what happens in the context of Mtb.
Treatment of cells with 2LPM19c decreased by around 50%
the internalization of H37Rv WT, conﬁrming that Mtb uses
mainly CR3 to invade human macrophages (Astarie-Dequeker
et al., 2009). Interestingly, adding PMA did not improve the
uptake of H37Rv WT, suggesting that CR3 is already activated
by H37Rv (Figure 2B). In comparison, internalization of the
DIM-deﬁcient mutant H37Rv△ppsE, which lacks a gene essential
for DIM biosynthesis, is dramatically decreased and insensitive
to CR3-blocking treatment, as previously described (Astarie-
Dequeker et al., 2009). Adding PMA restored both the infectivity
of the mutant and its inhibition by 2LPM19c to a level almost
identical to that of the H37Rv WT strain (Figure 2B). Moreover,
the CBRM1/5 antibody directed against the activation epitope
of CR3 tended to block the uptake of both H37Rv in untreated
and PMA-treated cells and of H37Rv△ppsE in PMA-treated
cells only (Figure S2b). Together, these data led us to conclude
that DIM activate CR3, thereby ensuring an optimal invasion
of macrophages.
DIM Act in Concert With Mycobacterial
Effectors to Promote Lysis of Biological
Membranes
We next enquired how DIM contribute to the membrane-
disrupting eﬀect of Mtb. Using our assay based on calcein leakage
from large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) and mass spectrometry,
we corroborated that the lytic activity of the batch of rEsxA
from BEI, which we previously attributed to EsxA (Augenstreich
et al., 2017), was in fact due to residual detergent ASB14
(Figure S3a–d) (Conrad et al., 2017). These observations
prompted us to test a native version of EsxA (nEsxA) puriﬁed
from a culture of Mtb (De Jonge et al., 2007). As expected, we
observed pH-dependent lytic activity of nEsxA on LUV made
of POPC (Figure 3A) (De Jonge et al., 2007). The activity at
pH 5 was signiﬁcantly decreased after digestion by proteinase K,
ruling out the presence of detergent (Figure 3A). Based on these
positive results, we investigated whether DIM could modulate
the activity of nEsxA. On liposomes of THP-1 lipids without
DIM, the lytic activity of nEsxA at pH 5 was <10% (Figure 3B),
well below that observed on POPC liposomes (Figure 3A). This
diﬀerence can be explained by the higher membrane rigidity of
THP-1 liposomes compared to POPC liposomes (Augenstreich
et al., 2017; Ray et al., 2019). Nevertheless, incorporating DIM
in THP-1 liposomes tended to potentiate by 35% the activity
of nEsxA (Figure 3B). We also tested a recombinant version
of EsxA (rEsxA) (Figure 3B) produced by us in E. coli and
puriﬁed using the protocol provided by BEI Resources (Conrad
et al., 2017) without the ASB-14-based endotoxin removal. We
noticed that rESXA permeabilized liposomes more eﬃciently
than nEsxA. We have no rational explanation for this diﬀerence
but we observed that DIM also increased the membranolytic
activity of rEsxA (Figure 3B). This eﬀect is speciﬁc to DIM, as
the incorporation of the apolar triglyceride tripalmitin in THP-
1 liposomes had no impact on the calcein leakage induced by
rESXA (60 ± 30% and 53 ± 15%, n = 2, in the absence and the
presence of 10% tripalmitin, respectively). We also observed that
incorporation of DIM into THP-1-derived liposomes increased
the lytic activity of the two pore-forming proteins, melittin and
perforin-1 (Figure 3B). These observations indicated that DIM
enhance the activity of diﬀerent membranolytic compounds.
We also tested whether DIM work with EsxA in a
mycobacterial context. To this end, we studied the hemolytic
activity of several knock-out or knock-in mutants of Mtb and
M. bovis BCG expressing combinations of DIM and EsxA. The
H37Rv WT strain incubated for 48 h with human erythrocytes
exhibited hemolytic activity (43+8%, n = 4). By comparison,
the H37Rv1esxA and H37Rv1mas mutants were signiﬁcantly
less hemolytic (Figure 3C), indicating that both DIM and EsxA
contribute to hemolysis. These results were conﬁrmed in the
BCG background, which has a partial deletion of ESX-1 and a
functional inhibition of EsxA. Indeed, when BCG was genetically
complemented with the ESX-1 region from Mtb, EsxA secretion
was re-established (Augenstreich et al., 2017) and the resulting
BCG::ESX-1 strain demonstrated higher hemolytic activity than
the BCG WT strain and the DIM-deﬁcient BCG::ESX-11mas
mutant (Figure 3C). Most notably, in both genetic backgrounds,
the DIM-deﬁcient strains exhibited signiﬁcantly lower hemolytic
activity than EsxA- or ESX-1-deﬁcient strains, showing that DIM
have an impact extending beyond EsxA/ESX-1.
DISCUSSION
The notion of DIM as bacterial eﬀectors subverting the host’s
immune responses has recently emerged (Rousseau et al., 2004;
Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009; Cambier et al., 2014; Passemar
et al., 2014; Augenstreich et al., 2017; Barczak et al., 2017;
Conrad et al., 2017; Quigley et al., 2017; Lerner et al., 2018), but
the molecular mechanisms by which DIM exert their biological
activity are poorly known. We have previously demonstrated that
DIM are transferred from the envelope of Mtb to the membranes
of host macrophages during infection and locally disturb their
lipid organization (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009; Augenstreich
et al., 2019). The next step was to identify the functional role
of this transfer. We now establish that DIM induce a membrane
perturbation, which spreads beyond the point of contact with the
bacilli and improves the activity of proteins either embedded in
host membranes, like CR3, or acting on these membranes, like
EsxA and other membranolytic eﬀectors.
Using C-laurdan combined with two-photon microscopy,
we showed that the membrane polarity decreased at the
site of interaction of BCG with a lipid membrane. This is
consistent with our previous observation of a global decrease
in membrane polarity in a population of macrophages infected
by BCG (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009). As C-Laurdan allows
identifying lipid domains with diﬀerent packing degrees and
lipid order (Owen et al., 2010), the observed decrease in

491 nm; its ﬂuorescence was measured at 517 nm. The ﬂuorescence intensity was converted in a percentage of leakage by the formula: % leakage = 100 ×
[I(t)–I0]/[ITX−100-I0] (Augenstreich et al., 2017). For each measurement, a new batch of liposome was made. Before treatment, we checked that the liposomes showed
no calcein leakage (Augenstreich et al., 2017). The signiﬁcance of difference in the percentage of leakage between untreated and membranolytic agent-treated
liposomes was evaluated using the paired Student’s t-test. (C) Strains of H37Rv or BCG producing a combination of EsxA and DIM were put in contact for 48 h at
37◦C with 1 × 107 erythrocytes at a MOI 50:1. Hemolysis was measured as described in Material and Methods and normalized to value of the corresponding DIM-
and EsxA-proﬁcient strain. The values are mean ± SEM of 4–5 separate experiments. The signiﬁcance of difference between strains was determined using a one-way
ANOVA test followed by Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test; *p ≤0.05, **p ≤0.01, ***p ≤0.001; ****p ≤0.0001.
polarity strongly supports the proposal that DIM locally disturb
the lipid organization of host membranes and alter their
physical properties. This can also be interpreted in the light
of our recent ﬁndings showing that DIM adopt a conical
molecular shape in a simple phospholipid bilayer and can
disorganize such a bilayer by promoting the formation of non-
bilayer (inverted hexagonal) membrane phases (Augenstreich
et al., 2019). Remarkably, we observed that the local decrease
in membrane polarity extends over a distance of 1–1.5 µm
around the bacterium. These observations provide experimental
support to our molecular dynamic simulations predicting
diﬀusion of DIM inside the membrane (see (Augenstreich
et al., 2019); supplementary movie). Indeed, after transfer
from the bacterium to the target membranes, DIM diﬀuse
away from the contact site, causing a gradual fading of the
polarity decrease.

Augenstreich et al.
Phthiocerol Dimycocerosates Modulate Membrane Effectors
Changes in membrane lipid composition and organization
are generally thought to inﬂuence many cellular functions.
Our ﬁndings go beyond the functional observations that Mtb
uses envelope lipids to remodel the host membrane and divert
macrophages functions (Laneelle and Tocanne, 1980; Sut et al.,
1990; Welin et al., 2008; Augenstreich et al., 2019; Mishra
et al., 2019). They provide evidence that insertion of lipids
into host cell membranes helps the bacteria exploit membrane
partners that direct the cell’s responses. For instance, DIM
increase CR3 activity for promoting phagocytosis. Like most
integrins, CR3 is normally exposed at the cell surface in
a low-activity state but can undergo changes that lead to
increased activity, e.g., conformational changes leading to a
state of higher aﬃnity for their speciﬁc ligands (Liddington
and Ginsberg, 2002). We found that DIM mimic at least
in part the action of PMA, a known activator of CR3. For
instance, DIM treatment increased the uptake of zymosan,
which was almost completely abolished when CR3 was blocked
by an anti-CR3 blocking antibody. Moreover, PMA restored
the ability of a DIM-deﬁcient mutant to infect macrophages
equally eﬃciently as the WT strain, probably through the
engagement of the active epitope of CR3 as assessed using
CBRM1/5. All together, these data tend to indicate that
DIM can also activate the CR3 receptor. Since CR3 can
undergo activation yielding a conformational change that
increases the aﬃnity for its ligands, this activation would
enable recognition by CR3 of PAMPs at the surface of Mtb
leading to its uptake. Conical lipids like DIM may induce
membrane curvature (Cooke and Deserno, 2006). The resulting
membrane elastic stress may in turn modulate the function
of integral membrane proteins (Phillips et al., 2009). It is
therefore reasonable to hypothesize that DIM impose a curvature
on the host’s membrane that governs CR3’s activation. This
is consistent with the transmembrane nature of CR3 and its
lateral mobility within cell membranes (Ross et al., 1992). DIM
could also act on other membrane receptors cooperating with
CR3 to carry out entry of mycobacteria, like CD14 which
has been shown to induce an inside-out signaling pathway
involving TLR2, leading to a CR3-dependent phagocytosis of
M. bovis BCG (Sendide et al., 2005).
Our ﬁndings reinforce the proposal that DIM can work
with MtbEsxA (Augenstreich et al., 2017; Barczak et al., 2017).
Using liposomes formed of THP-1 lipids, we demonstrate that
DIM enhance the activity of Mtb EsxA. Combined with our
previous data in macrophages, these results provide a reasonable
explanation for DIM’s involvement in the deterioration of the
phagosomal membrane by Mtb (Augenstreich et al., 2017;
Quigley et al., 2017). Interestingly, this potentiating eﬀect of DIM
is not speciﬁc to EsxA but also observed for the two pore-forming
proteins melittin and perforin-1, and even for the detergent ASB-
14 (Figure S3e). This strengthens the evidence that DIM act by
perturbing their target membrane to promote the membrane-
disruptive activities of these molecules. Furthermore, using gene-
deleted Mtb mutants, we observed that the loss of DIM results in
a lower hemolytic activity of Mtb than the loss of EsxA. As DIM
alone have no lytic activity, this implies that additional bacterial
factors are involved in this process.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings reveal molecular mechanisms
by which Mtb exploit DIM to rewire the host cells. Given
their overall hydrophobic properties, DIM are able to reshape
locally the host cell membrane in a way that targets cell
signaling pathways and bacterial eﬀectors, thus supporting their
multifaceted role in the virulence of Mtb.
