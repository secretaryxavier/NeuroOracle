Abstract
The goal of this study was to assess integrity of the cingulum bundle in patients diagnosed with
first episode schizophrenia, chronic schizophrenia, and matched controls as well as to determine
the relationship between diffusion measures of cingulum bundle integrity and severity of patients’
delusions of reference. Participants, who comprised 18 first episode patients, 20 chronic patients,
and two groups of matched controls (20 subjects in each), underwent 3 Tesla MRI diffusion tensor
imaging. Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (chronic + first episode) showed decreased
fractional anisotropy in the right cingulum bundle compared with controls. First episode patients
exhibited higher trace bilaterally, compared with matched controls, and on the left compared with
chronic patients. Axial diffusivity was increased in first episode patients, bilaterally, compared
with matched controls and chronic patients. Radial diffusivity was also higher, bilaterally, in first
episode patients compared with matched controls, and on the right compared with chronic

patients. Trace diffusity and radial diffusivity in first episode patients were significantly correlated
with increased severity of delusions of reference. Given that the abnormalities were present only
in first episode patients and were not observed in chronic cases, it appears that they normalize over
time. These abnormalities in first episode patients involved diffusivity measures in all directions
(trace, radial and axial), suggesting a likely acute, partially reversible process in which there is an
increase in brain water content, i.e., swelling, edema, or inflammation, that may reflect an early
neuroinflammatory response in first episode patients.

1. Introduction
Delusions of reference are a characteristic symptom of schizophrenia whereby patients
misinterpret social and interpersonal stimuli as having exaggerated personal significance,
such as believing a television newscaster is talking directly to or about them. It has been
suggested that delusions of reference might be caused by insignificant events being given
abnormal emotional valence (Fudge et al., 1998). The current study focuses on the cingulum
bundle, a major white matter tract that connects the neocortex (e.g., cingulate gyrus) with
the limbic system (e.g., hippocampal-amygdala complex). Given the anatomy of the
cingulum bundle, and its role in regulating emotional and social cognition (Hadland et al.,
2003; Brunet-Gouet and Decety, 2006), we examined the integrity of the cingulum bundle in
patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and correlated these findings with delusions of
reference. We hypothesized that while some degree of conduction delay is necessary for the
formation of delusions of references, delays beyond a certain threshold might not give rise to
psychotic symptoms. The cingulum bundle is an anatomical structure that is often portrayed
as forming the bridge between emotion and cognition (Allman et al., 2001), and
impairments of both of those processes are found in schizophrenia (Tamminga et al., 2000).
In studies with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a method that quantifies the tissue integrity
of the physical connections between different regions of the brain by measuring the
diffusion of water, patients with chronic schizophrenia have been shown to exhibit lower
fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity in the cingulum bundle, relative to
matched healthy controls (see reviews in Kubicki et al., 2007; Shenton et al., 2010). This
decrease in fractional anisotropy in patients with chronic schizophrenia has been correlated
with intelligence (e.g., Nestor et al., 2008), passivity symptoms (e.g., Sim et al., 2009),
prosaccade latency (Manoach et al., 2007), and auditory hallucinations (e.g., Hubl et al.,
2004). In addition, mean diffusivity in the cingulum bundle in patients with chronic
schizophrenia has also been correlated with performance time on the Stroop Test (Takei et
al., 2009), suggesting that disruptions in white matter fiber connections may slow processing
speed.
The cingulum bundle has been less well studied in patients with first episode or recent onset
schizophrenia than in chronic patients. The studies that do exist have observed a mixture of
decreased (Kumra et al., 2005; Hao et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2010; Voineskos et al., 2010;

Lee et al., 2013), increased (Segal et al., 2010), both increased and decreased, (Hoptman et
al., 2008), and no differences in fractional anisotropy (Peters et al., 2008), relative to
matched healthy controls. For example, looking at clinical symptomatology, Tang et al.
(Tang et al., 2010) showed that decreased fractional anisotropy was associated with
increased positive symptoms as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale
(Kay et al., 1987). In first episode patients, Moriya et al. (Moriya et al., 2010) reported
abnormally high mean diffusivity in the right anterior cingulate gyrus, and Lee et al. (Lee et
al., 2013) reported widespread increased mean diffusivity, including in the cingulum.
While mean diffusivity (or trace = mean diffusivity x 3) and fractional anisotropy have been
the standard measures for many years in DTI studies, and are believed to reflect overall
white matter health, maturation and organization (Basser et al., 1994; Basser and Pierpaoli,
1996). Two additional measures, axial and radial diffusivity, have recently become available
and are useful in furthering our understanding of the underlying physiology. Axial
diffusivity, which is a measure of the degree of diffusion along the primary diffusion
direction of the fiber, has been shown to reflect axon integrity, whereas the orthogonal
measure, radial diffusivity, has been shown to reflect myelin integrity (Song et al., 2002;
Song et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005). The present study compared the cingulum bundle in
patients with schizophrenia at first episode with patients with chronic schizophrenia, and
each of these patient groups’ matched controls, using fractional anisotropy, trace diffusity,
axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity. Given the possible role of the cingulum bundle in the
formation of delusions of reference, we hypothesized an association between these four
diffusion measures and the severity of patients’ delusions of reference.
2. Methods
2.1. Subjects
This study included 18 patients diagnosed with first episode schizophrenia, 20 patients
diagnosed with chronic schizophrenia, and 20 controls for each patient group, for a total of
78 subjects (see Table 1). First episode patients were recruited as part of the larger Boston
Center for Intervention Development and Applied Research (CIDAR) study, and they met
criteria for a DSM-IV-TR (2000) diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or
schizophreniform disorder. Only patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were included in this
study. They ranged in age from 15 to 31 years, and none had longer than | year of
continuous antipsychotic treatment (see Table 1). Chronic patients were defined as meeting
DSM-IV-TR criteria for a diagnosis for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and ranged
in age from 23 to 53 years, with a minimum of 5 years post-onset of illness (see Table 1).
Patients were excluded if they had a history of electroconvulsive therapy within the past 5
years. Diagnoses were based on a diagnostic interview using the Structured Clinical
Interview for the DSM-IV-TR (SCID), with the Research Version used for ages >18, and the
Childhood Version for subjects 13-17 years of age (First et al., 2002b). The severity of
delusions of reference was assessed in the first episode sample with the Scale for the
Assessment of Positive Symptoms (item 14), which was administered on average 18.6 days
from the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (Andreasen, 1984).

Control subjects were screened for the presence of an Axis I disorder using the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Non-patient Edition (First et al., 2002a), and were excluded
if (1) they currently met the criteria for any psychosis, major depressive disorder, dysthymic
disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder,
dissociative disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or developmental disorders; (2)
they had a history of any psychosis, major depression (recurrent), bipolar disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, developmental disorders, or
psychiatric hospitalization; (3) they had current or past use of antipsychotics for any
psychiatric condition (other past psychotropic medication use acceptable, but patients must
have been off medicine for at least 6 months before participating in the study, except for prn
medications like sleeping medications or anxiolytic agents, like beta-blockers for
performance anxiety, tremors, etc.); (4) they had any history of electro-convulsive therapy;
(5) there was evidence of any prodromal symptoms, or schizotypal or other Cluster A
personality disorders; or (6) they reported having a first degree relative with psychosis.
For all subjects exclusion criteria included sensory-motor handicaps, neurological disorders,
medical illnesses that significantly affect neurological functioning, diagnosis of mental
retardation, education of less than 9" grade (or less than 5" grade for subjects under 18),
non-fluency in English (exposure to English by age 6), substance abuse in the past month as
defined by the DSM-IV-TR, substance dependence (excluding nicotine) in the past 3 months
as defined by the DSM-IV-TR, and current suicidality. For their safety during the MRI
scanning, all subjects were screened for foreign metal in their body, pacemakers, pregnancy,
claustrophobia, or any other circumstance that may pose a risk. All study participants (or
legal guardians for those under 18) gave written informed consent before study participation.
The study was approved by the local IRB committees at Harvard Medical School, Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Brigham and Women’s
Hospital and at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, Brockton campus.
2.2. DTI scanning and processing
Subjects received diffusion imaging on a General Electric Echospeed system, using an echo
planar imaging DTI sequence double echo option to reduce eddy-current related distortions
(Alexander et al., 1997; Heid, 2000) at a resolution of 1.7 mm x 1.7 mm x 1.7 mm (51
diffusion directions at b=900, 8 baseline scans at b=0, 17000 ms repetition time, 78 ms echo
time, 24 cm field of view, 144 x 144 matrix) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston.
Manual regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn for every case. The cingulum was traced with
two distinct ROIs. The first one was drawn on three sequential coronal slices where the
anterior commissure is most visible, and the second one was drawn on two consecutive
coronal slices that were anterior and posterior to the splenium of the corpus callosum (see
Fig. 1). The placement of these regions was guided by two atlases (Mori et al., 2005; Catani
and Thiebaut de Schotten, 2008). Streamline tractography for the cingulum was initiated
(seeded) in both ROIs, and then filtered through a midline exclusion region (see Fig. 2). An
eigenvector-tracking algorithm based on the fourth order Runge-Kutta method for tracking
axonal fibers was used in this approach (Basser et al., 2000). A regularization scheme was
used, where a small bias toward the previous tracking direction to the current tensor is

added. The tractography stopping criteria were Westin’s measures (Westin at al., 2002)
below 0.15 and rapid change of direction angle above 45 degrees. Westin’s linear measure
was used to terminate tractography, in order to avoid the confound of using the same
measure to construct fiber tracts and to quantify their integrity. After fiber tracking, mean
fractional anisotropy, trace, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity were calculated for all
voxels through which any fiber tracts passed. Trace and fractional anisotropy are
independent of each other, with trace measuring the size of the diffusion tensor and
fractional anisotropy measuring the shape of the diffusion tensor. Axial and radial
diffusivity, which are substrates of trace, have been shown to be differentially sensitive to
certain pathologies; that is, axial diffusivity has been shown to be sensitive to axonal
pathology while radial diffusivity is sensitive to myelin pathology (Song et al., 2002; Song
et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005; Hanson and Gottesman, 2005). For the ROIs, we used the
streamline tractography method that is one of the modules in the 3D Slicer software (http://
www.slicer.org) and has been described in detail in previous publications (Rosenberger et
al., 2008; Whitford et al., 2011).
2.3. Statistics
3. Results
All statistical analyses were performed with SPSS Release 18 (IBM Corporation). For each
diffusion measure (fractional anisotropy, trace, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity), a
mixed design analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed with hemisphere as the within-
subject variable and age group (Young [first episode patients and their matched controls];
Older [chronic patients and their matched controls]) and diagnosis as the between-subject
variables. When interactions were found in the ANOVA involving age group or diagnosis,
after Bonferroni correction was applied, four sets of protected Student’s t-tests were
performed to examine the age effect on both healthy control (older vs. young controls) and
patient groups (first episode vs. chronic) separately and for each patient and their respective
normal control group (first episode patients vs. their matched controls and chronic patients
vs. their matched controls) for each hemisphere. To explore the effect of gender, all
ANOVAs were repeated with only the male subjects, as the number of female subjects was
insufficient to compare as a separate group. For the correlational analysis, Spearman’s rho
was used to quantify the linear relationship between the diffusion measures and patients’
delusions of reference scores given the ordinal nature of the Scale for the Assessment of
Positive Symptoms subscales. Spearman’s rho was also used to explore if there was a
correlation between current medication dosage, in chlorpromazine equivalents, with any of
our diffusion measures.
We measured fractional anisotropy, trace diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity
in all subjects using the statistical methods described above (see Table 2 for the ANOVA
results and Fig. 3 for the f-test results). We confirmed that the data followed a normal
distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Only significant results are discussed
below. In this study. we observed increases in trace, axial, and radial diffusivity in patients
with first episode schizophrenia, relative to both age-matched control and patients with
chronic schizophrenia (Fig. 3). For fractional anisotropy, a main effect of hemisphere was

observed, with the left cingulum showing higher fractional anisotropy values than the right.
A significant effect for hemisphere by diagnosis was also observed, with all schizophrenia
patients showing decreased fractional anisotropy in the right compared with the left, while
all controls showed approximately the same fractional anisotropy in both hemispheres.
Hemispheres differences were thus due to the patient samples. On follow-up t-tests, where
first episode patients and chronic patients were considered separately, no significant
differences in fractional anisotropy were found between groups, although there was a trend
for increased fractional anisotropy in the first episode patients relative to chronic patients in
the right hemisphere, which was absent in the left hemisphere.
For trace, a significant main effect of hemisphere was observed, with trace being higher in
the left hemisphere than in the right in both patients and controls. There was a main effect of
diagnosis, with patients exhibiting higher trace than controls. A diagnosis by age interaction
was also observed where first episode patients showed higher trace than chronic patients.
There was no such significant difference between the control groups. On the follow-up f-
tests, first episode patients exhibited higher trace in comparison to their matched controls in
both hemispheres and on the left in first episode patients compared with chronic patients
(see Fig. 3a), suggesting that, overall, first episode patients had abnormally high levels of
water diffusion in the cingulum.
For axial diffusivity there was a main effect of hemisphere with higher axial diffusivity in
the left than on the right in all subjects. There was also a main effect of diagnosis, with
patients exhibiting higher axial diffusivity than controls. A diagnosis by age effect was also
observed, with axial diffusivity in first episode patients being higher than in chronic patients
but with no differences being found between the two control groups. The additional follow-
up t-tests indicated that axial diffusivity was increased in first episode patients bilaterally
compared with their matched controls, and in first episode patients compared with chronic
patients (see Fig. 3b).
For radial diffusivity, there was a main effect of hemisphere, with the left cingulum showing
higher radial diffusivity than the right in all subjects. There was also a main effect of
diagnosis, with patients exhibiting higher radial diffusivity. Follow-up f-tests revealed that
radial diffusivity was higher in first episode patients compared with their matched controls,
bilaterally (see Fig. 3c). Radial diffusivity was also higher in the right hemisphere in the
group of older controls matched to the group of younger controls.
When females were excluded from the analyses, the ANOVA results described above
remained the same, with the following three exceptions where statistical significance was
lost: hemisphere by diagnosis for fractional anisotropy (F'(1,63)=2.740, p=0.103), diagnosis
for trace (F(1,63)=3.255, p=0.076), and diagnosis for radial diffusivity (F(1,63)=1.643,
p=0.205). The effect sizes for all three of these effects did decrease slightly when removing
females and leaving only males (fractional anisotropy, Hemisphere x Diagnosis: all subjects,
r=0.274; males only, r=0.204; Trace Diagnosis: all subjects, r=0.293; males only, r=0.222;
radial diffusivity, Diagnosis: all subjects, r=0.233; males only, r=0.159). See Table 2 for
effects with all subjects included.

Trace and radial diffusivity were found to be correlated with delusions of reference in first
episode patients (see Fig. 4; trace r, (30)=—0.404, p=0.027; radial r, (30)=—0.429, p=0.018),
but not in chronic patients (trace r, (38)=0.060, p=0.720; radial 7,(38)=0.004, p=0.983). No
significant correlations were found with fractional anisotropy or axial diffusivity, and
delusions of reference. No significant correlations were found with medication dosage and
fractional anisotropy, trace, radial diffusivity or axial diffusivity in either the right or left
cingulum in patients with schizophrenia (p>0.05 for all analyses). Further, no significant
correlations were found between medication dosage and fractional anisotropy, trace, radial
diffusivity or axial diffusivity in either the right or left cingulum in patients with
schizophrenia (p>0.05 for all analyses). No significant associations were found between
handedness and diffusion indices in the cingulum. The average chlorpromazine-equivalent
dose of medication for the chronic patient group was 418.01 mg (SD=331.42 mg), and the
average duration of medication was 20.25 years (SD=8.78 years).
4. Discussion
Findings from this study show increases in trace, axial, and radial diffusivity in the cingulum
bundle in patients with a first episode of schizophrenia compared with their age-matched
healthy controls, but not in patients with chronic schizophrenia relative to their matched
healthy controls. One explanation for these findings is that in first episode schizophrenia
there are abnormalities in myelin development and this abnormal myelin cannot sustain the
health of the underlying axons, resulting in partial degeneration of these axons (Song et al.,
2002), which, in turn, results in abnormalities in both axon integrity and myelination. This
process, however, would be characterized by an increase in radial diffusion as well as an
increase in trace (Song et al., 2003; Song et al., 2005; Hanson and Gottesman, 2005;
Pasternak et al., 2012), but would also most likely result in decreased axial diffusivity, not
the increase that was observed in this study. As the increases were in trace, axial and radial
diffusivity concurrently, and since they seemed to partially resolve over time, given that they
were not observed in chronic cases, we suggest that the observed DTI abnormalities in the
first episode participants may reflect an acute increase in water diffusion in the cingulum
bundle due to an inflammatory process. This possibility, which has been proposed
previously by Pasternak et al. in our group (Pasternak et al., 2012), is consistent with
previous positron emission tomography studies that have found increases in activated
microglia in patients with recent onset schizophrenia (Hanson and Gottesman, 2005; Muller
and Schwarz, 2006; Potvin et al., 2008; van Berckel et al., 2008; Doorduin et al., 2009). The
reversibility of diffusion measures has also been observed in the vasogenic edema phase of
stroke as well as during the acute phase of multiple sclerosis, suggesting its sensitivity to
edema/inflammation (Balashov et al., 2011). Pasternak et al. (Pasternak et al., 2012) suggest
that the initial phase of inflammatory response that is observed in the early stages of
schizophrenia resolves and is followed by myelin degeneration in later stages of the disease.
Such dynamics could account for the findings in our study, where both chronic and first
episode patients demonstrate white matter pathology (fractional anisotropy decrease), but
only first episode subjects demonstrate trace increase. The first episode patients in this
sample are being followed longitudinally, and follow-up studies are planned to investigate

further whether there are progressive changes in these diffusion measures and to determine
over what time course any changes occur.
As hypothesized, given the known role of the cingulum bundle in connecting areas involved
in emotional and social cognition such as the anterior cingulate and prefrontal cortices, we
found significant correlations between diffusion measures in the cingulum bundle and the
severity of delusions of reference in first episode patients (Hadland et al., 2003; Brunet-
Gouet and Decety, 2006). The first episode patients’ delusions of reference scores were
negatively correlated with trace and radial diffusivity in the cingulum bundle, such that first
episode patients with the most severe delusions had the least abnormal white matter in the
cingulum bundle. While this finding may seem counterintuitive, it is consistent with several
other studies showing that patients with increased levels of positive symptoms show
correlations with diffusion measures that are relatively close to those seen in healthy control,
while subjects with grossly abnormal diffusion measures show relatively low levels of
positive symptoms. For example, Szeszko et al. (Szeszko et al., 2008) observed a positive
correlation between overall positive symptomatology and fractional anisotropy in the
inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Similarly, Shergill et al. (Shergill et al., 2007) reported a
relationship between greater hallucination severity and elevated fractional anisotropy in the
superior longitudinal fasciculus, the tapetum of the corpus callosum, and the cingulate
bundle. Hubl et al. (Hubl et al., 2004) also reported elevated fractional anisotropy in patients
with greater levels of auditory hallucinations in comparison to patients with lower levels of
auditory hallucinations in the arcuate fasciculus and the anterior corpus callosum. The
relationship between increased levels of fractional anisotropy and higher levels of symptoms
was also demonstrated by Whitford et al. (Whitford et al., 2010), who observed that the
severity of patients’ reality distortion was positively correlated with fractional anisotropy in
the anterior corpus callosum. In light of the established association between axonal
transmission velocity and white matter integrity, severely subnormal fractional anisotropy
levels may be associated with such effects as severe neural desynchronization that may, in
fact, preclude the formation of stable, coherent, yet aberrant cognitive associations and thus
the development of highly systematized hallucinations and delusions. This proposal, while
speculative, is consistent with the results of the present study.
In this case, a small delay between the cingulum cortex, involved in error monitoring, and
the limbic system, involved in emotional valence, may lead to inappropriate environmental
events being given emotional salience and hence delusions of reference, but larger delays in
conductance may lead to complete disassociation between the error signals and the
environmental stimuli, resulting in negative symptomatology (Hubl et al., 2004; Shergill et
al., 2007; Szeszko et al., 2008; Whitford et al., 2010). To the extent that neural conduction
velocities can be estimated on the basis of diffusion indices such as trace and radial
diffusivity (Whitford et al., 2011), these results suggest that while some degree of
conduction delay might be necessary for the formation of delusions of reference; delays
beyond a certain threshold may actually preclude the formation of highly systematized
delusions of reference, possibly, as suggested previously, because they cannot be
incorporated into a coherent phenomenological framework (Kremen et al., 1994; Whitford et
al., 2010).

In this study we reported decreased fractional anisotropy in the right cingulum bundle in all
patients with schizophrenia compared with the left cingulum bundle. Healthy controls
showed no differences in fractional anisotropy in either hemisphere. The absence of
anisotropic asymmetry differences in the cingulum bundle in healthy controls in our study
differs from the findings in other studies. For example, Park et al. (Park et al., 2013)
reported that normal controls showed leftward asymmetry of the paracingulate sulcus, while
patient groups did not show this asymmetry. Additionally, Takao et al. (Takao et al., 2013)
reported leftward asymmetry of fractional anisotropy in the cingulum in healthy controls.
The inconsistent findings reported suggest that multiple confounds, such as sex, handedness,
and the use of different methods, may account for such inconsistencies in the findings
(Yucel et al., 2001; Fornito et al., 2008), and thus further investigation is needed.
There are several limitations worth noting in the present study. There were relatively few
female participants. Future work will be needed to replicate the results and also to explore
further the effect of gender. Cingulum bundle trace and radial diffusivity correlated
significantly with the severity of delusions of reference in first episode patients. However,
these correlations should be replicated in a larger sample. Additionally, all of the patients
with chronic schizophrenia had a long-term history of receiving antipsychotic medications,
which makes it impossible to determine which of the changes observed in this group are the
result of disease and which are the result of long-term medication. This issue continues to be
a challenge in the field of schizophrenia research, due to the difficulty of finding patients
with chronic schizophrenia who are medication naive, and it is one of the reasons why
research, including our own, has shifted to a focus on first episode patients who do not have
a chronic history of antipsychotic medication usage.
The cross-sectional design is also a limitation, as it is not known whether the first episode
patients in this sample will progress in such manner as to be comparable to the patients with
chronic schizophrenia. We will need a prospective cohort design to follow up the patients
with first episode schizophrenia until they reach a stage of chronicity, to determine whether
there are any white matter changes. As mentioned previously, the first episode patients in
this study are currently being followed longitudinally, and this question can then be more
readily addressed. Finally, while we did not see statistically significant differences in
fractional anisotropy between the chronic patients and their matched controls, such
differences have been reported in previous studies (Kubicki et al., 2007).
Since we used much higher image resolution than in previous reports, we believe that by
limiting partial volume effects we increased power and accuracy of DTI measures. It is still,
however, possible that our sample might be too small to detect differences in the chronic
patient group (see reviews in Kubicki et al., 2007; Shenton et al., 2010). In this case, though
the inflammatory model is most consistent with our data, the hypothesis of demyelination
and axonal degeneration should not be discarded as one of the explanations for our results.
In summary, this study observed increases in trace, axial, and radial diffusivity in patients
with first episode schizophrenia, relative to both age-matched controls and patients with
chronic schizophrenia. These findings suggest the presence of a pathophysiological
abnormality in the cingulum bundle in first episode patients such as an inflammatory process

that is not present in chronic patients. Additionally, a correlation was observed between
trace and radial diffusivity in the cingulum bundle and the severity of delusions of reference
in first episode patients. This suggests that the cingulum bundle may be involved in the
etiology of delusions of reference, possibly due to its functional role in connecting the
neocortex with the limbic system.
Future studies are needed to investigate further the role of the cingulum bundle in first
episode patients by following them over time to chart changes in white matter pathology.
Current studies are also underway to use more advanced tractography methods to dissect the
cingulum bundle into its constituent sub-fascicles, which will enable a finer grained
investigation into the relationship between white matter structure and function. A study of
people at risk for developing schizophrenia is also needed and is underway. Investigating
these at-risk individuals will be important to determine whether scalar measures of diffusion
in the cingulum bundle might serve as imaging biomarkers that predict conversion to a first
episode of psychosis, thereby making it possible to identify those most vulnerable to
schizophrenia very early, in order to implement possible treatment interventions.
