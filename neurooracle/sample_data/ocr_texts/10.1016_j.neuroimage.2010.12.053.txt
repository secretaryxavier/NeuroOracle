Abstract
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays a key role in learning and memory, but its effects
on the fiber architecture of the living brain are unknown. We genotyped 455 healthy adult twins
and their non-twin siblings (188 males/267 females; age: 23.7+2.1 years, mean+SD) and scanned
them with high angular resolution diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), to assess how the BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism affects white matter microstructure. By applying genetic association
analysis to every 3D point in the brain images, we found that the Val-BDNF genetic variant was
associated with lower white matter integrity in the splenium of the corpus callosum, left optic
radiation, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and superior corona radiata. Normal BDNF
variation influenced the association between subjects’ performance intellectual ability (as
measured by Object Assembly subtest) and fiber integrity (as measured by fractional anisotropy;
FA) in the callosal splenium, and pons. The BDNF gene may affect intellectual performance by
modulating white matter development. This combination of genetic association analysis and large-
scale diffusion imaging directly relates a specific gene to the fiber microstructure of the living
brain and to human intelligence.

1. Introduction
Growth factors play a crucial role in guiding brain development and connectivity, as they
regulate neuronal differentiation and survival, and modulate the plasticity and function of
neuronal synapses. Among them, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is critically

involved in learning and memory — it modulates hippocampal neurogenesis, synaptic
transmission, and activity-induced long-term potentiation and depression (Poo, 2001). In a
landmark study, Egan et al. (2003) showed that a common variant in the BDNF gene, a
methionine (Met) for valine (Val) substitution at codon 66 in the 5'-proregion of the BDNF
protein (Val66Met; dbSNP number rs6265), led to poorer episodic memory and
hippocampal activation in a cohort of 641 cognitively intact adults aged 25-45. This amino-
acid substitution impairs intracellular trafficking and activity-dependent release of the
growth factor, without affecting its synthesis (Chen et al., 2006). The Met allele occurs in
around 20% of Caucasians, and 40% of Asians (Shimizu et al., 2004), and is associated with
gray matter volume deficits especially in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (Pezawas et
al., 2004), and with impaired memory even in healthy young people (Hariri et al., 2003).
Nevertheless, associations between BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and the fiber integrity
of the living brain are still unknown. This is of special interest, as white matter
microstructure and intellectual ability were found to be influenced by a partially overlapping
set of genes (Chiang et al., 2009).
To study how BDNF Val66Met polymorphism impacts brain microstructure, we acquired
high angular resolution diffusion tensor images (DTI) from 455 twins and their non-twin
siblings. DTI is a variant of magnetic resonance imaging that is sensitive to the directionally
constrained water diffusion in the brain, which occurs preferentially along axons. The
fractional anisotropy (FA) of diffusion is a widely accepted index of the microstructural
integrity of the white matter (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996; Beaulieu, 2002). To evaluate the
association between BDNF Val66Met genotype data and white matter integrity measured by
FA, we applied a general linkage-disequilibrium test for quantitative traits (Abecasis et al.,
2000) to each location in the 3D brain images. Given BDNF’s known effects on cortical
structure and function, we hypothesized that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism may
contribute to the structural integrity of cerebral white matter.
The influence of the BDNF gene on memory performance has been widely replicated
(Hansell et al., 2007), but its association with full-scale IQ has not been detected (Egan et
al., 2003). Similarly, another cognition-related gene, the catechol-O-methyltransferase
(COMT) gene, was also found to be associated with working memory performance, but not
with IQ (Egan et al., 2001). Li et al. (2009) found that the COMT Val1l58Met polymorphism
modulated the association between white matter integrity and IQ — the regression slope for
FA against full-scale IQ was higher in Val homozygotes than in Met carriers in the
prefrontal regions and in the hippocampal formation, bilaterally. Based on this finding, we
expected that gene effects on IQ might be due to indirect interactions between white matter
integrity (or other brain structural phenotypes) and IQ. This inability to detect a direct
correlation between these specific genes and IQ may be because IQ is a complex phenotype;
the endophenotype strategy suggests that it may be easier to identify gene effects if they are
mediated by some basic intermediate phenotypes that are readily measured in brain images,
e.g., the voxelwise FA in this study. Therefore, our second hypothesis was that the BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism may influence intellectual performance via a modulating effect on
white matter architecture, similar to the COMT gene. This was an exploratory hypothesis,
and we tested it by studying how BDNF genotypes modulated the statistical association
between white matter integrity and IQ at every point of the brain, that we previously
detected in a subset of the subjects studied here (Chiang et al., 2009).
2. Methods
2.1. Subject description and Genotyping
The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was identified as rs6265 in the dbSNP public database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/). Genotype data were available for 785 healthy

adult twins and their non-twin siblings (385 males / 400 females) from 439 families with the
following ancestry: British Isles 76.2%, Northern Europe 12.6%, Mediterranean 5.4%,
unknown 5.8%, and were determined using primer extension in the Sequenom Mass-Array
system. Genotyping error rate was < 0.1%. The frequency of the BDNF Val allele was 81%,
and was similar for all ancestral groups (British Isles: 82%, Northern Europe: 77%,
Mediterranean: 76%, unknown ancestry: 79%). The probability of correct zygosity
assignment was > 99.99% (Hansell et al., 2007). To find the association between image
measures and BDNF genotype data, we acquired DTI scans from 455 subjects (188 males/
267 females; age: 23.742.1 years, mean+SD). BDNF genotypes were Val/Val for 316
subjects (69% of the total), Val/Met for 118 subjects (26%), and Met/Met for 21 subjects
(5%). To test the robustness and reproducibility of our findings, we split the 455 subjects
into two independent sub-groups, Groups 1 and 2, with a similar sample size: Group 1 had
234 subjects (99 males/135 females; age: 23.7+1.9 years) from 110 different nuclear
families. BDNF Val/Met genotypes were Val/Val for 161 subjects (68% of the total), for 60
subjects (26%), and Met/Met for 13 subjects (6%); Group 2 had 221 subjects (89 males/132
females; age: 23.7+2.2 years) from 128 families unrelated to those in Group 1. BDNF
genotypes were Val/Val for 155 subjects (70% of the total), Val/Met for 58 subjects (26%),
and Met/Met for 8 subjects (4%). The twin/sibling composition of the families in both sub-
groups is described in Table 1. The BDNF genotype distribution in all 455 subjects and in
both sub-groups followed the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P > 0.01). All subjects were
screened to exclude cases of pathology known to affect brain structure, a history of
significant head injury, a neurological or psychiatric illness, substance abuse or dependence,
or a psychiatric disorder in any first-degree relative.
2.2. Image processing and registration
All MR images were collected using a 4 Tesla Bruker Medspec MRI scanner (Bruker
Medical, Ettingen, Germany), with a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) headcoil, at the
Center for Magnetic Resonance (University of Queensland, Australia). High angular
resolution diffusion-weighted scans were acquired using single-shot echo planar imaging
with a twice-refocused spin echo sequence, to reduce eddy-current induced distortions.
Imaging parameters were: 21 axial slices (5 mm thick), FOV = 23 cm, TR/TE 6090/91.7 ms,
0.5 mm gap, with a 128x100 acquisition matrix. 30 images were acquired: 3 with no
diffusion sensitization (1.e., T>-weighted images) and 27 diffusion-weighted images (b =
1145.7 s/mm2) in which the gradient directions were evenly distributed on an imaginary
hemisphere. The reconstruction matrix was 128x128, yielding a 1.8x1.8 mm? in-plane
resolution. Total scan time was 3.05 minutes. We used the FMRIB software library (FSL,
http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/) for pre-processing and affine alignment of the diffusion
images. For each participant, motion artifacts were corrected by linearly registering all the
T>-weighted and diffusion-weighted images to one of the T>-weighted images (the
“eddy_correct” command). Then the three T>-weighted images were averaged and stripped
of non-brain tissues to yield a binary brain extraction mask (cerebellum included), using the
Brain Extraction Tool (BET) (Smith, 2002), followed by expert manual editing, if necessary.
The masked T>-weighted image was then registered to a standardized high-resolution brain
MRI template defined in the International Consortium for Brain Mapping space (ICBM)
(Holmes et al., 1998) with a 9-parameter linear transformation using the software FLIRT
(Jenkinson and Smith, 2001). The resulting transformation parameters were used to
rotationally reorient the diffusion tensors (computed from diffusion-weighted images using
the “DTIFIT” command) at each voxel (Alexander et al., 2001). The tensor-valued images
were linearly realigned based on trilinear interpolation of the log-transformed tensors
(Arsigny et al., 2005), and resampled to isotropic voxel resolution (with dimensions:
128x128x93 voxels, resolution: 1.7x1.7x1.7 mm?). The FA image derived from the affine-

registered DT image (Basser and Pierpaoli, 1996) was then fluidly registered to a randomly
selected participant’s FA image (Chiang et al., 2007).
We averaged the fluidly-registered FA images across all the subjects from Groups | and 2 (n
= 455) and restricted subsequent data analysis to regions with average FA > 0.2, as in Smith
et al (2006), to focus our regions of interest on major white matter fiber structures. Each
participant’s FA map was smoothed using an isotropic Gaussian filter with full width at half
maximum (FWHM) = 6 mm (Smith et al., 2006).
2.3. Association between diffusion anisotropy and BDNF polymorphisms
We followed the method of Abecasis et al. (2000) to analyze associations between the
BDNF polymorphism and FA at each voxel. To eliminate spurious associations due to
population stratification, the additive genetic values that coded different variants of the
BDNF polymorphism (g; Val/Val = 1, Val/Met = 0, and Met/Met = —1) were decomposed
into orthogonal between-family (b) and within-family (w) components. For sibling 7 in
family i, FA value at each voxel (yj), after adjusted for age and sex effects using the general
linear model, was modeled as yj = w + Bpb; + Bywi, where yu is the overall phenotypic mean
value. b; is the between-family component, or the expected family average, of the additive
genetic values of all the siblings in family 7. The within-family component for each
participant is given by w;; = gj; — bj. The covariance matrix of FA for family i, denoted by
@;, was based on known genetic similarity between relatives, written in terms of the
different sources of variance:
o2+0° +07 +07, if j=k
Dj x= o2to-+07, if 7 #k, and j andk are MZ twins
TijkOat+1/207? +07, if 7 #k, and jandk are not MZ twins
Here o,” is the variance due to the additive effects of the BDNF polymorphism and o,? is
the variance due to the residual additive of all other genes on the genome. o(” and of” are
respectively the variance that comes from environmental factors that are common to all
family members, and that are unique for each individual (experimental errors are included in
Of’). Tjjx 1S the expected proportion of alleles that arise from the same ancestor allele, i.e.,
identical by descent (IBD) for participants j and k. Estimation of 7; is detailed in (Haseman
and Elston, 1972).
The above association model was fitted using the maximum-likelihood method (Abecasis et
al., 2000). £,, # 0 indicates that there is genuine association of the additive effect of the
BDNF polymorphism on FA, 1.e., the genetic marker (the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism)
is either the trait locus for FA, or is considered to be in linkage disequilibrium with the trait
locus. The significance of the genuine association coefficient /,, was determined by minus
two times this difference between the full model and the restricted (f,, was excluded) model,
which is asymptotically distributed approximately as a chi-squared distribution with one
degree of freedom.
Here the association between the BDNF gene and FA was estimated with each voxel
regarded as an independent unit; no tracking of white matter fibers was performed. Linking
diffusion measures defined using tractography (Behrens et al., 2007) with genotype data
may elucidate genetic influences on cortical connectivity. Nevertheless, tract labeling has
not yet been fully automated and is labor intensive, so here we performed association
analysis using voxel-based methods. Moreover, we only considered BDNF gene effects on
brain fiber architecture; contributions from other genes, or epistatic effects between BDNF
and other genes were not included. Future genome-wide association studies (GWAS)

(Benyamin et al., 2009) are warranted to study joint effects of multiple genes on diffusion
imaging measures.
2.4. How does BDNF polymorphism modify the association between white matter
anisotropy and intellectual performance?
To study how the BDNF polymorphism influences intellectual performance, we assessed the
subjects’ general intellectual ability at age 16 using the Multidimensional Aptitude Battery
(MAB) (Jackson, 1984), a measure highly correlated with the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale. Duration of education (in months) was recorded at the same time. We examined three
verbal (information, arithmetic, and vocabulary) and two performance (spatial and object
assembly) IQ sub-scales. Each subtest gave a raw score; verbal (VIQ), performance (PIQ),
and full-scale (FIQ) intelligence quotient standardized scores were derived from these sub-
scales. The IQ data were available in 440 subjects. There was no difference in FIQ (Val/Val:
114.1 + 12.4, n = 304; Val/Met: 114.6412.8, n = 116; Met/Met: 109.2+15.8, n = 20; mean
+SD) or in other IQ sub-scales among the three genotype groups.
The BDNF polymorphism may affect IQ via its modulatory effect on the association
between brain white matter structure and IQ, 1.e., the regression slope (for FA versus IQ),
may differ in people with different BDNF genotypes. This was modeled by adding an
interaction term w IQ into FA-IQ regression, using the following moderated regression
equation:
FA j=H+Biq * IQi-+Bp - bit
Bw « wij+Bine - (wij -1Q;;)-
Subjects’ IQ and voxel FA values were adjusted for age and sex, and the IQ score was
further adjusted for the duration of school education. Positive interaction effect, i.e. Bin > 0,
means that subjects with w;; > 0 have a greater slope than subjects with w; < 0 in FA
regressed against the IQ score. This may be clearer if we consider the partial derivative of
FA with respect to IQ in the above equation, given by OFA/0IQ = fig + Pint: w; the slope of
the regression for FA on IQ is then shown to depend on w. The covariance matrix is
identical to that in the previous section.
To eliminate collinearity between the regressors, we used principal component regression,
where the design matrix of a linear regression is transformed into a matrix whose columns
are the eigenvectors weighted by the eigenvalues of the original design matrix, and thus are
linearly independent of each other (Slinker and Glantz, 1985). The moderated regression
equation above may be written in matrix form. For family i with n; members, y; = X,f; here
Yi=[FA;1 FA;2 ... FA: nil’. B= (4 Big Bo Bw Bint T and X; consists of five columns that are
n;-element vectors of values of 1, and values of IQ, 5;, Wijs and IQ;-wii) of all n; members (1
<j <n), in order. The superscript T indicates matrix transpose. Let the design matrix for the

total of n families be = ‘ and matrix V consists of columns that are normalized
eigenvectors of X. Given WV =I (the identity matrix), we may rewrite the regression
=) X/y;=XB=(XV)(V"
equation” 2 yiEXs ( 6) so that (XV) is the new design matrix whose columns
are linearly independent, and b = V’, is the new vector of the regression coefficients to
obtain. We removed the columns of V that corresponded to eigenvalues of X that were
smaller than a pre-defined threshold ao-8 times the maximum eigenvalue of X), if any, to
avoid singularity that may arise due to collinearity between columns of X.

The significance of the modulatory effect of BDNF polymorphism on FA and IQ, or Aint,
was determined by the Wald-type statistic (Vonesh and Carter, 1992). Given Jin, = (db) =
V(5)b, where V(5) is the fifth row of V, the null hypothesis £;,, =0 may be tested using the
Wald test statistic: 7? = /7[LQL7]"1U, where L(b) = [0l(b)/Ob], and Q is the covariance
matrix of b. We refer readers to (Vonesh and Carter, 1992) for the derivation of Q. T-2
follows the F distribution F (1, 1 — g), where g = 5 is the dimension of /.
We applied the above method to evaluate how the BDNF polymorphism modulated the
association between FA and subjects’ VIQ, PIQ, and FIQ scores, as we hypothesized that
these three IQ scores respectively reflected subjects’ verbal, performance, and overall
intellectual performance. Moreover, we also estimated BDNF interactions with FA and the
object assembly (OBJ) sub-scale, as in our previous study (Chiang et al., 2009) we found
that the cross-trait correlation between FA and FIQ, PIQ, and OBJ IQ scores was strongly
mediated by overlapping genetic factors.
2.5. Correction for multiple comparisons
3. Results
Given the very large number of tests performed (~80,000 voxels), we controlled for type I
error due to multiple comparisons across voxels using the topological false discovery rate
(FDR) method (Chumbley et al., 2010; Chumbley and Friston, 2009). Chumbley et al.
(2010) recently showed that voxelwise FDR, which is still quite widely used in statistical
brain mapping, does not control adequately for regional effects and recommended
topological FDR, to provide better assurance that the false positive rates are strictly
controlled. The topological FDR method controls the expected proportion of false positive
findings over all clusters, and it is not based on a test of the overall volume of the set of
supra-threshold voxels, at different statistical thresholds (as standard FDR is). A cluster was
defined as a set of contiguous voxels where the size of the tested effect at every voxel
surpassed a certain threshold. Here we set the threshold to Z > 3, where Z was the standard
Normal variate corresponding to the voxelwise P-value (e.g., the P-maps derived from
BDNF-FA associations; note this also defines a threshold in the P-maps). We then used the
FMRISTAT toolbox developed by Keith Worsley
(http://www.math.mcgill.ca/keith/fmristat/) to compute the significance P-value for each
cluster, derived from the Gaussian random field theory (Friston et al., 1994). This P-value
indicates how improbable it is to detect any other clusters with a greater volume (i.e.,
containing more voxels) than that cluster, based on the null hypothesis that there is no tested
effect but only Gaussian noise in the whole image field. P-values for all clusters were then
inputted into the traditional FDR procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Here we
controlled the FDR of clusters within 5%, which means that only 5% of the clusters that are
declared to be significant tend, on average, to be false positive findings. All computational
processes were executed using a 306-node, dual-processor SUN Microsystems V20z cluster.
Each compute node has a dual 64-bit 2.4 GHz AMD Opteron CPU.
By associating BDNF genotype data with white matter anisotropy in all 455 subjects, we
found remarkable and widespread BDNF gene effects across major white matter fibers.
Figure 1 shows that the Val genetic variant of BDNF is associated with lower FA in several
key white matter tracts (f,, < 0), such as the splenium of the corpus callosum and left
posterior thalamic radiation/optic radiation (z = —1 and z = 5; in Montreal Neurological
Institute (MNI) coordinates, expressed in mm), the junction of the genu of the corpus
callosum and the anterior corona radiata on the right (z = 5), left inferior fronto-occipital
fasciculus (IFO)/inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), midbrain (which contains
corticobulbar and corticospinal tracts) and fornix bilaterally (z = —10), and superior corona
radiata on the right (z = 42). FA in subjects whose Val allele exceeded their expected family

average (w > 0; 2 = 90) had up to 15% lower FA than whose Met allele exceeded their
expected family average (w < 0; 1 = 80). In other words, the BDNF allele that is normally
considered favorable (Val, not Met) conferred a detectable and systematic deficit in white
matter anisotropy of up to 15% regionally. We also tested BDNF-FA associations in the two
sub-groups respectively, to detect brain regions where the BDNF effects were robust enough
to reproduce in smaller samples. Figure 2 shows that the influences of the BDNF gene were
significant in both Groups 1 and 2 in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the left optic
radiation. These two regions coincide the white matter regions where the strongest BDNF
genotype effects (up to 15% FA reduction associated with the Val allele) were detected inn
= 455 subjects (see Fig. 1). Positive associations between the additive Val allele effect and
FA (f,, > 0) were not significant.
The BDNF polymorphism was not directly associated with intellectual performance, at least
when measured using FIQ, VIQ, PIQ, or OBJ scores. However, the BDNF polymorphism
may indirectly influence intellectual performance in specific brain regions by modulating the
association between white matter anisotropy and IQ. Figure 3 shows this; the slope for the
OBJ score regressed against FA in subjects with w > 0 (Val excess) was greater than the
corresponding slope in subjects with w < 0 (i.e. Aint > 0), in the pons on the left (z = —21)
and the splenium of the corpus callosum (z = 2). The interaction effects of the BDNF
polymorphism on the association between FA and FIQ, VIQ, or PIQ were not significant.
4. Discussion
In this paper, we mapped the influences of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on brain
white matter architecture, extending genetic association analyses to 3D images. The Val
allele was found to be associated with up to 15% reduction in FA in major fiber tracts,
especially in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the optic radiation on the left, the left
IFO/ILF, and superior corona radiata. Moreover, associations between BDNF and FA were
consistent in the two sub-groups of the subjects in the splenium of the corpus callosum and
the optic radiation on the left. Although these two sub-groups were not truly independent of
each other as all subjects were recruited from the same twin registry and their brain images
acquired using the same MR scanner, testing BDNEF-FA associations in these two sub-
groups might still help to support the consistency and robustness of the associations,
assuming that the genetic determinants for white matter architecture are independent across
families (Van Steen et al., 2005). In other words, the results are robust to subsampling
within the same cohort, but further analysis of new cohorts that were independently assessed
from the outset will be valuable as more large DTI datasets become available. Findings in
this paper are consistent with those in our previous study, where genetic influences
accounted for around 80% of the variance in FA in these regions (Chiang et al., 2009). This
suggests that BDNF is a key candidate gene that influences white matter integrity.
In all brain regions affected by the BDNF polymorphism, the additive effect of the Val allele
was associated with a lower FA. Supporting the direction and validity of this effect, a recent
conference abstract (Alam et al., 2010) reported significant BDNF genotype-dependent
differences in PA, largely restricted to the body of the corpus callosum, where the Val allele
was associated with a lower FA. In that study, DTI scans were collected from 85 young
healthy volunteers (mean age: 33.5+9.6 years; 46 men/39 women) — a sample of around one
fifth the size of that analyzed here. FA is usually considered as a measure of fiber
myelination and organization (Beaulieu, 2002). Higher FA reflects greater myelination, and
a directional coherence in the myelinated fiber tracts (Beaulieu, 2002), and has generally
been linked with better functional performance (Chiang et al., 2009). Even so, lower FA
does not necessarily always imply lower white matter integrity, and may reflect (1) larger
axonal diameter, which results in increased intracellular water content (Takahashi et al.,
Neuroimage. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2012 March 15.

2002), (2) greater fiber branching, or (3) higher intravoxel fiber crossing in, e.g., where the
optic radiation and corpus callosum fibers intermix (see Fig. 1) (Tuch et al., 2005). The
above hypotheses may be tested by comparing the T1l-weighted and DT images in the same
subjects using voxel-based morphometry (Ashburner and Friston, 2000), where larger
axonal diameter or more extensive fiber branching reflected by lower FA may also be
detectable as reduced white matter density. Tuch et al. (2005) showed that lower FA, at the
junction of the optic radiation and corpus callosum, was associated with a faster reaction
time to visual stimuli. Schmithorst and Wilke (2002) found that FA in the corona radiata
and internal capsule was lower in musicians than non-musicians. They attributed this to the
rearrangement of neural representations for motor control after intensive musical training.
The association between lower FA and the Val BDNF allele in this study may provide
another exception to the “higher FA is always better” hypothesis.
We found that BDNF variants significantly modulated the association between FA and the
OBJ sub-scale in the splenium of the corpus callosum, where the Val allele was associated
with a positive FA-OBJ correlation, whereas the Met allele was associated with no
correlation or with a negative correlation. The callosal splentum interconnects bilateral
primary visual and visual association areas of the parietal and occipital cortex, and is
relevant for visuospatial memory (Rudge and Warrington, 1991). Positive correlation
between FA and IQ may support the theory that optimal intellectual performance typically
requires high processing speed and short reaction times, which are influenced by axonal
myelination levels (Arbuthnott et al., 1980). Furthermore, the myelination of white matter
fibers may itself be enhanced by neuronal activity (Fields, 2005). On the other hand,
negative correlation between FA and IQ may reflect greater fiber crossing or branching that
lowers FA, as in a broadly connected cognitive network (Tuch et al., 2005). Reduced FA in
one brain region may also indicate that during the maturation or improvement of cognitive
function, myelination may be greater in other brain regions to optimize processing efficiency
(Schmithorst and Wilke, 2002). All these mechanisms may contribute to the association
between white matter architecture and intellectual performance, and the causal pathways are
influenced by genetic factors, including the BDNF gene. The interaction of the BDNF gene
with FA and OBJ provides an example that the cross-trait correlation between FA and OBJ
in major white matter regions is genetically mediated (Chiang et al., 2009).
Given that the Val-BDNF allele was previously associated with superior cognitive
performance compared to the Met allele (Hansell et al., 2007), and that in our previous study
FA was found to be in positive genetic correlation with IQ, especially with the OBJ subscale
(Chiang et al., 2009), the association between the Val allele and a lower FA we discovered
here may appear somewhat counterintuitive. The surprising direction of the relationship may
be explainable by considering the empirical plots of the modulatory effect of the BDNF
gene on FA and IQ. For example, in the splenium of the corpus callosum where the
modulatory effect of the BDNF gene on FA and IQ was significant (the right column in Fig.
3), the score for OBJ at the intersection of the two FA-OBJ regression lines for the Val (blue
line) and the Met (red line) allele was higher than the average OBJ score across all the
subjects (21.3 vs. 18.0). This may explain why the Val allele mediated a positive correlation
between FA and OBJ in that region, but was associated with a lower FA than the Met allele.
Genetic influences on FA and IQ may result from an overall combination of effects of
positive and negative modulations on FA-IQ correlation by many cognition-related genes,
including the BDNF gene here. Based on the currently available data, it seems like the net
effect of all these genes results in a positive genetic correlation between FA and IQ, as found
in our previous study. Nonetheless a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that examines
the modulatory effects of all SNPs across the genome will be warranted to test this
hypothesis. We have begun to examine GWAS in DTI (Hibar et al., 2010), but the sheer
number of tests across the genome makes it relatively underpowered without a meta-analytic

approach of many large samples, or without a restricted set of prior hypotheses. Currently,
the number of available large samples with both DTI and GWAS is limited. This will
change in the future, perhaps facilitated by the Enigma consortium
(http://enigma.loni.ucla.edu) and by other meta-analytic approaches to imaging genetics.
Our findings need to be interpreted with caution, because: (1) We did not find significant
BDNF interactions with FA and FIQ, VIQ, or PIQ. This may be due to a much higher
genetic correlation between FA and OBJ in most white matter regions (Chiang et al., 2009),
so that with the current sample size, the modulatory effect of the BDNF gene for FA and
OBJ may be easier to detect than the other IQ scales. (2) Given that interaction effects tend
to be much weaker than direct associations, even larger samples may be required to replicate
the modulatory effect of the BDNF gene for FA and OBJ, which was detected here in the
pooled sample of 455 subjects, but not when the samples were split. (3) The subjects were
scanned on average 7 years after their intellectual performance was evaluated, so we cannot
rule out that some environmental factors, e.g., school education or work experiences, may
confound the associations between gene effects, IQ, and white matter integrity, or that
changes in IQ may have occurred between the time of the cognitive evaluation and the scan.
The BDNF allelic effects we detected here (up to 15%) are larger than those reported in
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of other complex traits (Visscher, 2008).
Nevertheless, there has been a strong hypothesis for many years that as we dissect complex
traits into more and more basic endophenotypes, gene effects will become larger, and some
recent work supports this (Benyamin et al., 2009). We suggest that the phenotypes we report
here are just such fundamental elements and that our findings of relatively large gene effects
are not surprising. Even so, the BDNF gene affects cortical gray matter and intellectual
performance (Egan et al., 2003; Hariri et al., 2003; Pezawas et al., 2004), so it
unquestionably plays a critical role in aspects of white matter microstructure that are
relevant for intellectual performance.
