SUMMARY
Although macrophages are armed with potent antibacterial functions, Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(Mtb) replicates inside these innate immune cells. Determinants of macrophage intrinsic bacterial 
control, and the Mtb strategies to overcome them, are poorly understood. To further study these 
processes, we used an affinity tag purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) approach to identify 
187 Mtb-human protein-protein interactions (PPIs) involving 34 secreted Mtb proteins. This 
interaction map revealed two factors involved in Mtb pathogenesis - the secreted Mtb protein, 
LpqN, and its binding partner, the human ubiquitin ligase CBL. We discovered that an lpqN Mtb 
mutant is attenuated in macrophages, but growth is restored when CBL is removed. Conversely, 
Cbl−/− macrophages are resistant to viral infection, indicating that CBL regulates cell-intrinsic 
polarization between antibacterial and antiviral immunity. Collectively, these findings illustrate the 
utility of this Mtb-human PPI map for developing a deeper understanding of the intricate 
interactions between Mtb and its host.
Graphical Abstract
eTOC
Penn et al. used an affinity tag purification mass spectrometry approach to generate an Mtb-human 
protein-protein interaction map, uncovering a connection between LpqN, a virulence factor in Mtb 
and CBL, a host ubiquitin ligase. CBL suppresses lpqN attenuation and acts as a switch for host 
anti-bacterial and anti-viral responses.
INTRODUCTION
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection persists as a leading cause of death worldwide, 
with an estimated 2 billion people chronically infected and 1–2 million deaths annually 
(Zumla et al., 2015). The only vaccine, the live-attenuated Bacillus Calmette-Guerin strain 
developed nearly 100 years ago, offers very limited protection against Mtb (Mangtani et al., 
Penn et al.

2014). In addition, current treatment is cumbersome, requiring administration of multiple, 
potentially toxic antibiotics over a period of months (Gillespie et al., 2014). Thus, there 
remains a critical need to elucidate the mechanisms by which Mtb disrupts the host immune 
response in order to both optimize vaccine strategies as well as to explore therapies that 
promote sterilizing host immunity as an adjunct to antibiotics.
Mtb infection begins when airborne bacilli are inhaled and phagocytosed by alveolar 
macrophages (Torrelles and Schlesinger, 2017). This activates pattern-recognition receptors 
that bind bacterial constituents, leading to expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as 
interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) that are important for Mtb 
control (Mayer-Barber and Sher, 2015). Surprisingly, Mtb infection also activates secretion 
of Type-I interferons such as interferon beta (IFN-β) (Manzanillo et al., 2012), a hallmark 
cellular response to viral infection (McNab et al., 2015). IFN-β induction has been linked to 
Mtb’s ability to perforate the phagosome membrane through its Type VII/ESX-1 protein 
secretion system (Manzanillo et al., 2012; Novikov et al., 2011; Siméone et al., 2015; van 
der Wel et al., 2007), allowing communication between the bacterium and the host cytosol. 
This allows recognition of extracellular Mtb genomic DNA by cyclic GMP-AMP synthase 
(cGAS) (Collins et al., 2015; Wassermann et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2015; Wiens and Ernst, 
2016) which activates interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) to initiate IFN-β transcription. In 
vivo, IFN-β signaling counteracts anti-Mtb immunity (Manca et al., 2004; Manzanillo et al., 
2012; Stanley et al., 2007), in-part by antagonizing the effects of interleukin-1 (IL-1) 
mediated resistance (Mayer-Barber et al., 2014). Moreover, elicitation of antiviral programs 
may serve to impede antibacterial responses of the host.
While cytokines such as IL-1, TNF-α, and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) are critical for 
activating macrophages to control Mtb growth (Mayer-Barber and Sher, 2015), the cell 
intrinsic mechanisms by which macrophages restrict Mtb are incompletely understood 
(Braverman and Stanley, 2017). For example, macrophages encode an array of activities 
capable of eliminating bacteria, including phagocytosis and subsequent delivery to toxic 
lysosomes (Alonso et al., 2007; Shiloh et al., 1999). Mtb has evolved the remarkable ability 
to replicate within this hostile environment as it is not only intrinsically resistant to low pH 
and oxidative damage (Darwin et al., 2003; Vandal et al., 2009), but can also inhibit fusion 
between phagosomes and lysosomes (Armstrong and Hart, 1971; Clemens, 1996; Rohde et 
al., 2007). Likewise, the mechanisms by which Mtb thwarts macrophage resistance 
mechanisms are unclear. Many bacterial pathogens inject secreted effector proteins into host 
cells, often to directly interact with host proteins and disrupt host cell function (Byndloss et 
al., 2017). The ability of Mtb to permeabilize its phagosome via ESX-1 and communicate 
with the host cell cytoplasm raises the possibility that it may similarly introduce secreted 
effectors to target host proteins. While elegant genetic studies have implicated dozens of 
secreted Mtb factors in virulence (Sassetti and Rubin, 2003; Zhang et al., 2013), whether 
these factors directly interact with host molecules to influence macrophage physiology is 
unknown.
Identifying the set of physical interactions between secreted Mtb and human proteins that 
occur in vivo will be crucial in understanding Mtb pathogenesis and may provide advanced 
approaches to combat infection. However, only a handful of Mtb-host protein-protein

interactions (PPIs) have been characterized. For example, a previous yeast 2-hybrid screen 
targeting Mtb proteins identified an interaction between EsxH and the human ESCRT 
machinery (Mehra et al., 2013). Additional focused studies on individual Mtb factors have 
also identified interactions with the host proteins VPS33B and TLR2 (Bach et al., 2008; 
Pathak et al., 2007). However, the contribution of these interactions to Mtb virulence 
remains unclear either because of the known pleiotropic effects the bacterial factors have on 
the physiology of Mtb independent of the host (Siegrist et al., 2009), or because genetic 
disruption of the factors involved does not diminish Mtb virulence (Grundner et al., 2008).
Unbiased approaches for characterizing PPIs using mass spectrometry represent powerful 
ways to probe complex biological systems in an unbiased fashion (Beltrao et al., 2010; 
Collins et al., 2007; Krogan et al., 2006). Previously, using affinity tag purification combined 
with mass spectrometry (AP-MS), we have systematically identified host pathways required 
for virulence of a number of important human viruses (Shah et al., 2015), including human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (Jäger et al., 2012), hepatitis C virus(HCV) (Ramage et al., 
2015), and Kaposi’s sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV) (Davis et al., 2015). Likewise, by 
focusing on a set of Chlamydia trachomatis virulence factors secreted into host cells, we 
uncovered a unique pathway by which this difficult and persistent bacterial pathogen 
manipulates host cells (Elwell et al., 2017; Mirrashidi et al., 2015).
Here we report the results of an AP-MS study to identify the PPIs between Mtb secreted 
proteins and host factors. Using a combination of MS and bioinformatic analysis, we 
identified a set of high confidence physical interactions between Mtb and host proteins. 
Using this map, we have uncovered a previously undescribed secreted Mtb virulence factor 
essential for Mtb growth in vivo, LpqN, and have also identified the interacting host CBL 
ubiquitin ligase as a new restriction factor that regulates cell-intrinsic Mtb control. 
Surprisingly, while CBL-deficient macrophages are more permissive for Mtb growth, they 
are resistant to viral replication, indicating a role in modulating intrinsic control of antiviral 
versus antibacterial responses during Mtb infection. Collectively, these findings demonstrate 
the value of our Mtb-human PPI map as a resource to advance our understanding of the 
complex interaction between Mtb and its host.
RESULTS
Creation of an Mtb-host PPI network
To explore the mechanisms by which Mtb disrupts host immune function, we sought to 
identify physical interactions between secreted Mtb factors and host proteins using a 
systematic proteomic approach. We reasoned that since the Mtb-containing phagosome is 
permeabilized (Manzanillo et al., 2012; Novikov et al., 2011; Siméone et al., 2015; van der 
Wel et al., 2007), any protein secreted by the bacterium would have the potential opportunity 
to interact with host proteins in the cell. We began by analyzing highly controlled culture 
filtrates of Mtb, free of detectable cytoplasmic contamination. Using mass spectrometry 
(MS), we established a high-confidence set of bona-fide secreted proteins (Figure S1A; 
Table S1), and these data were further curated with additional published MS studies of Mtb 
protein localization (Målen et al., 2007). These conservative criteria, requiring direct 
biochemical evidence of secretion beyond the bacterial cell wall, were employed to

minimize inclusion of non-secreted proteins, though it precludes analysis of secreted 
proteins present below the level of detection by MS. These analyses identified a high-
confidence set of 105 secreted Mtb proteins, including 69 proteins with canonical Sec-
transporter N-terminal signal sequences and 21 ESX-system substrates (Table S1).
We next expressed each of these proteins in human cells as C-terminal Strep-tag fusions and 
identified co-purifying host proteins by MS. As expected, expression in 293T cells of the 
Sec-dependent substrates containing their natural signal sequences led to co-localization 
with the endoplasmic reticulum (Figure S1B). Thus, we expressed the protein predicted to 
correspond to the signal peptidase-processed form released by Mtb during natural infection 
and determined that these factors primarily localized to the cytoplasm (Figure S1B). We 
initially sought to express the entire set of Mtb secreted proteins directly in macrophages 
but, consistent with reports from other groups (Zhang et al., 2009), found this to be an 
inefficient process that yielded insufficient protein for MS analysis (Figure S1C). To 
circumvent this issue, yet still allow capture of macrophage-specific factors, we developed a 
two-step co-purification strategy (Figure 1A). After initially expressing and isolating the 
bacterial factors from 293T cells on Strep-tactin resin, the immobilized proteins were then 
incubated in an in vitro binding reaction with lysate from differentiated human U937 
macrophages before subsequent AP-MS. This method was robust, as we readily expressed 
and purified 99 of the 105 bacterial proteins (Figure S1D). We analyzed a subset of bacterial 
factors both with and without addition of U937 lysate and found a substantial number of 
additional interactions specific to the macrophage lysate (Table S2).
To identify the set of interacting human proteins, we performed AP-MS in triplicate for each 
bacterial protein with the addition of GFP-Strep as a control (see Table S3 for raw MS data). 
To identify specific interactions, we utilized the MiST bioinformatic algorithm, which scores 
each interaction for specificity, reproducibility, and abundance using principal component 
analysis (Verschueren et al., 2015). Since no ‘gold-standard’ set of known host-Mtb protein 
interactions existed with which to optimize a score threshold, we used a score threshold of 
0.7 to define high-confidence interactions. Using MiST (Figure 1B), the initial interaction 
dataset was distilled to a high-confidence network between 34 bacterial proteins and 187 
specifically-interacting human proteins (Figure 1C; Figure 3; Table S4). As a control, when 
the AP-MS data were randomized and then analyzed by MiST, only three host proteins 
exceeded the MiST 0.7 threshold (Figure 1B), providing further support that we defined a 
high-quality set of PPIs. To independently validate these interactions, we defined a high-
priority set of 34 host interactors with annotated immune-related functions and expressed 
them in 293T cells as 3xFLAG-tagged proteins with their Strep-tagged bacterial partner. 
Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of the tagged human proteins with their putative 
bacterial interaction partner verified 25 of 34 (74%) of the interactions, underscoring the 
reliability of the AP-MS coupled with bioinformatic analysis (Figure S1E).
Features of the Mtb-Human PPI Map
Bioinformatic analyses of the interactome revealed several striking features of the Mtb-host 
interaction. First, we found that only 34% of the Mtb proteins we targeted provided high-
scoring PPIs with host proteins, which is in contrast to our previous findings with viral

proteomes – HIV (89%), HCV (100%), and KSHV (75%) (Davis et al., 2015; Jäger et al., 
2012; Ramage et al., 2015). This suggests that, unlike viruses that are completely dependent 
on host functions for replication, many of the Mtb-secreted proteins are involved in bacterial 
cell-autonomous processes. While we had previously found C. trachomatis also had a high 
percentage of proteins with host interactions (66%), this could reflect the fact that the subset 
of virulence factors investigated was enriched for mediating contacts with host cells 
(Mirrashidi et al., 2015). Second, comparison of the host-pathogen interactomes of Mtb, 
HIV, KSHV and C. trachomatis revealed that while there was some overlap among the host 
proteins bound by the different pathogens, the majority of proteins in each of the datasets 
were pathogen-specific. In particular, 138 of 187 host proteins in the Mtb–host interaction 
map are Mtb-specific (Figure 2A, Table S5). However, comparison of the functional 
pathways represented by these interactions revealed several commonalities between the 
pathogens (Figure 2B, Table S6). In particular, both Mtb and C. trachomatis datasets were 
enriched for proteins involved in vesicular transport, consistent with their common 
intracellular lifestyles. Moreover, despite some commonalities between the datasets, the 
interactomes reflected distinct host pathways, suggesting that these pathogens have evolved 
unique strategies to establish a replicative niche.
Evolutionary Analysis of the Mtb-host interactome
Our data also offer an opportunity to empirically test evolutionary hypotheses regarding Mtb 
and its host. There are numerous examples of host antiviral restriction factors that are 
inhibited by direct binding of viral effector proteins. As a consequence, many of these 
restriction factors experience selective pressure to diversify rapidly (positive selection) and 
escape the effects of the viral protein - an example of the “Red Queen Hypothesis” of 
coevolution (Duggal and Emerman, 2012). We hypothesized that if secreted Mtb effectors 
physically interact with host proteins, then these host proteins might show similar evidence 
of positive selection. We began by using SnIPRE (Eilertson et al., 2012), which compares 
the relative rate of non-synonymous substitutions between human and chimpanzee orthologs 
and detects positive selection over a 5–7 million-year span, but identified no evidence of 
selective pressure over this timeframe (Figure 2C, left panel). However, examination over 
more recent evolution within the human lineage itself (10,000–30,000-year span), revealed a 
significant amount of recent diversification (Figure 2C, right panel). In the human 
population, positively selected alleles quickly sweep to high frequency before recombination 
separates these variants from the surrounding genome. As a result, loci that have 
experienced recent positive selection will exhibit longer than expected haplotypes in the 
human genome. The integrated Haplotype Score (iHS) measures haplotype block lengths to 
identify variant alleles with abnormally long haplotypes, which are likely undergoing 
positive selection (Szpiech and Hernandez, 2014; Voight et al., 2006). In contrast to our 
findings over longer evolutionary timeframes, iHS detected a shift in the distribution of 
evolutionary rates, with increased diversification for the set of Mtb-interacting host proteins 
(Figure 2C, right panel, Table S7). To control for detection bias in our MS methods, we 
analyzed the set of non-interacting proteins identified in our affinity purifications and found 
no such shift. We also analyzed the interactomes of other pathogens and found rapid 
diversification in HIV-interacting host proteins, but not in the interactomes of pathogens 
associated with lower mortality – KSHV and C. trachomatis. Thus, our findings are unlikely

to be the result of a bias introduced by either MS detection or bioinformatic filtering. Rather, 
our data suggest that the set of Mtb-interacting host proteins are rapidly diversifying, 
potentially as a result of their interactions with Mtb proteins.
Topology of the Mtb-host interactome
Individual proteins often associate into larger protein complexes to carry out cellular 
processes (Alberts, 1998). To help interpret the Mtb-host PPI map in this light, we used 
previously published host PPI data to arrange the identified host proteins into complexes. To 
this end, we used data from the CORUM and STRING databases to overlay known human 
PPIs within the Mtb interactome (Figure 3). This analysis revealed a number of host 
complexes targeted by Mtb proteins, including a connection between bacterial Apa and five 
subunits of the COP II vesicular trafficking complex as well as an association with the 
uncharacterized Mtb protein, Rv3722c and seven components of the CCT chaperone 
complex. Furthermore, we uncovered a connection between Rv1804c and Rv1075c and the 
host STRIPAK signal transduction complex, which has been recently linked to innate 
immunity and autophagy targeting (Liu et al., 2016; Neisch et al., 2017). Interestingly, 
Rv1075c also interacts with components of the SET1 histone methyltranferase complex, 
COMPASS, which regulates transcriptional elongation by RNAPII (Herz et al., 2013; 
Krogan et al., 2003). This connection suggests that Mtb may regulate host transcriptional 
regulation by hijacking this complex using one of its secreted proteins.
Recently, our groups carried out a global analysis of changes in the host proteome with 
respect to post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation and ubiquitination, in 
the presence of Mtb infection (Table S8). Overlaying this dataset with our PPI map revealed 
that we uncovered 22 and 12 host proteins with altered phosphorylation and ubiquitylation, 
respectively (Figure 3). These data suggest that these proteins might both be regulated by the 
host in response to Mtb and targeted by Mtb effectors making them high-priority targets for 
future study.
LpqN is an Mtb virulence factor
To begin to identify the functionally relevant interactions between Mtb secreted proteins and 
macrophages, we used a genetic approach to disrupt bacterial and host components of the 
PPI map and determined the effects during infection. Initially, we selected a set of 10 
bacterial factors whose host interactors had known immune-related functions or were post-
translationally modified in response to Mtb infection, and we generated or obtained 
previously-created Mtb mutants with these genes disrupted. These mutants were evaluated 
for growth in primary macrophages, and four strains with impaired growth relative to wild-
type Mtb were carried forward for further analysis (Figure 4A, data not shown). For each 
mutant, we created two isogenic strains carrying either a wild-type copy of the disrupted 
gene under the control of its native promoter on an integrated plasmid, or an empty control 
plasmid. Each plasmid also contained a unique DNA barcode that allowed us to determine 
the relative abundance of each of the eight strains within pooled infections. We infected 
mice with this mixture of strains via the aerosol route, recovered bacilli from lung 
homogenates at multiple time-points, and quantified the relative proportion of each strain by 
qPCR (Figure 4A). Two of the mutants competed equally with their cognate

“complementation” strains, and the Rv2469c mutant appeared to slightly out-compete the 
complemented strain but the lpqN::Tnhimar1 mutant (lpqN mutant) was rapidly depleted 
relative to lpqN::Tnhimar1::plpqN (lpqN complemented). Importantly, the lpqN mutant 
competed equally with the complemented strain when the pool was grown in culture (Figure 
S2), and the two strains grew with indistinguishable kinetics in axenic culture (Figure 4B), 
demonstrating that the lpqN mutant was specifically attenuated in the host.
To test whether the lpqN mutant was also attenuated during infection of macrophages, we 
used a bioluminescent growth assay in which the isogenic lpqN mutant and complemented 
strains were transformed with the luxBCADE operon from Vibrio harveyi, and their growth 
in macrophages was monitored by quantifying luminescence over time. As with our 
observations in infected mice, we found that the lpqN mutant was also significantly 
attenuated in primary macrophages (Figure 4C), suggesting that LpqN functions during the 
initial bacterial encounter with the innate immune system. Collectively, these results 
demonstrate that LpqN is critical for bacterial growth in both ex vivo macrophages and in 
mice, thus establishing LpqN as a Mtb virulence determinant for the first time.
LpqN and the ubiquitin ligase CBL interact physically and genetically
We hypothesized that LpqN functions to promote bacterial growth through its interaction 
with host proteins, either by blocking their function or by ‘hijacking’ them for pathogenic 
purposes. To test this idea, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based mutagenesis in RAW 264.7 cells to 
determine whether disruption of LpqN-interacting host factors was able to rescue the growth 
defect of the lpqN mutant. As noted above, our related studies using MS to examine host 
protein post-translational modifications during Mtb infection demonstrated increased 
phosphorylation of the ubiquitin ligase CBL, a LpqN-interacting protein, and suggested a 
possible role for CBL in antibacterial immunity (Figure 4D; Table S8). Indeed, while 
mutagenesis of several other LpqN interactors failed to rescue the lpqN mutant phenotype, 
we observed that disruption of Cbl rescued the growth of the lpqN mutant in RAW264.7 
cells (Figures 4E and S3A).
We verified the physical interaction between LpqN and CBL by expressing LpqN-Strep in 
293T cells. Endogenous CBL protein that copurified was detected by western blotting, 
verifying the interaction detected by MS (Figure 4F). Additional in vitro pull-down 
experiments using LpqN and CBL proteins produced in E. coli also revealed direct 
interaction between these two factors (Figure S4). We further explored the genetic 
interaction between lpqN and Cbl using primary bone marrow-derived macrophages 
(BMMs) deficient in CBL. To avoid the potential confounding effects of the two related 
CBL family ubiquitin ligases, we analyzed BMMs lacking the CblB and CblC genes, and 
carrying either a wild-type or floxed Cbl locus that could be deleted with ~90% efficiency 
by addition of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen to the culture media - hereafter designated Cbl+/+ and 
Cbl−/− respectively (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016). We infected Cbl+/+ and Cbl −/− primary 
macrophages with the lpqN mutant strain and monitored bacterial growth over time. 
Consistent with our observations in Cbl−/− RAW264.7 cells (Figure 4E), the lpqN mutant 
was markedly attenuated in Cbl+/+ BMMs (Figure 4G). Importantly, in Cbl−/− BMMs, we 
observed significant rescue of the lpqN mutant intracellular growth phenotype, with a 15-

fold increase in bacterial growth (Figure 4G). This result was further confirmed by plating 
macrophage lysates and directly enumerating bacterial colony-forming units (CFU) (Figure 
4H).
We also noted that both the lpqN complemented strain and the parental WT CDC1551 Mtb 
strain grew ~2-fold faster in Cbl−/− macrophages, indicating that CBL imposes some 
restriction on wild-type M. tuberculosis (Figures 4I, 4J), however, the effect of CBL activity 
was much more pronounced with the lpqN mutant (Figure 4K). Importantly, the growth of 
an attenuated ESX-1 mutant of Mtb, which is unable to permeabilize its phagosome, was 
unaffected in Cbl−/− macrophages (Figure 4L), as were the growth of other intracellular 
bacteria including Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. 
Typhimurium, Figures S3B and S3C). Thus, there is a genetic interaction between bacterial 
lpqN and host Cbl, whereby growth of the lpqN mutant strain is selectively enhanced upon 
loss of host Cbl, but strains expressing LpqN are relatively insensitive to CBL activity. This 
genetic interaction strongly suggests that LpqN and CBL function in a common pathway. 
Collectively, the combined biochemical and genetic data suggest a model whereby CBL acts 
as a host restriction factor that limits Mtb growth, and LpqN acts as a virulence factor to 
block the normal functions of CBL and promote bacterial replication.
CBL regulates the balance between cell-intrinsic antibacterial and antiviral responses.
CBL has been well-characterized as a ubiquitin ligase responsible for the ubiquitylation and 
degradation of activated receptor protein tyrosine-kinases (Levkowitz et al., 1999). Since 
ubiquitylated proteins localize to the Mtb phagosome and are proposed to function as a 
targeting mechanism for autophagy-mediated host defense (Ponpuak et al., 2010; Watson et 
al., 2012), we initially hypothesized that CBL might directly contribute to this process. 
However, the frequency of ubiquitin colocalization with either wild-type or lpqN mutant 
bacteria after 4h of infection was unaffected in Cbl−/− BMMs (Figure 5A), demonstrating 
that this ligase is not required for ubiquitin deposition around invading Mtb.
Given the role of CBL as a regulator of signaling, we investigated whether the ligase 
modulates macrophage inflammatory responses to bacterial infection by monitoring 
expression of key cytokines activated in response to Mtb. While we observed a modest 
decrease in TNF-α mRNA levels between Cbl+/+ and Cbl−/− cells, we noted a dramatic 
increase in the expression of the antiviral cytokine IFN-β (Figure 5B). Likewise, IFIT1, 
another target of antiviral signaling, was also increased in Cbl−/− cells (Figure 5B). Thus, the 
ability of Mtb to activate antiviral responses, likely through the exposure of bacterial DNA 
to the cytoplasmic sensor cGAS (Manzanillo et al., 2012), is amplified in the absence of 
CBL, indicating that this ligase functions to negatively regulate these responses.
These data support a model in which CBL-deficient macrophages are skewed towards more 
robust antiviral responses, but which come at the cost of decreased antibacterial resistance. 
In this way, CBL would promote cellular resistance by counteracting the antiviral response 
induced by Mtb via the cGAS/STING pathway. Indeed, our finding that ESX-1 mutants, 
which fail to activate antiviral signaling during infection (Stanley and Cox, 2013; Watson et 
al., 2015), are attenuated in Cbl−/− macrophages is consistent with the idea that CBL is 
unnecessary to control bacterial growth in the absence of an antiviral signal (Figure 4L). To

further investigate the idea that a CBL-regulated antiviral program promotes Mtb growth, we 
tested whether ectopic activation of antiviral responses by experimentally delivering DNA to 
the host cell cytosol would rescue the growth defects of ESX-1 mutant bacteria. In this way, 
activation of the antiviral pathway negatively regulated by CBL would occur in the absence 
of phagosomal permeabilization, effectively bypassing the ESX-1 requirement. In 
macrophages transfected with DNA we observed a significant rescue of the ESX-1 mutant 
with impaired bacterial killing over the first 24h, an effect that is enhanced in Cbl−/− 
macrophages (Figure 5C). This suggests that antiviral signaling is sufficient to blunt the 
antibacterial activity of macrophages and that CBL functions to counteract this effect. 
Importantly, addition of IFN-β did not rescue growth of the ESX-1 mutant, consistent with 
the idea that CBL regulates an antiviral program that is independent of Type I IFN (Figure 
5C).
Given the reciprocal effects of antiviral and antibacterial responses mediated by CBL, a 
simple prediction is that Cbl−/− cells may be resistant to viral infection. To test this, we 
infected Cbl−/− and Cbl+/+ BMMs with Sendai Virus (SeV) and Herpes Simplex Virus 1 
(HSV-1) and evaluated the release of viral particles 24h after infection. Deletion of Cbl 
conferred resistance to both viruses, with fewer viral particles released, and a reduction in 
viral cytopathic effects (Figure 6A, 6B). Thus, while loss of CBL results in increased 
sensitivity to Mtb infection, it also creates a more restrictive environment for viral 
replication. This is consistent with recent findings that siRNA-mediated depletion of CBL 
results in stabilization of IRF3 and increased antiviral signaling (Zhao et al., 2016), though 
when we evaluated whether CBL similarly regulated IRF3 during Mtb infection, we detected 
no change in protein levels (Figure 6C).
Although the exact mechanism by which CBL influences the balance between intrinsic 
antibacterial and antiviral defense, permissiveness of Cbl−/− macrophages is unlikely to 
result from increased Type I interferon itself as Mtb replicates normally in macrophages 
deficient for Type I IFN production (Irf3−/−) or signaling (Ifnar−/−) (Manzanillo et al., 2012; 
Stanley et al., 2007). Thus, it appears that CBL may control a broader cell-intrinsic 
antibacterial program by inhibiting antiviral responses, with one component being Type I 
IFN activation (Figure 6D).
DISCUSSION
Despite the impact of TB on mankind, surprisingly little is known about the physical 
interactions between Mtb proteins and its human host proteome. Our understanding of how 
many enteric pathogens interact with host cells via secretion of virulence factors that target 
host pathways has shed light on the evolution of intricate interactions that underlie the host-
pathogen interface. Because Mtb is a remarkably successful bacterial pathogen, capable of 
persisting for the lifetime of the host, it seems likely that Mtb would similarly introduce 
secreted effectors to manipulate host pathways and forestall host immunity. However, the 
evidence that Mtb actually employs this strategy is scant. There are only a handful of 
characterized interactions between Mtb and host proteins, and it remains unclear how they 
impact Mtb virulence. We have addressed this question using our AP-MS pipeline to 
globally identify 187 high confidence, physical interactions between Mtb and host proteins.

It is likely that not all of these will contribute significantly to bacterial virulence during the 
course of a natural Mtb infection. However, this proteomic approach, when combined with 
genetic analysis, represents a powerful way to uncover biologically relevant interactions 
between pathogens and their host cells. Indeed, with this approach we have identified an 
Mtb virulence factor, LpqN, and additionally have identified the CBL ubiquitin ligase as a 
protein that interacts both physically and genetically with LpqN and functions as a host 
restriction factor for Mtb, limiting bacterial growth in macrophages. Interestingly, LpqN is 
also physically associated with the ribosome and the HOPS complex, which is involved in 
vesicle fusion. Further work will be required to determine the functional relevance of these 
and the many other connections we uncovered in the our protein-protein interaction map.
CBL had not been implicated in innate responses to bacteria, and the mechanisms by which 
it contributes to host immunity await discovery. Ubiquitin ligases play key roles in targeting 
of intracellular pathogens to autophagy, but our data indicates that CBL plays a regulatory 
role modulating cell-intrinsic responses to infection. Indeed, we noted a surprising increase 
in the cellular antiviral response in the absence of CBL, with a concomitant decrease in the 
efficiency of antibacterial processes. Importantly, CBL had no effect on the growth of an 
ESX-1 mutant strain of Mtb that does not trigger antiviral responses. This finding that the 
antibacterial properties of CBL are only manifest in the setting of an antiviral host response 
is consistent with the hypothesis that CBL is acting as a regulator of the antiviral response to 
control bacterial infection (Figure 6D).
The specific antiviral pathways regulated by CBL, and exactly how this impairs antibacterial 
functions in the context of Mtb infection remain unknown. IFN-β has been suggested to 
impair clearance of the related pathogen Mycobacterium leprae (Teles et al., 2013), and 
disruption of either IRF3 or IFNAR have previously been shown to modestly impact Mtb 
growth in mice (Manzanillo et al., 2012; Stanley et al., 2007). However, IFN-β signaling 
itself does not alter Mtb growth cell-intrinsically in isolated macrophages, as we observe 
with CBL. This suggests additional, uncharacterized antiviral pathways exist, and are 
activated by Mtb, in addition to the known IRF3-IFN-β-IFNAR pathway. The existence of 
additional antiviral pathways is further supported by our findings in a related study using 
proteomics to examine host protein post-translational modifications during Mtb infection 
(Parry et. al. in preparation). In that work, we identified the IRF7-regulated antiviral 
response as a potent facilitator of Mtb replication. The effects mediated by IRF7 and CBL 
share several similarities. Unlike the IRF3-IFNAR pathway, they both alter Mtb replication 
cell-intrinsically in isolated macrophages. The effects of perturbing IRF7 and CBL are also 
both specific to Mtb, as the replication of neither S. Typhimurium nor L. monocytogenes are 
altered. It remains to be determined whether CBL and IRF7 are actually functioning in the 
same pathway, or whether they modulate parallel antiviral pathways. The finding that two 
different regulators of the macrophage antiviral response both impact the ability of Mtb to 
replicate inside macrophages suggests that this is an essential element in TB pathogenesis. 
We postulate that Mtb might have evolved the ability to release bacterial DNA into the host 
in order to trigger the macrophage antiviral response, and that this antiviral response 
antagonizes antibacterial activity. Effectors such as LpqN could then potentially function to 
prolong or amplify such a signal and create a more permissive intracellular environment for 
bacterial growth.

From within its replicative niche in host macrophages, Mtb is able to undermine the host 
immune response and establish a chronic, often lifelong infection – but how it actually does 
so remains mysterious. The interaction map reported here represents a unique resource to 
generate testable hypotheses regarding the Mtb-host interface and to identify the host 
pathways that dictate TB pathogenesis.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Macrophages—Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) were isolated by flushing 
the femurs from 8–10-week-old C57BL/6 female mice. They were cultured in high-glucose 
DMEM supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated FCS and 10% conditioned media from 
3T3-MCSF cells. All cells were cultured at 37°C with 5% CO 2. Cbl+/+ and Cbl−/− cells 
were generated by isolating BMMs from Cbl+/+ [B6.Cg-Cblbtm1Hua, B6.Cg-Cblctm1Pngr, 
Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(cre/ERT)Nat/J, Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1.1(CAG-EGFP)Fsh/Mmjax] and Cbl−/− 
[B6.Cg-Cbltm2Hua, B6.Cg-Cblbtm1Hua, B6.Cg-Cblctm1Pngr, Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1(cre/ERT)Nat/J, 
Gt(ROSA)26Sortm1.1(CAG-EGFP)Fsh/Mmjax] (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2016) in the presence 
1uM 4-hydroxytamoxifen (Sigma).
Cell Lines—RAW 264.7 mouse macrophages (ATCC TIB-71; male) and 293T cells 
(ATCC® CRL-3216; female) were purchased from ATCC and cultured according to ATCC 
recommendations with addition of 20mM HEPES pH7.4.
Bacterial strains—All Mtb strains were cultured in 7H9 liquid media (BD) supplemented 
with 10% Middlebrook OADC (Sigma), 0.5% glycerol, 0.05% Tween80 in roller bottles at 
37°C. Transposon mutants were obtained from ATCC and carry Himar1 transposon 
insertions with the Kanamycin resistance gene in the indicated locus. Transposon insertion 
sites were validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing (Lamichhane et al., 2003). For genetic 
complementation studies, the predicted promoter region and open reading frame were cloned 
into the SacI site of the integrating vector pBU (Vultos et al., 2006) which had been 
modified to confer Zeocin resistance, and strains were selected with 25μg/ml Zeocin. 
Control strains carried pBU with a ~100 nucleotide fragment of GFP as unique sequence tag 
(see Key Resources Table). For luminescent growth assays, strains carried the containing a 
codon-optimized luxBCADE operon expressed from a MOPS promoter carried on the 
pmv306-Hyg integrating vector (Craney et al., 2007). The ΔeccC strain was made by 
homologous recombination using the pMSG361 vector (Rosenberg et al., 2015).
METHOD DETAILS
Mtb secreted protein analysis—Mtb Erdman strain was grown in 7H9+OADC (BD 
Biosciences), +0.05% Tween-80 (Sigma) until mid-log, then transferred to Sauton’s minimal 
media + 0.05% Tween-80 for 5d, and then finally to Sauton’s media with 0.005% Tween for

5d. Bacteria were pelleted and supernatants concentrated with a 3K MWCO filter 
(Millipore). Bacteria were lysed by boiling, followed by 10 minutes of sonication in 1% 
SDS. 20μg each of cell lysate and culture filtrate were separated by SDS-PAGE and western 
blot performed against GroEL to verify that there was no detectable contamination of the 
culture filtrate by cytoplasmic proteins. For MS analysis, protein was resolved on SDS-
PAGE, visualized by Coomassie, and gel slices subjected to trypsin digestion as described 
below.
In vivo competition assay—12-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were inoculated by 
aerosol with a pool of four mutant strains and cognate complemented strains delivered at 
~75 CFU of each strain using a Madison chamber device. At the indicated times, lungs of 4–
5 mice were homogenized and plated on 7H10 plates. ~10,000 individual colonies were 
scraped into Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific), samples were lysed via bead-beating, RNA 
was removed per manufacturer instructions, and genomic DNA was isolated via extraction 
with 4 M guanidine thiocyanate/50mM Sodium Citrate/1M Tris base. 0.2 volumes sodium 
acetate and 0.4 volumes ethanol was added, and DNA was purified using RNeasy columns 
(Qiagen). qPCR primers were designed to detect unique sequence tags inserted in each 
strain’s genome using either a fragment of the GFP gene (mutant strains) or the unique 
junction between the pBU vector & complementation cassette (complemented strains). Each 
primer set was verified to detect only its specific strain. qPCR was performed with Taq 
polymerase (NEB) and SYBR green I (Sigma) detection.
Ex vivo luminescent bacterial growth assay—Mtb strains carrying the luxBCADE 
operon were prepared for inoculation by washing twice in PBS, removing aggregates with a 
200 RCF spin, followed by gentle sonication to generate a fine bacterial suspension. Bacteria 
were opsonized in 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and macrophages infected at an MOI=2 
by spinning inoculated plates for 10 min at 400 RCF. Monolayers were washed, and 
bacterial luminescence measured at the indicated times using a Spectromax L (Molecular 
Dynamics). Macrophage growth media was changed daily for cell lines and every 48h for 
BMM cultures.
CRISPR mutagenesis—CRISPR guides were designed to target regions in the first exon 
of target genes using an online bioinformatic tool (http://crispr.mit.edu), and cloned into the 
BsmB1 site of the pXPR_001 vector (a gift from Feng Zhang, Addgene plasmid # 52961). 
Viral particles were produced in Lenti-X cells (Clontech) per manufacturer’s instructions 
and used to transduce RAW264.7 cells. These were selected in 5ug/ml Puromycin 
(InVivoGen), and single-cell clones isolated. Mutations were identified by using PCR to 
amplify the first exon by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. CRISPR CBL mutants were 
independently confirmed by western blot with a mouse anti-c-CBL antibody (Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology cat# sc-1651).
Western blots—Protein in lysates was quantified by BCA (Pierce Fisher Scientific). 20μg 
of cell lysate was separated by SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad TGX), and transferred onto 
nitrocellulose membranes. After probing with the indicated antibodies, membranes were 
then imaged on an Odyssey scanner (Li-cor).

Affinity purification—Mtb genes were amplified by PCR from Erdman strain genomic 
DNA. For genes with a predicted signal peptide using SignalP 3.0 (Bendtsen et al., 2004), 
the portion of the open reading frame corresponding to the mature protein was amplified. 
Genes were cloned into PCDNA4 with a C-terminal 2x-Strep tag and expressed in 293T 
cells using calcium phosphate transfection. Cells were lysed 36h later in IP buffer (50mM 
Tris 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.05% NP-40) with phosphatase and protease 
inhibitors (Roche) and tagged proteins immobilized on Strep-Tactin resin (IBA). 
Macrophage lysate was generated from U937 cells differentiated with 10nM PMA for 72h 
and then similarly lysed in IP buffer. 10mg of macrophage lysate was added to each 
immobilized bacterial factor and binding allowed to proceed overnight. The resin was then 
washed 4x in IP buffer, and twice in IP buffer without NP-40 before elution in 10mM biotin. 
For reciprocal immunoprecipitation using FLAG-tagged human proteins the human factors 
were cloned as 3xFLAG-tag fusion proteins in pCDNA4. Combinations of host and bacterial 
factors were co-transfected into 293T cells using calcium phosphate and 
immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody was performed using the same lysis and 
wash conditions as above.
Mass Spectrometry—Purified proteins eluates were digested with trypsin for LC-MS/MS 
analysis. Samples were denatured and reduced in 2M urea, 10 mM NH4HCO3, 2 mM DTT 
for 30 min at 60C, then alkylated with 2 mM iodoacetamide for 45 min at room temperature. 
Trypsin (Promega) was added at a 1:100 enzyme:substrate ratio and digested overnight at 
37C. Following digestion, samples were concentrated using C18 ZipTips (Millipore) 
according to the manufacturer’s specifications. Desalted samples were evaporated to dryness 
and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid for mass spectrometry analysis.
For the MS study to establish a high-confidence set of Mtb secreted proteins culture filtrates 
were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was partitioned into sequential slices and each of 
these was individually subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion followed by desalting and LC-
MS/MS analysis on a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL linear ion trap mass spectrometer. The 
LTQ XL system was equipped with a LC Packings Ultimate HPLC with an analytical 
column (10 cm × 75 um I.D. packed with ReproSil Pur C18 AQ 5 um particles). The system 
delivered a gradient from 5% to 30% ACN in 0.1% formic acid over one hour, and collected 
data in a data-dependent fashion. The LTQ XL collected one full scan followed by 10 
collision-induced dissociation MS/MS scans of the 10 most intense peaks from the full scan. 
Dynamic exclusion was enabled for 30 seconds with a repeat count of 1.
For the primary AP-MS study used to establish the interactome, digested peptide mixtures 
were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL linear ion trap mass 
spectrometer as above.
For the secondary analysis, where AP-MS was performed without inclusion of U937 
macrophage lysate, the digested peptide mixtures were analyzed by LC-MS/MS on a 
Thermo Scientific Velos Pro dual linear ion trap 238 mass spectrometer equipped with an 
Easy-nLC II HPLC with a pre-column (2 cm × 100 um I.D. packed with 239 ReproSil Pur 
C18 AQ 5 um particles) and an analytical column (10 cm × 75 um I.D. packed with ReproSil 
Pur 240C18 AQ 3 um particles). A gradient was delivered from 5% to 30% ACN in 0.1%

formic acid over one hour. The mass spectrometer collected data in a data-dependent fashion 
with one full scan followed by 20 collision-242 induced dissociation MS/MS scans of the 20 
most intense peaks from the full scan. Dynamic exclusion was 243 enabled for 30 seconds 
with a repeat count of 1.
The raw data was matched to protein sequences by the Protein Prospector algorithm 
(Clauser et al., 1999). Data were searched against a database containing Swiss Prot Human 
protein sequences (downloaded March 6, 2012) and concatenated to a decoy database where 
each sequence was randomized in order to estimate the false positive rate. The searches 
considered a precursor mass tolerance of 1 Da and fragment ion tolerances of 0.8 Da and 
considered variable modifications for protein N-terminal acetylation, protein N-terminal 
acetylation and oxidation, glutamine to pyroglutamate conversion for peptide N-terminal 
glutamine residues, protein N-terminal methionine loss, protein N-terminal acetylation and 
methionine loss, and methionine oxidation, and constant modification for carbamidomethyl 
cysteine. Prospector data was filtered using a maximum protein expectation value of 0.01 
and a maximum peptide expectation value of 0.05.
Our global identification of phosphorylation and ubiquitylation during Mtb infection of 
RAW264.7 macrophages is described in a separate manuscript (Johnson et. al., in 
preparation) and will be submitted to ProteomeXchange via PRIDE.
MiST—AP-MS samples were scored with Mass spectrometry Interaction STatistics (MiST) 
algorithm, using the MiST reproducibility (0.45), specificity (0.50) and abundance (0.05) 
weights previously published (Davis et al., 2015). All bait-prey pairs with a MIST score ≥ 
0.70 were considered confident interactions and were combined with human protein 
interactions from the CORUM and STRING databases. The resulting network diagram was 
plotted using Cytoscape, v.3.1.2 411 (Smoot et al., 2011). For the subset re-analysis without 
U937 lysate, MiST with identical settings was used but additional control Strep-tag 
purifications added to the analysis matrix in MiST to compensate for the smaller number of 
experimental samples and establish robust specificity scoring.
Evolutionary Analysis—For analysis over a 5–7 million-year timescale, we employed 
SnIPRE (Eilertson et al., 2012). We focused our analysis on the human lineage by removing 
sites that are inferred to have received mutations along the chimpanzee lineage based on an 
alignment of closely related primates. For analysis of more recent evolution in the primate 
lineage, we used a modified version of integrated Haplotype Score (iHS) (Voight et al., 
2006) as implemented in (Szpiech and Hernandez, 2014).
In Vitro Interaction Studies—Proteins were cloned into the pH3C vector as either a 
Strep-Tag fusion (LpqN) or FLAG-Tag fusions (CBL, GFP). Factors were individually 
expressed in BL21 cells by overnight induction with IPTG at room-temperature. Cells were 
lysed in PBS + protease inhibitors using lysozyme and sonication. Total cell lysates 
containing ~10μg of each tagged protein was combined, subjected to Strep-Tactin 
purification, and interacting proteins were detected by Western blotting as above.

Gene Expression Analysis—Infected macrophages were lysed in Trizol (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and then purified with silica spin-columns (Purelink, Ambion) per manufacturer 
instructions. cDNA was generated using 500ng total RNA with the Superscript III First 
Strand Synthesis Kit (Invitrogen) and subjected to qPCR as described above with 
normalization to the beta-actin transcript.
Immunofluorescence microscopy—Coverslips were fixed for 20min in 4% PFA, 
permeabilized in 0.05% Saponin (Sigma) and incubated with the indicated antibodies for 3h 
at RT. Mycobacteria were visualized either by expression of mCherry or by labeling with 
SytoBC (Fisher). All samples were mounted and images acquired on a Keyence BZ-X700 
microscope. Z-stacks at 0.5μM were acquired and maximum intensity projections generated. 
To quantify colocalization positive phagosomes were scored for each marker by a 
microscopist blinded to sample identity.
Viral Infections—Primary BMDMs were inoculated at 1.5E5 cells in each well of a 24-
well plate and had either Sendai virus or human Herpes Simplex virus-1 added and were 
spun at 1500RMP for 1 hour to inoculate virus at MOI=1. 24 hours after infection cell 
supernatants were removed and nucleic acid isolated using a Quiagen QIAamp MinElute 
Virus Spin Kit. For Sendai virus RT-qPCR was performed and for Herpes Simplex virus-1 
qPCR was then performed.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical Analysis—For RT-qPCR, each sample was amplified in triplicate and 
transcript levels normalized to the beta-actin gene and the standard error of the mean was 
calculated. Each experiment was repeated at least two times from separate biological 
samples with representative data from one biological replicate shown. For luminescent 
growth assays, each sample was quantified in quadruplicate wells and standard-error of the 
mean was calculated. Each experiment was repeated at least three times from separate 
biological samples with representative data from one biological replicate shown. For in vivo 
competition assays, the sequence tags were amplified in triplicate qPCR reactions for each 
mouse, and the ratio between mutant and complement calculated. For the set of mice at each 
time point, the mean mutant:complement ratio and standard-error of mean were calculated. 
A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to calculate p-values for comparisons among sets of mice.
Bioinformatic Analysis of Host Proteins—The set of high-confidence host interacting 
proteins was analyzed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 functional annotation 
tool. Uniprot accession numbers were matched with Uniprot keyword categorization to map 
protein function and determine enrichment relative to the human proteome. Thresholds for 
inclusion were set to two-fold enrichment with a Benjamini–Hochberg corrected p-value of 
<0.05 to adjust for multiple hypotheses testing. Categories were manually curated to remove 
redundant and nonspecific categorizations. For overlap analysis between datasets, a Fisher’s 
exact test was used with the background proteome defined empirically as the set of all 
proteins detectable by our Velos Pro dual linear ion trap instrument in 293T cell-related 
experiments (10,782 proteins).

Figure 4. The LpqN-Interacting protein CBL is a host restriction factor for Mtb.
(A) In vivo competition assay. Bacterial mutant strains (lpqN/Rv0583c, Rv2469c, Rv1804c, 
Rv0999) and cognate complemented strains were pooled and used to infect mice via the 
respiratory route. At the indicated times, bacteria were recovered from lung homogenates 
and the relative proportion of each strain was quantified by qPCR using unique sequence 
tags present in each strain. The Rv2469c mutant appeared to slightly out-compete the 
complemented strain, although this difference was not significant.
(B) Growth curve of the indicated strains in standard 7H9 mycobacterial media. 
Representative data from two independent experiments is shown.
(C) Luminescent bacterial growth assay. BMMs were infected with the indicated strains 
carrying the LuxBCADE reporter operon at an effective MOI=1. Relative luminescent units 
(RLU) were quantified at the indicated times and mean RLU relative to t=0 is plotted. Mean

Figure 6. CBL represses antiviral responses during viral infection.

the supernatant were quantified by RT-qPCR; Mean ± SEM displayed. Phase-contrast image 
(10x) at 24h post-infection. Scale bars = 100 microns.
(B) Infection with HSV-1 for 24h, analyzed as above. t-tests were used for statistical 
analysis.
(C) BMMs were infected with lpqN mutant Mtb for 6h and analyzed by Western blot.
(D) Model of balance between antiviral and antibacterial cell-intrinsic immune response 
pathways mediated by CBL. Host macrophages tailor responses to distinct kinds of 
pathogens at the earliest stages of infection by activating cell-intrinsic immune pathways 
tailored to the threat, e.g. virus or bacterium. These programs appear to be mutually 
antagonistic, as activation of antiviral pathways comes at the cost of antibacterial immunity 
during Mtb infection. Our work indicates that CBL functions to influence this balance by 
inhibiting viral responses and promoting antibacterial immunity.
