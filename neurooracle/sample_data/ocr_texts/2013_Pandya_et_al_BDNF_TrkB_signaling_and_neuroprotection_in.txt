Abstract
Neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), play critical role in neuronal
survival, synaptic plasticity and cognitive functions. BDNF is known to mediate its action through
various intracellular signaling pathways triggered by activation of tyrosine kinase receptor B
(TrkB). Evidence from clinical as well as pre-clinical studies indicate alterations in BDNF
signaling in schizophrenia. Moreover, several antipsychotic drugs have time-dependent effects on
BDNF levels in both schizophrenia subjects and animal models of schizophrenia. Given the
emerging interest in neuroplasticity in schizophrenia understanding the neuroprotective and cell
survival roles of BDNF signaling will enhance our knowledge of its diverse effects, which may
lead to more effective treatments for schizophrenia. This article will present an overview of recent
findings on the role of BDNF signaling in the pathophysiology and treatment of schizophrenia,
with a special focus on its neuroprotective effects.

1. Introduction
Schizophrenia is a chronic, severe, and debilitating mental illness that is characterized by
disintegration of thought processes and of emotional responsiveness. Although the cause and
pathophysiology of schizophrenia are still not clear, evidence suggest that impairments in
neurodevelopmental processes as a result of genetic and environmental insults lead to the
development of schizophrenia pathophysiology. Neurotrophic factors play important roles in
neurodevelopment and adult brain plasticity. They are large family of dimeric polypeptides,
namely nerve growth factor (NGF), BDNF, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and NT-4/5 and are
known to play critical role in neuronal growth, differentiation, survival as well regulation of
neuronal structure and function (Huang and Reichardt, 2001; Lewin and Barde, 1996;
Maisonpierre et al. 1990). Their function requires activation of various intracellular
signaling pathways through binding of specific Trk receptors such as TrkA, TrkB and TrkC
for NGF, BDNF and NT-3 respectively (Arevalo and Wu, 2006; Biffo et al., 1995). In

addition, chronic stress, a major vulnerability factor in neuropsychiatric disorders including
schizophrenia has been shown to alter neurotrophin function (de Kloet et al., 2005; Gatt et
al., 2009).
2. BDNF and schizophrenia
There is accumulating evidence indicating altered BDNF levels in subjects with
schizophrenia. Serum BDNF levels in schizophrenia subjects were found lower in many
studies (Chen da et al., 2009; Grillo et al., 2007; Ikeda et al., 2008; Jindal et al., 2010; Rizos
et al., 2010; Toyooka et al., 2002; Vinogradov et al., 2009; Xiu et al., 2009; Zhang et al.,
2008) except a few studies reported higher BDNF levels (Gama et al., 2007; Reis et al.,
2008). Studies have reported significant decreases in plasma BDNF levels in schizophrenia
subjects as compared to control subjects (Buckley et al., 2007b; Palomino et al., 2006).
Similarly, BDNF levels were also found lower in CSF samples from schizophrenia subjects
(Pillai et al., 2010; Issa et al., 2010). Postmortem studies have shown increases in parietal
cortex and frontal cortex, whereas decrease in temporal cortex and occipital cortex in BDNF
levels as measured by ELISA (Durany et al., 2001). BDNF protein levels were significantly
lower in prefrontal cortex samples from schizophrenia subjects (Issa et al., 2010; Weickert et
al., 2003). BDNF mRNA expression was also found lower in the prefrontal cortex of
schizophrenia subjects (Hashimoto et al., 2005; Pillai, 2008; Weickert et al., 2003). Studies
have reported mixed results on BDNF levels in hippocampus (Iritani et al. 2003; Takahashi
et al., 2000; Thompson Ray et al., 2011). A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that
peripheral BDNF levels are reduced in drug-naive and medicated schizophrenia samples
when compared with age-matched healthy controls. Moreover, alterations in BDNF levels
were found to be increased with age, independent of medication dosage (Green et al., 2011).
As suggested in the recent review articles (Buckley et al., 2011; Favalli et al., 2012) the
inconsistency found in BDNF levels between different studies could be due to differences in
the methodology, sample population, different stage of illness, gender and subtype and
medication history. Therefore, more detailed placebo-controlled studies with larger sample
sizes on standardized antipsychotic therapy are warranted.
3. DNA methylation of BDNF gene and its association with schizophrenia
Epidemiological studies support the theory that the interplay between an individual’s genes
and the environment plays a significant role in the onset of schizophrenia (Roth et al., 2009).
Epigenetic mechanisms such as histone modifications and DNA methylation have been
shown to play a pivotal role in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia. ‘Epigenetics’ is
the study of heritable alterations in gene expression by mechanisms that do not cause direct
changes to the underlying DNA sequence. DNA methylation is one of these epigenetic
mechanisms shown to play a role in schizophrenia through a handful of candidate genes
such as the reelin gene, the glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 gene (GAD67) and BDNF (Roth
et al., 2009).
During DNA methylation, enzymes known as DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) catalyze
the addition of a -CH3 group to cytosine residues at the 5-position of the pyrimidine ring
(Bird, 2002; Miranda and Jones, 2007). Cytosines that are followed by a guanine can be
methylated, and these CpG dinucleotide sequences are typically found in and around gene
regulatory regions in clusters known as CpG islands. DNA methylation usually occurring in
these regulatory regions can lead to transcriptional suppression (Bird, 2002; Miranda and
Jones, 2007). A number of studies have also shed light on the potential role of DNA
methylation in the dynamic regulation of the BDNF gene in adults, and have highlighted the
fact that altered BDNF regulation could contribute to schizophrenia (Lu and Martinowich,
2008).

It has been shown that DNA methylation plays a role in activity-dependant BDNF regulation
(Martinowich et. al., 2003). It is also known that changes in methylation at the BDNF
promoter and intragenic regions is associated to different behavioral trends such as fear
learning, memory formation, stressful social interaction, etc (Lubin et. al., 2008; Roth et. al.,
2009). Mill et. al. (2008) using a genome wide micro-array based approach, found
alterations in DNA methylation in a number of genes including BDNF in major psychosis.
In a recent study Gavin et. al. (2011) found an increase in protein levels and mRNA
expression of a growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible, beta (GADD45b) in patients with
psychosis. They also found reduced GADD45b binding to the BDNF IXabcd gene promoter
region and increased methylation (5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine) at the
promoter in subjects with psychosis, in turn leading to reduced BDNF IXabcd mRNA
expression. GADD45b is required for activity-induced DNA demethylation and it utilizes
cytidine deaminases and thymidine glycosylases. Thus, DNA methylation might be involved
in the dynamic regulation of BDNF activity in schizophrenia (Lu and Martinowich, 2008).
4. Polymorphisms of BDNF gene in schizophrenia
An important single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) found in the BDNF gene is an amino
acid change from a valine (Val) to a methionine (Met) at position 66 (Val66Met) in the
prodomain of BDNF (BDNFMet) (Egan et al., 2003). This polymorphism has been found to
decrease activity-dependant BDNF secretion (Chen et al., 2004) and shown to be associated
with a number of neurological disorders in humans (Momose et al., 2002; Neves-Pereira et
al., 2002; Sen et al., 2003; Sklar et al., 2002; Ventriglia et al., 2002). It has also been linked
to affect hippocampal volume and memory function in humans (Egan et al., 2003). In vitro
studies have shown that the variant BDNFMet leads to altered BDNF trafficking and less
efficient BDNF sorting in neurons (Chen et al., 2004). BDNFMet mice exhibit increase in
anxiety-related behavior when placed in conflict settings (Chen et al., 2006).
Data from studies on stress and BDNFMet polymorphism in humans indicate mixed results
in part due to the variability of different kinds by genetic and environmental stressors in
humans as well as the unreliability of questionnaire based approach to judge human
emotional status (Gatt et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2012). However, in mice with
BDNFMet polymorphism, chronic restrained stress has been shown to increase anxiety-like
and depressive-like behaviors as well as impairs their working memory, (Yu et al., 2012)
which can be attributed to the decreased levels of BDNF in their brains.
A number of studies have investigated the relationship between BDNFMet polymorphism
and schizophrenia, but the results are mostly inconsistent. Some earlier studies have shown
an association between schizophrenia and BDNFMet in humans (Neves-Pereira et al., 2005;
Rosa et al., 2006); however, more recent studies did not find any direct correlation between
BDNFMet polymorphism and susceptibility to schizophrenia (Yi et al., 2011; Zhang et. al.,
2012). The BDNFMet polymorphism has been associated to a lower age at onset of
schizophrenia in male patients from the Han Chinese population (Yi et al., 2011).
5. Neuroprotective roles of BDNF/TrkB signaling
BDNF and its high affinity TrkB receptor are broadly expressed in the developing and adult
mammalian brain (Murer et al., 2001). BDNF induced activation of TrkB is essential to
synaptic plasticity (Kuipers and Bramham, 2006) and contributes to the pathogenesis of
schizophrenia. Studies have shown increases in two truncated TrkB Isoforms, (truncated
TrkB [TrkB-TK-] and sarc homology containing TrkB [TrkB-Shc]), but decreases in full
length TrkB levels in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects (Wong et al., 2011;
Weickert et al., 2005). Moreover, a non-significant decrease in TrkB immunoreactivity was
found in the cerebellum of patients with schizophrenia (Soontornniyomkij et al., 2011).
Pandya et al.

These studies suggest that blocking of excessive truncated TrkB or enhancement of full-
length TrkB function can be used as a future therapeutic approach to restore the deficits in
BDNF signaling in schizophrenia. In this regard, a recent study has shown the potential of
cysteamine to ameliorate alterations in BDNF signaling and GAD67 expression in
heterozygous reeler mice (Kutiyanawalla et al., 2011). BDNF/TrkB plays an important role
in neuronal survival, morphogenesis, and plasticity. It is well known that binding of BDNF
to TrkB elicits various intracellular signaling pathways, including mitogen activated protein
kinase/extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (MAPK/ERK), phospholipase Cγ
(PLCγ), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways (Schabitz et al., 2000; Wu and
Pardridge, 1999 Berridge and Irvine, 1989; Schlessinger, 2000; Hetman et al., 1999). In
addition, small G proteins such as Ras, Rap-1, and the Cdc-42-Ra have also been implicated
as key molecules in BDNF/TrkB signaling (Huang and Reichardt, 2001). BDNF has been
shown to prevent neuronal death caused by N-methyl d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)
blockade in corticostriatal organotypic cultures (Xia et al., 2010). The protective effect of
BDNF against apoptosis requires the activation of the PI-3K/Akt and ERK pathways
through the inhibition of GSK-3beta and activation of CREB. It has been observed that
BDNF protects cortical neurons against camptothecin or serum deprivation induced
apoptosis through the activation of ERK and PI3 kinase pathways (Hetman et al., 1999).
Similarly, the neuroprotective effects of cystamine and erythropoietin against haloperidol-
induced neuronal death were mediated through the activation of BDNF/TrkB signaling
pathway in primary cortical neurons (Pillai et al., 2008a; 2008b). The protective effects of
BDNF against glutamate (Almeida et al., 2005) and norepinephine (NE) (Chen et al., 2007)
in hippocampal neurons were also found to be mediated through PI3K and MAPK signaling
pathways. It has been shown that low level stimulation of NMDA receptors protects
hippocampal neurons against glutamate excitotoxicity via a BDNF autocrine loop in
hippocampal neurons (Jiang et al., 2005). BDNF and constitutive activation of Ras protein
have been shown to prevent MK801-induced apoptotic neuronal death in immature neuronal
cultures (Hansen et al., 2004). The above observations from animal studies are supported by
postmortem evidence showing alterations in Akt and Erk signaling pathways in
schizophrenia. A number of studies have reported decreases in AKT1 mRNA, protein, and
activity levels in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, as well as in peripheral blood of
individuals with schizophrenia (Emamian et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2006; Thiselton et al.,
2008). In addition, many studies have found genetic association between AKT1 genetic
variants and schizophrenia (Emamian et al., 2004; Ikeda et al., 2004; Schwab et al., 2005;
Bajestan et al., 2006). A recent study has shown an association between decrease in
phosphorylated AKT--total AKT ratio and reduced hippocampal volume in first episode
schizophrenia subjects (Szamosi et al., 2012). Significant decreases in protein levels of
members in ERK signaling pathway such as Rap1, B-Raf, MEK1, MEK2, ERK1/2 and
RSK1 were found in prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia subjects (Yuan et al., 2010). Since
BDNF plays a vital role in activation of various survival signaling pathways, efforts have
been made to identify the role of apoptotic mechanisms in the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia (Berger et al., 2003). The ratio of the proapoptotic to antiapoptotic proteins is
the key determinants for the apoptotic activation. The expression of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic
factor was found lower in postmortem temporal cortex of schizophrenia subjects (Jarskog et
al., 2000). In addition, the Bax/Bcl2 ratio was found significantly higher in the temporal
cortex of schizophrenia subjects (Jarskog et al., 2004). It is important to note that both Akt
and Erk are also downstream signaling pathways to many other proteins implicated in
schizophrenia pathophysiology such as neuregulin, DISC1 and reelin. Therefore, data from
postmortem studies have some limitations in interpreting the roles of Akt and Erk to
schizophrenia pathology. However, in vitro activation of Akt or Erk signaling pathway using
postmortem samples or lymphocytes from schizophrenia and control subjects might give
some answers to the specificity of these signaling pathways (Hahn et al., 2006).

6. Effects of antipsychotic drugs on BDNF levels
There is a growing literature from clinical and pre-clinical studies on the effects of
antipsychotic drugs on BDNF levels.
6.1. Clinical Studies
The effects of antipsychotic drugs on BDNF levels have been studied using serum and
plasma samples from schizophrenia and control subjects (Table 1). Serum BDNF levels
were found directly correlated with clozapine daily dose in schizophrenia subjects (Pedrini
et al., 2011). However, another study reported significant decreases in serum BDNF levels
in chornic schizophrenia subjects on long term treatment with antipsychotics (Tan et al.,
2005). No change in serum BDNF levels was found in schizophrenia subjects following 6
weeks of antipsychotic treatment (Pirildar et al., 2004). In contrast, a recent study found
significant increase in serum BDNF levels following 4 weeks of antipsychotic treatment in
schizophrenia subjects (Lee et al., 2011). Reduced serum BDNF levels were observed in
patients with chronic schizophrenic disorder in relapse, but no significant change in BDNF
levels was found following 6 weeks of treatment with typical (haloperidol) or atypical
antipsychotics (risperidone, olanzapine and amisulpride) drugs (Rizos et al., 2010).A
number of studies have investigated the effect of antipsychotic drugs on plasma BDNF
levels in schizophrenia subjects. A recent study compared plasma BDNF levels at base line
and after 1 year of olanzapine treatment in drug-naïve first episode subjects (Gonzalez-Pinto
et al., 2010). They found significantly lower plasma BDNF levls at onset as compared to
controls, but increased toward control values during olanzapine treatment. However, another
study in drug-naïve first episode subjects did not find any significant change in plasma
BDNF levels following 8 weeks treatment with antipsychotic drugs, risperidone, olanzapine
or aripiprazole (Yoshimura et. al., 2010). Similarly, unchanged plasma BDNF levels was
found in schizophrenia subjects following 8 weeks of olanzapine (Hori et al., 2007) or 4
weeks of risperidone (Yoshimura et al., 2007) treatment.
6.2. Pre-clinical Studies
Differential effects of typical and atypical antipsychotics on BDNF levels in rodents are
summarized in Table 2. Typical antipsychotics such as haloperidol have been shown to
reduce BDNF and TrkB protein levels in rat hippocampus (Parikh et al., 2004). No changes
in BDNF protein levels was found in rat hippocampus following olanzapaine treatment for
45 days (Parikh et al., 2004). Interestingly, switching to olanzapine markedly restored
haloperidol-induced reductions in both BDNF and TrkB receptors in rat hippocampus.
Haloperidol significantly decreased BDNF concentrations in frontal cortex, occipital cortex
and hippocampus after 29 days of treatment in rats (Angelucci et al., 2000). However,
risperidone could reduce BDNF levels in the above regions only at higher doses. Both
haloperidol and risperidone was unable to alter BDNF expression in hypothalamus and
striatum (Angelucci et al., 2000). Olanzapine at a dose of 15 mg/kg body weight for 29 days
significantly reduced BDNF protein levels in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus (Angelucci
et al., 2005). In addition, reduced BDNF mRNA expression has been reported in rat
hippocampus following haloperidol treatment (Lipska et al., 2001), whereas BDNF mRNA
levels were elevated with atypical antipsychotics, like clozapine and olanzapine in the rat
hippocampus (Bai et al., 2003). In chronic antipsychotic treatment studies, BDNF protein
levels in rat hippocampus were unchanged with olanzapine both after 90 and 180 days of
treatment (Pillai et al., 2006). BDNF protein levels were significantly lower in rat
hippocampus following 90 days of haloperidol or chlorpromazine treatment and the
reduction was continued up to 180 days. Furthermore, switching haloperidol treated rats
after 90 days of treatment to either risperidone or olanzapine for the next 90 days
significantly restored levels of BDNF in hippocampus. Olanzapine, but not haloperidol has

been shown to restore MK-801-induced reductions in BDNF protein levels in rat
hippocampus (Fumagalli et al., 2003). Similarly, quetiapine treatment in rats was effective
to attenuate the decreases in BDNF mRNA expression caused by immobilization stress in
hippocampus and cortex (Park et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2002). Moreover, administration of
ziprasidone significantly attenuated the immobilization stress-induced decrease in BDNF
mRNA expression in rat hippocampus and neocortex (Park et al., 2009). The above studies
suggest that atypical antipsychotics exhibit less deleterious effects on BDNF levels
compared to typical antipsychotics and also capable of restoring the effects of typical
antipsychotics. However, it is important to determine whether the beneficial effects of
atypical antipsychotics will sustain over longer period of treatment (Terry and Mahadik,
2007).
7. Conclusion
There is growing interest in understanding the role of BDNF signaling in the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Although most of the studies have found decreases in
BDNF protein levels in peripheral samples from schizophrenia subjects the data on the
effects of antipsychotic drugs on BDNF are not conclusive. TrkB signaling molecules such
as Akt and Erk are linked to several cellular pathways involved in survival and apoptosis,
and are also implicated in schizophrenia pathology. Given the limitations of the currently
available antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia, in particular, treating
cognitive deficits and negative symptoms, novel treatment avenues would be of great
importance. Neuroprotective/neurotrophic compounds might be used as adjunctive
therapeutic strategy for the treatment of schizophrenia.

Highlights
Overview of BDNF/TrkB signaling in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
Pre-clinical and clinical studies indicate differential effects of antipsychotic drugs on
BDNF/TrkB signaling in schizophrenia.
Neuroprotective/neurotrophic compounds should be tried as adjunct to conventional
medications in schizophrenia.
