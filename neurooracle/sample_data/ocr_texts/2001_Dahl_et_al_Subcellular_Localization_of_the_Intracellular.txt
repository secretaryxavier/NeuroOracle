Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular pathogen that has evolved the ability to survive and
multiply within human macrophages. It is not clear how M. tuberculosis avoids the destructive action of
macrophages, but this ability is fundamental in the pathogenicity of tuberculosis. A gene previously identiﬁed
in M. tuberculosis, designated eis, was found to enhance intracellular survival of Mycobacterium smegmatis in the
human macrophage-like cell line U-937 (J. Wei et al., J. Bacteriol. 182:377–384, 2000). When eis was introduced
into M. smegmatis on a multicopy vector, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed
the appearance of a unique 42-kDa protein band corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of the eis
gene product. This band was electroeluted from the gel with a purity of >90% and subjected to N-terminal
amino acid sequencing, which demonstrated that the 42-kDa band was indeed the protein product of eis. The
Eis protein produced by M. tuberculosis H37Ra had an identical N-terminal amino acid sequence. A synthetic
polypeptide corresponding to a carboxyl-terminal region of the deduced eis protein sequence was used to
generate afﬁnity-puriﬁed rabbit polyclonal antibodies that reacted with the 42-kDa protein in Western blot
analysis. Hydropathy proﬁle analysis showed the Eis protein to be predominantly hydrophilic with a potential
hydrophobic amino terminus. Phase separation of M. tuberculosis H37Ra lysates by the nonionic detergent
Triton X-114 revealed the Eis protein in both the aqueous and detergent phases. After fractionation of M.
tuberculosis by differential centrifugation, Eis protein appeared mainly in the cytoplasmic fraction but also in
the membrane, cell wall, and culture supernatant fractions as well. Forty percent of the sera from pulmonary
tuberculosis patients tested for anti-Eis antibody gave positive reactions in Western blot analysis. Although the
function of Eis remains unknown, evidence presented here suggests it associates with the cell surface and is
released into the culture medium. It is produced during human tuberculosis infection and therefore may be an
important M. tuberculosis immunogen.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent of tubercu-
losis, is the leading cause of death worldwide due to a single
infectious agent and is responsible for as many as 26% of all
avoidable adult deaths (20, 36, 44, 60). M. tuberculosis is highly
infectious; once inhaled into the lungs, the bacilli are engulfed
by aveolar macrophages. The microbes are resistant to killing
by host macrophages and multiply within these phagocytes.
Internalized M. tuberculosis may avoid death by several pro-
posed mechanisms, which include inhibiting phagosome-lyso-
some fusion (2, 17), inhibiting phagosome acidiﬁcation (14,
52), and scavenging toxic oxygen products produced by mac-
rophages (9). Various mycobacterial cell wall components may
be involved in these processes (49). Classic studies by Goren et
al. (28) suggest a possible role for mycobacterial sulfatides in
the inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion, while the cell
wall-associated glycolipid lipoarabinomannan of M. tuberculo-
sis has been shown to scavenge toxic oxygen products produced
by macrophages (9, 10). With the publication of the complete
genome sequence of M. tuberculosis (13), additional genes and
protein products of the pathogen have been identiﬁed as po-
tentially playing roles in pathogenesis. These include the mce
(3), erp (4), acr (62) and sigF (12) gene products, although their
modes of action remain speculative.
Recently the eis gene of M. tuberculosis was shown to en-
hance Mycobacterium smegmatis intracellular survival in the
human macrophage cell line U-937 (56). M. smegmatis con-
taining eis on a multicopy plasmid exhibited a 5- to 10-fold-
enhanced intracellular survival over a 2-day infection period.
The eis gene corresponds to Rv2416c of the M. tuberculosis
genome, but this open reading frame (ORF) has no signiﬁcant
homology to other known genes. Southern blot analysis showed
eis present only in members of the M. tuberculosis complex and
absent from numerous other mycobacterial species (56). The
putative Eis proteins from M. tuberculosis H37Rv and H37Ra
had the same electrophoretic mobility as the Eis protein from
M. smegmatis(p69) and reacted with the antibody to the Eis
protein in Western blots. The N-terminal amino acid sequence
of the Eis proteins from M. smegmatis(p69) and M. tuberculosis
H37Ra were identical. It was concluded that the Eis proteins
from the three mycobacteria are probably the same. The N-
terminal sequencing of Eis protein revealed that the transla-
tion start site is different from the ones initially reported (13,
56). To help in assigning a function to Eis, cell fractionation
experiments were performed to delineate the location of Eis
within M. tuberculosis H37Ra.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains and growth media. M. smegmatis 1-2c (63) was grown in Middlebrook

tuberculosis H37Ra were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 with or without albumin
dextrose catalase (ADC) plus 0.05% Tween 80 (64) or in glycerol-alanine-salts
(GAS) medium (53). When required, the antibiotics hygromycin B (200 mg/ml
for Escherichia coli; 50 mg/ml for mycobacteria) and kanamycin (25 mg/ml for
mycobacteria) were used.
Production of anti-Eis antibody and other antibodies. Anti-Eis polyclonal
antibodies were produced by Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Inc. (Hokinton,
Mass.). A potentially immunogenic peptide sequence was selected from the
deduced Eis protein amino acid sequence, and an 18-mer oligopeptide (AAA
NRLRTKDSQLLRRLD) corresponding to a C-terminal domain was synthe-
sized. The peptide was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, mixed with
Freund’s adjuvant, and injected subcutaneously into rabbits. Booster injections
were given at least ﬁve times, with test bleeds taken at each stage for enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay of antibody titers against the Eis peptide bound to
bovine serum albumin (BSA). The synthetic polypeptide proved immunogenic,
and the resulting antibody was afﬁnity puriﬁed by passing rabbit serum over an
agarose-based column with the peptide thiol coupled to the resin. The column
was washed, and bound antibodies were eluted using a low-pH glycine buffer
before dialysis in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The afﬁnity-puriﬁed anti-Eis
antibody was stored frozen until used in Western blots at a 1:1,250 dilution.
Monoclonal antibodies speciﬁc for M. tuberculosis H37Rv antigens were pro-
vided by John Belisle, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, through the
National Institutes of Health (NIH, Bethesda, Md.) contract entitled “Tubercu-
losis Research Material and Vaccine Testing.” The M. tuberculosis antigens
(antibodies and dilutions) used in Western blots were lipoarabinomannan (LAM)
(CS-35; diluted 1:2,000), a-crystallin (CS-49; diluted 1:500), 38-kDa lipoprotein
(IT-23; diluted 1:500), and the 45-kDa secreted glycoprotein (CS-93; diluted
1:50).
Sera from human tuberculosis patients. Sera from 15 sputum smear acid-fast
bacterium-positive cavitary tuberculosis patients and 5 puriﬁed protein derivative
(PPD)-positive healthy controls were used in Western blot analysis for detection
of anti-Eis antibody. Electropuriﬁed Eis protein (see below) was used to test
these sera for Eis-speciﬁc antibody. Human sera were used at 1:1,000 dilution to
bind with 5-mg aliquots of electropuriﬁed Eis transblotted to nitrocellulose.
Construction of M. smegmatis with a chromosomal copy of eis. Insertion of eis
as a single copy into the chromosome of M. smegmatis [M. smegmatis(c69)] was
carried out as described by Lee et al. (40), using the integrative plasmid vector
pMV306 (41). The eis gene was cloned into this integrative vector by inserting the
1.6-kb Clal-HindIII fragment from p62-97 (56) into Clal-HindIII digested
pMV306. The recombinant plasmid was electroporated into M. smegmatis as
previously described (6), and transformants were selected by growth on 7H10
plates with kanamycin. The appearance of eis in the M. smegmatis chromosome
was validated by Southern blot analysis as previously described (56).
Electroelution and N-terminal sequencing of the Eis protein. M. smegma-
tis(p69), which contains the eis gene in the multicopy plasmid pOLGY (56), was
grown to late log phase and resuspended in PBS containing protease inhibitor
cocktail (Sigma P-8465). Cells were lysed using a Branson Soniﬁer 450, and
proteins were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electro-
phoresis (SDS-PAGE) (37) using 1.5-mm-thick, 12% resolving gels with 4%
stackers. A small central region of the gel was sliced off and stained with
GelCode Blue (Pierce) to quickly visualize the location of the Eis protein band
for excision with a razor blade. The Eis protein was electroeluted out of gel slices
using a Centilutor Micro-Electroeluter (Millipore) according to the manufactur-
er’s directions. Electroeluted protein was concentrated 10-fold with Centicon
Centrifugal ﬁlter devices (Amicon) with a 10,000-molecular-weight (MW) cutoff.
Purity of stained, electroeluted Eis was determined with an AlphaImager 2000
densitometer (Alpha Innotech Corp). N-terminal peptide sequencing was per-
formed by Wallace Clark, University of Arizona Laboratory for Protein Se-
quence Analysis. Peptide sequencing was performed on electropuriﬁed Eis re-
covered from both M. smegmatis(p69) and M. tuberculosis H37Ra. These
preparations were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transblotted onto Immobilon-PSQ
membranes (Millipore), and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 to
identify the bands for sequencing.
Western blot analysis. Mycobacterial lysates for Western blot analysis were
prepared as follows. M. smegmatis(pOLYG) and M. smegmatis(p69) were grown
on agar plates and harvested; bacterial lysates were prepared using 0.1- to
0.15-mm-diameter glass beads and a Turbomix device (VWR Scientiﬁc) attached
to a vortexer and mixed for 30 min. Lysates of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and H37Ra
were also prepared as described above. H37Rv cells inactivated by gamma
irradiation were obtained via NIH contract with Colorado State University as
mentioned above.
Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (54). Protein
sample concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid colorimetric
assay (Pierce) with BSA standards as instructed by the manufacturer. Samples
were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gel) along with prestained MW standards
(Gibco BRL), containing BSA (68 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhy-
drase (29 kDa), b-lactoglobulin (19 kDa), and lysozyme (14 kDa). Electrophore-
sis was done at 250 V and 90 mA for 4 to 5 h. Proteins from gels were trans-
blotted overnight onto nitrocellulose membranes (Protran), which were then
blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 5% powdered skim milk and 0.02% sodium
azide. All antibodies used were diluted into PBS containing 0.25% powdered
skim milk with 0.02% sodium azide. Membranes were rocked at 23°C for 5 h with
primary antibodies, washed, and then incubated with secondary antibodies over-
night at 4°C. Secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase, speciﬁc
for Fc regions of either mouse (Bio-Rad catalog no. 170-6520), rabbit (Zymed
catalog no. 62-6122), or human (Zymed catalog no. 62-8322) antibody were used
at 1:2,000 dilutions. Membranes were washed with PBS and developed with
chromogenic substrates as described by Sambrook et al. (51). Densitometry
measurements of developed protein bands on Western blots were made using an
Alphalmager 2000 (Alpha Innotech Corp.) and assigned arbitrary integrated
density values (IDV).
Glycoprotein staining. Puriﬁed Eis protein was analyzed for glycosylation
using GelCode Glycoprotein stain (Pierce) as instructed by the manufacturer.
The GelCode Glycoprotein stain is speciﬁc for proteins with the sugar moieties
that include galactose, mannose, glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylgalac-
tosamine, sialic acid, fucose, and xylose. Glycoproteins appear as magenta bands
against a colorless or pink background. The sensitivity of the stain was tested
using avidin and horseradish peroxidase, with amounts of 0.625 ng and 0.16 mg,
respectively, detected. One gel was stained for total protein with GelCode Blue
and compared with an identical gel stained with GelCode Glycoprotein stain as
instructed by the manufacturer.
Preparation of mycobacteria cellular fractions by differential centrifugation
partitioning. Subcellular fractionation was performed essentially as described by
Ortalo-Magne´ et al. (46), with minor modiﬁcations. Brieﬂy, 1 liter of M. tuber-
culosis H37Ra was grown to mid-log phase (3 weeks) in GAS medium (53) at
37°C with shaking before harvesting. By using GAS medium, which does not
contain BSA, potential problems in concentration and analysis of the superna-
tant were alleviated. Cells were collected by a 30-min centrifugation at 10,000 3
g, and the culture supernatant was saved for concentration following a procedure
modiﬁed from Dubos et al. (19). The culture supernatant was passed through a
0.22-mm-pore-size bottle ﬁlter, and the ﬁltrate was concentrated 100-fold in a
Centricon Plus-80 concentrator with a 10,000-MW cutoff membrane (Amicon,
Inc.). The concentrate was saved as the culture ﬁltrate protein (CFP) fraction.
Pelleted cells were washed, resuspended in PBS with protease inhibitor cocktail,
and lysed using glass beads as described above. Lysates were centrifuged twice at
11,000 3 g for 5 min at room temperature to remove unbroken cells and
insoluble material. Lysate supernatants were centrifuged at 27,000 3 g for 1 h at
4°C to pellet cell walls (34). The supernatant was collected and ultracentrifuged
at 100,000 3 g for 4 h at 4°C to separate cell membranes (pellet) from the
cytoplasmic fraction (supernatant) (39). The cell wall and cell membrane frac-
tions were each washed three times with PBS and resuspended in 500 ml of PBS.
The cytoplasmic fraction was ultracentrifuged three more times for 4 h at
100,000 3 g to ensure that all residual membranes were removed. The ﬁnal
volume of the cytoplasmic fraction was 3.5 ml, seven times the volumes of the cell
wall and cell membrane fractions.
Triton X-114 detergent-phase partitioning. M. tuberculosis H37Ra was grown
in 7H9 with ADC and Tween 80 to late log phase before cells were pelleted,
washed, and resuspended in PBS with protease inhibitors. Cells were lysed by
vortexing with glass beads, and whole cells were removed as described above.
The clariﬁed lysate was centrifuged at 47,000 3 g for 1 h at 4°C to produce
soluble and insoluble fractions. The insoluble fraction was washed three times
with PBS and then resuspended in PBS to a volume equivalent to that of the
soluble fraction. Both the soluble and insoluble fractions were subjected to
Triton X-114 (TX-114)-phase separation as described by Bordier (5). The solu-
ble and insoluble fractions were separately treated with TX-114 (Sigma) at a ﬁnal
concentration of 2%. Samples were vortexed for 30 s and then placed on ice
overnight. Samples were allowed to equilibrate to 37°C for 10 min before cen-
trifugation at room temperature for 5 min at 10,000 3 g to produce an upper
aqueous phase and a lower detergent phase. All phase fractions were separated
and backwashed four times (46). After backwashing, all phases were equilibrated
with PBS and TX-114 before separation by SDS-PAGE and analysis by Western
blotting.
Accumulation of Eis protein in culture supernatants. A liquid culture of M.
tuberculosis H37Ra grown in GAS medium was shaken at 37°C for 36 days. At
various time points (3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 days), 15-ml aliquots were
harvested. A sample was removed and used to determine CFU per milliliter by

viable plate count determinations. Culture supernatants were then centrifuged to
remove bacterial cells and passed through 0.22-mm-pore-size ﬁlters, and the
ﬁltrates were concentrated 100-fold using Millipore spin columns with a
10,000-MW cutoff. Levels of Eis and other selected M. tuberculosis proteins in the
concentrated culture ﬁltrate were analyzed by Western blotting as described
above and compared over time to CFU. Data shown are representative of two
separate experiments.
RESULTS
Expression of Eis protein in M. tuberculosis. The eis gene is
present only in members of the M. tuberculosis complex (M.
tuberculosis strains H37Rv, H37Ra, and Erdman and M. bovis
BCG), but its protein product has been previously shown to
occur only in M. smegmatis containing eis on plasmid pOLYG
(56). For detection of Eis in mycobacterial lysates by Western
blot analysis, rabbit anti-Eis antibody was produced by using a
synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal domain of
Eis as described in Materials and Methods.
Results of Western blot analysis are presented in Fig. 1. The
anti-Eis antibody detected the presence of the 42-kDa Eis
protein in lysates of M. smegmatis(p69) (lane 2) and as a single
chromosomal copy in M. smegmatis(c69) (lane 3) but not in
lysates of M. smegmatis(pOLYG) (lane 1) since this mycobac-
terial species does not contain an eis homolog. The Eis protein
was readily detected in lysates of both M. tuberculosis H37Ra
(lane 4) and H37Rv (lane 5). The eis gene product was clearly
overexpressed in M. smegmatis(p69) (lane 2) and probably in
M. smegmatis(c69) (lane 3). These results demonstrate that the
Eis protein is indeed produced in M. tuberculosis.
Puriﬁcation and N-terminal sequencing of the Eis protein.
Numerous attempts to purify Eis from overproducing M. smeg-
matis(p69) with ion-exchange, size exclusion, and antibody-
afﬁnity columns all proved unsuccessful. This suggests that Eis
may be associated with other components in a stable fashion,
thus preventing easy separation by chromatography. Electro-
elution from SDS-polyacrylamide gels proved successful in pu-
rifying Eis (Fig. 2). The vector control M. smegmatis(pOLYG)
lysate does not produce Eis (Fig. 2A, lane 2), in contrast to the
M. smegmatis(p69) lysate containing the overexpressed 42-kDa
Eis (lane 3). In comparison, lane 4 shows electropuriﬁed Eis.
The electroeluted protein was greater than 90% pure, as de-
termined by densitometry scan analysis on a GelCode Blue-
stained gel (Fig. 2A). Western blot analysis using anti-Eis an-
tibody conﬁrmed that the electropuriﬁed protein was indeed
Eis (Fig. 2B).
This puriﬁed protein was N-terminally sequenced (Fig. 3).
The N terminus was established as TVTLCS. This demon-
strates that the start of translation of Rv2416c is different from
the MPQSDS N terminus described by Cole et al. (13) and the
MFLLAA N terminus proposed by this laboratory (56). This
modiﬁcation does not alter the previously predicted promoter
region for eis, which appears to be a strong promoter since its
-35 and -10 promoter regions are in close agreement with the
consensus sequences of TTGACA and TATAAT, respectively.
The predicted strength of the promoter is in good agreement
with the high levels of protein expression observed during in
vitro mycobacterial growth (Fig. 1).
Hydropathy analysis of Eis. The DAS (density alignment
surface) (15) and TMpred (35) programs were used to analyze
the Eis protein sequence for the presence of possible trans-
membrane domains. Most of the protein appears hydrophilic,
the exception being the N terminus, where 10 uncharged res-
idues from positions 78 to 89 are ﬂanked by proline residues,
suggesting a transmembrane domain (data not shown).
Eis is not a glycoprotein. Because numerous secreted and
exported M. tuberculosis proteins have been shown or sug-
gested to be glycosylated (33), analysis for glycosylation of Eis
was done with a stain that reacts speciﬁcally with glycoproteins
(GelCode Glycoprotein stain) (Fig. 4). Two positive controls,
horseradish peroxidase and the M. tuberculosis 45-kDa se-
creted glycoprotein (19), and a negative control, soybean tryp-
sin inhibitor, were included in the experiment. Horseradish
peroxidase and the 45-kDa glycoprotein both reacted with the
stain (Fig. 4B, lanes 5 and 7, respectively). Ample amounts of
soybean trypsin inhibitor were loaded (Fig. 4A, lane 6), but this

analysis using anti-Eis antibody (B). Lanes: 1, prestained MW protein
standards; 2, M. smegmatis(pOLYG) (47 mg of total protein); 3, M.

(5 mg of total protein).

elements and the Shine-Dalgarno (S.D.) sequence are underlined, with

protein did not react with the stain (Fig. 4B, lane 6). Neither
Eis in the M. smegmatis(p69) lysate nor electropuriﬁed Eis
(Fig. 4B, lanes 3 and 4, respectively) reacted with the stain.
Similar results were obtained using Eis produced in M. tuber-
culosis H37Ra (data not shown). These results suggest that Eis
is not a glycoprotein.
M. tuberculosis H37Ra fractionation by differential centrifu-
gation. Subcellular fractions of M. tuberculosis H37Ra were
separated by differential centrifugation and probed by Western
blot analysis for the presence of Eis protein and other M.
tuberculosis antigens used as speciﬁc markers for various sub-
cellular fractions (Fig. 5). a-Crystallin was predominantly in
the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 5A, lane Cy). The 45-kDa se-
creted glycoprotein, conversely, was predominantly seen in the
extracellular environment (panel D, lane CFP). LAM is a set
of membranous glycophospholipids anchored in the plasma
membrane of M. tuberculosis and extending outward through
the peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan, mycolic acids, and free
lipids of the cell envelope (50). Consequently, it is difﬁcult to
isolate LAM into discrete subcellular fractions (Fig. 5C). The
only location from which LAM was clearly absent was the
cytoplasm (Fig. 5C, lane Cy), which agrees with its site of
assembly in the cell wall (50). The 38-kDa lipoprotein was
present in all four fractions (Fig. 5B), with increasing amounts
found, moving out of the cell from the cytoplasm to the culture
supernatant. Like the 38-kDa lipoprotein, Eis was found in all
four subcellular fractions (Fig. 5E). However, unlike the 38-
kDa lipoprotein, Eis lacks anything resembling the consensus
signal sequence of lipoprotein precursors in bacteria (61). Eis
was found primarily in the cytoplasmic fraction, with reduced
levels in the membrane, cell wall, and culture supernatant
fractions.
X-114 detergent-phase partitioning fractionation of M. tu-
berculosis H37Ra. To further test the possibility that Eis might
be associated with the hydrophobic environment of the plasma
membrane and cell wall, H37Ra lysates were subjected to
TX-114-phase fractionation and probed with the antibody for
Eis (Fig. 6). Phase partitioning with TX-114 is a strategy for
isolating integral membrane proteins that has been used in M.
tuberculosis and other bacteria (5, 7, 47, 59, 61). Both soluble
and insoluble portions of the bacterial lysates were treated with
TX-114 to produce both aqueous and detergent soluble frac-
tions. Antibodies speciﬁc for a-crystallin, 38-kDa lipoprotein,
LAM, and Eis were used to analyze the various fractions. The
hydrophobicities of these antigens match well with their sub-
cellular locations shown in Fig. 5. The a-crystallin showed a
preference for the aqueous phase (Fig. 6A, lane SA), while the
38-kDa lipoprotein (Fig. 6B, lanes SD and ID) and LAM (Fig.
6C, lanes SD and ID) partitioned preferentially into the de-
tergent phase. LAM was observed as a diffuse band consistent
with reported Western blot analysis of this glycolipid (39).
LAM in the detergent fractions was signiﬁcantly smaller than
LAM in the whole-cell lysate (Fig. 6C, lane WL). This may be
explained by the physical breakage of LAM during repeated
vortexing of the detergent-phase samples as they were back
washed to remove aqueous-phase antigens. Eis was found pre-
dominantly in the aqueous fraction of the soluble material of
the lysate (Fig. 6D, lane SA) just as it was predominantly in the
cytoplasmic fraction produced by differential fractionation
(Fig. 5E).
Release of Eis into the culture supernatant. The presence of
Eis in the culture supernatant was analyzed to determine if the
protein was being released by autolysis of cells or if it was
naturally exported out of intact cells (61). Analysis of the eis
gene, Rv2416c ORF, using a bioinformatic approach described
by Gomez et al. (27; http://tbsp.phri.nyu.edu/) reveals a Signal
P score of 0.341 and a SPScan score of 6.1. Both values fall
below cutoff values established from scores based on known M.
tuberculosis secreted proteins (27). Although there is no rec-
ognizable N-terminal secretion sequence for Eis, there are
numerous examples of M. tuberculosis proteins without secre-
tion sequences that have been identiﬁed in culture ﬁltrates that
include L-alanine dehydrogenase (57), glutamine synthetase

FIG. 5. Localization of the Eis protein in M. tuberculosis H37Ra by
differential centrifugation partitioning. H37Ra grown to mid-log phase
was lysed and divided into the following fractions using differential
centrifugation: Cy (cytoplasm; 44 mg of total protein), M (cell mem-
brane; 5 mg of total protein), CW (cell wall; 10 mg of total protein), and
CFP (26 mg of total protein). These fractions were subjected to SDS-
PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose, and reacted with anti-Eis
polyclonal antibodies or with monoclonal antibodies speciﬁc for the
various localized M. tuberculosis proteins. The Western blots show
primary antibodies binding to a-crystallin (A), 38-kDa lipoprotein (B),
LAM (C), 45-kDa secreted glycoprotein (D), and Eis protein (E).

(29), superoxide dismutase (1), catalase (48), and GroES (57).
To address the question of whether Eis is released from intact
cells, we grew M. tuberculosis H37Ra in liquid media and an-
alyzed culture ﬁltrates at various time points. Western blot
analysis was used to detect the presence of Eis as well as a
secreted M. tuberculosis antigen (45-kDa secreted glycopro-
tein) (38), a cytoplasmic protein (a-crystallin) (62), and a sur-
face-associated protein that is known to be released into the
culture supernatant (38-kDa lipoprotein) (24).
The 45-kDa secreted glycoprotein appeared in culture su-
pernatant as early as 3 days in log-phase growth (Fig. 7A),
whereas a-crystallin did not appear in the culture ﬁltrate
throughout the 36 days of growth (Fig. 7B). The a-crystallin
protein was produced, but it remained intracellular during
these stages of cell growth. This is indicated by detection of the
antigen in mid-log-phase cell lysates analyzed in Fig. 5 and 6.
These results suggest that no signiﬁcant bacterial cell lysis
occurred over the 36 days of the experiment. The 38-kDa
lipoprotein, beginning at 18 days, was increasingly released
throughout the remainder of the growth curve (Fig. 7C). This
is apparently due to temporary acylated association of the
antigen with the cell wall before its release. The appearance of
the Eis protein in the culture supernatant (Fig. 7D) followed a
pattern similar to that of the 38-kDa lipoprotein, with Eis
being detected by 18 days of growth. By 36 days of growth, the
levels of Eis released into the culture supernatant were com-
parable to the 3,800 IDV levels observed for the 45-kDa se-
creted glycoprotein. This suggests that Eis was steadily re-
leased across the plasma membrane during growth in liquid
culture.
Detection of antibody to Eis protein in sera from human
tuberculosis patients. A small-scale study was done to screen
sera from human pulmonary tuberculosis patients for the pres-
ence of antibodies to the Eis protein by using Western blot
analysis (Fig. 8). Detection of antibody would suggest that Eis
is produced during an active human infection. Electropuriﬁed
Eis was transblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, and strips
were incubated with sera from 15 cavitary tuberculosis patients
and from 5 PPD-positive healthy controls. Among tuberculosis
patient sera, 40% gave clear positive reactions (6 out of 15
patients tested). Lane 2 in Fig. 8 shows a positive reaction
using rabbit anti-Eis antibody which readily detects the elec-
tropuriﬁed Eis, while lanes 4 and 5 are representative of pos-
itive patient sera reactions to Eis. Lane 3 represents a tuber-
culosis patient who was not generating antibody for Eis. None
of the ﬁve PPD-positive healthy control sera tested gave pos-
itive reactions (lane 6).
DISCUSSION
It is unlikely that the prevention, control, and ultimate erad-
ication of tuberculosis will be achieved without better methods
of diagnosis, treatment, and vaccination. To this end, the
search continues for virulence factors of M. tuberculosis that
might enable it to survive in the macrophage. One such poten-
tial virulence factor is the Eis protein (56). The work presented
here was aimed at establishing the subcellular location of Eis as
a ﬁrst step in elucidating its function.
It was ﬁrst critical to show that M. tuberculosis produces the
Eis protein, as the previous study regarding eis dealt with the
expression of the gene in M. smegmatis only (56). Eis is indeed
produced in M. tuberculosis, where it has the same N terminus
as in M. smegmatis(p69). Examination of the predicted amino
acid sequence of Eis with appropriate computer programs pre-
dicted that the Eis protein would be mainly hydrophilic, with
possibly one or two transmembrane regions in its N terminus,
and that it would not contain a secretion signal sequence.
Two procedures were used in the subcellular localization
studies: differential centrifugation and detergent-phase parti-
tioning. In both techniques, it was essential to use monoclonal
antibodies speciﬁc for M. tuberculosis antigens known to be
associated with particular subcellular fractions to establish the
cleanness of separation of the various cellular components.
One such antibody was speciﬁc for a-crystallin, which was

with whole cells removed, was subjected to ultracentrifugation. Both the supernatant and the insoluble pellet were subjected to TX-114 partitioning

and the Eis protein (D). Lanes: SA, supernatant aqueous phase; SD, supernatant detergent phase; IA, insoluble pellet aqueous phase; ID, insoluble
pellet detergent phase; WL, whole-cell lysate not subjected to TX-114 partitioning. Each lane contained 100 mg of total protein.

designated a cytoplasmic antigen. The actual subcellular loca-
tion of a-crystallin in M. tuberculosis is unknown, although it
has been proposed by several groups to reside in the cell
envelope and outside the bacillus (16, 39). Others, however,
have used TX-114-phase partitioning to show that the protein
resides in the cytoplasmic fraction (62). Chang et al. (11)
showed that the protein is capable of functioning as a multi-
subunit complex of 149 6 6 kDa. Since reports of the protein
as being cell wall associated are largely based on observations
of the protein pelleting at 100,000 3 g, it is possible the pro-
tein’s appearance in the cell periphery is due to the large mass
of the oligomeric state of the protein. Claims that the a-crys-
tallin homolog is secreted by M. tuberculosis should be evalu-
ated with caution since the protein is abundantly expressed in
older organisms (62) and surface association or release into the
environment could be due to older bacilli autolysing in mixed
cultures. We found that a-crystallin is produced in the mid-
logrithmic phase of growth and that at this stage the protein
cannot be detected in the cell envelope or culture supernatant.
Another control antibody used in the subcellular localization
studies was speciﬁc for the 38-kDa lipoprotein. Immunogold
labeling showed this antigen is localized to the cell surface of
M. tuberculosis (24). Ortalo-Magne´ et al. (46) obtained subcel-
lular fractionation results for the 38-kDa protein similar to
those presented here in Fig. 5, with the antigen found in the
cytosol, on the cell surface, and in 7-day culture ﬁltrates.
Young and Garbe (61) found TX-114 detergent-phase parti-
tioning of the 38-kDa protein similar as to that shown in Fig. 6.
Unlike Eis, the 38-kDa protein contains a lipoprotein consen-
sus sequence and is believed to attach to the cell envelope via
acylation to lipids (22, 32). Antibody speciﬁc for LAM, an
abundant cell wall component, was used as an additional con-
trol for cell surface association. Like the 38-kDa protein, the
45-kDa antigen of M. tuberculosis contains a typical N-terminal
signal sequence used for translocation across the plasma mem-
brane by the Sec-dependent pathway (38). However, the 45-
kDa protein does not form an acyl bond with the cell surface
FIG. 7. Detection of the Eis protein in M. tuberculosis culture supernatants. Aliquots from M. tuberculosis H37Ra GAS liquid cultures were
recovered at various time points, and a portion was removed for viable plate count determinations. The remaining samples were centrifuged to
remove cells, and the supernatant was passed through 0.22-mm-pore-size ﬁlters and concentrated 100-fold before being subjected to Western blot
analysis with antibodies speciﬁc for 45-kDa glycoprotein (A), a-crystallin (B), 38-kDa lipoprotein (C), and Eis (D). Results of Western blots are
shown as insets and represent CFPs collected on the indicated days. Densitometry readings were assigned arbitrary IDV units and were graphed
(boxes) and compared to bacterial numbers (CFU per milliliter) (diamonds) during culture growth.

culosis patients. Electropuriﬁed Eis was analyzed by Western blotting
using rabbit anti-Eis antibody (lane 2) or representative sera from
tuberculosis patients (lanes 3 to 5). Prestained MW standards are
shown in lane 1. Lane 3 is representative of patient serum which did
not react with Eis, while lanes 4 and 5 are representative patient sera
which demonstrate positive reactions to Eis. Lane 6 is a representative

and is readily released into the culture supernatant, as is evi-
dent in Fig. 5 and 7.
The fractionation studies described here suggest that Eis
appears primarily in the cytoplasm and in modest amounts in
the cell envelope and in the culture supernatant. This pattern
is very similar to the subcellular distribution of L-alanine de-
hydrogenase, another reported M. tuberculosis CFP protein
that lacks a signal sequence (46). Eis lacks an N-terminal
lipoprotein consensus element but it does appear to interact
with the cell envelope, as shown in Fig. 5 and by its ability to
exist in the detergent phase (Fig. 6) despite its hydrophilic
appearance.
It was interesting to test for glycosylation of Eis protein since
its cellular localization pattern is similar to the glycosylated 19-
and 38-kDa lipoproteins. Also, Eis protein is found in the CFP
fraction of M. tuberculosis which has been shown to contain as
many as 21 individual glycoproteins (8). Traditionally glycop-
roteins of mycobacteria have been identiﬁed using Western
blot analysis with peroxidase-conjugated concanavalin A as the
probe (23, 26). An alternative method was use of GelCode
Glycoprotein stain (Pierce), which speciﬁcally stains for the
carbohydrate moieties on the 45-kDa glycoprotein of M. tuber-
culosis. Eis protein does not appear to be glycosylated, as
tested by this staining procedure. This is not surprising because
most of the glycosylated CFPs of M. tuberculosis have typical
N-terminal sequences involved in Sec-dependent transloca-
tion, which Eis does not contain.
The lack of an N-terminal secretion sequence raises the
question of how Eis appears in the CFP fraction in the absence
of autolysis. Almost nothing is known about how M. tubercu-
losis proteins that lack a signal sequence are secreted. Often
these proteins are normally cytosolic enzymes (58). Like the
Eis protein, GroES lacks a signal sequence but has been found
in the culture ﬁltrate as described previously (57). The poten-
tial biological signiﬁcance of secreted or exported proteins
from M. tuberculosis is that these proteins may play a role in
bacterial pathogenesis by directly interacting with the host. The
Erp protein is exported by M. tuberculosis. An erp mutant is
signiﬁcantly impaired for survival in macrophages and in im-
munocompetent mice (4). Like the Eis protein, Erp has no
homology to proteins of known function, and its mode of
action remains unclear.
The eis gene has been identiﬁed only in M. tuberculosis and
in M. bovis BCG (56), and so antibodies to its protein product
might prove useful in the development of a serological diag-
nosis of tuberculosis infections. Evidence presented here
shows that 40% of sera from patients with tuberculosis gener-
ated antibody to Eis, whereas none of the sera from ﬁve PPD-
positive individuals did. A histidine-tagged translation fusion
of Eis has been puriﬁed by nickel afﬁnity chromatography, and
afﬁnity-puriﬁed His-tagged Eis will be used in enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assays to test a large battery of pulmonary and
miliary tuberculosis patient sera for Eis-speciﬁc antibody.
It is not claimed that Eis is a secreted protein, only that it
may be released from intact M. tuberculosis cells. This possi-
bility will be investigated by use of a secretion reporter system.
The use of alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) translational fusions
in studying M. tuberculosis secreted proteins is limited to use
with surrogate hosts such as M. smegmatis which may differ in
its secretory methods. However, Staphylococcus aureus nucle-
ase fusions have been shown by Downing et al. to identify
proteins secreted directly from M. tuberculosis (18). Immuno-
gold staining of M. tuberculosis for Eis will be done to verify
that the protein is truly surface associated. An additional test
to determine if Eis is speciﬁcally exported to the culture ﬁltrate
rather than by autolysis will be to compare supernatant protein
proﬁles with those of whole cell pellets, a technique employed
by Vanet and Labique (55).
