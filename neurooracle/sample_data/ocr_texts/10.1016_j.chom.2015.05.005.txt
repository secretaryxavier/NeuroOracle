Summary
Activation of the DNA-dependent cytosolic surveillance pathway in response to Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis infection stimulates ubiquitin-dependent autophagy and inflammatory cytokine 
production, and plays an important role in host defense against M. tuberculosis. However, the 
identity of the host sensor for M. tuberculosis DNA is unknown. Here we show that M. 
tuberculosis activated cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) 
synthase (cGAS) in macrophages to produce cGAMP, a second messenger that activates the 
adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to induce type I interferons and other 
cytokines. cGAS localized with M. tuberculosis in mouse and human cells and in human 
tuberculosis lesions. Knockdown or knockout of cGAS in human or mouse macrophages blocked

cytokine production and induction of autophagy. Mice deficient in cGAS were more susceptible to 
lethality caused by infection with M. tuberculosis. These results demonstrate that cGAS is a vital 
innate immune sensor of M. tuberculosis infection.
Introduction
We recently identified the cytosolic DNA sensor cyclic guanosine monophosphate–
adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) as the primary trigger for production 
of type I interferons and other cytokines in the setting of viral infections including herpes 
simplex virus type 1, vaccinia virus and HIV (Gao et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Sun et al., 
2013). When cGAS binds DNA, it is activated to synthesize cGAMP from adenosine 
triphosphate (ATP) and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (Wu et al., 2013). cGAMP then binds 
and activates the endoplasmic reticulum protein STING, which in turn activates the protein 
kinases IκB kinase (IKK) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). IKK and TBK1 then 
stimulate nuclear translocation of nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB) (Abe and Barber, 2014) and 
interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (Liu et al., 2015) to induce transcription of type-I 
interferons (e.g., IFNβ) and other cytokines (Cai et al., 2014). While the induction of type-I 
interferons is critical for immune defense against viral infections (Stetson and Medzhitov, 
2006), some bacterial pathogens such as M. tuberculosis and Listeria monocytogenes exploit 
the type-I interferon pathway for their own advantage (Eshleman and Lenz, 2014).
In addition to initiating a signaling cascade leading to IFNβ production, cytosolic DNA is 
also vital for autophagy induction. Cytosolic DNA can activate a STING-dependent 
pathway for ubiquitin-dependent autophagy induction (Watson et al., 2012) but also a 
STING-independent autophagy pathway through dissociation of the negative regulator 
Rubicon from Beclin 1 (Liang et al., 2014). The DNA-triggered induction of autophagy is 
important for the host defense against bacterial infections. Thus, in the context of bacterial 
infections, it is important to determine whether the activation of the cytosolic DNA 
surveillance pathway (CSP), which induces both autophagy and interferons, is protective or 
detrimental to the host.
Despite being considered a classic intraphagosomal pathogen, M. tuberculosis can rarely be 
found residing in the macrophage cytoplasm (van der Wel et al., 2007) where M. 
tuberculosis pathogen associated molecular patterns can interact with host sensors. M. 
tuberculosis also activates the cytosolic DNA surveillance pathway via a mechanism 
requiring phagosome disruption by the mycobacterial protein secretion system ESX-1 
(Manzanillo et al., 2012) and the virulence factors ESAT-6 and CFP-10 (De Leon et al., 
2012; Simeone et al., 2012). Mycobacterial DNA then escapes into the cytoplasm to activate 
cytokine production in a STING-, TBK-1- and IRF-3-dependent manner (Manzanillo et al., 
2012). Although M. tuberculosis DNA activates the CSP to induce IRF-3 dependent 
cytokine production including IFNβ (Manzanillo et al., 2012) as well as autophagy 
induction, the identity of the host sensor for M. tuberculosis DNA is not known. Because the 
detection of M. tuberculosis infection by macrophages is so vital to the innate immune 
response (Stamm et al., 2015), we sought to identify the receptor for M. tuberculosis DNA 
and determine its role in the host response to infection.

Results
M. tuberculosis induces cGAS in human macrophages and during active tuberculosis
To first test if cGAS is expressed during M. tuberculosis infection, we queried the GEO 
database and found that during mouse infection (Kang et al., 2011), cGAS is induced in the 
lungs of infected mice (Fig. S1, related to Fig. 1). We next infected the human THP-1 
macrophage cell line with M. tuberculosis and measured cGAS mRNA by quantitative PCR. 
We found that cGAS is upregulated 2 fold by 6 h after infection and 5 fold after 24 h (Fig. 
1A). We also determined if cGAS protein is induced in human macrophages by infecting 
THP-1 cells with M. tuberculosis and measuring cGAS accumulation by western blot (Fig. 
1B) and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1C). We observed that M. tuberculosis 
infection upregulated cGAS in human macrophages 24 h after infection (Fig. 1B, C). cGAS 
puncta occurred adjacent to intracellular mycobacteria and in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1C). 
Quantification of the degree of colocalization revealed that ~30% of intracellular M. 
tuberculosis colocalized with cGAS (Fig. 1D). We next asked if cGAS is expressed in 
human tuberculosis lesions by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1E; Fig. S2, related to Fig. 1) 
and immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1F) and found that cGAS was expressed 
diffusely in lung biopsies obtained from patients with human tuberculosis. By 
immunofluorescence we observed a punctate staining pattern similar to our observations in 
THP-1 cells (Fig. 1F) with occasional colocalization of M. tuberculosis with cGAS (Fig. 
1F). Taken together, M. tuberculosis infection is sufficient to induce cGAS in macrophages 
and the cGAS protein is expressed in human tuberculous lesions.
cGAS is required for IFNβ production by human and mouse macrophages infected with M. 
tuberculosis
Since cGAS induces IFNβ in response to viral DNA (Gao et al., 2013; Li et al., 2013; Sun et 
al., 2013), and M. tuberculosis releases its DNA into the macrophage cytoplasm (Manzanillo 
et al., 2012; Watson et al., 2012), we asked if cGAS is required for M. tuberculosis to induce 
IFNβ and other cytokines using THP-1 cells stably expressing shRNA against cGAS or 
STING (Sun et al., 2013) (Fig. S3, related to Fig. 2). M. tuberculosis induced IFNβ 
transcription in a manner that depended on the multiplicity of infection (MOI; Fig. 2A). 
Knockdown of cGAS significantly reduced the induction of IFNβ (Fig. 2A) and the 
chemokine CXCL10 (Fig. 2B) by M. tuberculosis. Likewise, STING knockdown in THP-1 
cells blocked IFNβ expression (Fig. 2A), as has been recently reported (Manzanillo et al., 
2012). Knockdown of STING or cGAS had no effect on transcription of an NFκB-
dependent cytokine, TNFα (Fig. 2C), suggesting that other ligands in M. tuberculosis may 
activate NF-κB through a cGAS-independent pathway. To obtain definitive genetic evidence 
for cGAS’s role in sensing M. tuberculosis infection in macrophages, we infected mouse 
bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) deficient in cGAS or STING and measured 
IFNβ, CXCL-10, and TNFα by quantitative PCR. As in THP1 cells, IFNβ expression was 
MOI dependent (Fig. 2D) and both cGAS and STING were required for IFNβ and CXCL-10 
but not TNFα transcription (Fig. 2D–F). Thus, we conclude that cGAS is essential for 
inducing IFNβ in response to M. tuberculosis infection in both human and mouse 
macrophages.

Another organism that can activate the CSP is Listeria monocytogenes. Infection of THP-1 
cells with L. monocytogenes resulted in IFNβ induction in a cGAS and STING dependent 
manner (Fig. S3 related to Fig. 2), indicating a conserved role for cGAS in detecting 
cytoplasmic bacterial DNA. However, in contrast to THP-1 cells, IFNβ and CXCL-10 
induction by L. monocytogenes in mouse macrophages was cGAS-independent but STING-
dependent (Fig. S3 related to Fig. 2), consistent with a role for the bacterial secretion of 
cyclic di-AMP, a direct STING ligand (Hansen et al., 2014; Woodward et al., 2010). Thus, it 
appears that cytosolic bacterial DNA plays a dominant role in IFNβ induction in THP1 cells, 
whereas both the DNA sensing pathway and bacterial c-di-AMP are important in activating 
STING in the mouse macrophages. Infection with another Gram-positive bacterium reported 
to induce IFNβ via secretion of DNA, Streptococcus pyogenes (Gratz et al., 2011), 
demonstrated an intermediate phenotype as IFNβ and CXCL-10 were undetectable in 
STINGgt/gt BMDM and significantly reduced in BMDM lacking cGAS (Fig. S3 related to 
Fig. 2). As above, induction of the NFκB-dependent cytokine IL-1β was independent of 
cGAS and STING (Fig. S3 related to Fig. 2).
cGAMP is produced during M. tuberculosis infection in a cGAS and ESX-1 dependent 
manner
To demonstrate that the cGAS product cGAMP is produced during M. tuberculosis 
infection, we developed and utilized a sensitive mass spectrometry assay to measure 
cGAMP levels in M. tuberculosis-infected mouse BMDMs. This assay utilizes a heavy 
isotope 13C1015N5-labeled cGAMP internal standard to quantify the absolute amounts of 
endogenous unlabeled cGAMP in cell lysates. We first determined a time course of cGAMP 
production and found that in wild type BMDMs cGAMP peaked at 8 h after infection with 
wild type M. tuberculosis (Fig. 2G). However, infection with an M. tuberculosis ΔeccD 
mutant, a critical component of the ESX-1 secretion machine that fails to disrupt the 
phagosomal membrane and release mycobacterial DNA (Manzanillo et al., 2012; Stanley et 
al., 2007), did not induce cGAMP production in macrophages (Fig. 2G). Thus, phagosomal 
rupture via ESX-1 and release of mycobacterial DNA into the cytoplasm is necessary to 
induce cGAMP production. Next, we quantitated cGAMP in M. tuberculosis-infected 
BMDM from WT and cGAS−/− (Gao et al., 2013) mice as well as the STING golden ticket 
mutant mice (STINGgt/gt), which have a loss of expression of STING (Sauer et al., 2011). M. 
tuberculosis induced cGAMP production in WT and STINGgt/gt BMDM at a level of 
approximately 6000 molecules per cell, but cGAS deficient macrophages produced no 
detectable cGAMP (Fig. 2H). Thus, cGAS is required for cGAMP production in M. 
tuberculosis-infected macrophages.
cGAS is required for LC3 association with M. tuberculosis
Sensing of cytosolic DNA by M. tuberculosis induces recruitment of the autophagy markers 
LC3, NDP52, p62 and ubiquitination of M. tuberculosis containing organelles (Manzanillo 
et al., 2013; Manzanillo et al., 2012; Watson et al., 2012); the autophagy induction mediates 
early inhibition of bacterial growth (Watson et al., 2012). LC3 is a protein component of 
both autophagy and LC3-associated phagocytosis that marks both classic double membrane 
enveloped autophagosomes and single membrane enveloped phagosomes (Green and 
Levine, 2014). Such LC3 marked organelles are targeted to lysosomes for degradation of

intracompartmental contents. We first asked if STING or cGAS is required for induction of 
general autophagy by starvation, and found that neither STING nor cGAS deficiency 
prevented LC3 starvation induced LC3-puncta formation (Fig. 3A,B). To determine if cGAS 
is necessary to regulate association of M. tuberculosis with LC3 we transduced mouse 
BMDMs with a lentivirus to express GFP-LC3 and infected them with mCherry-expressing 
M. tuberculosis. Absence of STING or cGAS significantly reduced but did not eliminate the 
association of GFP-LC3 with mCherry-M. tuberculosis (Fig. 3C,D). Thus, we conclude that 
cGAS is required for early recruitment of LC3, a marker of autophagy and LC3-associated 
phagocytosis, during M. tuberculosis infection of macrophages.
cGAS is required for early control of M. tuberculosis replication by macrophages
Since activation of the CSP provides early protection from M. tuberculosis infection in 
macrophages (Watson et al., 2012), we determined the role of cGAS in controlling 
intracellular replication of M. tuberculosis. We infected BMDM deficient in either STING or 
cGAS, and quantified intracellular mycobacterial growth. While all macrophages ingested 
bacteria equally at time zero (Fig. 4A), both STING and cGAS deficient BMDM were more 
permissive for M. tuberculosis growth (Fig. 4A). However, both cGAS and STING deficient 
macrophages were able to control intracellular M. tuberculosis growth equally at 3 and 7 
days after infection (data not shown), suggesting that additional antimicrobial mechanisms 
are able to compensate in macrophages later in the course of infection. Because cGAS 
produces the cyclic dinucleotide cGAMP, and some cyclic dinucleotides such as cyclic di-
AMP and cyclic di-GMP can impact bacteria directly (Li and He, 2012; Witte et al., 2013), 
we tested if cGAMP alone could inhibit M. tuberculosis growth in vitro, and found no effect 
of cGAMP at a concentration as high as 10 µM (Fig. S4, related to Fig. 4). Thus, cGAS 
signaling plays a role in early events controlling M. tuberculosis infection in human 
macrophages.
cGAS is protective in mice chronically infected with M. tuberculosis
To test the functional role of DNA sensing mediated by cGAS and STING during M. 
tuberculosis infection, we performed a low-dose aerosol infection of cGAS−/−, STINGgt/gt 
and congenic C57Bl/6 mice. Of note, to date no differences in survival have been observed 
in aged cGAS−/− uninfected mice compared to control wild type littermates (data not 
shown). All mice were infected with approximately 200 colony-forming units (CFU) via 
aerosol. CFUs in lung (Fig. 4B), liver, and spleen (Fig. S5, related to Fig. 4) were similar 
among the different genotypes at days 21 and 42 after infection as well as at the time of 
death (Fig. S4, related to Fig. 4). We observed an ~0.7 log decrease in all mouse groups 
from day 21 to day 42, which is consistent with multiple prior studies in similarly performed 
aerosol challenge models (Converse et al., 2009; Darwin and Nathan, 2005; Manzanillo et 
al., 2012). Gross inflammation as assessed by pathology at days 21 and 42 and inflammatory 
cytokines such as IFN-γ, IL-1β, IL-12, and TNF-α were also similar (Fig. S4, related to Fig. 
4). IFNβ was reduced about 2-fold in the serum of cGAS deficient mice compared to wild 
type, but this result was not statistically significant (Fig. S4, related to Fig. 4). However, M. 
tuberculosis-infected cGAS−/− mice succumbed to infection significantly earlier than their 
wild type or STING deficient counterparts (Fig. 4C, Fig. S4 related to Fig. 4), suggesting a 
vital role for cGAS in chronic tuberculosis infection.

Discussion
Here we show that cGAS plays an important role in inducing IFNβ, autophagy and 
macrophage antimicrobial activity during M. tuberculosis infection in vitro, as well as in 
resistance to chronic tuberculosis in vivo. The cGAS product cGAMP is detected in M. 
tuberculosis infected macrophages only when the phagosome is ruptured by the activity of 
the M. tuberculosis ESX-1 system and when cGAS is expressed. cGAS is expressed in 
mouse and human macrophages, and in primary human tuberculous lesions, consistent with 
its important role in regulating the innate immune response during tuberculosis.
M. tuberculosis infection induced upregulation of cGAS as visualized by punctate 
cytoplasmic staining within infected cells. Likewise, Wassermann et al. (Wassermann et al., 
2015) also found punctate cGAS staining during M. tuberculosis infection. Transfection of 
DNA is known to induce similar punctate staining, and transfected DNA can be colocalized 
with cGAS in many of these areas of cGAS aggregation (Sun et al., 2013). cGAS has 
recently been found to be a key interferon stimulated gene (ISG) (Schoggins et al., 2014), 
and increased cGAS staining during M. tuberculosis infection is also visualized in adjacent 
non-infected cells likely due to paracrine type I interferon signaling (Stetson and Medzhitov, 
2006). Additionally, cGAMP produced in one cell can be transferred via gap junctions to 
neighboring cells where it activates STING and the production of type I interferon (Ablasser 
et al., 2013). This suggests that another mechanism for the upregulation of ISGs such as 
IFNβ and cGAS in uninfected cells may be transfer of cGAMP from M. tuberculosis infected 
cells to adjacent cells, and indeed Wassermann et al. (Wassermann et al., 2015) 
demonstrated that during M. tuberculosis infection cGAMP can translocate between cells 
via connexin channels to induce IFNβ. Furthermore, in vivo, IFNβ may also be induced in 
macrophages and other cells in a TLR4-dependent manner (Liu et al., 2015).
Some intracellular pathogens such as L. monocytogenes and C. trachomatis secrete their 
own cyclic nucleotides such as c-di-AMP into the host cytoplasm, thus bypassing cGAS 
activation to directly trigger STING-dependent IFNβ production (Woodward et al., 2010). 
We found that L. monocytogenes could induce IFNβ in the absence of cGAS in mouse 
BMDM but not in human THP-1 cells, suggesting a role for L. monocytogenes secreted c-di-
AMP in mouse but not human cells. Hansen et al. recently reported similar results using 
RNAi of cGAS (Hansen et al., 2014). It is not clear whether listeria produces significant 
levels of c-di-AMP to stimulate IFNβ in THP1 cells.
Whether M. tuberculosis produces any cyclic di-nucleotide is a subject of debate. In one 
study, deletion of the M. tuberculosis di-adenylate cyclase gene disA (Rv3586) had no effect 
on IFNβ production during M. tuberculosis infection of BMDMs (Manzanillo et al., 2012). 
However in another recent study, deletion of disA reduced IFNβ production four-fold 
whereas deletion of the diadenylate cyclic di-AMP phosphodiesterase gene (cnpB) increased 
IFNβ production 10-fold during BMDM infection (Yang et al., 2014). In our hands, both 
shRNA mediated depletion and genetic ablation of cGAS prevented IFNβ expression by 
macrophages, except at very high MOI. Likewise, both Watson et al. (Watson et al., 2015) 
and Wassermann et al. (Wassermann et al, 2015) also failed to detect a cGAS-independent 
induction of interferon-dependent genes, suggesting that if c-di-AMP is indeed secreted by

M. tuberculosis, it plays only a minor role compared to mycobacterial dsDNA in triggering 
IFNβ production. Since STING can respond to a variety of cyclic di-nucleotides, an 
alternative explanation for the induction of a residual amount of IFNβ in cGAS deficient 
BMDM at high MOI would be the action of an accessory host enzyme producing cyclic 
dinucleotides in response to bacterial infection.
Identification of cGAS in human tuberculosis lesions and cGAMP in infected macrophages 
provides a possible explanation for the interferon driven transcriptional signature in human 
tuberculosis (Berry et al., 2010). Emerging data suggests that successful outcomes in human 
tuberculosis occur when there is an appropriate balance between bacterial death and 
inflammation (BoseDasgupta and Pieters, 2014; Tobin et al., 2012). To that end, modulating 
cGAS activity could be a productive approach to host-directed therapy.
We observed two competing roles for cGAS in regulating host defense against M. 
tuberculosis in macrophages, namely, inducing type I interferon production and facilitating 
early control of intracellular replication through the induction of autophagy. Thus, the 
increased sensitivity of cGAS−/− mice to M. tuberculosis–induced lethality may reflect an 
imbalance between decreases in detrimental IFNβ signaling (Teles et al., 2013) and 
activation of protective autophagy/LC3-associated phagocytosis. Studies of M. tuberculosis 
infection of IRF-3- (Manzanillo et al., 2012) or Parkin-deficient mice (Manzanillo et al., 
2013) support this hypothesis. IRF-3 deficiency prevents IFNβ production during M. 
tuberculosis infection (Manzanillo et al., 2012), though autophagic targeting is not affected 
(Watson et al., 2012). Notably, IRF-3 mutant mice do not have a defect in bacterial growth 
in M. tuberculosis infected macrophages in vitro or a profound difference in bacterial 
growth compared to control mice during low dose aerosol infection, yet they are 
dramatically protected from mortality during M. tuberculosis infection (Manzanillo et al., 
2012), which may reflect IRF-3’s central role as signaling hub (Liu et al., 2015). In contrast, 
Parkin deficient mice are defective in M. tuberculosis induced autophagy but have no type I 
interferon defect, and M. tuberculosis infected Parkin deficient mice succumb earlier to 
infection associated with a modest increase in CFU burden (Manzanillo et al., 2013). In that 
regard, cGAS-deficient mice had defective LC3 recruitment to M. tuberculosis containing 
organelles and reduced intracellular killing ability in BMDMs, which might explain why 
they were more susceptible to chronic infection. Consistent with this notion, Atg5-deficient 
mice are also more susceptible to lethality induced by M. tuberculosis infection (Castillo et 
al., 2012; Watson et al., 2012), though the early mortality may in part be explained by a 
hyperinflammatory state in these mice (Castillo et al., 2012; Watson et al., 2012).
Given the shared roles of cGAS and STING in inducing IFNβ and recruiting LC3 to M. 
tuberculosis containing organelles, it was unexpected that cGAS−/− mice would be more 
susceptible than STINGgt/gt mice to M. tuberculosis infection. In a parallel study, Watson et 
al. (Watson et al., 2015) did not find a mortality defect when comparing wild type and 
cGAS−/− mice also infected with ~200 CFU of the M. tuberculosis Erdman strain via 
aerosol. Of note, whereas the Watson et al. survival study lasted only 100 days, in our hands 
in two independent experiments cGAS−/− mice did not significantly succumb to disease until 
after 100 days. Consistent with the fact that wild type C57BL/6 mice are relatively resistant

to aerosol M. tuberculosis infection (Manzanillo et al., 2012; Medina and North, 1998), wild 
type mice did not start to succumb until about 175 days after infection.
Several recent studies have emerged highlighting unique STING independent functions for 
cGAS, particularly in the induction of autophagy. cGAS, independent of its catalytic 
activity, interacts directly with the autophagy protein Beclin-1 to block its association with 
the negative regulator Rubicon (Liang et al., 2014). Thus, we speculate that the increased 
susceptibility of cGAS−/− mice to tuberculosis may reflect in vivo effects on cGAS mediated 
autophagy. Indeed, autophagy is not only important for control of intracellular replication of 
mycobacteria (Castillo et al., 2012), but also for antigen presentation (Deretic et al., 2013), 
suggesting that during a long-term infection, cGAS deficiency may impact the ability of 
mice to develop an appropriate adaptive immune response. Taken together, we propose that 
cGAS is a central signaling hub that is vital for immunity against viruses and bacteria.
Experimental Procedures
Strains and media
The Erdman wild type strain of M. tuberculosis was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 medium or 
on Middlebrook 7H11 agar plates supplemented with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-
catalase. Tween-80 was added to liquid medium to a final concentration of 0.05%
Mice and macrophages
cGAS−/− mice (Li et al., 2013) were generated and maintained at UTSW. A detailed 
description of their ontogeny is available in the Supplementary methods and online (Li et al., 
2013). STINGgt/g (Sauer et al., 2011) mice purchased from Jackson lab were bred at UTSW. 
Wild type C57BL/6 mice were bred in the same facility and all mice were housed in specific 
pathogen-free conditions. All experiments were carried out according to experimental 
protocols approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas.
Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence of human specimens
Paraffin embedded specimens were deparaffinized in xylene, subjected to heat mediated 
antigen-retrieval in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0), permeabilized in 0.2% Triton-100 
(Sigma) and blocked in 5% donkey sera. For immunohistochemistry, human sections were 
stained with rabbit anti-C6orf150 antibody (cGAS; 1:100, Abcam) or rabbit polyclonal IgG 
(1:100, Abcam). HRP conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Jackson 
Immunochemicals and used at 1:250. Staining was amplified with AB reagent (Vecta-stain) 
and detected using DAB reagent (Thermo Scientific). Images were acquired using a Zeiss 
Axioplan 2 microscope. For immunofluorescence in THP-1 cells and human tissue, cGAS 
was identified using rabbit anti-MB21D1 antibody (Sigma 1:100) and an HRP conjugated 
donkey anti-rabbit secondary (1:100, Jackson Immunochemicals) followed by amplification 
with tyramide (1:50, Perkin Elmer). M. tuberculosis was identified using guinea pig anti-M. 
tuberculosis (1:25, BEI Resources, NR-13818) and an Alexa 488 conjugated donkey anti-
guinea pig secondary (1:100, Jackson Immunochemicals). Hoechst stain was used to 
visualize nuclei. Sections were mounted using Prolong Gold, allowed to cure for 24 hours in

the dark, and then visualized. Images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP5 confocal 
microscope. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of 
Texas Southwestern Medical Center.
In vitro M. tuberculosis infections
For macrophage infections, liquid M. tuberculosis cultures were washed twice with PBS, 
resuspended in PBS and centrifuged to remove clumps. The supernatant was sonicated twice 
to generate a single cell suspension. Bacteria were resuspended in RPMI media plus 10% 
horse serum. Bacterial dilutions or plain media for uninfected controls were added to the 
macrophages and plates centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1500 RPM to initiate infection. 
Macrophages were then washed with PBS and fresh macrophage media applied.
cGAMP extraction and quantification
cGAMP was measured in TB- or mock-infected BMDMs as we recently described 
(Rongvaux et al., In Press). Briefly, cells were lysed in cold 80% methanol/2% acetic acid 
solution, into which 13C1015N5-labeled cGAMP internal standard was immediately 
supplemented. After a short incubation on ice, insoluble debris was cleared by 
centrifugation, and extracted twice in 2% acetic acid. cGAMP was enriched by solid phase 
extraction using HyperSep Aminopropyl SPE Columns (Thermo Scientific), and eluted in 
4% ammonium hydroxide/80% methanol. The eluents were vacuum-dried, resuspended in 
LC/MS-grade water, cleared by centrifugation, and transferred to autosampler vials. 
Metabolite extracts were separated by hydrophilic chromatography (HILIC) with Xbridge 
Amide phase (3.5 µm, 3.5 mm ID × 100 mm L, Waters) on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 Rapid 
Separation Liquid Chromatography system (Thermo Scientific). Mobile phase A was 20 
mM ammonium bicarbonate with 20 mM ammonium hydroxide in water, and mobile phase 
B acetonitrile. The separation ran at a flow of 400 µL/min for the first 14.5 min and 800 
µL/min for the remaining 8.5 min, through the following gradient: 0 min 85% B, 3 min 85% 
B, 10 min 2% B, 14 min 2% B, 14.5 min 85% B and 23 min 85% B.
The HILIC eluent was sprayed online into a TSQ Quantiva triple quadruple mass 
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific), which performed multiple reaction monitoring 
experiments for detecting cGAMP and the internal standard. The technical details of the data 
acquisition and analysis were recently described (Rongvaux et al. Cell. 2014), with the 
exception that the spray was at default setting for 400 µL/min, and that the scan dwell time 
was 50 ms.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism. For in vitro studies, one-tailed 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests were used for experiments with multiple comparisons 
using Dunnett’s test. For experiments with single comparisons, two-tailed unpaired student’s 
t-test was used. For experiments containing samples with non-normal distributions such as 
cytokine and in vivo CFU measurements, the Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test was used. 
The Gehan-Breslow-Wilcoxon test was used to analyze survival studies.
