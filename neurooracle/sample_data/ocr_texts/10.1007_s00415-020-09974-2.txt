Abstract
Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, affecting millions of people. However,
clinical research on its neurological manifestations is thus far limited. In this study, we aimed to systematically collect and
investigate the clinical manifestations and evidence of neurological involvement in COVID-19.
Methods Three medical (Medline, Embase, and Scopus) and two preprints (BioRxiv and MedRxiv) databases were system-
atically searched for all published articles on neurological involvement in COVID-19 since the outbreak. All included studies
were systematically reviewed, and selected clinical data were collected for meta-analysis via random-effects.
Results A total of 41 articles were eligible and included in this review, showing a wide spectrum of neurological manifesta-
tions in COVID-19. The meta-analysis for unspecific neurological symptoms revealed that the most common manifestations
were fatigue (33.2% [23.1-43.3]), anorexia (30.0% [23.2—36.9]), dyspnea/shortness of breath (26.9% [19.2-34.6]), and
malaise (26.7% [13.3-40.1]). The common specific neurological symptoms included olfactory (35.7—85.6%) and gustatory
(33.3-88.8%) disorders, especially in mild cases. Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute inflammation of the brain, spinal cord,
and meninges were repeatedly reported after COVID-19. Laboratory, electrophysiological, radiological, and pathological
evidence supported neurologic involvement of COVID-19.
Conclusions Neurological manifestations are various and prevalent in COVID-19. Emerging clinical evidence suggests neu-
rological involvement is an important aspect of the disease. The underlying mechanisms can include both direct invasion and
maladaptive inflammatory responses. More studies should be conducted to explore the role of neurological manifestations
in COVID-19 progression and to verify their underlying mechanisms.

2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization
(WHO), has now been confirmed to have originated from
a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavi-
rus (SARS-CoV-2). By May 3rd, 2020, the pandemic had
affected more than 200 countries, with 3,349,786 cases
having been confirmed as COVID-19, including 238,628
deaths (data from COVID-19 Situation Report-104 by the
WHO). The disease in most patients is characterized by
mild to medium fever, dry cough, chest distress or dysp-
nea, with interstitial pneumonia features on chest com-
puted tomography (CT) scan [1, 2]. The main routes of
transmission are respiratory droplets and close contact
transmission. The average of the reproductive number of
COVID-19 is 3.28, based on a summary of 12 related stud-
ies, which is much higher than SARS and Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS) [3].
As knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has accumu-
lated, most researchers have agreed that COVID-19 is
not just a respiratory disease and that it could affect other
systems in human. There have recently been increasing
studies on the neurological involvement of COVID-19,
which could be associated with more severe symptoms
and higher mortality. However, there has been no com-
prehensive review regarding on this topic until now. Here
in this systematic review with meta-analysis, we collected
and analyzed the clinical manifestations and evidence of
neurological involvement in this disease.
Methods
Search strategy and study selection
This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science
and Technology, and the written consent was exempted
because it was a secondary analysis of the published
studies. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we
searched the English literature that demonstrated clinical
manifestations and that provided evidence of neurologi-
cal manifestations in COVID-19, according to the Pre-
ferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses guidelines (PRISMA Checklist in Supplement
materials). Given the novelty of the field, the search was
conducted up to May 3rd, 2020, in two preprint databases
(bioRxiv and medRxiv) and three popular medical data-
bases (PubMed, Embase and Scopus). A combination of
keywords related to COVID-19, neurological manifesta-
tions, neurological diseases and specific symptoms were
used with Boolean operators for more efficient literature
retrieval (search strategy in Supplement materials).

Eligibility criteria
The studies on clinical manifestations and evidence regard-
ing neurological manifestations after COVID-19 were col-
lected using Endnote X9 software (Clarivate Analytics), and
the duplicates were removed accordingly. Case reports, case
series, correspondence with relevant clinical data, and retro-
spective and cross-sectional studies were included for further
analysis and review. The exclusion criteria included (1) clinical
observation with no related neurological symptoms and a lack
of related data; (2) the studies focused on a specific population
(e.g., infants, children, patients with cancer, pregnant women);
(3) repeated research on the same cohort of patients; and (4)
other types of study (e.g., reviews, book chapters). All selected
publications were comprehensively reviewed by two independ-
ent investigators to ensure their eligibility for inclusion in the
review. If any disagreement occurred about eligibility of the
literature, it was resolved by consensus after thoroughly dis-
cussing the publication with a third investigator.
Inclusion criteria, data extraction and quality
evaluation for meta-analysis
Given that the articles reporting specific neurological symp-
toms (e.g., dysgeusia, agnosia) were limited, only articles that
reported unspecific neurological symptoms (e.g., headache,
weakness, respiratory failure) in patients with COVID-19 were
selected for further meta-analysis. The quality assessment
tool for case series studies designed by the National Institutes
of Health (NIH) was applied to evaluate the included stud-
ies in the meta-analysis. For each item, we scored | point for
“yes” and 0 points for “no,” “not available,” “not reported,”
and “cannot determine.” The total score from all nine criteria
(O—-9) was generated accordingly to gauge the overall quality
of the study.

Statistical analysis
Stata (version 15.1) was used to perform a meta-analysis of
single arm studies. The combined prevalence and 95% con-
fidence interval were calculated using the random-effects
model. Egger’s test was performed to assess publication bias in
all literature, and P< 0.05 was considered statistically signifi-
cant. Subgroup analysis was done to discuss the heterogeneity
of the meta-analysis.
Results
After a primary search, a total of 440 publications were
retrieved, including 73 from Pubmed, 133 from Embase, 163
from Scopus, and 71 from medRxiv and bioRxiv. Among

Journal of Neurology (2020) 267:2777-2789
2779
these, 142 were duplicates and were removed accordingly.
We evaluated the eligibility of the remaining 298 papers
according to title, abstract, article type, and full-texts
(Fig. 1). The 11 papers from other resource (e.g., references
list of existing papers) were added. Ultimately, 41 studies
were included for systematic review and meta-analysis,
including 20 studies on unspecific neurological manifesta-
tions [1, 2, 4-21], 20 studies on the specific neurological
symptoms [22-41], and 1 reporting both types of symptoms
[42].
Unspecific neurological symptoms associated
with COVID-19 and meta-analysis
From a clinical aspect and the reported symptoms, headache,
myalgia, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, confusion, anorexia, diz-
ziness, malaise, dyspnea/shortness of breath were regarded
as unspecific symptoms and were included in the subsequent
meta-analysis.
Twenty-one eligible papers that reported unspecific neu-
rological symptoms are summarized in Table 1, among
which 19 (90.5%) were retrospective case series with one
retrospective cohort (4.8%) and 1 prospective case series
(4.8%). Nineteen studies (90.5%) enrolled patients from
China, with the other two from Korea and India, respec-
tively. There were 7 (33.3%) multicenter studies and 12
(57.1%) reports from a single institute. The number of
enrolled patients ranged from 13 to 1099, and the sex ratio
varied from 0.69 to 3.33 (male/female). The quality assess-
ment for the literature is detailed in Supplement Table S1.
We then meta-analyzed the prevalence of the nine
unspecific neurologic COVID-19 manifestations in 3837
patients. For the common neurological manifestations
(the number of the studies > 10 and total cases > 1500),
fatigue (33.2% [23.1—43.3]) and dyspnea/shortness of
breath (26.9% [19.2-34.6]) were the most prevalent symp-
toms, followed by myalgia (16.0% [12.3-19.8]), headache
(9.2% [7.2-11.2]), and nausea/vomiting (5.1% [3.3-6.8]).

Among the neurological manifestations that were reported
sporadically (the number of the studies < 10 and total
cases < 1500), the most common symptoms were anorexia
(30.0% [23.2-36.9]), malaise (26.7% [13.3—40.1]), dizziness
(10.0% [5.9-14.2]), and confusion (5.2% [— 1.7 to 12.2]), in
descending order (Fig. 2). Significant publication bias was
not observed in the common neurological manifestations
including headache, myalgia, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and
dyspnea/shortness of breath (Fig. 2, all p >0.05 by Egger’s
test).
Substantial heterogeneity was observed in most symp-
toms within subgroups (Fig. 2 and Supplement Tables
$2—5). In the subgroup analysis, dyspnea/shortness of breath
was more prevalent in the studies performed in Wuhan, on
elder patients (median or mean age > 47 years), with higher
M/F ratio (M/F ratio > 1.38), and higher percentage of severe
cases (> 15%) (p <0.05). In addition, fatigue was more fre-
quent in the severe cases and studies in Wuhan (p< 0.05),
and younger patients tended to experience more headaches.
No other potential sources of heterogeneity of these five
unspecific neurological manifestations were identified.
Specific neurological symptoms associated
with COVID-19
We retrieved 21 studies regarding the specific neurologi-
cal symptoms and diseases after COVID-19 (summarized
in Table 2), among which 6 (28.6%) studies were case series
and the rest (71.4%) were cases reports. In the six cases
series, two studies focused on a relatively wide spectrum
of neurological manifestations (e.g., central nervous system
[CNS], peripheral nervous system [PNS], neuromuscular
disorders) [36, 42], with the other four focused on olfactory
and gustatory dysfunction [23, 24, 29, 37]. In the 15 case
reports, 5 were associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome

[31-35], 5 focused on neurological inflammation (e.g., mye-

cerebrovascular diseases [27, 38], and the rest on specific
neurological symptoms [25, 40].
Laboratory, electrophysiological, radiological,
and pathological evidence of neurological
manifestations after COVID-19
Eleven papers that demonstrated laboratory, electrophysi-
ological, radiological, and pathological changes after
COVID-19 were distilled from the summarized literature,
including seven on the examination of cerebrospinal fluid
[30, 32, 34-36, 39, 41], three on electroencephalogram [36,
39, 41], two on nerve conduction [32, 34], six on magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans [26, 27, 30, 32, 36, 40], two
on CT images [27, 40], and one post-mortem examination
[25] (summarized in Table 3).
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review with
meta-analysis of more than 41 studies involving approxi-
mately 4700 patients that provides a comprehensive view
of neurological manifestations in COVID-19. In comparison
with previous review and proposal on the topic, both clinical
manifestations and related evidence were demonstrated to
investigate multifaceted mechanisms underlying neurologi-
cal involvement in COVID-19.
After the primary exploration, the neurological mani-
festations in COVID-19 were found to mainly fall into
three categories: (1) neurological diseases comorbid
with COVID-19, in which neurological symptoms occur
prior to the infection that also make patients themselves

Unspecific neurological manifestations are various and
insidious in COVID-19. It has been reported that unspecific
neurological manifestations occurred in the early onset of
the infection and could serve as the primary and only symp-
tom when COVID-19 patients were admitted to the hospital
[32]. Neurologic manifestations were also more prevalent in
the patients with severe disease, which increased the risk of
transmission and could lead to death if not handled properly
and effectively [42]. However, there is a wide symptomatic
spectrum of neurological manifestations in COVID-19, and
it is easy to misdiagnose them during the epidemic due to the
g\ Springer
respiratory nature of the virus. After a systematic explora-
tion of the literature, we found that the headache, myalgia,
fatigue, nausea/vomiting, confusion, anorexia, dizziness,
malaise, and dyspnea/shortness of breath were reported as
unspecific neurological symptoms. Among them, the domi-
nant clinical manifestations were fatigue, dyspnea/shortness
of breath, anorexia, and malaise, which affected approxi-
mately one-third of patients with COVID-19.
Whether dyspnea/shortness of breath is a neurologi-
cal symptom is still a matter of debate. Recently, several
patients with dyspnea in an intense care unit (ICU) subjec-
tively described that active and conscious breath was needed
to maintain a normal breathing rhythm [43]. As we know,

Journal of Neurology (2020) 267:2777-2789
2785
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), an important
SARS-CoV-2 receptor, is found to be expressed in the cardi-
orespiratory center of the medulla together with other brain
regions [44, 45]. Given the high similarity among coronavi-
ruses and the fact that other coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV,
MERS-CoV) could invade the nervous system [46], it is
reasonable to speculate that SARS-CoV-2 virus might play
a role in the dyspnea/shortness of breath via affecting the
respiratory center of the medulla, especially in those patients
with rapid disease progression but without severe respiratory
symptoms. Thus, dyspnea/shortness of breath was included
as one of the neurological manifestations in this review, and
we observed that it was one of most prevalent neurological
symptoms in COVID-19 infection. However, further clinical
and experimental studies should be performed to differenti-
ate the exact cause of dyspnea and to explore its potential
association with neurological involvement.
Specific neurological manifestations and diseases
associated with COVID-19
In this review, we found six case series focused on the spe-
cific neurological manifestations, including CNS-related
symptoms (e.g., impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovas-
cular disease, corticospinal tract signs, ataxia, and seizure),
PNS-related symptoms (e.g., taste impairment, smell impair-
ment, vision impairment, and nerve pain), and musculoskel-
etal injury [23, 24, 29, 36, 37, 42]. Interestingly, olfactory
dysfunction and gustatory disorders were observed 30-80%
in patients with mild COVID-19. Recently, Fodoulian et al.
and Brann et al. had reported that ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2
entry genes were expressed by sustentacular cells in the
human olfactory neuroepithelium [47, 48]. In addition,
bilateral inflammatory response in the olfactory clefts was
observed in a patient with COVID-19 with sudden olfactory
loss but without nasal obstruction by MRI and CT scans,
which suggests the virus might affect olfactory function
via direct invasion of the olfactory neuroepithelium [40].
However, we lack definitive evidence regarding the potential
association between the PNS symptoms and the risk of CNS
infection.
Regarding the neurological diseases, we found that asep-
tic neuroinflammation appeared to be related to COVID-
19, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, Miller Fisher syn-
drome, myelitis, meningitis, and encephalitis [22, 30, 32,
34, 35, 39]. Notably the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
tests of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were negative in all cases.
The mechanism for the neuroinflammation in the patients
with COVID-19 is unclear. However, in a recent report on
a rare condition (hemorrhagic necrotizing encephalopathy)
in COVID-19, the author inferred that the breakdown of
the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by cytokine storm could
be the primary cause of disseminated brain necrosis and
hemorrhage in this case [27]. Together with the increase in
protein levels and immunoglobulin in CSF, we suspect that
both the cytokine storm secondary to the systematic infec-
tion and the overactivation of the immune system might play
a role in this process.
Evidence for neurological involvement of COVID-19
Currently, our knowledge regarding on neurological involve-
ment of COVID-19 is still limited. The definitive evidence
for the invasive behavior of COVID-19 in CNS is mainly
from two neuropathological reports. Paniz-Mondolfi et al.
had reported the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in brain tissue
from post-mortem examination of a COVID-19 patient by
employing a transmission electron microscope. Viral parti-
cles of approximately 80-110 nm, which were pleomorphic
and spherical with distinct stalk-like projections and per-
fectly matched the structural features of SARS-CoV-2, were
spotted in the frontal lobe section of the brain [25]. Notably,
these viral particles were found to be located not only in
the cytoplasmic vacuoles of neuronal cells but also in the
small vesicles of endothelium cells, which suggested this
direct neuroinvasive behavior via hematogenous pathways
might be a leading cause for rapid progression of neurologi-
cal symptoms [25]. In consistence with this finding, SARS-
CoV-2 was also detected in CSF via PCR examinations in a
male patient suffering from consciousness disturbance and
transient generalized seizures, with typical meningitis and
encephalitis characteristics shown on the MRI [30]. Inter-
estingly, this case presented negative PCR result in naso-
pharyngeal swab at the time point, which indicated that
CNS invasion might happen in the early phase of COVID-19
[30]. However, several similar studies had reported negative
findings in the CSF examination, which suggests that direct
neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 is not a universal phenom-
enon for COVID-19 [32, 34]. But the interpretation of these
negative results should be cautious due to the limitation of
PCR examinations, which is currently the most prevalent test
for viral detection. Its low sensitivity in CSF specimen may
lead to repeated negative findings. Thus, more investigations
are needed to further confirm this direct invasive behavior.
The adjuvant evidence for neurological involvement in
COVID-19 includes CSF examination, electrophysiology,
and radiological findings. The characteristic change in CSF
after COVID-19 is the slight increase in cell counts and pro-
tein levels, especially immunoglobulins, which suggests its
inflammatory or infective status [30, 32, 34-36, 39]. For
electrophysiology, two cases presented unspecific altera-
tions, another patient exhibited focal seizure in electroen-
cephalogram [36, 39], and the rest showed delayed nerve
conduction, attenuation of action potential amplitude, and
absent F-Waves, which are associated with the damage to
myelin and axons in Guillain-Barré Syndrome [32, 34]. In
g\ Springer

the radiological examination, MRI and CT scans had been
commonly adopted to search for clues for neurological
disorders after COVID-19, such as inflammation and cer-
ebrovascular dysfunction, which suggest the direct invasion
of SARS-CoV-2. In the patients diagnosed with encepha-
litis, myelitis, meningitis, and Guillain-Barré Syndrome,
enhancement of lesion sites in meninges, brain, spinal cord,
and nerve roots was detectable in MRI and correlated with
individual clinical manifestations [30, 32, 36]. Poyiadji et al.
reported a unique case of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing
encephalopathy associated with COVID-19 and the patient
presented bilaterally hemorrhagic lesions within multiple
brain regions, which implied that the breakdown of the BBB
might serve as an explanation of COVID-19-associated cer-
ebrovascular diseases [27]. In addition, perfusion abnormali-
ties appeared to be prevalent (100%) in the patients with
COVID-19 with severe neurological symptoms and were
not only found in the patients with cerebrovascular disorders
[36].
Potential mechanism underlying the neurological
manifestation in COVID-19
From the limited studies on the neurological involvement of
COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 could impair the nervous system
via two potential pathways: (1) direct invasion of neural tis-
sue and (2) maladaptive inflammatory responses (Fig. 3).
In terms of direct invasion, SARS-CoV-2 could affect the
CNS mainly through the hematogenous and the neuronal
Olfactory Bulb
Fig.3 The potential mechanism underlying the neurological mani-
festation in COVID-19. Based on the current evidence, there are two
routes for the neurological involvement of COVID-19. (1) SARS-
CoV-2 could direct infect nervous system via hematogenous and neu-
g\ Springer
retrograde routes. First, ACE2 was found to be enriched
in the endothelium cells of the CNS. Thus, viruses might
invade nervous systems by infecting the endothelial cells of
the BBB and the blood—CSF barrier in the choroid plexus.
This hypothesis was strongly supported by the study con-
ducted by Paniz-Mondolfi et al. [25]. The authors cap-
tured the viral particles using a cytoplasmic vacuole at the
endothelial neural cell interface in a transmission electron
microscope, which suggests that SARS-CoV-2 could bind
to vascular endothelium, penetrate the BBB, and invade
nervous tissues through hematogenous pathways. However,
some researchers believe that the hematogenous route is not
the only pathway, and that the neuronal retrograde transmis-
sion serves as another potential mechanism. In this route,
SARS-CoV-2 might first invade peripheral nerve terminals
and infect the CNS retrogradely. Previous animal studies on
SARS-CoV and OC43-CoV had suggested the virus could
enter the brain by disruption of the nasal epithelium and lead
to subsequent neuronal dissemination when administered
intranasally [46] [49]. Due to the high similarity among
SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and OC43-CoV, it is likely that
this same route also works in COVID-19. Notably, anosmia
and dysgeusia were reported recently to be prevalent among
patients with COVID-19 despite a lack of upper respiratory
symptoms [23, 37]. In addition, ACE2 and other entry genes
of SARS-CoV-2 are found to be highly expressed by susten-
tacular and non-neuronal cells in the human olfactory neu-
roepithelium [47, 48]. However, definitive evidence for this
transmission route is lacking, and more solid pathological

and experimental investigations should be conducted to vali-
date this pathway.
Maladaptive inflammatory responses can also con-
tribute to the neurological manifestations of COVID-19,
especially in those patients in whom no virus RNA is
detected in CSF. In the early phase of COVID-19, the
increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines (e.g.,
IL-1B8, IFN-y, TNF-a, IL-4, IL-10) was a signature
feature caused by rapid viral replication and second-
ary cellular injury. In addition, higher plasma levels of
these inflammatory cytokines were observed in the ICU
patients, which suggests that a cytokine storm presented
in the severe patients [12]. This cytokine storm could
induce various neurological symptoms and was previ-
ously reported to be able to disrupt the BBB and induce
neuroinflammation in the sepsis [27, 50, 51]. In addition,
the neutralizing antibodies (anti-S protein lgG), which are
assumed to clear the virus and promote the recovery, can
also cause severe secondary injury by altering inflam-
matory responses. In a previous study on SARS-CoV,
anti-S protein lgG was found to facilitate severe tissue
injury in other organs, such as the lung [52, 53]. Ina
recent case series of neurologic features in severe SARS-
CoV-2 infection, oligoclonal bands and elevated IgG were
detected in the CSF, which suggests that the activation of
the immune system might be a double-edged sword [36].
Limitations
This systematic review with meta-analysis has several
limitations. First, in the meta-analysis of the unspecific
manifestations we included all the related symptoms,
some of which were not classical neurological presenta-
tions. Neurological involvement could contribute partially
to these symptoms, and an overall analysis may exag-
gerate its role in COVID-19. Second, in the systematic
review, most of the included papers on clinical charac-
teristics were of retrospective design and were performed
in China, which could introduce potential bias. Third, the
studies on specific neurological symptoms and diseases
were mostly case reports and were limited. Fourth, dur-
ing the outbreak of COVID-19, the influx of numerous
COVID-19 patients made advanced neuroimaging, CSF
tests, electrophysiological tests, and pathological exami-
nations impractical due to high risk of cross-infection,
which limited the evidence of neurological involve-
ment. Fifth, this study was conducted during an ongoing
outbreak. Many related studies have not yet been pub-
lished, which could influence the results. The potential
mechanism underlying the neurological manifestation in
COVID-19 will be updated along with emerging evidence.
Conclusions
The neurological manifestations are various and prevalent
in COVID-19, but are usually underestimated. Emerging
clinical evidence suggests that neurological involvement
is an important aspect of the disease. The multifaceted
mechanisms are involved in its neurological impact, which
includes both direct invasion and maladaptive inflamma-
tory response. Nevertheless, more clinical and experimental
research should be conducted to further explore the role of
neurological manifestations on the disease progression and
its underlying mechanism.
