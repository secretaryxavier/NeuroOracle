The surface-exposed lipids of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium kansasii,
Mycobacterium gastri, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Mycobacterium aurum were isolated by gentle mechanical
treatment of cells with glass beads. Analysis of the exposed lipids demonstrated a selective location of classes
of ubiquitous lipids on the surfaces of mycobacteria. While phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylino-
sitol mannosides were exposed in all the species examined, dimycoloyl trehalose (‘‘cord factor’’) was identiﬁed
in the surface components of M. aurum only. Furthermore, monomycoloyl trehaloses and triacylglycerides were
identiﬁed in the surface-exposed lipids of M. avium and M. smegmatis but not in those of the other mycobac-
terial species examined. The species- and type-species speciﬁc lipids were present on the mycobacterial cell
surface: phenolic glycolipids, dimycocerosates of phthiocerols, and lipooligosaccharides were identiﬁed in the
surface-exposed materials of M. tuberculosis (Canetti), M. kansasii, and M. gastri, whereas glycopeptidolipids
were identiﬁed in the outermost lipid constituents of M. avium and M. smegmatis. This difference in the surface
exposure of lipids of various mycobacterial species may reﬂect differences in their cell envelope organizations.
Brief treatments of M. tuberculosis with Tween 80 prior to the use of glass beads led to erosion of regions of the
capsule to expose gradually both cord factor and other lipids on the cell surface of the tubercle bacillus,
demonstrating that the latter lipids are buried more deeply in the cell envelope and leading to the proposal of
a scheme for the location of the capsular lipids of the tubercle bacillus.
Several mycobacterial species, like Mycobacterium tubercu-
losis and Mycobacterium leprae, are the causative agents of
important human diseases. The former bacterium, which
claims 3 million lives per year, is responsible for more deaths
annually than any other single bacterial pathogen (8, 38).
Knowledge of the architecture of the cell envelopes of myco-
bacteria is central to our understanding of some unsolved
problems of mycobacterial diseases, such as recrudescence of
tuberculosis and occurrence of the opportunistic mycobacteri-
oses (43). The cell envelopes of Mycobacterium spp. are com-
posed of two structures: a plasma membrane and a cell wall
skeleton consisting of two covalently attached macromolecules,
peptidoglycan and mycoloyl arabinogalactan (32, 43). These
two layers are consistently found among mycobacterial species;
however, the outermost layer is considered to have different
molecular compositions in the various species (43). The most
distinctive structural feature of pathogenic mycobacterial spe-
cies is the presence of an electron-transparent zone, also called
a capsule, which surrounds each bacterium (34) and may be
part of the defense mechanism permitting these pathogens to
resist killing by phagocytic cells (24).
Previous evidence has shown that inside host cells, M. leprae
and Mycobacterium lepraemurium are surrounded by, respec-
tively, a foamy and a ﬁbrillar capsule (48). These capsules
contain characteristic lipids of mycobacterial origin consisting,
respectively, of phenolic glycolipids (PGLs [9, 35, 36]) and
structurally related dimycocerosates of phthiocerols (DIMs
[23, 35]) and glycopeptidolipids (GPLs [25]). Although other
mycobacterial species grown on artiﬁcial media synthesize lip-
ids, they have not been reported, with the possible exception
of a strain of M. avium, to produce similar ultrastructural-
ly distinctive capsules inside cells. In the case of M. avium,
Rulong et al. (54) demonstrated the presence of multilamellar
capsule-like structures, probably composed of GPLs, sur-
rounding bacilli growing inside phagosomes of murine macro-
phages. However, it has been shown that both GPL-positive
and GPL-negative strains of Mycobacterium avium-M. intracel-
lulare are surrounded by capsules (53). Similarly, some tuber-
cle bacilli, notably the Canetti and Canetti-like strains, synthe-
size large amounts of PGLs (12, 14, 19), whereas other virulent
strains contain only traces, if any at all, of these molecules (11,
12, 51). These observations suggested that PGLs and GPLs are
not the major components of the mycobacterial capsule and
that M. leprae and M. lepraemurium are anomalous in produc-
ing such very large amounts of lipids (22).
We recently isolated the outermost capsular components of
M. tuberculosis and demonstrated that they consist principally
of polysaccharides and proteins (50); small amounts of lipids (1
to 6% of the dried bacterial mass) were also detected in the
surface-exposed material (50), whereas only traces of lipids
were found in the material shed into the culture medium (41).
Because the interaction of the outermost constituents of the
bacterial cell envelope with the phagocyte determines in part
the immunological response of the host, the surface-exposed

lipids may play a role in the pathogenesis of mycobacterial
diseases. It is worthy of note that both PGLs and GPLs have
been shown to be located on the cell surface (3, 9, 21, 29) and
to exhibit various immunomodulatory properties (10, 26, 44,
52, 56). In the present study, we adopted a novel approach to
study the outermost capsular components, based on the release
of superﬁcial components by gentle mechanical abrasion, to
deﬁne the chemical nature of the surface-exposed lipids of M.
tuberculosis and other pathogenic and nonpathogenic myco-
bacterial species. An attempt to distinguish between lipids on
the actual surface and others buried more deeply in the capsule
of M. tuberculosis was also made.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294) and Canetti (CIPT 1400100-059), M.
avium (ATCC 15769), Mycobacterium kansasii (ATCC 12478), Mycobacterium
gastri (W471), and Mycobacterium smegmatis (ATCC 607) were grown on Sau-
ton’s medium (100 ml per ﬂask) as surface pellicles at 378C. M. aurum (strain
A1) and M. smegmatis were grown on 7H9 Middlebrook broth enriched with
0.5% (wt/vol) Casitone and 1% (wt/vol) glucose at 378C and harvested in the
mid-log phase by centrifugation.
Mycobacterial cells were harvested by pouring off the medium and gently
shaken for 1 min with 10 g of glass beads (4-mm diameter) per 2 g (wet weight)
of cells (50). In a parallel experiment, the original culture medium of actively
growing M. tuberculosis H37Rv was replaced by fresh Sauton’s medium contain-
ing 1% (wt/vol) Tween 80, and the cells were shaken at 378C for 1, 4, or 16 h. The
cells were then harvested by centrifugation and treated with glass beads as
described above. The declumped cells resulting from the treatment of bacteria
with glass beads were suspended in distilled water (50 ml per ﬂask) and imme-
diately ﬁltered through a 0.2-mm-pore-size sterile ﬁlter (Nalgene) to yield sterile
surface-exposed materials. The ﬁltrates derived from the treatment of bacteria
with Tween 80 and/or glass beads were concentrated separately under vacuum to
1/10 of the original volume. Chloroform and methanol were added to the aque-
ous solutions to obtain a partition mixture composed of chloroform-methanol-
water (3:4:3, vol/vol/vol). The organic phases were concentrated, washed with
water, evaporated to dryness to yield crude lipid extracts, and weighed. The lipid
extracts were dissolved in a few milliliters of chloroform and analyzed by thin-
layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel 60-precoated plates (0.25-mm thick-
ness; E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The plates were developed with the
following: petroleum ether-diethyl ether (9:1 and 7:3 [vol/vol], respectively) for
analyzing DIMs (15) and triacyl glycerols (TAGs); chloroform-methanol (99.5:
0.5 [vol/vol]) for polyphthienoyl trehaloses (PPTs [13]); chloroform-methanol
(9:1 [vol/vol]) for PGLs, GPLs, and 6,69-dimycoloyl trehaloses (DMTs); and
chloroform-methanol-water (30:8:1 [vol/vol/vol]) for 6-monomycoloyl trehaloses
(MMTs), 2,3-diacyl trehaloses (DATs), and lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) (18,
42). Phospholipids were analyzed by developing the TLC plates with chloroform-
methanol-water (65:25:4 [vol/vol/vol]). When the crude materials extracted with
Tween 80 were analyzed, it was difﬁcult to observe well-resolved spots, probably
because of the presence of huge amounts of the detergent. Thus, the crude lipid
extracts derived from the treatment of cells with Tween 80 were precipitated
twice with 6 volumes of cold ethanol, and the precipitates were applied to Florisil
columns (60/100 mesh), which were eluted successively with 100 ml of chloro-
form, with 100 ml of increasing concentrations of methanol in chloroform (5, 10,
20, 30, and 50% [vol/vol]), and ﬁnally with 100 ml of a mixture of chloroform,
methanol, and water (65:25:4 [vol/vol/vol]). The crude lipid extracts derived from
the mechanical treatment of cells with glass beads were also fractionated on
Florisil, as described above. The eluates were concentrated and analyzed by
TLC. Sugar-containing compounds were visualized by spraying plates with 0.2%
anthrone in concentrated sulfuric acid, followed by heating at 1108C. The Ditt-
mer-Lester reagent (20) was used for revealing phosphorus-containing sub-
stances. A ninhydrin reagent was used to reveal the presence of free amino
groups.
Cells were extracted with chloroform-methanol (2:1 [vol/vol]), and the lipid
extracts were evaporated to dryness. Delipidated cells, lipid extracts, and the
various fractions eluted from the Florisil column were saponiﬁed; the fatty acids
were methylated and analyzed by gas chromatography as described previously
(16). Mycolic methyl esters were analyzed by TLC with petroleum ether-diethyl
ether (9:1 [vol/vol], four runs) and dichoromethane as developing solvents (16).
For sugar analyses, a sample (1 mg) of the chromatographic fractions or puriﬁed
lipids was routinely hydrolyzed with 2 M aqueous triﬂuoroacetic acid (Sigma, St.
Louis, Mo.) solution at 1108C for 1 h. The hydrolysates were then partitioned
between chloroform and water. The aqueous phases were dried under nitrogen,
subjected to trimethylsilylation, and analyzed by gas chromatography with a
Girdel G-30 apparatus equipped with a fused silica column (25-m length by
0.22-mm internal diameter) coated with OV-1 (0.3-mm ﬁlm thickness). A tem-
perature gradient of 100 to 2808C (28C min21) was used.
The bacteria were examined by scanning electron microscopy as previously
described (50).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The tubercle bacillus and most other mycobacterial species
are known to form large clumps, especially when growing in
stationary liquid cultures (32). This phenomenon is illustrated
in Fig. 1A. Gentle shaking of pellicles of M. tuberculosis with
4-mm-diameter glass beads declumps cells by extracting the
amorphous covering material but does not affect their integrity
(50). In the present study, this method of isolation of the
outermost surface constituents was combined with shaking of
exponentially grown tubercle bacilli with Tween 80 for 1 or 4 h
or overnight. The latter treatment also extracted the surface-
exposed material and prevented cell clumping (Fig. 1B). When
treatment with Tween 80 was followed by the gentle mechan-
ical shaking of the treated cells with glass beads, we expected
the exposure of compounds which were buried more deeply in
the capsules of the intact bacilli.
The materials extracted from the tubercle bacillus with glass
beads and/or Tween 80 represented 1 to 8% of the bacterial
dry mass, depending on the method used for extraction (Table
1). Treatment of the cells for 4 h with the detergent extracted
more material than did 1 h of the same treatment. Similarly,
treatment of cells for 16 h with Tween 80 led to a higher yield
than did treatment for 4 h. These data suggested a gradual
removal of the constituents from the cell surface. The different
recovered materials were partitioned between chloroform,
methanol, and water, and the organic phases were compared
by TLC. As shown in Table 1, marked differences between the
lipid compositions of the materials derived from the different
treatments were observed.

ical treatment of bacilli with glass beads. It has to be noted that
extraction of the material derived from the mechanical treat-
ment of cells with petroleum ether-diethyl ether (1:1 [vol/vol])
also yielded small amounts of lipids, quantitatively comparable
to those obtained by using water to recover the material ex-
tracted with glass beads (50). This observation suggested that
the amount of recovered lipids reﬂected the quantity of lipids
in the mixture of surface-exposed components. The remaining
95 to 99% was composed of proteins and polysaccharides (50).
The surface-exposed lipids consisted of the type-speciﬁc PGLs
(14) and LOSs (18) of the Canetti strain, the species-speciﬁc
DIMs (15, 46) and DATs (2, 6, 42) of M. tuberculosis, and the
ubiquitous phosphatidylinositol mannosides (PIMs) and phos-
phatidylethanolamine (PE). In contrast, the ubiquitous DMTs,
MMTs, and TAGs (32, 45), as well as the type-speciﬁc PPTs
(13), were not detected in the material removed with glass
beads (Table 1). The failure to detect DMTs in this material
was surprising in view of the old published data. Historically,
DMTs were isolated from virulent cord-forming tubercle ba-
cilli and were called cord factor because it was believed that
they were responsible for the formation of cords (7, 32). In-
deed, all the ubiquitous lipids, including DMTs, were detected
in the lipids extracted from the glass bead-treated cells. The
failure to detect these lipids among the surface-exposed com-
ponents was not due to their hydrophobicity, as less polar
compounds, such as DIMs, were easily detectable in the sur-
face-exposed material extracted with glass beads.
Identiﬁcation of buried capsular lipids of M. tuberculosis.
When M. tuberculosis was treated for 1 h with Tween 80, the
recovered material contained PPTs which were not detectable
in the outermost material extracted with glass beads (Table 1).
While treatment of bacilli with the detergent for 4 h led to the
detection of traces of DMTs, treatment for 1 h with the same
agent, followed by the subsequent treatment of cells with glass
beads, was needed for the detection of signiﬁcant amounts of
DMTs in the cell surface-exposed material of the tubercle
bacillus. This observation further substantiated the fact that
the previous failure to detect this family of glycolipids was not

due to the use of glass beads. The structurally related MMTs,
as well as the ubiquitous TAGs, were detected only after treat-
ing cells for 16 h with the detergent (Table 1). These results
demonstrated that not all the different classes of lipids were
exposed on the surfaces of intact tubercle bacilli. While PGLs,
DIMs, LOSs, DATs, and phospholipids were present in the
outermost compartment of the capsule, DMTs, TAGs, and
MMTs were located in an inner region of the capsule, TAGs
and MMTs being buried more deeply in the capsule than
DMTs. The lipid extracts from the various Tween-treated cells
still contained all the classes of lipids, demonstrating that the
type-speciﬁc as well as the species-speciﬁc lipids were not lo-
cated only in the outermost compartment of the capsule. These
data, schematized in Fig. 2, supported a concept of gradual
extraction of the capsular material with glass beads and Tween
80. This concept was further substantiated by the lipid compo-
sitions of the different extracted materials, in that all the lipids
found in the outermost capsular material were also detected in
the Tween extracts (Table 1). It has to be noted that in the
proposed scheme (Fig. 2), classes of lipids are selectively lo-
cated in a polysaccharide-protein matrix.
Identiﬁcation of the surface-exposed lipids of other myco-
bacteria. The failure to detect all the classes of lipids in the
outermost capsular material of M. tuberculosis led us to inves-
tigate the distribution of lipids in the cell envelopes of other
mycobacterial species. This was done by comparing the surface
lipid extracts derived from the mechanical shaking of cells with
glass beads (Table 2). The materials extracted with glass beads
from the cell surfaces of the different species represented
roughly 2 to 3% of the dried bacterial mass and contained
small amounts of lipids, as in the case of M. tuberculosis. They
represented 1 to 5% of the materials removed by the treatment
with glass beads, the remaining constituents also being com-
posed of polysaccharides and proteins (40). Among the ubiq-
uitous mycobacterial lipids (32, 45), PE and PIMs were the
lipids found in the outermost compartments of all the species.
The presence of phospholipids as surface-exposed lipids is
notable and merits consideration. The phospholipid composi-
tions of mycobacterial cell fragments were studied earlier by
several authors (1, 31, 49). In those studies, however, all the
individual phospholipids were present in substantial propor-
tions in all the fractions examined, and the technical problems
involved in obtaining representative fractions were recognized
(45). Thus, the impression that phospholipids were certainly
membrane components which probably contaminated cell wall
fractions prevailed. Therefore, our results clearly demon-
strated that, in addition to being found in the plasma mem-
brane, phospholipids are also located in the outermost region
of the mycobacterial envelope.
M. kansasii and M. gastri showed the same proﬁle as M.
tuberculosis: PGLs (27, 57), DIMs (15, 46), and LOSs (30, 37)
were surface exposed in these species, but DMTs, MMTs, and
TAGs were not. The surface exposure of these species-speciﬁc
lipids was in agreement with the immunocytochemical data
showing the surface location of PGLs and LOSs on M. kansasii
(4, 29) and with the identiﬁcation of PGLs and DIMs in the
petroleum ether extract of this species (39). In connection with
that agreement, it is interesting that DIMs, PGLs, and TAGs
were detected in a petroleum ether extract of M. kansasii (39).
It is likely that the organic solvent extracted not only the
surface-exposed material but also other cell constituents of
bacilli.
The species-speciﬁc GPLs were also detected in the materi-
als extracted with glass beads from M. avium and M. smegmatis
(Table 2). The surface location of GPLs was in accordance
with the isolation and characterization of GPLs from the cap-
sule of M. avium-M. intracellulare (3, 21), with the identiﬁca-
tion of this class of mycobacterial glycolipid as the receptor of
mycobacteriophage D4 (28, 33), and with GPLs being the
Schaefer typing antigens (32). The immunochemical data ob-
tained for M. avium-M. intracellulare also supported the loca-
tion of GPLs in the outermost region of the cell envelope. The
ubiquitous MMTs and TAGs were also surface exposed in
these two species, but DMTs were not. It is worth noting that
the detection of TAGs in the surface-exposed components of
three mycobacteria, namely, M. avium, M. aurum, and M. smeg-

SURFACE-EXPOSED LIPIDS ON MYCOBACTERIAL CELL ENVELOPES

matis (Table 2), and in the inner region of the capsule of M.
tuberculosis (Table 1) was surprising in that these lipids have
been regarded as storage compounds found in the bacterial
cytoplasm (32).
M. aurum was the only species in which DMTs were exposed
on the cell surface (Table 2). As the strain of M. aurum used
was grown on a modiﬁed Middlebrook medium (because it did
not grow on glycerol-containing media), we also analyzed the
surface-exposed lipids of M. smegmatis grown on the same
medium. No difference was observed between the lipid com-
position of the material removed from the cells of M. smegma-
tis grown on Sauton’s medium and that of the material re-
moved from cells grown on Middlebrook medium by the
mechanical treatment with glass beads (data not shown).
In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that mycobac-
teria are not identical in terms of surface exposure of the
various classes of lipids, probably reﬂecting differences in their
cell envelope organizations. This ﬁnding is interesting in that
no such differences between species in the arrangement of
surface-exposed lipids are mentioned in the general models
which have been proposed. The present study did not investi-
gate the arrangement of the peptidoglycan-arabinogalactan-
mycolate and associated lipids. Thus, the mono- or bilayer
models currently proposed for this mycobacterial cell envelope
region still remain possible, providing opportunities for further
studies. Nevertheless, the data presented in Fig. 2 show that
lipids are present in the outermost region of the mycobacterial
cell envelope in a protein-polysaccharide matrix, requiring
models to be modiﬁed accordingly.
On the basis of the surface-exposed lipid compositions de-
scribed here, the six mycobacterial species investigated may be
arranged into three groups. The ﬁrst group is composed of M.
tuberculosis, M. kansasii, and M. gastri; on outermost cell sur-
faces of these species, species-speciﬁc lipids (PGLs, LOSs, and
DIMs) are exposed but ubiquitous lipids (DMTs, MMTs, and
TAGs) are not. The second group consists of M. avium and M.
smegmatis; their species-speciﬁc lipids (GPLs) and some of the
ubiquitous lipids (MMTs and TAGs) are exposed on the cell
surface. The third group is composed of M. aurum; all the
classes of lipids so far described for this species are exposed at
the outermost region of the cell.
Finally, the location of PGLs and GPLs on the cell surface
deserves consideration, as the outermost constituents of the
bacilli, in the course of infection, are in contact with the host
cells and may affect their response. It must be recalled that
both classes of speciﬁc mycobacterial glycolipids may function
as virulence factors in the pathogenesis of mycobacterial dis-
eases. PGLs have been shown to inhibit the lymphoprolifera-
tive response (26, 44), to suppress monocyte oxidative re-
sponses (56), and to scavenge oxygen radicals (47). Similarly,
GPLs, which are mainly the most simple version of these mol-
ecules, have been shown to inhibit both the nonspeciﬁc mito-
gen-induced proliferation of mononuclear cells (10) and mito-
chondrial oxidative phosphorylation (55). Keeping in mind
that bacterial pathogenicity and virulence are multifactorial, it
is not surprising that some nonpathogenic mycobacterial spe-
cies, like M. gastri, synthesize PGLs (15, 57), whereas both
virulent smooth transparent and avirulent smooth opaque
strains of M. avium-M. intracellulare elaborate GPLs (5), as
does the nonpathogenic M. smegmatis (17), while some virulent
strains are devoid of these glycolipids (15, 18, 53).
