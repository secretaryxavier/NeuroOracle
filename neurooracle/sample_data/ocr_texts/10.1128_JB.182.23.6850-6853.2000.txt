tuberculosis That Is Similar to Eukaryotic Acid Phosphatases

Mycobacterium tuberculosis secretes a large number of polypeptides with broad biological and immunological
functions. We describe here the characterization of a 28-kDa acid phosphatase of M. tuberculosis (SapM)
localized to the culture ﬁltrate. The mature protein demonstrated biochemical characteristics similar to those
of the bacterial nonspeciﬁc acid phosphatases. However, SapM yielded signiﬁcant sequence homology to fungal
acid phosphatases and not those of bacteria. Thus, SapM may represent a new class of bacterial nonspeciﬁc
acid phosphatases.
The complete Mycobacterium tuberculosis genome was re-
cently sequenced and annotated (8). However, of the 3,924
putative gene products, only a minority are assigned experi-
mentally established physiological functions. Thus, continued
analyses of the M. tuberculosis proteome are required to fully
elucidate the biology of this intracellular pathogen. The most
thoroughly studied gene products of M. tuberculosis are the
culture ﬁltrate proteins (CFPs) (reviewed in reference 6). The
CFPs are proposed to participate in intracellular survival (6)
and are a primary target of the host’s protective T-cell re-
sponse (21). Several laboratories have added some deﬁnition
to the myriad of biological and enzymatic activities associated
with the CFPs (4, 7, 15, 23). In the most comprehensive of
these studies, Raynaud et al. (23) described 22 enzymatic ac-
tivities. However, the molecular identities and characteristics
of the enzymes responsible for these activities were not eluci-
dated. One of the activities identiﬁed was that of an acid
phosphatase.
One mechanism of intracellular survival employed by M.
tuberculosis is the modulation of host cell activities, such as
intracellular vesicle fusion, phagosome maturation, and phago-
some acidiﬁcation (reviewed in reference 27). Although the
speciﬁc proteins of M. tuberculosis that modulate macrophage
activity remain elusive, recent studies of other intracellular
pathogens demonstrate that acid phosphatases are important
to this aspect of microbial pathogenicity (2, 24, 25, 28). Thus,
we believe that such an activity may also facilitate host cell
modulation by M. tuberculosis. As a ﬁrst step in testing this
hypothesis, the presence of acid phosphatase activity in the
culture ﬁltrate of M. tuberculosis was conﬁrmed and a 28-kDa
protein possessing this activity was puriﬁed and characterized.
Puriﬁcation and identiﬁcation of the acid phosphatase. To
identify and isolate a secreted acid phosphatase, a culture
ﬁltrate of M. tuberculosis cells grown to late log phase was
harvested (9) and dialyzed against 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH
6.0). Initial evaluation of this culture ﬁltrate for phosphatase
activity, using p-nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) as the substrate
(5), indicated the presence of weak activity (750 nmol of p-
nitrophenol [pNP]/min/mg of protein) at pH 6.0. The culture
ﬁltrate was fractionated by cation-exchange chromatography,
and a single asymmetric peak of acid phosphatase activity was
eluted with about 0.3 M NaCl. Moreover, the acid phosphatase
activity was enriched 70.6-fold. Final puriﬁcation of this enzy-
matic activity was accomplished by hydrophobic-interaction
chromatography. This resulted in the isolation of a single
polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 28 kDa, as
determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel elec-
trophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (Fig. 1A), and a speciﬁc acid phos-
phatase activity of 86,290 nmol of pNP/min/mg of protein.
The molecular identity of the 28-kDa acid phosphatase was
determined via peptide mass ﬁngerprinting. Peptides gener-
ated by trypsin digestion of the puriﬁed protein were separated
by C18 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatogra-
phy and analyzed by electrospray mass spectrometry (ES-MS)
(12, 16). The molecular mass/charge ratio (m/z) and ES-
MS-MS fragmentation patterns were determined for individual
peptides, and these data were searched against the M. tuber-
culosis protein database by using the Sequest program (12).
Three peptides with 901.4, 1,692.8, and 2,009.1 m/z (Fig. 1B)
were matched to predicted trypsin fragments of a gene product
annotated in the M. tuberculosis database as “hypothetical pro-
tein Rv3310.” The putative Rv3310 gene product possessed
299 amino acid residues with a theoretical molecular mass of
31,807 Da and an isoelectric point (pI) of 6.14.
To conﬁrm the identity of the puriﬁed acid phosphatase,
N-terminal sequencing was performed on the intact protein
(29). This yielded a sequence of ASALPTFAHVVI (Fig. 1B)
that corresponded to amino acids 44 to 55 of the putative
Rv3310 gene product. Analysis of the deduced protein se-
quence revealed that the ﬁrst 43 amino acids of the predicted
Rv3310 gene product possessed characteristics of a typical
prokaryotic signal sequence (31). Additionally, the theoretical
molecular mass of the mature protein was calculated to be
27,365 Da, a value similar to that obtained by SDS-PAGE (Fig.
1A). These data provided strong evidence of a protein secreted
via a sec-dependent mechanism. Thus, the 28-kDa acid phos-
phatase was designated SapM, for secreted acid phosphatase
of M. tuberculosis.
Sequence homology of SapM. The amino acid sequence of
the full-length SapM was subjected to a BLASTP search (32)
against the nonredundant protein database (National Center
for Biotechnology Information). This resulted in the identiﬁ-
cation of three sequences with 28 to 31% identity and 44 to
51% similarity to SapM. These homologous sequences be-
longed to a phosphate-repressible acid phosphatase from Pen-

icillium chrysogenum (Pc-PhoA) (14), a pH 6.0-optimum acid
phosphatase from Aspergillus (niger) ﬁcuum (Af-PhoA) (11),
and a potential acid phosphatase of Kluyveromyces lactis (Kl-
PhoX) (13). Interestingly, no signiﬁcant homology to any
prokaryotic acid phosphatases was found. SapM also lacked
sequence motifs of phosphothreonine-serine and protein ty-
rosine phosphatases (3), metallophosphoesterases (19), and
histidine phosphatases (22). However, SapM did possess two
His residues (position 93 and 204) that were conserved in
highly homologous regions of the fungal acid phosphatases.
Oligomeric state, pH optimum, and kinetics of SapM. To
determine whether SapM existed in a monomeric or oligo-
meric form, the puriﬁed protein (100 mg) was applied to a
Sepharose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc.)
and eluted with phosphate-buffered saline at a ﬂow rate of 0.5
ml/min. A comparison of the SapM retention coefﬁcient to
those of protein standards (bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa;
carbonic anhydrase, 29 kDa; cytochrome c, 12.4 kDa; and
aprotinin, 6.5 kDa) yielded a relative molecular mass of 28.8
kDa. This value agreed well with the theoretical mass of the
mature monomeric protein and that obtained by SDS-PAGE.
Furthermore, the puriﬁed protein showed no oligomeric spe-
cies by SDS-PAGE in cross-linking experiments with bis(sul-
fosuccinimidyl) suberate.
The pH optimum for the enzymatic hydrolysis of pNPP by
SapM was determined using four buffer systems: 0.1 M sodium
citrate (pH 3.0 to 5.0), 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 5.5 to 6.5),
0.1 M Tris base (pH 7.0 to 8.0), and 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate
(pH 8.5 to 9.0). The relative rate of hydrolysis of pNPP was
determined by quantitation of released pNP (5) and Pi (20).
Both methods yielded comparable results. Signiﬁcant activity
was observed between pH 5.5 and 8.0, and optimal activity was
observed at pH 6.5 to 7.5. This optimal pH range is wider than
that observed for other acid phosphatases, such as the homol-
ogous Af-PhoA (11) and those from Francisella tularensis (24)
and Coxiella burnetii (2). However, it is similar to that observed
for the bacterial nonspeciﬁc acid phosphatases (NSAPs) (26).
The kinetic parameters for the hydrolysis of pNPP were deter-
mined using a 0.4 mM to 0.5 mM concentration range of pNPP
in 0.1 M Tris buffer, pH 6.8. The Km was determined to be 0.43
mM, and the Vmax was 2.1 3 106 nmol of pNP/h/mg of protein.
Range of substrates and inhibitors of SapM. Twenty-one
compounds at a concentration of 1 mM were tested as sub-
strates for SapM, and their rates of hydrolysis were compared
to that of pNPP (Table 1). SapM demonstrated equivalent
activity against a-naphthyl phosphate, another substrate com-

monly used to detect phosphatase activity. When tested with
naturally occurring molecules of physiological signiﬁcance to
mycobacteria, the puriﬁed enzyme exhibited the highest activ-
ity against phosphoenolpyruvate, glycerophosphate, GTP,
NADPH, phosphotyrosine, and trehalose-6-phosphate. In con-
trast, the enzyme exhibited poor activity against glucose-6-
phosphate, phosphothreonine, and a number of nucleotides
(NADP, ATP, AMP, and GMP). SapM was not active against
cysteamine phosphate, a substrate speciﬁc for alkaline phos-
phatase. Similarly, no activity was detected against phospho-
lipids or the phospholipase substrate p-nitrophenylphosphoryl-
choline. Some acid phosphatases, in particular a subgroup of
histidine acid phosphatases, also possess phytase activity (18).
However, the rate of hydrolysis of phytic acid by SapM was
15% of that for pNPP (Table 1). This low activity for phytic
acid led us to conclude that SapM is not a phytase.
A more informative hypothesis of the activity of SapM can
be derived from its susceptibility to different inhibitors. Using
pNPP as the substrate, 16 potential phosphatase inhibitors
were tested against SapM. The enzymatic activity of SapM was
inhibited by low concentrations of several heavy metals (1 mM
zinc chloride, 20 mM sodium molybdate, 0.3 mM magnesium
chloride, and 0.5 mM copper sulfate) and moderately high
concentrations (.8 mM) of EDTA. These results indicated the
requirement of a speciﬁc metal cofactor for substrate hydroly-
sis and the displacement of the cofactor and inactivation by
other heavy metals. SapM was resistant to sodium tartrate, a
characteristic of other acid phosphatases that require iron for
enzymatic activity (10). Additionally, the pH optimum of SapM
is reﬂective of the pKa for the active site of a histidine acid
phosphatase, an enzyme that forms a phosphohistidine inter-
mediate and uses a metal cofactor (17). Although SapM lacked
consensus sequences of histidine acid phosphatases, it did pos-
sess the “HD” motif (residues 204 and 205), shown to be
involved in the catalytic activity of a number of such enzymes
(22). Further evidence that the His residues of SapM might be
important for catalytic activity is found in the conservation of
this amino acid in two domains (residues 92 to 99 and residues
197 to 208) that are highly homologous to regions of the fungal
acid phosphatases Pc-PhoA, Af-PhoA, and Kl-PhoX.
Subcellular localization of SapM. Subcellular localization of
SapM was investigated by assessing tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase activity in subcellular fractions (culture ﬁltrate,
cell wall, cell membrane, and cytosol) of M. tuberculosis H37Rv
(Table 2). Tartrate was included in these reactions to minimize
interference by acid phosphatases other than SapM. The acid
phosphatase activity partitioned predominantly with the cul-
ture ﬁltrate. However, a signiﬁcant amount of activity was
detected in the cell membrane and cell wall fractions, but not
in the cytosol. In comparison, activity of isocitrate dehydroge-
nase, a cytosolic enzyme, was observed primarily in the cytosol,
with minor activity detected in the culture ﬁltrate (Table 2).
The isocitrate dehydrogenase activity associated with the ex-
tracellular milieu was most likely due to some cellular autolysis
of the culture (1). These data, combined with the sequence
analysis of SapM, prove that this is a true secreted protein of
M. tuberculosis.
General conclusions. SapM is the ﬁrst mycobacterial acid
phosphatase to be identiﬁed and characterized at a molecular
level. Only one other gene product of M. tuberculosis (Rv2577)
is predicted to be an acid phosphatase (8). However, Rv2577
does not possess an export signal sequence (8). Thus, SapM
appears to be the only secreted acid phosphatase of M. tuber-
culosis, a hypothesis that is supported by our observations. This
enzyme also ﬁts the description of bacterial NSAPs, a broad
group of phosphatases consisting of secreted proteins that
function in an acidic-to-neutral pH range and use a wide va-
riety of organic phosphoesters as substrates (26). However, the
amino acid sequence of SapM does not possess the signature
motifs used to deﬁne any of the three classes of bacterial
NSAPs, and in fact, this enzyme shows the greatest homology
to several acid phosphatases of fungal origin. This is not sur-
prising given that the investigation of bacterial NSAPs is still
maturing (26) and that the class C NSAPs were recognized
only recently as a distinct group (30). Thus, it would appear
that SapM represents a new class of bacterial NSAPs. This
report also provides strong evidence that SapM is an NSAP
that may function as a histidine phosphatase. However, the
lack of available data on SapM homologues underscores the
need to perform detailed mechanistic studies and site-directed
mutagenesis to determine the mode of action of SapM. Simi-
larly, SapM deletion mutants are required to elucidate the
precise physiological function of SapM and whether it contrib-
utes to the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis.
