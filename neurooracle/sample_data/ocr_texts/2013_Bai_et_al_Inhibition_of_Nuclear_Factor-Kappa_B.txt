Abstract
Nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB) is a ubiquitous transcription factor that mediates pro-inflammatory responses required for
host control of many microbial pathogens; on the other hand, NFkB has been implicated in the pathogenesis of other
inflammatory and infectious diseases. Mice with genetic disruption of the p50 subunit of NFkB are more likely to succumb
to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB). However, the role of NFkB in host defense in humans is not fully understood. We
sought to examine the role of NFkB activation in the immune response of human macrophages to MTB. Targeted
pharmacologic inhibition of NFkB activation using BAY 11-7082 (BAY, an inhibitor of IkBa kinase) or an adenovirus construct
with a dominant-negative IkBa significantly decreased the number of viable intracellular mycobacteria recovered from THP-
1 macrophages four and eight days after infection. The results with BAY were confirmed in primary human monocyte-
derived macrophages and alveolar macrophages. NFkB inhibition was associated with increased macrophage apoptosis and
autophagy, which are well-established killing mechanisms of intracellular MTB. Inhibition of the executioner protease
caspase-3 or of the autophagic pathway significantly abrogated the effects of BAY. We conclude that NFkB inhibition
decreases viability of intracellular MTB in human macrophages via induction of apoptosis and autophagy.

Introduction
Tuberculosis (TB) remains problematic throughout much of the
world due, in large part, to burgeoning drug resistance and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection [1–3]. In addition to
these critical barriers to TB control, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)
has been highly successful in evading host immune mechanisms
and surviving within phagocytes [4–7]. Gaining a better under-
standing of host-pathogen interactions will enable the develop-
ment of novel therapeutics to treat drug resistant cases and shorten
current treatment time.
The seminal work of Lurie demonstrated that innate immunity
is particularly important in the protective response against
pulmonary TB [8] and is largely mediated by a number of
phagocytic receptors and pattern-recognition receptors such as
complement receptors and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on macro-
phages [9–17]. Upon engagement of TLRs by microbial ligands,
the I-kappa B-alpha (IkBa) kinase-nuclear factor-kappa B (IKK-
NFkB) signaling cascade is activated, resulting in NFkB-mediated
transcription of pro-inflammatory genes [18–21]. By inducing an
inflammatory response, NFkB activation has been shown to
enhance immunity against certain microbial pathogens [22,23].
However, specific NFkB-mediated pathways may be exploited by
bacterial pathogens to promote survival; e.g., Escherichia coli and
Chlamydophila pneumoniae activate NFkB to prevent apoptosis of host
cells [22], while Shigella flexneri and Helicobacter pylori induce host
NFkB to enhance tissue invasion [24,25].
We examined how inhibition of NFkB activation impacts the
viability of intracellular MTB in human macrophages including
differentiated
THP-1
monocytes,
primary
monocyte-derived
macrophages (MDM), and primary alveolar macrophages (AM).
We found that inhibiting NFkB activation reduced the viability of
intracellular MTB in all three types of human macrophages. We

also examined the impact of inhibiting NFkB activation on
apoptosis and autophagy [26–28], two cellular processes known to
facilitate mycobacterial killing [4,6,29–33]. We discovered that
inhibition of NFkB activation reduces intracellular survival of
MTB by enhancing both host-protective apoptosis and autophagy
of the infected macrophages.
Materials and Methods
Materials
The human promonocytic cell line THP-1 (TIB-202) and MTB
H37Rv (27294) were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA). The following reagents were pur-
chased: RPMI cell culture medium (Cambrex, East Rutherford,
NJ), FBS heat-inactivated at 56uC for 1 hr (Atlanta Biologicals,
Norcross, GA), BAY 11-7082 (BAY) – a specific IKK inhibitor
(Biomol Research Laboratories, Plymouth Meeting, PA), TNFa

Research
Products
DuPont,
Wilmington, DE), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), phorbol
myristate acetate (PMA), and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO). The polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against
microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3), cytochrome c
antibody, and b-actin antibody were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). The caspase-3 inhibitor
benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-fluoromethylketone (z-DEVD-
fmk) and ELISA kits for detecting active caspase-3 (Human Active
Caspase-3 Immunoassay) and IL-8 were purchased from R & D
Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). The EIA-lacking adenovirus vector
(AdV) cloned to a mutant IkBa in which serine 32 and 36 residues
were mutated to alanine (AdV-S32/36A-IkBa) and an AdV-green
fluorescent protein (AdV-GFP) construct were gifts of Drs. Adela
Cota-Gomez and Sonia Flores of University of Colorado Anschutz
Medical Center.
Culture of MTB stock
MTB was grown to log phase at 37uC in Difco Middlebrook
7H9 medium (Becton Dickinson, MD), enriched with 10% stock
ADC Enrichment (Remel, Lenexa, KS) containing 5% (w/v) BSA
fraction V, 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.87% (w/v) NaCl, and 0.004% (w/
v) catalase. Tween 80 (0.05%, v/v) and glycerol (0.2%, v/v) were
also
added
to
the
growth
medium.
After
culture
of
the
mycobacteria under aeration, the culture was diluted to a
concentration of 1.0 McFarland standard (equivalent to 108 ba-
cilli/mL) and stored at 280uC.
Differentiation of THP-1 cells
THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplement-
ed with 10% FBS and 2 mM glutamine and were maintained
between 2 and 106105 cells/mL. Prior to experimentation, THP-
1 cells were stimulated with 15 ng/mL PMA for 2 to 3 days to
allow differentiation into macrophages. The PMA-containing
medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium just prior
to exposing the cells to the experimental conditions.
Isolation of human monocyte-derived macrophages
Nine healthy, non-smoking volunteers, 21 to 65 years of age,
were recruited for blood donation after National Jewish Health
Institutional Review Board (NJH-IRB) approval and written
informed consent was obtained from each enrolled subject.
Human monocytes were isolated from 50 mL of heparinized
blood and process for differentiation into macrophages as we
previously described [34]. In brief, the samples were centrifuged at
4006g at room temperature for 25 min. The white buffy coat layer
was removed, washed, counted, and resuspended in RPMI
medium
containing
10%
FBS
to
a
concentration
of
46
106 cells/mL. One-half mL of the cell suspension (26106 cells/
0.5 mL) was added to each well of a 24-well polystyrene plate,
estimated
to
yield
about
26105 MDM
assuming
10%
of
peripheral white blood cells are monocytes. The cells were
incubated at 37uC in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 10–14
days, and the media were replaced on days 2, 5, 7, 9 and 12,
resulting in the selection of MDM.
Isolation of alveolar macrophages
Nine healthy, non-smoking volunteers, 21 to 65 years of age,
were recruited for bronchoalveolar lavage to obtain AM after
NJH-IRB approval and written informed consent was obtained
from each enrolled subject. All bronchoscopies were performed by
EDC. The bronchoscope was wedged in a segment of the right
middle lobe and four-60 mL aliquots of sterile normal saline were
instilled and sequentially aspirated back. The volume of lavage
recovered was typically 60 to 70% of the amount instilled. The
bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was centrifuged at 2006g for 10 min
at 4uC. Cell pellets were washed with PBS and resuspended in
10 mL RPMI medium containing 10% FBS and 100 U/mL
penicillin G. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer and the
volume of medium was adjusted to give a concentration of
1.06106 cells/mL. One-quarter mL (2.56105 cells) of this
suspension plus 250 mL of RPMI medium was added to each
well of a 24-well plate and incubated at 37uC in a humidified 5%
CO2 incubator. After 24 hours of incubation, the medium was
replaced with fresh antibiotic-free RPMI medium containing 10%
FBS and incubated overnight. Prior to infection with MTB, the
medium was replaced a second time with antibiotic-free RPMI
medium to remove any trace of penicillin G.
Infection of macrophages with MTB
Macrophages were infected with MTB H37Rv at a multiplicity
of infection (MOI) of 10 bacilli to 1 macrophage as previously
described [35]. In conditions where NFkB was inhibited, the cells
were pre-incubated with 5 mM BAY or 0.1% (v/v) DMSO for
1 hr prior to infection.
Culture of cell-associated MTB
For cells infected for 1 hr (Day 0), the supernatants were
collected after 1 hr of infection and the cells washed twice with a
1:1 solution of RPMI:16 PBS. Adherent cells were lysed with
250 mL of a 0.25% SDS solution per well, followed by addition of
250 mL of 7H9 plating broth. Serial dilutions of cell lysates were
prepared and then 5 mL of each dilution was plated on
Middlebrook 7H10 agar. For Day 4 and 8 infections, the cells
were washed twice after the initial 1 hr of infection and replaced
with fresh RPMI medium containing 10% FBS65 mM BAY; the
medium was not changed until 4 or 8 days after infection. After 4
and 8 days of infection, the supernatants were centrifuged to
recover any non-adherent macrophages; these macrophages were
lysed together with the adherent macrophages and MTB cultured
as described above. We considered it important to culture both
adherent and non-adherent macrophages to accurately recover all
cell-associated MTB. The cell-free supernatants were collected for
cytokine analysis.
Construction and detection of MTB H37Rv-GFP
MTB H37Rv was transformed with the plasmid pBCM. In
brief, the GFP fragment recovered from digestion of plasmid
Inhibition NFkB Decreases Survival of MTB

pFPCA1 [36] with BamHI/EcoRI was cloned into pMV261 to
make pBCM. pMV261 (Addgene) is a replicative vector that
contains a kanamycin resistance gene, an E.coli origin of
replication
(oriE), a mycobacterial plasmid DNA origin of
replication (oriM), an expression cassette containing a mycobacte-
rial promoter (Hsp60), a multiple cloning site, and a transcrip-
tional terminator. After transformation of MTB H37Rv with
pBCM by electroporation, positive clones were selected on
Middiebrook 7H10 agar which contains 50 mg/mL of kanamycin
and GFP-labeled MTB detected by fluorescent microscopy.
THP-1 cells (26105 cells/200 mL/well) were plated in black,
clear-bottom 96-well microtiter plates in order to minimize
background fluorescence (Black Viewplates, Packard Instrument
Company, Meriden, Conn). Following overnight differentiation
with PMA, the cells were incubated with 5 mM BAY for 1 hr and
then infected with MTB H37Rv-GFP at a MOI of 10 for 1 hr. For
the 1 hr time point, the medium was removed, 4% paraformal-
dehyde was added for 1 hr to fix the cells, washed three times with
PBS, and fluorescence was measured using a Cytofluor II
microplate fluorometer in the bottom-reading mode with excita-
tion and emission wavelengths of 485 nm and 508 nm, respec-
tively. For the 4 and 8 day time points, the medium was changed
to fresh medium containing 5 mM BAY, and the MTB-infected
cells were incubated at 37uC in 5% CO2 for an additional 4 and 8
days before the same preparations were made to measure
fluorescence. The mean fluorescent value of three wells containing
uninfected THP-1 cells was subtracted from the measured
fluorescence of all test wells.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay
NFkB activation was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA). The human macrophages were either untreated, or
pre-treated with 5 mM BAY or 0.1% DMSO vehicle for 1 hr,
followed by infection with MTB H37Rv at a MOI of 10 for
30 min, 1 hr, 3 hrs, or 6 hrs. The methods used for the nuclear
protein extraction, end-labeling of a double stranded oligonucle-
otide (Promega, Madison, WI) containing a consensus sequence
for NFkB with 32P-c-ATP, and binding reaction of the nuclear
proteins with the labeled oligonucleotide are as previously
published [37,38]. One additional step was that the extracted
nuclear protein was filtered through a 0.2 mm syringe filter to
remove any MTB.
Cytokine measurements
The
concentrations
of
TNFa
and
IL-8
in
the
culture
supernatants were determined by ELISA according to manufac-
turer’s instructions. The level of IFNc was determined by
electrochemiluminescence as previously described [35,39].
Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl trans-
ferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Cell suspensions
(0.5 mL) were grown on 4-chamber well slides [34], pre-incubated
with BAY and then infected with MTB H37Rv at a MOI of 10.
The medium was removed at 4 and 8 days following infection and
the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution (pH 7.4).
The cells were then stained with an Apoptosis In Situ Detection
Kit (Roche Diagnostic, Indiannapolis, IN) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and as previously reported [35].
Enumeration of apoptotic cells was performed by light microsco-
py, counting ,5000 cells per condition per experiment.
Western blotting
Expression of the autophagosome-associated LC3-II and its
precursor LC3-I as well as cytochrome c were detected by western
blotting using methods previously described [35]. In brief, after
SDS-PAGE of nuclear-free whole cell lysates (20 mg protein per
condition), the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane (ISC BioExpress, Kaysville, UT), blocked in 10% (w/v)
non-fat dry milk at 4uC overnight with shaking, and immuno-
blotted with 1:1000 solution of anti-LC3B antibody in 5% BSA
(w/v) or anti-cytochrome c antibody in 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk
for 1 hr at room temperature shaking. After incubation with
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody
(1:2000) in 5% (w/v) non-fat dry milk for 1 hr at room
temperature, bound antibodies were detected by enhanced
chemoluminescence.
Direct fluorescence to examine autophagosome
formation
Autophagosomes can be directly visualized as cytoplasmic
granules (punctae) that stain positive for LC3-II, a lipoprotein
specific for autophagosomal membranes [40]. To quantify LC3-II-
positive punctae in MTB-infected THP-1 cells with NFkB
inhibition, recombinant GFP-LC3 lentivirus was generated in
the HEK 293 cell line (Cell Biolabs, Inc, San Diego, CA).
Lentiviruses were prepared by co-transfecting packaging plasmids
pVSV-g (Dr. Jerome Schaack, University of Colorado School of
Medicine) and pCMV-HIVdeltaR8.2 (Addgene, plasmid #12263)
using an established protocol [41]. The GFP-LC3 expression
plasmid, pCDH-GFP-LC3, was generated by subcloning the GFP-
LC3 gene from the pEGFP-C3 vector backbone (Addgene) into
the pCDH-puro lentivirus expression vector. GFP-LC3 lentivirus
was transduced into THP-1 cells at a multiplicity of 10 lentiviruses
to one THP-1 cell in the presence of 8 mg/mL Polybrene; GFP
lentivirus served as a positive control and empty vector lentivirus
as a negative control. To quantify autophagosome formation by
fluorescence, GFP-LC3 lentivirus-transduced cells were plated on
chamber slides at 105 cells per well, and allowed to differentiate
overnight with 15 ng/mL PMA at 37uC in 5% CO2. The next
day, the PMA-containing medium was replaced with fresh THP-1
medium (RPMI+10% FBS+1% glutamine). BAY was added at a
concentration of 5 mM per well and was incubated for 1 hr prior
to infection with MTB. Cells were infected with MTB H37Rv at a
MOI of 10 for 24 hrs and fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde
solution for 1 hr at room temperature. After rinsing with PBS, the
cells were then stained with ProLong Gold Antifade reagent with
DAPI (Invitrogen) and placed in the dark at 4uC until use. For
quantifying the number of autophagosomes per cell, the number
of GFP-LC3 punctae were counted from at least 100 cells/well in
duplicate wells for each condition. All the cellular images were
obtained using an inverted confocal fluorescence microscope
(Nikon, Carl Zeiss Axiovert 200 M) and the data analysis using
correlation analysis tool of Slidebook program (Slidebook 4.2).
Statistical analysis
Replicate experiments were independent, and where appropri-
ate, summary results are presented as means 6 SEM. Differences
were considered significant for p,0.05, and all reported p-values
used a two-sided test. For most experiments, group means were
compared by ANOVA using Fisher’s least significance difference
procedure. The AM and MDM cytokine data were analyzed as
follows to account for repeated measures over treatment and time
within subjects. Each outcome variable was fit with a linear mixed
model, using predictor variables of MTB (Y, N), BAY (Y, N), Time

(1, 24, 96, 192 hours), and all interactions of these, up to the 3-way
interaction. Repeated measures on subjects over treatment (4
combinations of MTB–Y/N and BAY–Y/N) and time were
accounted for using a direct (Kronecker) product structure for all
outcome variables except for those noted below. The ‘‘unstruc-
tured’’ covariance structure was used for repeated measures
involving time, while the compound symmetry structure was used
for those involving treatment; the direct product structure allows
these to be modeled simultaneously in one combined covariance
structure. TNFa and IFNc produced by MDM used a simpler
compound symmetric covariance structure since for these outcome
variables the models did not converge using the direct product
covariance structure.
Outcome variables were log transformed for analysis when
necessary (AM-TNFa, THP-1-TNFa, and AM-IFNc), but results
for all outcome variables are presented on the original scale; those
analyzed on the log scale were inverted back for presentation.
Specific pairwise comparisons of interest were between times for
the MTB only treatment, and within times between the MTB only
and MTB + BAY treatments. Such comparisons were only
considered when at least one predictor variable (main effect or
interaction) in the related model was significant.
Results
MTB-induced NFkB activation is inhibited by BAY
MTB induced NFkB activation in THP-1 cells, particularly after
3 and 6 hrs of infection (Figure 1A). In the presence of 5 mM
BAY, NFkB activation was strongly inhibited (Figure 1A). Co-
incubation of the nuclear extract with anti-p50-NFkB antibody
further retarded the migration of NFkB complexes, previously
identified to be p50/p50 and p50/p65 [38]. There was no further
reduction in NFkB activation following administration of 7.5 mM
or 10 mM BAY (data not shown).
We pre-incubated primary human MDM and AM with 5 mM
BAY or 0.1% (v/v) DMSO vehicle for 1 hr, followed by infection
with MTB H37Rv for an additional 3 hrs. Similar to THP-1 cells,
MTB infection of primary MDM and AM induced NFkB
activation,
and
this
activation
was
inhibited
by
BAY
(Figure 1B/C).
Inhibition of NFkB significantly reduces the viability of
intracellular MTB
Differentiated THP-1 cells, MDM, and AM were used to
determine the impact of NFkB inhibition on intracellular recovery
of viable MTB. The mean number of intracellular MTB isolated
1 hr following infection (Day 0) was similar between the control
cells and cells pre-treated with BAY, indicating that inhibition of
NFkB
did
not
impact
the
phagocytosis
of
MTB
by
the
macrophages (Figure 2A,B,C). However, inhibition of NFkB
activation significantly reduced the number of intracellular MTB
recovered 4 days after infection from THP-1 cells by 64%, from
MDM by 67%, and from AM by 63% (Figure 2A,B,C). By 8
days after infection, BAY significantly reduced the number of
viable intracellular MTB by 66% in THP-1 cells, 63% in MDM,
and 71% in AM (Figure 2A,B,C). There was no significant
difference
in the
number
of
CFU
recovered
with higher
concentrations of BAY (7.5 and 10 mM) compared to 5 mM
BAY (data not shown). In the absence of macrophages, 5 mM or
10 mM BAY had no effect on viability of MTB H37Rv compared
to MTB cultured with 0.1% DMSO vehicle (Figure S1).
Trypan blue staining was performed on control THP-1 cells and
cells incubated for 4 days with 5 mM BAY or BAY + MTB.
Approximately 11% of the cells infected with MTB alone were
non-viable whereas ,20% of the cells were non-viable after
incubation with both MTB and BAY (Figure S2).
While we attempted to recover any non-adherent cells at the
Day 4 and Day 8 time points since it would be important to
include any live MTB in these cells, some cells may have been lost
in the recovery process. To validate the CFU data, we infected
THP-1 cells with MTB H37Rv-GFP in the presence or absence of
BAY at the aforementioned times of infection. After the indicated
times, the cells were washed, fixed, and fluorescence intensity
measured. As shown in Figure 2D, the fluorescent intensity of the
BAY-treated THP-1 cells was significantly less than untreated
MTB-infected cells at 4 and 8 days after infection. Moreover, the
relative slope of the fluorescent curves roughly matched those of
the CFU growth curves.
While BAY does not inhibit other signaling pathways such as
the mitogen-activated protein kinases [42,43], we validated our
findings by transducing THP-1 cells with an EIA-deficient
Figure 1. MTB H37Rv induces NFkB binding to its cis-regulatory element. (A) THP-1 cells were pre-treated with 0.1% (v/v) DMSO or 5 mM
BAY for 1 hr, followed by infection with MTB H37Rv at the indicated times. An EMSA was performed with an oligonucleotide that corresponds to the
consensus binding sequence for NFkB. Data shown are representative of three independent experiments. (B) Primary human MDM or (C) AM were
pre-incubated with 0.1% DMSO or 5 mM BAY for 1 hr, then infected with MTB for 3 hrs, and followed by an EMSA to assay for NFkB binding. Data
shown are representative of two independent experiments for MDM and AM. NS = non-specific band. SS = supershift band.

adenovirus (AdV) construct containing a mutant IkBa (AdV-S32/
36A-IkBa) [44,45]. Due to lack of EIA, this attenuated AdV-S32/
36A-IkBa vector is unable to replicate but because the mutated
IkBa cannot be phosphorylated, this dominant-negative IkBa
remains a potent inhibitor of NFkB activation. We have previously
used this construct to effectively inhibit MTB lipoarabinomannan
activation of NFkB [38]. THP-1 cells were transduced with AdV-
GFP (control vector) or AdV-S32/36A-IkBa for 6 hrs, infected
with MTB at a MOI of 10 for 4 days, and cell-associated MTB
were quantified. As shown in Figure 3A, AdV-GFP-infected cells
had similar numbers of MTB compared to MTB infection of
wildtype THP-1 cells; in contrast, the AdV-S32/36A-IkBa-
infected cells had significantly reduced number of cell-associated
MTB, consistent with the results of NFkB inhibition by BAY. To
confirm AdV-S32/36A-IkBa is biologically active in THP-1 cells,
we determined whether MTB-induction of IL-8 could be inhibited
since induction of IL-8 is critically dependent on NFkB [46,47].
THP-1 cells infected with MTB for 24 hrs induced IL-8 but co-
incubation with BAY significantly inhibited IL-8 expression
(Figure 3B). THP-1 cells transduced with Adv-GFP and infected
with MTB also had robust induction of IL-8; in contrast, THP-1
cells transduced with AdV-S32/36A-IkBa and infected with MTB
had significantly lower amounts of MTB-induced IL-8 compared
to AdV-GFP transduced cells (Figure 3B).
Inhibition of NFkB increases apoptosis of macrophages
Apoptosis contributes to the intracellular killing of mycobacteria
[30,48–51]; thus, the effect of NFkB inhibition on apoptosis of
infected
macrophages
was
evaluated.
Following 4 days
of
incubation, there was no difference in extent of TUNEL staining
between uninfected THP-1 cells and THP-1 cells infected with
MTB (Figure 4A). However, there was a significant increase in
apoptosis at 4 days (relative increase in apoptosis of 79%) in BAY-
treated, MTB-infected THP-1 cells (Figure 4A). After 8 days of
infection, there was a modest but significant increase in apoptosis
with MTB infection alone compared to uninfected cells (relative
increase in apoptosis of 34%); in the presence of BAY, there was a
further significant increase in apoptosis of MTB-infected THP-1
cells (Figure 4A).
BAY alone was also found to modestly increase apoptosis of
THP-1 cells in the absence of MTB at 24 hrs; i.e., the level of
TUNEL positivity in THP-1 cells alone was 2.45%; with the
addition of 5 mM BAY, the percent of TUNEL positivity increased
to 5.37%. These results suggest that basally, low levels of NFkB
activation may prevent spontaneous apoptosis in differentiated
THP-1 cells.
We next quantified TUNEL positivity in the MTB-infected
MDM and AM in the presence or absence of BAY. MTB-infected
MDM and AM showed increased apoptosis after 4 days of
infection in the presence of BAY, with relative increases of 170%
and 60%, respectively (Figure 4B,C).
To corroborate that apoptosis is induced by MTB and BAY, we
analyzed the level of cytochrome c, an essential component of the
intrinsic apoptotic pathway, in THP-1 cells infected with MTB
with and without BAY after 48 hrs. MTB alone had little or no
induction of cytochrome c as assessed by western blotting
(Figure 4D). BAY 11-7082 treatment alone had a modest
induction of cytochrome c whereas culture of THP-1 cells with
both MTB and BAY showed a significant induction of cytochrome
c (Figure 4D).
While the absolute change in apoptosis was small, there was a
large decrease in bacterial recovery from macrophages. This
phenomenon can occur when killing mechanisms other than

uniformly infected with MTB. To assess the latter, THP-1 cells
were infected with MTB H37Rv-GFP for 1 hr and visualized by
fluorescent microscopy. Shown in lower magnification is a

one macrophage is heavily infected (arrows in panels 1 and 2
of Figure 4E) while others were much less burdened or not
infected (Figure 4E, panel 2). The cells were also stained with
DAPI and the merged images are shown in Figure 4E, panel 3
and further magnified in Figure 4E, panel 4. Similar findings
were also seen with the infected MDM and AM with Auramine
acid-fast staining (data not shown).
Caspase-3 inhibition abrogates BAY-induced apoptosis
To
determine
whether
BAY-induced
apoptosis
impacted
viability of intracellular MTB, we analyzed the effect of inhibiting
apoptosis using a specific caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk).
Caspase-3 is an executioner caspase for both the intrinsic and
extrinsic pathways of classical apoptosis. THP-1 cells infected with
MTB or cultured with BAY for 48 hrs showed a modest induction
of activated caspase-3 whereas cells cultured with both MTB and
BAY showed robust caspase-3 activation (Figure 5A). Co-culture
with 10 mM of the caspase-3 inhibitor (z-DEVD-fmk) showed a
significant abrogation of MTB+BAY activation of caspase-3
(Figure 5A). THP-1 cells were infected with MTB alone,

MTB+5 mM BAY, or MTB+BAY and 10 mM z-DEVD-fmk. At
1 hr, 2 days, and 4 days after infection, cells were lysed and lysates
cultured for MTB. As seen previously, compared to MTB alone,
addition of BAY significantly reduced the number of MTB in
THP-1 cells (Figure 5B). With caspase-3 inhibition, BAY-
mediated
decrease
in
CFU
was
significantly
abrogated
(Figure 5B).
To confirm that caspase-3 inhibition reduces the induction of
apoptosis by MTB and BAY, infected THP-1 cells were incubated
with BAY in the presence or absence of the specific caspase-3
inhibitor, z-DEVD-fmk. Increased apoptosis was observed in
BAY+MTB-infected cells after 48 hrs; in the presence of z-DEVD-
fmk,
MTB

induced
apoptosis
was
significantly
suppressed (Figure 5C). There was no significant difference
between the effects of 10 mM and 20 mM of z-DEVD-fmk in
regard to both intracellular number of MTB and apoptosis (data
not shown).
Inhibition of NFkB induces autophagy in MTB-infected
THP-1 cells
Autophagy is a cellular process by which cytoplasmic organelles
and molecules are catabolized, and is increasingly recognized as an
effector mechanism by which host cells kill intracellular MTB and
other intracellular pathogens [4,6,52]. With initiation of autoph-
agy, an LC3-II-mediated double membrane forms around the
cytoplasmic or intraphagosomal organisms, forming autophago-
somes that more readily fuses with lysosomes, resulting in the
killing of the organisms by lysosomal machinery [40].
Immediately following synthesis of LC3, its C-terminal fragment
is cleaved to yield a cytosolic form of LC3 termed LC3-I. During
induction of autophagy, LC3-I is conjugated with phosphatidyl-
ethanolamine (PE) to form LC3-II, which binds to both the outer
and inner autophagosomal membranes [53]. Thus, LC3-II is a
highly specific marker of autophagosome formation [6]. Although
LC3-II has a higher molecular weight than LC3-I, it runs lower on
SDS-PAGE due to the physical properties of the lipid attachment.
Thus, we determined the effects of NFkB inhibition and MTB
infection on the levels of the autophagic marker LC3-II.
THP-1 cells were exposed to the following conditions for 24 hrs:
RPMI medium+10% FBS+1% glutamine+0.1% DMSO (unsti-
mulated control), RPMI without FBS (starvation control), 5 mM
BAY, MTB, or both MTB and BAY, followed by western blotting
for LC3-I and LC3-II. This time point were found to be optimal to
observe an increase in LC3-II by autophagy induction. Immuno-
blot showed increased LC3-II in lysates of starved cells compared
to
unstimulated
control
cells
(DMSO)
(Figure
6A).
BAY
treatment or MTB infection also modestly induced more LC3-II
formation and when the cells were incubated with both MTB and
BAY, there was a further increase in LC3-II (Figure 6A).
To validate the immunoblot data, we quantified the average
number of LC3-II-positive autophagosomes per cell using THP-1
cells transduced with GFP-LC3 lentivirus. Transduced THP-1
cells were either left uninfected or infected with MTB for 24 hrs.
We found that MTB infection alone significantly increased the
number of GFP-LC3 punctae per cell compared to uninfected cells
by 4 to 5-fold (Figure 6B). Following NFkB inhibition of MTB-
infected THP-1 cells, the average number of GFP-LC3 punctae
per cell further increased by an additional ,2.5-fold (Figure 6B).
To corroborate whether autophagy plays a role in reducing the
number of viable intracellular MTB recovered, we inhibited
autophagy in MTB-infected THP-1 cells that were treated with
BAY using the established autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine
(3-MA), an inhibitor of class III PI3 kinase, an upstream signaling
molecule of the autophagic signaling cascade [54]. As shown in
Figure 6C, LC3-II was increased in MTB-infected THP-1 cells
treated with BAY compared to THP-1 cells infected with MTB
alone. With addition of 6 mM 3-MA in the culture medium, there
was significant reduction in LC3-II levels. THP-1 cells were then
infected with MTB alone or MTB+5 mM BAY with and without
addition of 6 mM 3-MA. The cells were then cultured for 4 days
and cell-associated MTB was quantified. As shown in Figure 6D,
BAY reduced the number of MTB recovered, which was
significantly abrogated by the addition of 3-MA.

The effects of NFkB inhibition on intracellular MTB are
independent of TNFa and IFNc expression
TNFa can induce apoptosis [31,55,56] and IFNc can induce
autophagy in MTB-infected macrophages through immunity-
related p47 guanosine triphosphatases (IRG) [6,33]. Additionally,
NFkB is an important transcription factor in the induction of both
IFNc and TNFa [57]. We examined the production of TNFa and
IFNc in MTB-infected human macrophages with or without
NFkB inhibition. THP-1 cells had no detectable IFNc and had
minimal induction of TNFa by MTB at the time points examined
(data not shown). In MDM, TNFa and IFNc were minimally
induced by MTB infection (Figure 7). In AM, TNFa and IFNc
were induced by MTB infection and BAY significantly inhibited
their expression (Figure 7). The inhibition of TNFa and IFNc
expression in AM by BAY occurred despite concomitant decreases
in MTB recovered. These results indicate that inhibition of
bacterial growth following inhibition of NFkB activation is likely
independent of TNFa and IFNc production.
Discussion
In human macrophages, inhibition of NFkB activation reduced
the viability of intracellular MTB through increased induction of
apoptosis and autophagy. While we showed that inhibition of
NFkB enhanced macrophage response to MTB, it is important to
note that NFkB is a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in
many
cellular
processes
associated
with
inflammation
and
infections. For example, suboptimal binding of NFkB to a cis-
regulatory site on the 59-flanking region of the IFNc gene promoter
leads to decreased production of IFNc [58], a cytokine that is

critically important in host-defense against mycobacterial infec-
tions. While others have shown that NFkB activation in mouse
macrophages resulted in increased killing of mycobacteria, those
studies primarily used non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis
[59,60]. These studies, combined with our findings, suggest that
NFkB plays roles in both host-defense and host-susceptibility,
depending on the microbial pathogen and the host species.
Since mice lacking the p50 subunit of NFkB suffered worsened
MTB infection as compared to wildtype mice [23], we predicted
that pharmacologic inhibition of NFkB activation in human
macrophages
would result in increased recovery of viable
intracellular MTB. In contrast, we found that inhibition of NFkB
activation resulted in significantly fewer viable intracellular MTB
despite similar number of bacilli phagocytosed. One possible
reason for the discrepancy between the prior mouse study and our
current work with human macrophages is that production of nitric
oxide, which is critically dependent on NFkB activation, plays a
central role in killing intracellular MTB in mice [61]. Indeed,
MTB-infected p50 –/– mice had significantly less inducible nitric
oxide synthase expression in their lung tissues than infected
wildtype mice [23]. In contrast, the role of nitric oxide in killing
MTB in humans and human macrophages is considered far less
important [62]. Additionally, there are inherent differences in the
in vivo mouse study and our in vitro/ex vivo human macrophage
studies. For example, in the p50-knockout mice, NFkB complexes
containing the p50 subunit are silenced in all cell types including
macrophages; in contrast, we examined macrophages in isolation.
On the other hand, because we used a pharmacologic inhibitor of
IKK as well as a dominant-negative IkBa, our experimental
approach is expected to inhibit activation of not only p50-
containing NFkB complexes but all NFkB complexes, which are
comprised of dimers of various subunits (Rel A, c-Rel (p65), RelB,
p50, and p52). Since there are several different types of NFkB
complexes, an additional possibility is that there are differences
between mouse and human cells in the ability of various NFkB
complexes to affect immune response. This notion is consistent
with the work of Gutierrez and co-workers who showed that in
murine macrophages, activation of NFkB by some host lipids can
induce killing of MTB whereas other lipids can induce killing of
mycobacteria independent of NFkB activation [60]. Finally, the
mouse study employed a different strain of MTB (Kurono strain)
than the current study (H37Rv). Since different strains of MTB can
induce varying degrees of apoptosis in host cells [51], differences in

the MTB strain used may impact the importance of apoptosis in
killing intracellular MTB with NFkB inhibition.
After discovering that inhibition of NFkB activation decreased
intracellular
MTB
recovery,
we
next
sought
out
potential
mechanism(s). We found in all three types of human macrophages
that decreased number of MTB recovered following NFkB
inhibition correlated with increased apoptosis, an important
effector
killing
mechanism
of
intracellular
MTB
[30,48,50,51,53]. Moreover, since there was non-uniformity of
MTB infection of macrophages, apoptosis of relatively few but
heavily infected cells could account for the significant reduction in
the number of viable intracellular MTB recovered. While
inhibition of classical apoptosis with inhibition of caspase-3
significantly abrogated the effects of BAY in terms of CFU and
apoptosis, the reversal was not complete, suggesting that the effects
of BAY may also involve caspase-3–independent programmed cell
death mechanisms [63]. Based on our finding that the percent of
non-viable cells as determined by Trypan blue staining was greater
than the percentage of cells that were undergoing apoptosis, we
believe that some of the infected cells are also undergoing necrosis
as well. This is supported by studies showing that with MOI of 5
and 10, MTB H37Rv caused both apoptosis and necrosis of
human macrophages [64]. This may explain the finding that even
though inhibition of NFkB decreased the number of cell-
associated MTB, the growth curve was still increasing over time;
i.e., we posit that in contrast to cells undergoing apoptosis, MTB
remain viable in necrotic cells and upon release, have the potential
to be phagocytosed by other macrophages and proliferate. Thus,
we believe the overall fate of MTB cultured in macrophages is a
dynamic process with some bacteria being killed while others
proliferate, with the net biological effect being decreased number
of intracellular MTB with inhibition of NFkB.
While TNFa has been shown by others to induce apoptosis in
the context of MTB infection, there was little induction of TNFa in
either THP-1 cells or MDM infected with MTB. For the THP-1
cells, we believe the minimal TNFa production may be due to the

development of ‘‘tolerance’’ of these cells to subsequent MTB-
induced cytokine production since we incubated the THP-1 cells
with PMA for 2 to 3 days before changing the medium and
infecting with MTB. We have since found that differentiating these
cells over a shorter, overnight PMA incubation preserves the
ability of THP-1 cells to produce cytokines in response to MTB
without impact on intracellular survival of MTB [35].
Dhiman and co-workers previously showed that THP-1 cells, in
which NFkB was suppressed via transfection with a mutated,
dominant-negative form of IkBa, were less burdened by intracel-
lular MTB [65]. Similar to our findings, the decrease in bacterial
growth due to suppression of NFkB coincided with increased
apoptosis of the transfected THP-1 cells [65]. We extended these
findings by utilizing two types of primary human macrophages.
Additionally, we showed that inhibition of classical apoptosis
abrogated the reduction in intracellular CFU induced by NFkB
inhibition. While Loeuillet et al showed that TLR2-mediated
activation of NFkB prevented MTB infected THP-1 cells from
undergoing Fas ligand mediated apoptosis [66], the anti-apoptotic
effect of NFkB may involve induction of several anti-apoptotic
gene products that ultimately inhibit caspase-3 activation [28].
NFkB may also interfere with apoptosis via direct protein-protein
interaction such as direct coupling of NFkB subunits and c-IAP2,
providing a signal amplification loop that promotes cell survival
independent of de novo protein synthesis [28]. Activation of NFkB
in the context of infections with Bartonella, Ehrlichia, or Rickettsia has
also been shown to inhibit apoptosis of host cells by preventing the
release of cytochrome c [67]. The increased vulnerability of AIDS
patients to TB is most likely related to impaired effector T cell
function [68,69]. However, increased NFkB activation seen in
HIV positive individuals could also impair the ability of their
MTB-infected macrophages to undergo apoptosis [56,70], provid-
ing another mechanism for their predisposition to TB.
NFkB inhibition also increased the formation of autophago-
somes. Since autophagy has been shown to be an efficient killing
mechanism of intracellular MTB [4,6,52], induction of apoptosis
and autophagy are two mechanisms by which NFkB inhibition
reduced the number of intracellular bacilli (Figure 8). Due to
experimental
limitations,
we
could
not
determine
whether
apoptotic cells were the exact same cells undergoing autophagy.
However, it is plausible that autophagy may be activated in dying
cells, perhaps as an attempt by dying cells to survive [71]. Since we

detected increased autophagy in MTB-infected cells in which
NFkB activation was inhibited at 24 hrs, whereas induction of
apoptosis was seen later, it suggests that autophagy is not likely to
be a secondary response to apoptosis in our experimental model.
However, we cannot exclude the possibility that autophagy may be
induced in response to the earliest stages of apoptosis. Conse-
quently, there is a possibility that both processes may occur in the
same cell over an extended period of time, but experimentally this
would be very difficult to prove. Furthermore, the interplay
between these NFkB-mediated mechanisms of MTB killing is likely
complicated by the fact that NFkB can regulate its own activation
by opposing mechanisms; i.e., NFkB activation induces the
production of its inhibitory molecule IkBa (Figure 8, blue
arrow) and yet NFkB inhibition of autophagy can increase IKK
activity since this kinase is normally degraded by the autophagic
process [72] (Figure 8, red line).
Cytokines and microbial products can activate other transcrip-
tion factors such as AP-1 and ATF-2, which likely play important
roles in the host immune response to MTB [42,73]. A class of
transcription factors known as nuclear receptors have recently
been
implicated
in
host-mycobacterial
interactions
[74,75].
Mahajan and co-workers [75] showed that during MTB infection
of macrophages, MTB-derived lipids and macrophage-derived
lipids
can
combine
with
lipid-sensing
nuclear
receptors
–
peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARc) and
testicular receptor 4 (TR4) – to induce expression of genes that
ultimately enhances intracellular survival of MTB. In addition,
activation of either of these receptors induced alternate activation
of macrophages to the M2 phenotype [75], which would be
expected to impair effective host immune response against MTB.
These nuclear receptors are immune evasive factors since
mycobacteria can induce the expression of PPARc [74]. In
contrast, activation of another type of nuclear receptor (LXRa)
decreases lipidogenesis and enhances host immunity against MTB
[75].
In summary, we found that inhibiting NFkB activation in
macrophages resulted in increased apoptosis and autophagy, and
decreased recovery of viable intracellular MTB. There are
hundreds of natural and synthetic compounds known to inhibit
NFkB activation, including various antioxidants, proteasome and
protease inhibitors, and IKK inhibitors (http://people.bu.edu/
gilmore/nf-kb/inhibitors/index.html). It is clear that the role of
NFkB following MTB infection is complicated. Future studies
could consider utilizing mixed cell cultures to determine the effects
of NFkB inhibition on the collaboration between macrophages
and T cells. Furthermore, it is plausible that NFkB activation may
be important in the early phase of infection but continued
activation may be deleterious to the host. Thus, future in vivo
studies could inhibit NFkB at different time points of infection to
begin to delineate ‘‘host-protective’’ vs. ‘‘host-susceptible’’ NFkB-
mediated pathways.

complex process. IKK = IkBa kinase.
