Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a facultative intracellular pathogen that parasitizes macrophages by modulating properties
of the Mycobacterium-containing phagosome. Mycobacterial phagosomes do not fuse with late endosomal/lysosomal
organelles but retain access to early endosomal contents by an unknown mechanism. We have previously reported that
mycobacterial phosphatidylinositol analog lipoarabinomannan (LAM) blocks a trans-Golgi network-to-phagosome phos-
phatidylinositol 3-kinase–dependent pathway. In this work, we extend our investigations of the effects of mycobacterial
phosphoinositides on host membrane trafﬁcking. We present data demonstrating that phosphatidylinositol mannoside
(PIM) speciﬁcally stimulated homotypic fusion of early endosomes in an ATP-, cytosol-, and N-ethylmaleimide sensitive
factor-dependent manner. The fusion showed absolute requirement for small Rab GTPases, and the stimulatory effect of
PIM increased upon partial depletion of membrane Rabs with RabGDI. We found that stimulation of early endosomal
fusion by PIM was higher when phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was inhibited by wortmannin. PIM also stimulated in
vitro fusion between model phagosomes and early endosomes. Finally, PIM displayed in vivo effects in macrophages by
increasing accumulation of plasma membrane-endosomal syntaxin 4 and transferrin receptor on PIM-coated latex bead
phagosomes. In addition, inhibition of phagosomal acidiﬁcation was detected with PIM-coated beads. The effects of PIM,
along with the previously reported action of LAM, suggest that M. tuberculosis has evolved a two-prong strategy to modify
its intracellular niche: its products block acquisition of late endosomal/lysosomal constituents, while facilitating fusion
with early endosomal compartments.
INTRODUCTION
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an intracellular parasite that
survives in infected macrophages by modulating phagoso-
mal biogenesis and maturation. After phagocytosis, myco-
bacteria reside in phagosomes that do not acquire late en-
dosomal and lysosomal characteristics (Armstrong and
Hart, 1971; Russell et al., 2002). Another important aspect of
the mycobacterial phagosome is that the vacuole seems to
retain access to markers derived from plasma membrane
(Clemens and Horwitz, 1996; Russell et al., 1996; Sturgill-
Koszycki et al., 1996), allowing acquisition of nutrients, such
as iron (Schaible et al., 2002), by M. tuberculosis.
The mycobacterial factors affecting phagosome matura-
tion are only now beginning to be identiﬁed (Vergne et al.,
2003a). In recent studies (Fratti et al., 2001, 2003b), lipoarabi-
nomannan (LAM), a heavily glycosylated phosphatidylino-
sitol exclusively produced by mycobacteria, has been shown
to interfere with phagosomal acquisition of late endosomal
constituents. LAM, and a number of other mycobacterial
lipids, have been reported to trafﬁc within the infected mac-
rophages and intercalate into the host cell endomembranes
(Beatty et al., 2000). One of the M. tuberculosis glycolipids
shown to impregnate host cell endomembranes is phospha-
tidylinositol mannoside (PIM) (Figure 1A), a biosynthetic
precursor of LAM. PIM is abundantly produced by myco-
bacteria and represents 56% of all phospholipids in the
mycobacterial cell wall (Goren, 1984).
Historically, inositol phospholipids were ﬁrst recognized
as general components of biological membranes by studies
carried out in mycobacteria (Anderson and Roberts, 1930;
Ballou and Lee, 1964). Over many years of research, it has
become evident that phosphatidylinositols and their differ-
ent phosphorylated forms are important regulatory mole-
cules in eukaryotic cells. Numerous studies have shown that
phosphoinositides play important roles in signal transduc-
tion, cytoskeletal organization, and, more recently, in regu-
lating discrete membrane trafﬁcking events in organellar
biogenesis (for reviews, see De Camilli et al., 1996; Corvera et
al., 1999; Gillooly et al., 2001; Simonsen et al., 2001). Phos-

phoinositides are substrates for modifying enzymes, such as
phosphatidylinositol kinases, phosphatases, and phospho-
lipases. Phosphatidylinositol (PI), when phosphorylated in
various combinations at the 3, 4, or 5 positions of the inositol
ring (Figure 1B), earmarks the organelles or their membrane
domains for subsequent trafﬁcking events. One manifesta-
tion of these phenomena is the recruitment of membrane
fusion effector proteins containing speciﬁc phosphoinositide
binding domains (Simonsen et al., 2001).
Phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) is an example of
phosphoinositides relevant for phagosomal maturation in
the context of M. tuberculosis interference with the intracel-
lular trafﬁcking in infected macrophages (Fratti et al., 2001).
PI3P recruits the endosomal tethering molecule EEA1 to the
endocytic organelles (Simonsen et al., 1998). EEA1 is essen-
tial for phagosomal maturation into phagolysosomes (Fratti
et al., 2001; Vieira et al., 2002), and its recruitment to M.
tuberculosis phagosomes is altered as a part of the mycobac-
terial phagosome maturation block (Fratti et al., 2001). The
mycobacterial heavily glycosylated phosphatidylinositol an-
alog LAM inhibits EEA1 recruitment to phagosomal mem-
branes (Fratti et al., 2001), which leads to a disruption of
delivery of lysosomal hydrolases and Vo HATPase from
the trans-Golgi network (TGN) to the phagosome (Fratti et
al., 2003b). These effect of LAM, exerted via a block in
[Ca2]c rise (Vergne et al., 2003b), while explaining at least in
part the mycobacterial phagosome maturation block, also
open the question of how mycobacteria maintain the inter-
actions with early endosomes. The latter phenomenon has
been postulated to exist based on the observed delivery of
transferrin receptor and iron to mycobacterial phagosomes
(Clemens and Horwitz, 1996; Sturgill-Koszycki et al., 1996;
Schaible et al., 2002)
Based on the pivotal role that phosphatidylinositols play
in intracellular signaling and trafﬁcking in mammalian cells
(De Camilli et al., 1996; Corvera et al., 1999; Gillooly et al.,
2001; Simonsen et al., 2001), combined with the observations
that M. tuberculosis produces PI analogs, such as LAM and
PIM, which intercalate into the endomembranes of infected
macrophages (Beatty et al., 2000), we have continued our
investigations (Fratti et al., 2001, 2003b; Vergne et al., 2003b)
of whether and how mycobacterial phosphoinositides mod-
ulate interactions of M. tuberculosis phagosome with endo-
cytic and biosynthetic organelles of the host cell. In this
work, we report a surprising and previously unappreciated
activity of PIM. We show that this mycobacterial phospho-
lipid stimulates homotypic fusion of early endosomes.
Moreover, PIM enhances fusion between phagosomes and
early endosomes. We also report that PIM affects phagoso-
mal properties in vivo.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Puriﬁed Rab-GDP-dissociation inhibitor (GDI) was a gift from Drs. G.J. Quell-
horst and M. Wessling-Resnick, Harvard University. 1,2-Bis(2-aminophe-
noxy)ethane-N,N,N,N-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA), anti-avidin antibody, wort-
mannin, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-
bisphosphate were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). N-ethylmaleimide
(NEM), guanosine 5-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTPS), phosphatidylinositol,
and other products used for in vitro fusion were from Sigma.
Fractionation of Lipids, Puriﬁcation of Phosphatidylinosi-
tol Mannosides, and Preparation of Lipid Suspensions
and Lipid-coated Beads
Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27299) cells grown to late log phase
in glycerol alanine salts medium (Takayama et al., 1975) were harvested,
inactivated by -irradiation (Covert et al., 2001), and lyophilized. Dried My-
cobacterium bovis BCG Pasteur (TMC 1011) was a kind gift from Dr. Patrick J.
Brennan (Colorado State University). The dried cells were extracted at room
temperature for 24 h with CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) at 30 ml/g of cells. The cells
and organic extract were separated by ﬁltration through Whatman 17 CHR
chromatography paper. The ﬁltrate was dried suspended in a biphasic mix-
ture of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (4:2:1) (Folch et al., 1957), and the lower organic
phase was recovered. This material was termed the CM total lipid extract. The
extracted cells were recovered from the ﬁlter paper and extracted a second
time for 24 h at room temperature with CHCl3/CH3OH/H20 (10:10:3) to
recover polar glycolipids and lipoglycans (Besra et al., 1997). This extract was
termed the total polar lipid extract (CMW).
A portion of the dried CM total lipid and the total polar lipid extracts
(CMW) were placed on ice, cold (20°C) acetone was added to each at 30
ml/g of lipid, and the material was thoroughly suspended. Each acetone
trituration was centrifuged at 10,000  g, 4°C for 20 min. The acetone
supernatants were collected and the insoluble pellet washed twice more with
cold acetone. The supernatants of each lipid sample were pooled and dried
along with the acetone-insoluble pellets. This resulted in acetone soluble (AS)
and acetone insoluble fractions (AI) of the CM total lipid and CMW extracts.
To isolate PIM, the acetone-insoluble fraction of the CM total lipid extract
from the M. bovis BCG Pasteur was applied to a column (3.5  35 cm) of silica
(Merck AG, Darmstadt, Germany) equilibrated with CHCl3/CH3OH (9:1).
Lipids were eluted with 500-ml step gradients of increasing CH3OH concen-
trations (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50%) in CHCl3. The resulting fractions were
examined by silica gel thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in CHCl3/CH3OH/
H20 (60:30:6) and resolved lipids visualized by spraying with -napthol and
10% CuSO4 in 8% H2SO4 (Kates, 1986). The 40 and 50% CH3OH fractions were

enriched for PIM. These fractions were pooled and separated by preparative
TLC by using a 20  20-cm glass-backed silica gel TLC plate (Merck AG)
developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H20 (60:30:6). Individual lipid bands were
visualized using iodine vapors (Dawson et al., 1993) and scraped from the
TLC plates. The puriﬁed lipids (PIM) were extracted from the silica gel in
CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). The puriﬁed PIM was compared with standards by
one-dimensional TLC, two-dimensional TLC, and gas chromatography (Bren-
nan and Ballou, 1968; Khoo et al., 1995).
Lipid suspension were prepared by solubilization of lipids in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), injection of this solution into phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) while vortexing, followed by sonication (ﬁnal lipid concentration 0.8
mg/ml in 8% DMSO in PBS). Standard PIM concentration used was 40
g/ml, as described previously with phosphoinositides (Mayer et al., 2000;
Defacque et al., 2002) with the exception of experiments with PIM preincu-
bation with the cytosol, when 80 g/ml PIM was used, and when stated
otherwise.
Lipid-coated beads were prepared as described previously (Kang and
Schlesinger, 1998). Latex beads were washed in NaHCO3, pH 9.6, and incu-
bated for 2 h at 37°C in the presence or absence of PIM in NaHCO3.
Preparation of Endosomes and Cytosol for In Vitro
Fusion
The murine macrophage-like cell line J774 was maintained in DMEM supple-
mented with 4 mM l-glutamine and 5% fetal bovine serum. Suspended J774
cells were incubated with either 1.7 mg/ml biotinylated horseradish peroxi-
dase (b-HRP) or 3.3 mg/ml avidin at 37°C in 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM HEPES/
KOH, pH 7.4, 5.5 mM glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 5
min (early endosomes loading) or for 20-min pulse and 40-min chase (late
endosomes loading). Cells were washed several times with PBS, PBS with 5
mg/ml BSA, and then homogenized in 250 mM sucrose, 3 mM imidazole, pH
7.2, 0.5 mM EGTA, cocktail of protease inhibitors (10 g/ml N-tosyl-l-lysine
chloromethyl ketone, 1.79 g/ml E64, 1 nM pepstatin, 10 g/ml leupeptin),
and a postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was prepared as described previously
(Via et al., 1997). PNS was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
80°C. Endosome enriched fractions were prepared by diluting 1 volume of
rapidly thawed PNS with 4 volumes of 250 mM sucrose, 20 mM HEPES/
KOH, pH 7.2, 0.5 mM EGTA, and protease inhibitors. The diluted PNS was
centrifuged 1min at 37,000  g for early endosomes or at 25,000  g for late
endosomes. The supernatant was recovered and was centrifuged 5 min at
50,000  g. The pellet of the second centrifugation was used as a fraction
enriched for early endosomes (Mayorga et al., 1991). For cytosol preparation,
PNS from J774 was centrifuged 1 h at 150,000  g at 4°C and the supernatant
was aliquoted, quickly frozen in ethanol/dry ice, and stored at 80°C.
Homotypic Early Endosome Fusion Assay
Avidin- and b-HRP-loaded early endosomes (0.5 mg/ml) were combined at
4°C in the presence of cytosol (1–3 mg/ml) and 60 g/ml biotinylated-insulin
(b-insulin), as a scavenger for external avidin leaked from endosomes, and
incubated at room temperature, for 20 min with PIM, other lipids, or carrier
(0.8% DMSO). Fusion reactions were performed in 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM
dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EGTA, 20 mM HEPES/KOH, pH 7.2, with an ATP-
regenerating system (1 mM ATP, 8 mM creatine phosphate, 28 U/ml creatine
phosphokinase) or ATP-depleting system (10 mM glucose, 10 U/ml apyrase).
Reactions were initiated by rising the temperature to 37°C and stopped by
placing the tubes on ice. After 5 min on ice, endosomes were solubilized in 1%
(vol/vol) Triton X-100, 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS, 50 g/ml b-insulin for 30 min at
0°C and diluted in 0.05% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM
Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml heparin. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000  g,
for 5 min and the supernatants assayed for avidin-b–HRP complexes by using
precoated anti-avidin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plates (Braell,
1992). HRP activity was measured by ﬂuorescence in a Gemini ﬂuorescent
plate reader by using QuantaBlu substrate from Pierce Chemical (Rockford,
IL), and excitation and emission wavelengths of 320 and 405 nm, respectively.
To determine the level of extravesicular probes, early endosome fractions
containing b-HRP or avidin were mixed, incubated for 1 h at 37°C, in the
absence of ATP and b-inusulin, and then processed as described above for
fusion assay.
Phagosome-Early Endosomes Fusion Assay
Macrophages were incubated for 30 min at 37°C, 5% CO2 with streptavidin
magnetic particles (Polysciences, Warrington PA) (1/45) in 150 mM NaCl, 20
mM HEPES pH 7.4, 6.5 mM glucose, 1 mg/ml BSA. After three washes with
cold PBS, cells were lysed by passing through 22-gauge needles connected to
a two-syringe apparatus. PNSs were generated and phagosomes were iso-
lated using a magnetic separator (Polysciences) and resuspend in 250 mM
sucrose, 3 mM imidazole, pH 7.2, 0.5 mM EGTA, protease inhibitors. Early
endosomes loaded with b-HRP were prepared as described above. Early
endosome fraction (0.6 mg/ml) and phagosomes (0.8 mg/ml) were combined
at 4°C in the presence of cytosol (2 mg/ml) and 140 g/ml biotinylated-
insulin (b-insulin), as a scavenger. Fusion reactions were performed in 250
mM sucrose, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM EGTA, 20 mM HEPES/KOH, pH
7.2, with an ATP-regenerating system or ATP-depleting system. Reactions
were initiated by rising the temperature to 37°C, incubating for 1 h and
stopped by placing the tubes on ice. Phagosomes were isolated with the
magnetic separator, resuspended in 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 0.1% (wt/vol)
SDS, 100 g/ml b-insulin, diluted in 0.05% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 50 mM
NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mg/ml heparin and incubated at 4°C for 30
min to lyse the membranes. Particles were washed two times with 1% (vol/
vol) Triton X-100, 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,
1 mM EDTA, 0.5% ﬁsh skin gelatin, and then two times with PBS. HRP
activity bound to streptavidin particles was measured as described above.
Fluorescence Microscopy
J774 cells grown on glass coverslips and allowed to phagocytize latex beads.
Synchronization of infection was achieved by centrifugation of particles onto
macrophages. Macrophages were ﬁxed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, fol-
lowed by membrane permeabilization by using 0.2% saponin. Permeabilized
cells were incubated with primary antibody, syntaxin 4 (from A. Hubbard
and P. Tuma, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) or transferrin recep-
tor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), followed by secondary Alexa
568-conjugated antibody. LysoTracker Red DN-99 (Molecular Probes, Eu-
gene, OR) staining was carried out as described previously (Via et al., 1998).
The presence of syntaxin 4 on phagosomes was scored by morphological
criteria, as described previously (Fratti et al., 2001, 2003b) and the formation of
a rim-like structure (red channel) around latex bead phagosomes (green
channel) was scored as a positive event. Images were collected and processed
using LSR Esprit or Ultraview for acquisition of confocal images and Adobe
PhotoShop software. The effect of mycobacterial lipids on the accumulation of
syntaxin 4 was veriﬁed by extracting lipid coated latex beads with Triton
X-100. Relative to control beads, Syntaxin 4 colocalization with Triton X-100–
extracted beads was unaffected.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were calculated using Fisher’s protected least signiﬁ-
cant difference post hoc test (analysis of variance, ANOVA) (SuperANOVA
1.11; Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). P values of 0.05 were considered
signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
Mycobacterial Phosphatidylinositol Mannoside PIM
Stimulates Early Endosomal Fusion
An in vitro system to monitor early endosomal fusion by
using puriﬁed organelles has been established previously
(Mayorga et al., 1991; Braell, 1992). In this assay, two popu-
lations of puriﬁed endosomes, separately loaded with either
avidin or b-HRP, are mixed in the presence of cytosol and
ATP, to allow tethering, docking, and fusion. Organellar
fusion is then quantitated using an HRP ﬂuorescent assay
after capture of avidin–b-HRP complexes that form only
upon the mixing of the lumenal contents of the fusing en-
dosomes. Puriﬁed endosomal fractions were preincubated
for 20 min with a panel of M. tuberculosis products, including
PIM, before initiating fusion reactions by adding salt and
ATP-regenerating system. Different lipid fractions from M.
tuberculosis showed for the most part inhibitory or minor
stimulatory
effects
on
endosomal
fusion
(Figure
1C),
whereas PIM increased early endosomal fusion (Figure 1C).
PIM-dependent stimulation was 25% when PIM was added
to the mixture at the outset of the fusion PIM reaction
(Figure
1C,
main
panel).
When
the
cytosol
and
PIM were preincubated in the presence of ATP for 20 min
before the initiation of the fusion reaction, the stimulatory
effect activity of PIM was further augmented to a 2.5-fold
increase in fusion (Figure 1C, inset). Figure 2A shows that
the observed stimulatory effect of PIM on endosomal fusion
was ATP and cytosol dependent. Because, the fusion in-
duced by PIM required ATP and cytosolic factors, PIM did
not act simply as a fusogenic lipid bypassing regulated
vesicle fusion (Hinkovska-Galcheva et al., 1998). We also
tested whether PIM potentially acted as a detergent causing
nonspeciﬁc content leak from vesicles. When the amount of
probe outside the vesicles was measured, extraorganellar

HRP levels were the same in the presence or absence of PIM
(Figure 2A, inset).
We next examined whether PIM-mediated stimulation of
fusion acts via the involvement of known membrane fusion
factors, such as N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF).
NSF is critical for membrane fusion as it primes the soluble
N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein recep-
tors (SNAREs) for subsequent formation of trans-SNARE
complexes leading to organellar fusion (Haas, 1998). Figure
2B shows that PIM did not promote fusion in the presence of
the NSF inhibitor N-ethylmaleimide. This, along with the
ATP and cytosol dependence of PIM effects, demonstrates
that PIM acts by enhancing regulated early endosomal fu-
sion. The magnitude of the stimulatory effect by PIM was
cytosol concentration dependent, because at higher concen-
trations of cytosol, PIM did not increase endosomal fusion
(Figure 2C). A kinetic analysis using intermediate concen-
trations of cytosol (2 mg/ml) showed that PIM acted by both
increasing the rate of fusion (Figure 2D and inset) and
enhancing the extent of fusion (Figure 2D).
Speciﬁc Stimulation of Homotypic Early Endosomal
Fusion by PIM
The stimulation of fusion was speciﬁc for PIM, as ManLAM,
a polyglycosylated form of PIM, did not enhance fusion
(Figure 3A). We also tested two eukaryotic phosphatidylino-
sitols,
PI3P
and
phosphatidylinositol
4,5-bisphosphate
(PIP2), known to participate in early endosomal (Simonsen
et al., 1998) or vacuolar (Mayer et al., 2000) fusion. However,
in contrast to PIM, PI3P and PIP2 did not enhance early
endosomal fusion (Figure 3A).
Most of the regulated fusion events in the cell are NSF
dependent. Within the endocytic pathway, these include
homotypic early endosomal (Diaz et al., 1988; Holroyd et al.,
1999) or late endosomal fusion events (Haas, 1998; Mullock
et al., 1998). To examine whether PIM acts speciﬁcally at a

certain stage, or, alternatively, indiscriminately activates any
regulated endosomal fusion, we compared its effects on
early versus late homotypic endosomal fusion. In contrast to
its stimulatory effect on early endosomes, PIM did not en-
hance fusion between late endosomes (Figure 3B), indicating
that the effects of PIM are speciﬁc for early endosomal
fusion.
Fusion Stimulation by PIM Requires Rab GTPases
The endosomal GTPase Rab5 is essential for early endoso-
mal fusion. Rab5 recruits to endosomes several Rab5-inter-
acting components and downstream effectors important for
membrane tethering and fusion (Gorvel et al., 1991). In the
absence of Rab5, endosomal fusion is inhibited (Barbieri et
al., 1998). Rabs can be removed from membranes by adding
the protein known as GDI, which plucks Rabs from organel-
lar membranes (Soldati et al., 1993; Barbieri et al., 1998).
Figure 4A shows that the stimulatory effect of PIM was
preserved at intermediate concentrations of GDI, reducing
Rab levels but not completely eliminating Rabs from mem-
branes. Thus, PIM stimulates fusion when either membrane
components (Rabs) or cytosolic factors controlling this pro-
cess become limiting. The enhanced stimulation of mem-
brane fusion by PIM when cytosolic components necessary
for fusion are in short supply is evident from experiments
with different amounts of cytosol in the fusion reaction
(Figure 2C). When endosomes were preincubated with
higher concentrations of GDI expected to remove most of
the Rabs from membranes, this not only further inhibited
early endosomal fusion but also it fully abrogated the stim-
ulatory effect of PIM. Thus, PIM stimulates only a Rab-
dependent reaction and cannot promote Rab-less membrane
fusion.
Next, we tested the effect of GTPS on PIM-mediated
stimulation of fusion. It has been reported that, at low cy-
tosol concentration (0.5 mg/ml), GTPS stimulates fusion of
early endosomes by acting most likely on Rab GTPases
(Mayorga et al., 1989). For example, GTPS locks Rab5 in its
active, GTP-bound form, thus facilitating the recruitment
from the cytosol of Rab5 effectors, such as EEA1, which
facilitate fusion (Simonsen et al., 1998). It is also important to
note that GTP hydrolysis by Rabs is not necessary for endo-
somal fusion but its conversion to GDP is rather a means to
terminate the activation cycle (Rybin et al., 1996). As ex-
pected, at low concentrations of cytosol, no detectable fusion
occurred in the control (Figure 4B). However, in the pres-
ence of PIM, endosomal fusion was evident (Figure 4B,
inset). On addition of GTPS, which in its own right strongly

stimulated fusion, PIM lost its enhancing effect. These re-
sults indicate that PIM can stimulate fusion if Rab GTPases
are not constitutively activated by other means.
PIM-stimulated Fusion Requires Release of Intravesicular
Ca2
Several reports have indicated that Ca2 release from vesi-
cles plays a role in fusion events (Peters and Mayer, 1998;
Holroyd et al., 1999; Pryor et al., 2000). Fusion subsequent to
Ca2 release from vesicular lumen into the cytosol can be
countered by adding the fast-acting Ca2 chelator BAPTA at
10 mM, but not with a slower Ca2 chelator such as EGTA
(Peters and Mayer, 1998; Pryor et al., 2000). When tested, in
the presence of BAPTA, PIM could not stimulate fusion
(Figure 4C). These results indicate that PIM-mediated stim-
ulation of early endosomal fusion requires Ca2. Because
the fusion reaction contained 0.5 mM EGTA, a slow-acting
Ca2 chelator, the Ca2 required for the fusion must have
originated from the endosomes, as reported previously (Pe-
ters and Mayer, 1998; Holroyd et al., 1999; Pryor et al., 2000).
The absence of any stimulatory effects of PIM in the presence
of lower concentration of BAPTA (2.5 mM), i.e., under con-
ditions that permitted 30% of the reaction to occur, suggests
that PIM acts in fusion upstream of the release of intrave-
sicular Ca2.
PI3-Kinase Inhibition with Wortmannin Enhances
Stimulatory Effect of PIM on Endosomal Fusion
One of the characterized Rab5 effectors is hVPS34, a type III
PI3-kinase (Christoforidis et al., 1999b). Early endosomal
fusion has been shown to depend on this PI3-kinase, which
produces phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate on early endo-
somal membranes essential for the recruitment of the or-
ganelle-tethering and SNARE-organizing protein EEA1 (Si-
monsen et al., 1998; Christoforidis et al., 1999a). Wortmannin
is a speciﬁc inhibitor of mammalian PI3-kinases when used
at 10–100 nM concentrations. As expected, wortmannin at
all concentrations tested (95–350 nM) inhibited fusion (Fig-
ure 4D). In the presence of 100 nM wortmannin, PIM
showed a dramatic increase in fusion relative to the un-
treated, control level reaction (Figure 4D). PIM also showed
stimulatory effects at higher concentrations of wortmannin,
but the magnitude of its effects was the highest at concen-
tration of the inhibitor speciﬁcally affecting the PI3-kinases.
These results show that PIM can stimulate early endosomal
fusion even when PI3-kinase activity is inhibited by phar-
macological means, and thus, PI3P production is limited.
PIM Stimulates Phagosome-Early Endosome Fusion In
Vitro
We next investigated the effect of PIM on fusion between
phagosomes and early endosomes, in vitro, using a sensitive
assay described in MATERIALS AND METHODS. PIM was
added exogenenously to the system and preincubated for 20
min with cytosol, phagosomes and early endosomes before
initiating fusion. Figure 5 shows that PIM stimulates the
ATP-dependent fusion between phagosomes and early en-
dosomes.
In Vivo Effects of PIM
To test whether the observed PIM effects on in vitro endo-
somal and phagosomal fusion have consequences on phago-
somes in vivo, we applied the previously published ap-
proach of coating 1-m latex beads with mycobacterial
glycolipids (Kang and Schlesinger, 1998; Fratti et al., 2001,
2003b). PIM-coated beads were incubated with macrophages
and markers of phagosomal maturation were examined. We
observed two effects with PIM-coated latex beads relative to
the uncoated control: 1) PIM coating prevented acidiﬁcation
of phagosomes, determined by reduced staining with the
acidotropic ﬂuorescent dye LysoTracker DN-99 (Figure 6);
and 2) recycling endosomal and plasma membrane SNARE
syntaxin 4 (Bennett et al., 1993; Band et al., 2002) (Figure 7) as
well as transferrin receptor (Figure 8) were found to accu-
mulate to higher extent on phagosomes containing PIM-
coated latex beads relative to the uncoated bead control.
PIM-coated bead phagosomes showed the same level of
syntaxin 6 (Fratti et al., 2003b) and lysobisphosphatidic acid
(our unpublished data) as uncoated bead phagosomes, in-
dicating that PIM does not directly affect acquisition of late
endosomal markers via the previously shown TGN-to-
phagosome pathway (Fratti et al., 2003b). These ﬁndings are
consistent with PIM having a highly specialized biological
activity in vivo, limited to promoting interactions with early
endosomes that may deliver nutrients in mycobacterial
phagosomes and maintain a relatively nonacidic pH.
DISCUSSION
M. tuberculosis produces a panoply of lipids, including sev-
eral glycosylated phosphatidylinositol species (Lee et al.,
1996), some of which have been shown to trafﬁc within the
endomembranes of infected macrophages (Beatty et al.,
2000). One of them, LAM, a heavily glycosylated phospha-
tidylinositol, has been shown to participate in the arrest of
phagolysosome biogenesis (Fratti et al., 2001, 2003b). The
mechanism of LAM action, which involves inhibition of
[Ca2]c rise, has recently been reported (Vergne et al.,
2003b). In the present study, we have presented evidence
that the much less glycosylated LAM precursor PIM, stim-
ulates homotypic early endosomal fusion and phagosome-
early endosome fusion. This stimulatory effect is speciﬁc for
early endosomes and has all the characteristics of regulated
Figure 5.

cubated for 20 min at room temperature in absence or presence of 80

fusion events because it is dependent on cytosol, ATP, NSF,
Rabs, and Ca2.
In addition to its in vitro activity, we have observed PIM
effects in vivo, by using latex beads coated with this glyco-
lipid. The observation that syntaxin 4 and transferrin recep-
tor are accumulating on phagosomes containing PIM is in
keeping with the biochemical detection of increased fusion
with early endosomal compartments. Although initial over-
expression experiments with syntaxin 4 have localized this
SNARE exclusively to the plasma membrane (Bennett et al.,
1993), recent studies with endogenous syntaxin 4 have
shown that a major fraction of this SNARE localizes to
endosomal membranes in normal rat kidney cells, where it
colocalizes partially with recycling endosomal markers
(Band et al., 2002). The distribution of syntaxin 4 in macro-
phages detected in our studies matches well the observa-
tions in normal rat kidney cells reported by Band et al. (2002.
The in vivo effects of PIM on preventing acidiﬁcation of
phagosomes, as detected by inhibition of staining with the
dye LysoTracker DN-99, which is normally trapped in acid-
iﬁed phagosomes (Via et al., 1998), can be related to fusion
with early endosomal compartments that are not acidic.
Interestingly, the pH of mycobacterial phagosome (pH 6.4)
has been reported to match that of the recycling endosome
(Sturgill-Koszycki et al., 1994). This block of acidiﬁcation
does not seem to be related to the prevention of phagosomes
to interact with late endosomal marker as lysobisphospha-
tidic acid and syntaxin 6 colocalize to the same extent with
uncoated and PIM-coated bead phagosomes (our unpub-
lished data) (Fratti et al., 2003b).
The survival of M. tuberculosis in phagocytic cells rests on
the ability of the tubercle bacillus to balance the block of
phagosomal maturation with its need to access nutrients
while residing in macrophages (Clemens and Horwitz, 1996;
Russell et al., 1996; Vergne et al., 2003a). Whether both of
these phenomena are achieved by a single effector molecule
produced by M. tuberculosis or is a manifestation of separate
processes, is not known. The observations with PIM, pre-
sented in this work, and the previously reported ﬁndings
with LAM (Fratti et al., 2001), suggest a model in which
distinct M. tuberculosis products manipulate separate intra-
cellular membrane trafﬁcking systems in the host cell. In the
case of LAM and PIM, they exert two opposing but compat-
ible and complementary actions: 1) LAM inhibits recruit-
ment of effectors that normally promote delivery of lysoso-
mal hydrolases and acidiﬁcation systems (Simonsen et al.,
1999; Fratti et al., 2001, 2003b; Gillooly et al., 2001; Vergne et
al., 2003b); 2) PIM stimulates early endosomal fusion, most
likely allowing the mycobacterial vacuole to gain access to
endocytosed nutrients, including iron bound to transferrin.
The opposing effects of LAM and PIM are also in keeping
with the LAM effects on late endosomal, lysosomal, and
TGN markers, in contrast to the absence of similar effects of
PIM on delivery of markers from the TGN, as reported
Figure 6.

previously (Fratti et al., 2001, 2003b). This model could also
explain an apparent paradox that the inhibitory action of
LAM, although advantageous in terms of blocking matura-
tion into the phagolysosome, by the same token diminishes
the recruitment of early endosomal tethering molecules, i.e.,
EEA1. The inhibition of EEA1 recruitment would be ex-
pected to potentially interfere with acquisition by the patho-
gen of fresh nutrients from the endocytic pathway. How-
ever, the stimulatory action of PIM on early endosomal
fusion reported here, most likely bypasses the negative effect
of LAM, and compensates for the diminution of EEA1 on
mycobacterial phagosomes (Fratti et al., 2001), thus generat-
ing a shunt for fusion with early endosomes.
Based on kinetic studies and the results obtained under
conditions when various components necessary for endoso-
mal fusion (cytosol, Rabs), were in a limited supply, it seems
that PIM acts at a rate limiting step(s) in the fusion process.
The experiments with GDI suggest that this rate-limiting
step involves a Rab GTPase, most likely Rab5, because Rab5
controls early endosomal homotypic fusion and is a rate-
limiting factor (Rybin et al., 1996). PIM effects on Rab
GTPases could be either direct or indirect through stimula-
tion of a GEF (e.g., Rin-1 or Rabex-5) (Horiuchi et al., 1997;
Tall et al., 2001) or inhibition of a GAP (e.g., RN-Tre)
(Lanzetti et al., 2000). This model is in keeping with the
ﬁnding that PIM cannot further stimulate fusion under con-
ditions when Rab GTPases are fully activated by GTPS.
Our results indicate that PIM can stimulate fusion be-
tween phagosomes and early endosomes when it presented
from the lumenal side (in vivo) or the cytosolic side (in
vitro). During M. tuberculosis infection, PIM has been found
intercalated into endomembranes (Beatty et al., 2000). How-
ever, its location within the lipid bilayer is still unknown.
One study has shown that PIM binds to galectin-3, a galac-
toside-binding protein enriched on the cytosolic side of my-
cobacterial phagosomes (Beatty et al., 2002). We propose two
models for how PIM could exert its activity 1) either directly
on its target after translocation to the cytosolic side of the
membrane, or 2) indirectly by modifying the biophysical
properties of the membrane bilayer. For example, lipid-
altered membrane ﬂuidity has been shown to play a role in
membrane association of Rab proteins, affecting the capacity
of GDI to extract membrane-bound Rabs (Lebrand et al.,
2002). Regarding the latter model, not only does the M.
tuberculosis var. bovis BCG phagosome display abnormal Rab
patterns (Via et al., 1997) but also it has unusually high levels
of membrane-associated GDI (Fratti et al., 2003a), suggestive
of potential alterations of the biophysical properties of the
mycobacterial phagosomal membrane affecting Rab extract-
ability.
We propose the following model in which mycobacterial
lipids act to balance inhibitory and stimulatory activities
controlling organellar biogenesis in macrophages: 1) PIM
stimulates Rab5 to enhance early endosomal fusion. This
enhancement is independent of PI3K activity, because PIM
stimulates fusion even in the presence of wortmannin. This
is in keeping with involvement of an active, GTP-bound
Rab5, because constitutively ON Rab5 can bypass pharma-
cological inhibition of its downstream effector PI3K hVPS34
and promote early endosomal fusion (Li et al., 1995; Simon-
sen et al., 1998). It is also important to underscore the ob-
served wortmannin insensitivity of PIM-stimulated fusion,
because Mycobacterium phagosome shows stage-dependent,
reduced levels of PI3P compared with model, latex bead
phagosomes (Chua, Vergne, and Deretic, unpublished data).
2) LAM inhibits wortmannin-sensitive steps and effectors
downstream of Rab5 activation and thus selectively dimin-
ishes delivery of lysosomal constituents from the TGN to the
phagosome, a process that normally depends on EEA1-syn-
taxin 6 interactions (Fratti et al., 2003b). 3) The wortmannin-
insensitive bypass caused by PIM, which activates early
endosomal fusion even when PI3K activity is inhibited, re-
duces the need for high levels of EEA1 on mycobacterial
phagosomes otherwise required to maintain interactions
with the early endosomal compartments (Russell et al.,
2002). As a net result, LAM and PIM act in coordination to
prevent the delivery of lysosomal constituents without hurt-
ing the ability of the mycobacterial phagosome to gain ac-

cess to essential nutrients such as iron (Clemens and Hor-
witz, 1996; Sturgill-Koszycki et al., 1996), which seems
critical for the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis
(Schaible et al., 2002; Kelley and Schorey, 2003). Although
different aspects of this model remain to be further exam-
ined, the biochemical deﬁnition of PIM activities presented
here is another afﬁrmation of the concept that lipids pro-
duced by M. tuberculosis have discrete and clearly signiﬁcant
effects on intracellular trafﬁcking in mammalian cells.
