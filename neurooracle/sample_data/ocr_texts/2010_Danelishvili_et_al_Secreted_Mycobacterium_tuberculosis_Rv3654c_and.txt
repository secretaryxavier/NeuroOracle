Abstract
Background: Inhibition of macrophage apoptosis by Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been proposed as one of the virulence
mechanisms whereby the pathogen avoids the host defense. The mechanisms by which M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain
suppress apoptosis and escapes human macrophage killing was investigated.
Methodology/Principal Findings: The screening of a transposon mutant bank identified several mutants, which, in contrast
to the wild-type bacterium, had impaired ability to inhibit apoptosis of macrophages. Among the identified genes, Rv3659c
(31G12 mutant) belongs to an operon reminiscent of type IV pili. The Rv3654c and Rv3655c putative proteins in a seven-
gene operon are secreted into the macrophage cytoplasm and suppress apoptosis by blocking the extrinsic pathway. The
operon is highly expressed when the bacterium is within macrophages, compared to the expression level in the extracellular
environment. Rv3654c recognizes the polypyrimidine tract binding Protein-associated Splicing Factor (PSF) and cleaves it,
diminishing the availability of caspase-8. While M. tuberculosis inhibits apoptosis by the extrinsic pathway, the pathogen
does not appear to affect the intrinsic pathway. Inactivation of the intrinsic pathway by pharmacologic agents afftects M.
tuberculosis and induces cell necrosis. Likewise, inactivation of PSF by siRNA significantly decreased the level of caspase-8 in
macrophages.
Conclusion: While M. tuberculosis inhibits the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, it appears to activate the intrinsic pathway
leading to macrophage necrosis as a potential exit strategy.

Introduction
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen infecting
primarily mononuclear phagocytes. The bacterium has developed
intricate strategies to evade killing mechanisms of phagocytes [1].
Once M. tuberculosis is inhaled and deposited in the alveolar space,
it infects alveolar macrophages, prevents phagosome acidification
and subsequent fusion of the vacuole with lysosomes [2,3].
Macrophages control bacterial growth by a number of mecha-
nisms, including the production of reactive oxygen intermediaries
and nitric oxide (NO) [4]. M. tuberculosis blocks the delivery of
nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to the vacuole membrane and
consequently avoids the toxic effects of NO [5]; although NO still
has some impact on the bacterial viability, as evidenced by the
increase in bacterial survival in iNOS knockout mice [5].
Autophagy, a repair mechanism of eukaryotic cells, frequently
associated with cell starvation, has also recently been shown to
eliminate intracellular bacteria through the delivery of ubiquitin-
derived peptide to the mycobacterial vacuoles [6,7]. A number of
reviews have explored the role of autophagy in host defense
against infectious agents [8]. Autophagy is connected through
several possible pathways with apoptosis [8]. It is plausible to
assume that, when infected macrophages fail to kill M. tuberculosis
by autophagy, the alternative host strategy, apoptosis, is used to
eliminate the intracellular bacteria [9]. M. tuberculosis has the ability
to suppress macrophage apoptosis using active mechanisms, with
the aim of blocking the expression of apoptosis-associated genes or
stimulating anti-apoptosis pathways [10,11]. The importance of
apoptosis as a host-defense strategy has also been studied in vivo
[12]. In one of these studies, while macrophages isolated from
mice with resistant sst1 (super-susceptibility to tuberculosis-1) locus
undergo
apoptosis
in
response
to
M.
tuberculosis
infection,
macrophages of sst1-susceptible mice die after infection and show
widespread necrosis [12]. A recent study suggested that both
H37Rv
and
H37Ra
strains
of
M.
tuberculosis
disrupt
the
mitochondrial outer membrane, but only the virulent H37Rv
induces significant mitochondrial transmembrane potential loss
[13]. Other studies have concentrated their observations on

focused aspects of the pathways [9,11], but none thus far have
used gene knockout mutants to dissect the possible mechanisms
involved. Only recently, a report by Velmurugan and colleagues
attempted to investigate a H37Rv mutant clone deficient in
suppression of apoptosis [14].
The underlying mechanisms by which virulent M. tuberculosis
inhibits apoptosis in macrophages remain largely unknown.
Macrophages
undergo
apoptosis
by
at
least
two
different
pathways. The extrinsic pathway, in which released tumor necrosis
factor-alpha (TNF-a), activates caspase-8. The adaptor proteins
TRADD, RIP-1 or FAAD (TRADD in the case of TNF-a
stimulus), stimulate the downstream caspases, through the type I
(extrinsic) or type II (intrinsic) pathways [15,16,17]. Recent work
by Kundu and colleagues showed that M. tuberculosis-induced
apoptosis is mediated by p38 and ASK-1 (apoptosis signal-
regulating
kinase
1),
and
that
the
pathogen
also
induces
degradation of FLiPS, which, when ubiquitinated, blocks TNF-
a-mediated apoptosis [18]. In contrast, Chen and colleagues
described that the virulent H37Rv strain stimulates LxA4, which
inhibits PGE2 production . PGE2 protects mitochondrial mem-
branes from damage and inhibits necrosis [19].
The
discordant
findings
in
the
literature,
regarding
M.
tuberculosis inducing or inhibiting apoptosis, may be related to a
large variety of factors, such as cell types, strain phenotype and
phases of infection when the studies are carried out. Because of the
inconsistency, we decided to investigate the ability and mechanism
by which virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain suppresses apoptosis
and escapes killing by human macrophages, by using the screening
of a transposon library to identify mutant(s) that do not inhibited
the apoptosis. Previous studies establish that inhibition of apoptosis
by M. tuberculosis is seen in U937, THP-1 and human monocyte-
cleaved macrophages [10]. In the present study, we demonstrate
that M. tuberculosis is capable of blocking the extrinsic pathway of
apoptosis by secreting effector proteins that interfere with caspases’
post-transcriptional events.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial strain, cell culture and infections
Mouse-passed, virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv
(ATCC 25618) was cultured for 3 weeks in liquid Middlebrook
7H9 medium or Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates supplemented
with 10% oleic acid, albumin, dextrose and catalase (OADC)
enrichment (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA). Bacteria
were harvested at mid-log phase and adjusted to 16107 cells/ml
in Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS, Invitrogen). Kanamy-
cin sulfate was added to all media at a final concentration of
200 mg/ml, where appropriate. Human monocytic cell line
U937 (ATCC CRL-1593.2) was used for all assays and was
grown in RPMI-1640 (GIBCO Laboratories) supplemented with
heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 2 mM L-
glutamine. Cells were seeded at 80% confluence into 75 cm2
tissue culture flasks, in 96-well plates or chamber glass slides, as
needed. U937 macrophage monolayers were treated with
500 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, Sigma, St.
Louis, MO) for 8 h to promote maturation and adherence and
then monolayers were replenished with a new medium. After
additional 24 h incubation, cells were infected with M. tuberculosis
H37Rv or transposon mutants at MOI of 10. Infected and
uninfected macrophages were collected at different time points
for cytotoxicity assay, caspase activity or microarray assays. The
percentage of phagocytized bacterium (wild-type or mutants) was
calculated from controls grown under identical culture condi-
tions for 3 h and 24 h in 24-well plates.
M. tuberculosis transposon library construction, screening
and sequencing
The M. tuberculosis transposon library was generated using the
plasmid pTNGJC containing a temperature-sensitive origin of
replication, as previously described [20]. Approximately 5,000
clones were stored in the library, in 50% glycerol at 280uC, and
used for screening of clones for an increase of macrophage
apoptosis compared to wild-type bacterium. U937 cells were
treated with Phorbol 12-Myristate 13-Acetate (PMA, Sigma) and
seeded at 16105 mononuclear cells/well in 96-well flat-bottomed
tissue culture plates. Monolayers were infected with mutants and
wild-type at a ratio of 10 bacteria:1 cell and incubated for 2 h at
37uC and 5% CO2. The wells were washed three times with HBSS
to remove extracellular bacteria and incubated at 37uC. After 5
days of infection, individual wells were visually screened for
detached macrophages compare with control. Selected wells were
processed for ELISA to confirm changes during M. tuberculosis
mutant infection. M. tuberculosis genes interrupted by the Tn5367
transposon were identified using nonspecific nested suppression
PCR method, previously reported by R. Tamme [21], and
sequenced at the Central Service laboratories (CSL), Center for
Gene Research
and Biotechnology (CGRB), Oregon State
University, Corvallis. Database search of the sequenced fragments
was
performed
at
the
National
Center
for
Biotechnology
Information (www.ncbi.nih.gov), using BLAST network service.
Complementation of M. tuberculosis 31G12 mutant
To complement the defect of 31G12 mutant, the M. tuberculosis
Rv3659c gene, Rv3656c–Rv3659c and Rv3654c–Rv3659c genes
were amplified from the wild-type H37Rv using GC-Rich PCR
system (Roche). The PCR-generated fragments (Table 1) were
cloned into EcoRI and HindIII sites of Escherichia coli-Mycobacterium
shuttle vector pMV261+AprII [22], encoding apramycin resis-
tance. The resulting plasmids pLD31G12-1, -2 and -3 were
propagated in DH10B E. coli and then electroporated into M.
tuberculosis
31G12
mutant.
Transformants
were
selected
on
Middlebrook 7H10 agar plates containing 200 mg/ml of apramy-
cin and screened by PCR using apramycin upper (GCATCG-
CATTCTTCGCATCC) and lower (GGCCCACTTGGACT-
GATCGA)
primers
for
the
650 bp
fragment
from
the
apramycin-resistant gene. Constructed 31G12 clones were tested
for restoration of the apoptosis phenotype using TUNEL assay.
Cytotoxicity assays
Cell Death Detection ELISAPLUS and TUNEL assays (Roche)
were used for detection of macrophage apoptosis. Necrosis,
determined as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from necrotic
cells, was measured using the CytoTox 96 non-radioactive
cytotoxicity assay (Promega), as previously described [10].
Real-time PCR procedures and transcriptional analysis for
M. tuberculosis genes
U937 macrophages were exposed to M. tuberculosis H37Rv for
30 min or infected for 3 h with MOI 100 bacteria:1 cell. Both
bacteria exposed to 7H9 broth and RPMI medium, for either
30 min or 3 h, were used as controls. Bacterial RNAs from control
and experimental
(exposed and intracellular) samples were
extracted and processed for Real-time PCR, as previously
described [23]. To determine whether the Rv3654c–Rv3660c
locus produced a transcript containing seven genes, we arbitrarily
chose approximately 1000 bp size intergenic regions of Rv3654c–
Rv3657c, Rv3657c–Rv3659c and Rv3659c–Rv3660c and per-
formed RT-PCR using intracellular bacterial RNA (Table S1).

Caspase-8 activity
FLICE/Caspase-8 fluorimetric protease assay (Chemicon, Teme-
cula, CA) was used to determine the changes in caspase-8 activity,
72 h following both M. tuberculosis wild-type and mutant infection of
human macrophages. Treatment of U937 cells with human
recombinant TNF-a protein (103 U/ml) was used as a positive
control. The assay was performed directly into 96-well tissue culture
plate. Briefly, cells were resuspended in 50 ml of chilled lysis buffer,
incubated on ice for 10 min, and 50 ml of 26 reaction butter
containing 10 mM DTT was added. Each sample was mixed with
5 ml of 1 mM IETD-AFC (7-amino-4-trifluoromethyl coumarin)
substrate to a final concentration of 50 mM and incubated at 37uC for
2 h. Results were measured using a Cytofluorimeter II (Biosearch,
Bedford, MA) with 400 nm excitation and 505 nm emission filters.
CHeMICON’s CaspaTagTM Caspase-8 In Situ Assay (Chemicon)
was used for detection of active caspase-8 in U937 macrophages after
transfection with M. tuberculosis proteins fused with Red Fluorescent
Protein (RFP). 306FLICA reagent solution at 1:30 dilution in culture
medium was added to transfected or non-transfected macrophage
monolayers that were treated with human recombinant TNF-a
protein (103 U/ml) for 1 h at 37uC under 5% CO2. Hoechst stain
0.5% v/v (Chemicon) was added to each well for 5 min at 37uC, for
nuclei labeling. Cells were washed three times with washing buffer,
fixed in 1:10 diluted fixative and analyzed under fluorescence
microscope using band pass FITC filter for green fluorescence and
UV-filter for apoptotic nuclei labeling with Hoechst stain.
Detection of mitochondrial permeability
MitoLightTM Apoptosis assay (Chemicon) was used to detect the
mitochondrial membrane disruption in M. tuberculosis-infected or -
uninfected macrophages, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
In some uninfected wells, staurosporine (Sigma) was added to
trigger apoptosis (positive control). The lipophilic cationic dye was
used to stain viable macrophage mitochondria (an assay dependent
on the membrane potential) and was observed under fluorescence
microscopy using Texas Red and FITC channels.
Immunostaining of cytochrome C
The U937 cells were cultured in duplicate, using eight-chamber
slides (NUNC). Macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis wild-type or
with the mutant 31G12 for 72 h were washed three times with HBSS
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h. Cells were permeabilized
with 1% Triton X-100 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 5 min and
blocked for 1 h in 2% bovine serum albumin. This was followed by a
5 h incubation with mouse monoclonal antibody against cytochrome
C (1:500, PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Macrophages were then
washed and incubated with Texas Red-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG
(1:1000, Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) for 1 h.
Transfection experiments
Rv3654c (aa 84), Rv3655c (aa 125), Rv3656c (aa 68), Rv3657c (aa
576) and Rv3659c (aa 352) were subcloned into the EcoRI/BamHI
sites of the pDsRed1-C1 vector and fused with Red Fluorescent Protein
(CLONTECH). Resulting vectors pLDRv3654c, pLDRv3655c,
pLDRv3656c, pLDRv3657c, pLDRv3659c, or the empty pDsRed1-
C1 were transformed into U937 macrophages with Lipofectamine

grown in M63 medium (7.661022 M (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 M KH2PO4,
5.861026 M FeSO4.7H2O, pH 7) supplemented with 1 mM
MgSO4, 0.5% Tween-80 and 2% succinate for non-induced cultures
or 2% succinate and 2% acetamide for induced cultures. Bacteria
were grown for 21 days, after which cells were harvested, washed two
times and used for infection of U937 macrophages.
Macrophages were infected with M. tuberculosis pJAM2:Rv3654c,
or pJAM2:Rv3655c, induced and non-induced clones for 48 h. Cell
cultures were lysed with 0.05% SDS and centrifuged at 3,0006g for
15 min to remove bacterial pellet from the suspension. Pre-cleared
cell lysates were incubated with His.tag primary agarose conjugate
antibodies, overnight at 4uC. Samples were resolved by electropho-
resis on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes and blocked overnight with 5% blocking reagent. The
secondary mouse horseradish peroxidase-linked whole (IgG) antibody
was used at a dilution 1:5000. Reactivity was assessed with Hyperfilm
ECL detection reagents (Amersham) followed by autoradiography.
His-tagged pull-down assay
Macrophage lysates were prepared and labeled as previously
described [22], mixed with 1 mg of purified His.tag-Rv3654c or
His.tag-Rv3655c proteins and 60 ml of His.tag agarose conjugate
rabbit polyclonal IgG beads (500 g/ml with 25% AG). The
samples were incubated at 4uC overnight, spun down, washed
three times with PBS and processed for electrophoresis. The
pulled-down proteins were subjected for In-Gel Tryptic Digestion
(PIERCE, Rockford, IL) and sequencing by electrospray ioniza-
tion mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS).
Mass Spectrometric sequencing
Proteins were analyzed at Environmental Health Science Center
(EHS) Mass Spectrometry Facility, Oregon State University,
Corvallis, by chromatography and electrospray ionization mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). Tandem MS was performed with ESI,
and mass spectra were acquired by using quadrupole–time-of-flight

(Q-TOF) Global Ultima system from Micromass (Manchester, UK),
operated with a spray voltage of 3.5 kV. Digested protein samples
were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with 0.1% formic acid, 0.005% trifluoroacetic
acid, and 3% acetonitrile in H2O (solvent A). A Symmetry 300 C 18
trap from Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA) and 75-m inner-diameter PicoFrit
column from New Objective (Woburn, MA), packed in-house with
Jupiter C 5 from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA), were used for the ESI
experiments. The LC program consisted of a gradient from 3% to
35% B over 60 min, to 70% B at 65 min, and finally 95% B from 70
to 80 min. Solvent B contained 0.1% formic acid and 0.005%
trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile. Data-dependent MS/MS was
generated using a 0.5-sec MS survey scan and 2.5-sec MS/MS scans
on the three most abundant peaks found in the survey scan. A
database search was performed using Mascot (Matrix Science,
London, UK) and IPI human (Bioinformatics Solutions, Inc.,
PEAKS studio, Canada) software.
PSF and ALK proteins
The anti-polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)-associated
splicing factor (PSF) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc.) and
FITC-conjugated mouse anti-human NPM-ALK/ALK (Anaplastic
Lymphoma Kinase) antibody (ALK1, BD Pharmingen) were used
for fluorescence microscopy studies. Briefly, 46105 cells were seeded
on eight-chamber slides and infected or not with rhodamine-labeled
wild-type or 31G12 bacteria. One well was transfected with either
pLDRv3654c or pLDRv3655c plasmid to investigate the expression
of either PSF or ALK proteins, respectively. After 48 h of infection,
cells were fixed for 1 h in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with
0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and blocked in 2% bovine serum
albumin, followed by a 2 h incubation with rabbit monoclonal
antibody against PSF (1:500) or FITC-conjugated monoclonal
ALK1 antibody (1:500). Fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG
(1:2000, Molecular Probe, Eugene, OR) was used as secondary
antibody for PSF protein. Results were confirmed by Western bolt
analysis of immunoprecipitated samples (experimental and control)
for PSF protein.
Inactivation of PSF by siRNA
To examine the role of PSF in caspase-8 activation, transfection of
macrophages with PSF siRNA (Santa Cruz) was performed using

manufacturer’s recommendations. Isolated 16106/ml macrophages
were seeded in six-well tissue culture plates, washed once with siRNA
transfection medium and replaced with transfection medium
containing PSF siRNA transfection reagent mixture. Untreated and
control siRNA (scrabbled sequences)-transfected cells were used as
negative controls. Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of
recombinant TNF-a protein. PSF and caspase-8 protein expressions
were determined by Western blot analysis.

with 500 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. U937 cells (56105)
were infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv or mutant 31G12 (MOI of
10), and extracellular bacteria were removed by washing after 1 h.
Intracellular bacteria were allowed to grow up to 5 days. Several wells
were lysed at 1 h and plated onto 7H10 agar to quantify the intact
inoculums. At 2 and 5 days, both attached and detached
macrophages were collected, lysed and CFU counts were recorded.
Statistical analysis
All experiments were carried out in duplicate and repeated at
least two times. Mean values and standard deviations were
calculated to describe the data population. Significance of the
differences between experimental groups and control groups was
analyzed by the Student’s t-test or ANOVA. P values of ,0.05
were considered significant.
Results
Mutant library screening and analysis
The M. tuberculosis transposon bank was partially screened (5,000
mutants) for the lack of ability to inhibit macrophage apoptosis.
The initial selection was performed based on the observation that
infected U937 phagocytes would become apoptotic after 4–5 days
and detach from the tissue culture wells. TUNEL and ELISA
assays confirmed that 99% of detached cells were, in fact,
undergoing apoptosis. We visually identified 54 clones in which
the number of detached cells in the tissue culture wells differed
significantly from monolayers infected with the wild-type bacte-
rium. The selected clones were further evaluated by TUNEL and
ELISA assays. Thirty-two of the 54 clones lacked the ability to
inhibit macrophage apoptosis. Previously published studies have
shown that M. tuberculosis inhibits apoptosis similarly in U937,
THP-1 and human monocyte-derived macrophages [10].
Identified mutants are shown in Table 2. The sequencing of
31G12
mutant
demonstrated
that
the
Rv3659c
gene
was
inactivated. The gene belongs to an operon of seven genes
(Figure 1A). The operon is part of the same transcriptional unit, as
evidenced by RT-PCR. In this operon the genes Rv3657c to
Rv3660c have significant homology to many bacterial type IV pili
and to Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans pilus assembly tad genes.
The inactivated Rv3659c is part of the pili assembly genes, and has
homology to VirB11. The downstream genes in the operon are a
putative transmembrane protein (Rv3656c) and two secreted
proteins (Rv3654 and Rv3655c). The Rv3654c–Rv3659c genes are
significantly induced in the intracellular environment, compared
with the gene expression in bacteria exposed to RPMI-1640
supplemented by 10% FBS (Figure 1B).
Effects of 31G12 complementation
In order to identify whether the observed phenotype was due to
the inactivation of Rv3659c or other downstream genes, we created
three constructs covering genes encoding for the structural,
transmembrane and secreted proteins in the region. Macrophages
were infected with complemented 31G12 clones, and monitored
for five days for apoptotic changes by the TUNEL assay. In
parallel experiments, apoptosis was induced in wild-type infected
and uninfected control cells by TNF-a (Table 3). While M.
tuberculosis H37Rv infected macrophages triggered a 24% greater
level of apoptosis than uninfected macrophages after five days,
infection with the 31G12 mutant led to an increase of apoptosis,
66% compared with uninfected controls. The 31G12 mutant,
complemented with pLD31G12-3, a clone containing all six
downstream genes of the operon, was able to inhibit apoptosis in a
similar fashion to M. tuberculosis H37Rv. In contrast, complemen-
tation of 31G12 with pLD31G12-1 or pLD31G12-2 plasmid did
not revert the phenotype (Table 3). In addition, we observed that
M. tuberculosis H37Rv infection of macrophages was associated
with suppression of TNF-a-induced macrophage apoptosis as
shown on the Table 3.
Changes in the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of
apoptosis
It was observed that, while recombinant TNF-a-treated and
31G12-infected macrophages showed caspase-8 activation, signif-
icant suppression of caspase-8 activation was observed in both
macrophages infected with wild-type bacterium and with the
complemented 31G12 strain containing the pLD31G12-3 con-
struct (Figure 2A).
Using mitochondrial permeability and cytochrome C assays
(Figure 2, B and C) as indicators of the activation of the intrinsic
pathway, we observed that there was no differential effect between
the wild-type and the knockout bacterium on macrophage
apoptosis. Figure 2B shows that the lipophilic cation dye is
accumulated in the mitochondria of uninfected cells (bright red
fluorescence). The mitochondrial membrane was damaged in M.
tuberculosis H37Rv- and 31G12-infected macrophages, where the
dye had diffused in the cytoplasm giving bright green fluorescence.

Immunolabeling of cytochrome C in uninfected macrophages
showed a granular pattern; whereas, a diffuse cytoplasmic staining
was observed in macrophages infected with M. tuberculosis wild-type
or 31G12 mutant. The pattern was similar to the control cells
treated with staurosporine (Figure 2C).
Resistance to TNF-a-mediated apoptosis during M.
tuberculosis infection
To investigate whether the putatively secreted proteins in the
operon were capable of inhibiting macrophage apoptosis by the
extrinsic pathway, U937 cells were transfected with pDsRed1-C1
plasmid, containing Rv3654c, Rv3655c, Rv3656c, Rv3657c or
Rv3659c genes, and evaluated for caspase-8 activation and nuclear
fragmentation following treatment with human recombinant
TNF-a. M. tuberculosis putatively secreted the proteins (Rv3654c,

into the macrophage cytoplasm, we fused both proteins with 6-
His-tag and over-expressed them in M. tuberculosis using pJAM2
vector. Infected macrophages were lysed by day 2, separated from
the intracellular bacteria and processed for Western blot analysis.
Rv3654c and Rv3655c proteins were detected in the macrophage
cytoplasmic fraction (Figure 3C).

proline-
and

Polypyrimidine
tract-
binding protein-associated-splicing factor) and 175kDa ALO17
(ALK lymphoma oligomerization partner on chromosome 17),
respectively.
Using immunofluorescence, macrophages infected with M.
tuberculosis H37Rv, 31G12 mutant or macrophages transfected
with pLDRv3654c showed differences regarding PSF protein
expression levels (Figure 4B). PSF protein was expressed at a high
level and diffused in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells (Figure 4B,
a), while within macrophages containing the pLDRv3654c and
also in macrophages infected with H37Rv (Figure 4B, d and b),
significantly reduced levels of PSF protein at 48 h time point was
observed. In contrast, the level of PSF protein is elevated in 31G12
mutant-infected cells (Figure 4B, c). Further analysis by Western
blot showed that the wild-type bacterium cleaves PSF protein,
which was not seen in phagocytic cells infected with the 31G12
mutant (Figure 4C).
Using the interference siRNA system, we then inactivated PSF
to identify its role in caspase-8 activation. As observed in
Figures 5A and 5B, the expression of PSF was significantly
reduced in macrophages transfected with siRNA. Figures 5C and
5D show that inactivation of PSF leads to a significant reduction of
caspase-8 protein in macrophages.
ALO17, a protein of unknown function, has recently been
described as a novel fusion partner of ALK [24]. We used
fluorescent labeling of ALK to examine whether it formed fusion
with ALO17. ALK was not expressed in M. tuberculosis-infected
macrophages, as determined by fluorescence microscopy and RT-
PCR using primers designed for the fused transcripts, as previously
described [25]. Real-time PCR was also performed for the
expression of ALO17. During M. tuberculosis wild-type infection of
macrophages, ALO17 gene showed 5.3-fold higher expression
over the uninfected control.
Survival in macrophages
To verify the differences in macrophage survival during 31G12
and the wild-type bacterium infection, intracellular bacteria were
cultured from detached (apoptotic) and attached macrophages at
two different time points. The results (Table 5) show that, while the
wild-type bacterium grows within attached macrophages, the
31G12 mutant loses viability over time in apoptotic macrophages,
demonstrating attenuated phenotype.

Intrinsic pathway of apoptosis and macrophage necrosis
Since M. tuberculosis is known to exit macrophages by inducing cell
necrosis, we decided to examine whether pharmacological inhibition
of macrophage apoptosis by the intrinsic pathway could have any
impact on the phagocytic cell necrosis induced by M. tuberculosis.
In agreement with previously published data, M. tuberculosis H37Rv
infection was associated with reduced macrophage necrosis after 1
and 3 days of infection compared with the level of apoptosis at the
same time points (data not shown); however, M. tuberculosis triggered a
greater level of necrosis than apoptosis at later time points (Figure 6A).
To identify weather M. tuberculosis-induced necrosis of macrophages is
related to the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, host cells were treated with
irreversible caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK.TFA (Sigma) and
levels of cytotoxicity were determined by 3, 5, 7 and 9 days post-
infection. M. tuberculosis H37Rv-infected macrophages did not
undergo necrosis after blocking the intrinsic pathway with the
caspase-9 inhibitor (Figure 6B). The data indicate that inhibition of
the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis at later time points had direct
correlation to increased levels of necrosis during M. tuberculosis
infection of U937 cells.
Discussion
M. tuberculosis is a pathogen that evolved several different
strategies to survive within host cells. Among them are the ability
to impair nitric oxide delivery to the phagosome [5], the
prevention of phagosome-lysosome fusion [2,3], and the capacity
to interfere with autophagy [7]. Macrophage apoptosis is a host
mechanism of innate immunity that has been shown to eliminate
M. tuberculosis [13]. A number of studies, however, have suggested
that M. tuberculosis infection of macrophages either induces or
blocks apoptosis [10,14], which apparently correlates with strain
virulence and microbial burden and certainly reflects the different
models used. We have evaluated apoptosis and necrosis caused by
M. tuberculosis H37Rv in two cell lines (U937 and THP-1) and in
primary human monocyte-derived macrophages [10]. In our
hands, M. tuberculosis infection of the three macrophages above was
associated with inhibition of apoptosis by the extrinsic pathway but
did not interfere in a significant manner with the intrinsic
pathway. In the current work, by screening a transposon mutant
library, we identified two M. tuberculosis proteins (Rv3654c,
Rv3655c) that are exported outside of the bacterial phagosome
by a putative secretion apparatus. The choice of these mutants,
from among all others, was due to the interesting nature of the
chromosomal region containing the inactivated Rv3659c gene. Of
note, the ‘‘type IV pili’’ operon that contains Rv3654c and
Rv3655c is only upregulated when the bacterium is within
macrophages. The type II/IV secretion system identified in M.
tuberculosis is well conserved in many microorganisms, and in some
cases, it has been associated with bacterial attachment to epithelial

cells [26]. In the majority of the bacteria, however, the function of
this chromosomal region is currently unknown. Our findings
suggest a novel function for the region that contains genes
encoding for four secretion apparatus structural proteins, one
transmembrane protein, and two secreted proteins, which interfere
with macrophage apoptosis.
The secreted proteins Rv3654c and Rv3655c interact with host
PSF and ALO17, respectively, and as consequence, interfere with
extrinsic pathway of apoptosis, as demonstrated by transfecting
macrophages with the bacterial proteins. PSF is a factor essential
for pre-mRNA splicing [24]. PSF has been shown to regulate
apoptosis by influencing caspase activity at the translational level.
During cell apoptosis, PSF remains intact and phosphorylated,
which is not expected of a splicing factor, suggesting a possible
secondary function. In fact, we were able to demonstrate that
inactivation of PSF leads to significant decrease of caspase-8
expression. Our study also shows that the wild-type bacterium
cleaves PSF after 48 h of infection, in contrast with the 31G12
mutant, making it the probable mechanism of inactivation. In fact,
the work by Shav-Tal and colleagues suggests that PSF is sensitive
to proteolysis and can be degraded [27]. Alternative explanation
for the decrease of PSF would be related to the phosphorylation of
PSF, which occurs following macrophage apoptosis. It could make
at least some of the protein undetected by antibodies.
Rv3655c recognizes AL017, a protein usually associated with ALK
(anaplastic lymphoma kinase) [25]. Various fusion partners of ALK
and AL017 have been described, all of them with anti-apoptotic
function of cells [28]. Once ALK is activated in the cytoplasm, it
migrates into the nucleus and phosphorylates NIPA (nuclear
interacting partner of ALK) protein. NIPA protein has been found
to inhibit PI3-kinase/AKT anti-apoptotic signaling pathway and
then inhibit caspases. Although we could not show the ALK-AL017
interaction, we demonstrated that the ALO17 gene is highly
expressed in macrophages, after infection with M. tuberculosis H37Rv.

Apoptosis is now considered as one of the host mechanisms of
innate immunity. Intracellular pathogens, which overcome many of
the killing strategies of phagocytic cells, such as reactive oxygen and
reactive nitrogen products, antimicrobial peptides and autophagy,
had to evolve strategies to survive the apoptosis of the host cell.
Because host cells have many triggering mechanisms for apoptosis,
and at least three apoptotic pathways are currently known, we can
assume that M. tuberculosis had to adapt to all in order to remain viable
within macrophages. By screening a transposon mutant library, we
identified several deficient mutants that very likely have different or
complementary mechanisms to suppress apoptosis. The overlapping
functions of bacterial genes point to the importance of the strategy,
which, in addition, influence the outcome of infection. Our results
also unveil a plausible important strategy of the pathogen. By
inhibiting the translation phase of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis,
other proteins co-expressed with caspases may remain intact to
perform potentially significant functions, some of them still unknown.
In addition, the level of inhibition is the most efficacious one, not
depending on gene regulation, which can be complex. The fact that
M. tuberculosis does not seem to significantly suppress apoptosis by the
intrinsic pathway is one of the reasons for much of the diverse results
in the field. In fact, if one does not use mutants to understand the
effect on the pathway, conflicting results are very likely. Our findings
suggest that M. tuberculosis acts in different ways to manipulate
apoptosis in macrophages. Suppression and, possibly, stimulation of
apoptotic pathways by the pathogen depend on the phase of the host
cell infection and have important roles in the outcome of the
condition, as demonstrated in this study and elsewhere [29]. This
complex interaction can also be responsible for some of the
discrepancies among the published results. Data from in vivo
observation supports that clinical strains capable of inhibiting
apoptosis are more virulent [29]. The finding that M. tuberculosis uses
the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis as a strategy to induce macrophage
necrosis explains, at least in part, the fact that the pathogen appears to
inhibit apoptosis selectively through the extrinsic pathway. It is
interesting that the bacterium uses the activation of the intrinsic
pathway during a very defined phase of infection to induce necrosis.
One can propose that there is some advantage to following this
particular strategy, although we currently cannot understand it. We
do know that the proteins ESAT-6 and CFP-10 appear to participate
in the process of macrophage necrosis [30,31]. M. tuberculosis is now
accepted as a pathogen that escapes the macrophage during a phase
of the intracellular life, probably infecting other cells. All the evidence
thus far supports the idea that the pathogen triggers necrosis or some
lesion of the macrophage surface [32]. The genes linked to this
process and the mechanisms are still under investigation. Other
pathogens, such
as
Legionella
pneumophila,
inhibit
macrophage
apoptosis by targeting pro-death members of the Bcl-2 protein
family [33]. In this case, SidF, a Legionella protein, binds to Bcl-rambo
and BNIP-3, interfering with the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
Our model agrees with the model described by Chen and
colleagues [13] that the suppressive effect of M. tuberculosis
infections on apoptosis occurs in the extrinsic but not in the
intrinsic pathway. We also found that M. tuberculosis uses the
intrinsic pathway to trigger necrosis. Future investigation will
attempt to enhance our understanding of the complex interaction
of M. tuberculosis with different apoptotic pathways.
