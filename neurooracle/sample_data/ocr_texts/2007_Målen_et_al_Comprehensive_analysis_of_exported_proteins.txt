Abstract  
 
Proteins secreted by Mycobacterium tuberculosis play an essential role in the 
pathogenesis of tuberculosis. The culture filtrates of M. tuberculosis H37Rv made by 
Sadamu Nagai, Japan, are considerably enriched for secreted proteins compared to 
other culture filtrates. Complementary approaches were used to identify the secreted 
proteins in these culture filtrates: 1) 2D-PAGE combined with MALDI-TOF MS and 2) 
liquid chromatography coupled MS/MS. Peptides derived from a total of 257 proteins 
were identified of which 144 were identified by more than one peptide. Several members 
of the immunologically important Early Secretory Antigenic Target-6 (ESAT-6) family 
of proteins were found to be major components. The majority of the identified proteins, 
159 (62%), were predicted to be exported through the general secretory pathway. We 
experimentally verified that the signal peptides, which mediate translocation through 
the cell membrane, had been removed in 41 of the identified proteins, and in 35 of those, 
there was an AXA motif N-terminally to the cleavage site, showing that this motif is 
important for recognition and cleavage of signal peptides in mycobacteria. A large 
fraction of the secreted proteins were unknowns, suggesting that we have mapped an 
unexplored part of the exported proteome of M. tuberculosis.

1 Introduction  
Tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to a single bacterial pathogen, 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis [1]. According to the WHO, one-third of the world’s population 
is latently infected and there are more than 10 million new cases and 2-3 million deaths 
annually. In 1998, the entire genome of Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv was sequenced 
[2], followed by the genome of the clinical isolate, M. tuberculosis CDC1551 [3] and 
Mycobacterium bovis AF2122/97 [4]. The availability of whole genomic sequences of M. 
tuberculosis complex organisms has greatly facilitated the analysis of its proteome [5-10].  
 
Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is a live attenuated strain of M. bovis used for vaccination 
[11]. In newborn children, vaccination with BCG prevents miliary and meningeal 
tuberculosis. The efficiency of BCG in preventing pulmonary tuberculosis in adults, which is 
mainly responsible for infectiousness at the community level, is however highly variable and 
in all low [12]. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new strategies for combating the 
pathogen. The genomes of the members of the M. tuberculosis complex, including virulent M. 
tuberculosis, M. africanum, M. microti, M. bovis, and attenuated M. bovis BCG are highly 
conserved [13]. Comparative genome analyses have revealed distinct regions in the genome 
of M. tuberculosis H37Rv that have been deleted in wild-type M. bovis, M. bovis BCG 
substrains and/or clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis [11, 14]. In addition, complementary 
proteomic analyses have revealed several differences in the protein composition between M. 
tuberculosis and M. bovis BCG [15, 16]. The consequences of these differences with respect 
to virulence and pathogenesis are still not fully understood. 
 
A significant number of mycobacterial proteins inferred from the genome are predicted to be 
exported. In bacteria, the well-characterized general secretory (Sec) pathway transports 
unfolded proteins across the cytoplasmic membrane to the bacterial envelope and the 
extracellular environment. Proteins targeted to this system contain specific N-terminal signal 
sequences which consist of three distinct regions: the N-, H-, and C- regions. The 
hydrophobic core, also designated the H-region, consists of 10 to 15 amino acid residues. It is 
formed by a stretch of hydrophobic residues that seems to adopt an α-helical conformation in 
the membrane. At the N-terminal side, the H-region is flanked by a positively charged stretch 
of polar residues, the N-region. At the C-terminal side, the H-region is flanked by the C-
region, a stretch of short uncharged polar residues, usually carrying the consensus sequence

AXA at position -1 to -3 relative to the cleavage site for Signal peptidase I [17, 18]. Upon 
export, the signal sequence is cleaved by a type I signal peptidase, releasing the mature 
protein at the external side of the cell membrane [19, 20]. 
 
An important feature of M. tuberculosis is its ability to survive and proliferate inside host 
macrophages and to inhibit the acidification and maturation of the phagosome [21-24]. 
Phagosome modification does not take place upon phagocytosis of dead bacilli, suggesting 
that secreted proteins play a key role in pathogenesis [25]. Secreted proteins are also 
considered to be key T-cell antigens of protective immune responses against M. tuberculosis 
[26, 27].  
 
Several attempts have been made to define the secreted proteome of M. tuberculosis. In one 
of the original proteomic studies of M. tuberculosis H37Rv culture filtrate, 8 secreted proteins 
were purified and identified [28]. Relatively few additional proteins with predicted N-terminal 
signal peptide, which can be recognized as secreted through general secretory pathway, have 
been uncovered in subsequent studies by various authors [9, 10, 16, 29-31]. This is probably 
due to considerable contamination of regular culture filtrates with intracellular proteins [32]. 
In the present study we have analysed a unique culture filtrate of M. tuberculosis H37Rv with 
minimal presence of cytoplasmic proteins. By using state of the art proteomic approaches we 
were able to identify 257 proteins, 159 of them had predicted N-terminal signal peptides, out 
of which 25 also had a predicted transmembrane domain in the mature part, and 36 proteins 
were predicted to be lipoproteins. These identifications represents a  major contribution to the 
exploration of the exported proteome of M. tuberculosis which is of great importance in order 
to understand the pathogenesis of tuberculosis. 
 
2 Experimental procedures 
 
2.1 Bacterial cultivation and sample preparation 
M. tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC27294 from the National Institute of Health, Tokyo, Japan was 
cultured as surface pellicle on the wholly synthetic Sauton medium for 3 weeks without  
shaking. Bacteria were removed by filtration and the culture filtrate was concentrated by 80% 
ammonium sulphate precipitation. Precipitated proteins were dissolved in buffer and dialyzed 
against distilled water and lyophilised [28]. Three different batches, referred to as batch A, B 
and C, of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv culture filtrate were analysed to emphasise the

reproducibility of the protein profile of the culture filtrate proteins. These preparations were a 
generous gift from Sadamu Nagai, Osaka Japan. 
 
2.2 One-dimensional gel electrophoresis  
Fifty µg of M. tuberculosis H37Rv culture filtrate proteins were mixed with 25 µl sodium-
dedocyl-sulphate (SDS) loading buffer and boiled for 5 minutes prior to separation on a 10 
cm long, 1 mm thick 12% SDS-polyacrylamide (SDS-PAGE) gel. The protein migration was 
allowed to proceed until the blue dye had migrated to the bottom of the gel. The protein bands 
were visualized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB) (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). 
The molecular mass standard, full-range-rainbow-RPN800 (Amersham Biosciences AB 
Uppsala, Sweden), was used to divide each lane into 10 segments. Each segment was cut into 
smaller pieces, destained, and in-gel digested with trypsin (Promega, Woods Hollow Road, 
Madison, U.S.A.). 
2.3 Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis  
Two mg of M. tuberculosis H37Rv culture filtrate proteins were mixed with 350 µl of 
rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% 3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)Dimethyl-
Ammonio]-1-Propanesulfonate (CHAPS), 2% dithiothreitol (DTT), 2% Immobiline pH 
Gradient buffer (IPG buffer) pH 4-7). Isoelectric focusing was performed at 20°C on 18 cm 
immobiline dry strips (Amersham Biosciences AB, Uppsala, Sweden) with pH intervals (3-
10; 4-5; 4.5-5.5; 5.3-6.5) using Multiphor II Electrophoresis System (Amersham Biosciences 
AB Uppsala, Sweden). Running conditions: Current 2 mA; power 5 W using the EPS 3501 
XL Power Supply in gradient mode and with check option for current turned off. Prior to the 
second dimension, the strips were incubated for 15 minutes in equilibration buffer (6 M urea, 
2% SDS, 0.375 M Tris, pH 8.8, 20% glycerol) with 130 mM DTT first and then with 135 mM 
iodoacetoamide. The equilibrated strip was then placed on an ExcelGel XL SDS 12-14% 
(Amersham Biosciences). The second dimension was run at: current 40 mA and power 40 W 
for 4 hours. Proteins were visualized with CBB. Protein spots were excised from the gel and 
digested with trypsin.  
 
2.4 In-gel digestion 
Sliced gel spots or bands were washed twice with 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in 25 mM 
ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) for 15 minutes at room temperature (RT). The gel pieces

were dehydrated by incubating them with 50 µl 100% ACN for 20 minutes at RT. Proteins 
were reduced using 10 mM DTT and alkylated with 55 mM iodoacetamide (IAA); both in 
100 mM NH4HCO3. The gel pieces were dehydrated with ACN as described above, and 
rehydrated in 25 mmol/l NH4HCO3 containing 0.01 µg/µl modified trypsin (Promega). 
Proteins were digested by trypsin for 16–20 h at 37°C. Then, the tryptic peptides were eluted 
by incubating the gel pieces with 50 µl 1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 20 minutes at RT. 
The supernatant containing tryptic peptides were collected by centrifugation at 15700 g for 10 
minutes. Additional peptides were extracted from gel pieces by incubation  with 50 µl 0.1% 
TFA in 50% ACN for 20 minutes at RT, followed by centrifugation at 15700 g. The 
supernatant was collected and added to the previous one. Finally, the gel pieces were 
dehydrated by incubating the gel pieces with 50 µl 100% ACN for 20 minutes at RT, and the 
supernatant was collected by centrifugation as described above and added to the pool. 
2.5 In-solution digestion 
Proteins were precipitated from the M. tuberculosis H37Rv culture filtrate by 80% v/v 
acetone at -20ºC over night. The protein pellet obtained after centrifugation at 15700 g for 10 
minutes was dissolved in aqueous 6 M urea (Ultragrade Fluka), 100 mM Tris (Merck) pH 8 
and 10 mM DTT (Amersham Biosciences), and incubated for 1 hour at 37ºC. Iodoacetoamide 
(IAA) was added to a final concentration of 25 mM followed by an one hour incubation in the 
dark at 37ºC. To avoid unwanted protease alkylation, DTT corresponding to 2.5 mM was 
added followed by a 20 minute incubation at 37ºC. The sample volume was diluted 1:3 with 
MilliQ water (Sigma), and CaCl2 was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. Trypsin 
(Promega) was added to obtain a protein:trypsin ratio of 1:50, and a 16 hour incubation at 
37ºC was conducted. The reaction was quenched by adding TFA to obtain a pH<3 in the 
digested solution. 
2.6 Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-off-flight mass spectrometry 
(MALDI-TOF MS) 
The tryptic peptides extracted from the gel slices were concentrated and desalted using 
ZipTipC18 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA), and eluted with saturated alpha-cyano-4-hydoxy-
cinnamic acid solution (CHCA) (Sigma) in 50% ACN and 0.1% TFA. One µl sample eluted 
from the matrix was applied to the steel target plate and analysed by MALDI-TOF MS 
(Autoflex & Ultraflex, Bruker Daltonics) and MALDI with tandem mass spectrometry 
(MS/MS) (Ultraflex, Bruker Daltonics). The obtained mass spectra were searched against the

21.05.2007 
 
7
M. tuberculosis complex database using MASCOT (http://www.matrixscience.com). The 
search parameters were: 100 ppm tolerance as maximum mass error, monoisotopic mass 
value, and fixed modification of cysteine by carboxymethyl. A protein was regarded 
identified if the matched peptide mass fingerprint covered 20% of the complete protein 
sequence. An assignment with sequence coverage below 20% was only accepted if one or 
more of the main peaks were identified by MALDI MS/MS with a significant MASCOT 
score (above 95% certainty). 
 
2.7 Liquid chromatography (LC) Electrospray Ionisation (ESI) with MS/MS 
On-line LC-MS/MS was performed using the Ultimate high pressure liquid chromatography 
(HPLC) equipment (LC Packings) and an ESI-Q-TOF Ultima Global instrument (Waters, 
Micromass, Manchester, UK). One of two different columns were used, either a capillary 0.3 
x 150 mm C18 reverse phase column (LC Packings) or a nano 0.075 x 150 mm C18 reverse 
phase in-house packed column. The flow rate through the columns was 3 µl/min for the 
capillary column and 0.2 µl/min for the nano column. The solvent gradient went from 5% B 
to 60% B in 42 minutes, then from 60% B to 95% B in 10 minutes, ending with constant 95% 
B for 5 minutes. Solvent A was aqueous 2% ACN in 0.1% TFA, whereas solvent B was 
aqueous 90% ACN in 0.1% TFA. Proteolytic peptide profiles were acquired in data-
dependent MS/MS mode from 3 to 60 minutes with a maximum of 40 seconds spectral 
accumulation time, 10 seconds for each of a maximum of four selected peptides from each 
scan window. The electrospray voltage was set to 3kV and 2.4kV, respectively for the 
capillary and nano setup. The collision energy was set to variable using the charge recognition 
option. The obtained data was searched against the publicly available M. tuberculosis 
complex database using MASCOT Deamon or against the Removed-Signal-Sequence 
database described below. The search results from the different LC-MS/MS analyses were 
stored and combined in a publicly available system (http://genesis.ugent.be/ms_lims/). 
 
2.8 Determination of N-terminal start sites in predicted secreted proteins 
The Neural Network method (SignalPNN) and the Hidden Markov Model (SignalPHMM) for 
predicting 
signal 
peptides 
are 
publicly 
available 
at 
the 
SignalP 
server 
(http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/). All proteins in the proteome of M. tuberculosis 
H37Rv that were predicted to have a signal peptidase I cleavage site by either of the two 
SignalP methods (v 2.0) were compiled in a MASCOT searchable database after removal of

21.05.2007

the predicted signal peptide. This database is referred to as the Removed-Signal-Sequence 
database and is available at (http://www.bioinfo.no/publications/wiker2006/) 
 
One-sided binomial test (Clopper-Pearson) was used to investigate if there were any 
correlation between the AXA motif present in position -1 to -3 relative to the experimentally 
identified cleavage sites.  
3 Results 
 
3.1 Identification of M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteins from Two-dimensional (2D) 
PAGE using MALDI 
 
The major goal of this study was to do a comprehensive proteomic analysis of culture filtrates 
of M. tuberculosis H37Rv with minimal content of intracellular proteins in order to identify as 
many secreted proteins as possible. Three different batches, A, B and C, of 3-4 week old M. 
tuberculosis H37Rv culture filtrates were compared by both SDS-PAGE and 2D-PAGE. The 
batches had highly similar protein profiles, and the major secreted proteins like the antigen 85 
components, MPT32, MPT63, MPT64 and MTC28 were found to constitute a substantial part 
of the total protein in all three batches. In contrast, many proteins thought to be intracellularly 
derived were found to be minor constituents. In particular we did not observe GroEL1 or 
GroEL2 proteins in these culture filtrates which is in accordance with previous observations 
on this type of culture filtrate [33]. A representative 2D-PAGE pattern of the culture filtrate 
from batch A is shown in figure 1 and the corresponding SDS-PAGE profile in figure 2. The 
majority of spots were found in the area between pH 4.0 and 6.5 (Fig. 1). The area between 
pH 6.5 and pH 10.0 did not contain CBB stained spots (results not shown). All the detected 
spots in the CBB-stained 2D-PAGE gels (Fig. 1) were excised and subjected to in-gel 
digestion followed by MALDI-TOF-MS and/or MALDI MS/MS analysis. Three-hundred and 
eighteen spots were identified as 118 unique gene products (Table 1). The identified proteins 
were 
classified 
according 
to 
the 
M. 
tuberculosis 
H37Rv 
gene 
annotation 
(http://sanger.ac.uk/projects/M_tuberculosis/Gene_list/).  
 
3.2 Protein identification by LC-ESI-MS/MS 
The M. tuberculosis H37Rv culture filtrate was also analysed using two different LC-MS/MS 
approaches. Firstly, the unfractionated culture filtrate of batch A was trypsinated in solution, 
and analysed directly with LC-MS/MS. The peptides to be fragmented by MS/MS were 
limited by only selecting peptides within specified molecular mass windows. The windows 
chosen were 300-400 Da, 400-500 Da, 500-600 Da, 600-700 Da, 700-800 Da, 800-900 Da,

21.05.2007 
 
9
900-1000 Da, 1000-1300 Da, 1300-2000 Da and 300-2000 Da. Secondly, in order to identify 
more proteins, the culture filtrates of batch A, B and C were prefractionated using SDS-PAGE 
prior to capillary or nano LC-MS/MS analysis. A total of 10 gel slices were cut and in-gel 
digested with trypsin (Fig. 2). In total, 199 distinct gene products were identified from the 
LC-MS/MS analysis based on at least one identified peptide per protein with a MASCOT 
confidence level above 95% (Table 1). Information about the reliability of each identification, 
like number of peptides matching each protein, is given in supplementary Table 1. The 
protein profile of the three batches showed that proteins with predicted signal peptide using 
Signal P constituted a major part of all three: batch A 60%, batch B 69% and batch C 83%. 
 
3.3 Determination of signal peptidase I cleavage sites  
 
Possible cleavage sites for signal peptidase I can be determined by various computational 
methods. The SignalP method for prediction of secreted proteins based on Neural Network 
method (NN) or the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) [34, 35] is one of the most reliable 
programs for this purpose [36]. Of the 257 proteins identified by 2D-PAGE/MALDI-TOF-MS 
and/or 1D-SDS-PAGE/LC-MS/MS, 159 had a predicted signal peptide by SignalP (Table 1 
and supplementary table 2).  
 
To identify the cleavage site for signal peptidase I of secreted proteins of M. tuberculosis 
H37Rv and to verify a cleavable signal peptide, each mass finger print was searched against 
the Removed-Signal-Sequence database using MASCOT. Out of the 159 identified proteins 
with a predicted signal peptide, 41 N-terminal peptides lying immediately C-terminally to a 
predicted cleavage site were identified (Table 2), which confirms the existence of a cleavable 
signal sequence in many of these proteins. The signal peptides of these proteins are shown in 
table 3. 
 
Interestingly, the SignalP method predicted in total 188 cleavage sites in 127 of the proteins 
predicted to be processed by Signal peptidase I and 85 of these cleavage sites had an AXA 
motif at the N-terminal side (Supplementary table 2). However, among the 127 proteins, 35 
out of 41 experimentally verified cleavage sites had an AXA motif (Table 2). The one-sided 
binomial test showed that this observation was highly signficant (p<0.000003).

Twenty-five of the identified N-terminal cleavage sites were in agreement with both the 
Neural Network method and the Hidden Markov Model predictions, while 10 corresponded 
only with the cleavage site predicted by the Hidden Markov Model, and 6 only with the 
Neural Network method. Furthermore, 13 of the identified N-terminal sequences started with 
aspartic acid in the (+1) position and proline in the (+2) position (the DP motif), which may 
serve as a sorting or recognition signal following translocation and cleavage by signal 
peptidase I [37]. Interestingly, the N-terminal cleavage site of signal peptidase I predicted by 
SignalP in 5 potential lipoproteins (Rv0526, Rv0999, Rv2911, Rv3668c and Rv3759c) were 
also detected; with the predicted lipobox further N-terminally to the detected cleavage sites. 
This finding opens for the possibility that lipoproteins might be alternatively cleaved and 
processed by signal peptidase I and signal peptidase II.  
 
All the experimental data were searched against the NCBI database, but none of the identified 
peptides corresponded to potential signal peptides. 
 
3.4 Functional distribution of the identified M. tuberculosis H37Rv culture filtrate 
proteins 
The annotated M. tuberculosis H37Rv proteins have been classified into 12 distinct functional 
groups (http://genolist.pasteur.fr/TubercuList/). The 257 proteins identified by 2D-PAGE 
MALDI-TOF-MS and SDS-PAGE combined with LC-MS/MS in this study were distributed 
across ten of those functional groups (Fig. 3). Most of the identified proteins are involved in 
prokaryotic cell wall and cell processes (functional group 3, 40.2%) and intermediary 
metabolism and respiration (functional group 7, 25.0%).  
 
3.5 Isoelectric point and molecular mass distribution of the identified M. tuberculosis 
H37Rv culture filtrate proteins 
The methods used in this study for protein identification were able to cover wide pI and 
molecular mass ranges, from a pI value of 3.64 (possible resuscitation-promoting factor 
RpfA, Rv0867c) for protein identified by both 2D-PAGE MALDI and LC-MS/MS to pI value 
12.60 which belonged to Rv3760 identified by LC-MS/MS. The majority of the proteins 
clustered between pI 4-6.5, which is in agreement with previous 2D-PAGE based studies 
performed on culture filtrate proteins (Fig. 4A) [9].

21.05.2007 
 
11
The protein with lowest molecular mass in this study was 9.41 kDa (Putative ESAT-6 like 
protein EsxN, Rv1793), as observed by 2D-PAGE/MALDI-TOF-MS. Probable respiratory 
nitrate reductase, narG (Rv1161) with a molecular mass of 136.92 kDa observed by LC-
MS/MS represented the largest identified secreted protein. The majority of the proteins were 
found in the range between 10 to 50 kDa (Fig. 4B). In many cases, the same protein was 
identified from different 2D-PAGE spots, and in different SDS-PAGE fractions with different 
molecular mass and pI, possibly as a consequence of post-translational modifications or 
proteolytic processing. For example, Rv3587c was detected in three different spots (Fig. 1). 
For 45 secreted proteins the observed average molecular mass was 23.6 kDa by 2D-PAGE 
(Supplementary Table 1). The average theoretical mass of these proteins was 31.0 kDa and 
after removal of the signal peptides as predicted by the NN method, it was 26.5 kDa. With 16 
potential lipoproteins the observed average molecular mass was 29.5 kDa. The theoretical 
masses were 34.4 kDa before and 32.2 kDa after predicted signal peptidase II cleavages. In 57 
proteins without predicted signal peptide the observed average mass was 30.7 kDa while the 
theoretical mass was 32.2 kDa. The differences between average theoretical and average 
observed masses in groups of proteins with and without predicted signal peptides therefore 
supported that signal peptides had been removed from the secreted proteins. 
 
3.6 Novel protein identification 
Among the 257 proteins identified in this study, 92 proteins represent novel identifications. 
Seventy-two of the novel identifications had a N-terminal signal peptide predicted by one or 
both of the Neural Network (NN) and the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) methods, of those, 
13 proteins were predicted to be lipoproteins by ScanProsite (http://au.expasy.org/prosite/). 
Fifty-nine of the novel proteins were without resemblance to other proteins that have been 
functionally characterised previously, showing that there are many proteins with unknown 
functions in the secreted subproteome of M. tuberculosis.  
 
To our knowledge, these results represent the largest number of novel predicted secreted 
proteins in M. tuberculosis culture filtrate reported in one study (Fig. 5), revealing a new part 
of the M. tuberculosis culture filtrate proteome that may prove important for the pathogenesis 
of the bacteria. 
 
3.7 Major M. tuberculosis H37Rv culture filtrate proteins

21.05.2007 
 
12
The most abundant proteins in this M. tuberculosis H37Rv culture filtrate as observed by 2D-
PAGE, were the secreted antigen 85 complex (85A (Rv3804c), 85B (Rv1886c), 85C 
(Rv0129c) and 85D (MPT51, Rv3803c)), immunogenic protein MPT63 (Rv1926c), 
immunogenic protein MPT64 (Rv1980c), alanine-, proline-rich secreted protein MPT32, 
Rv1860) and secreted proline-rich protein MTC28 (Rv0040c). In addition, protein members 
of the 6 kDa early secreted antigenic target-6 (ESAT-6) family were also among the abundant 
proteins (Fig. 1). Among the novel proteins identified by 2D-PAGE, Rv0063 (Possible 
oxidoreductase) and Rv3587c (Probable conserved membrane protein) were also relatively 
abundant. Rv3587c has only one predicted transmembrane region which is coincident with its 
predicted signal peptide, indicating that it is a secreted protein rather than a membrane 
protein.  
 
3.8 Identification of ESAT-6 family proteins  
ESAT-6 is the primary component of a family of small proteins without signal peptides 
secreted by an alternative mechanism [37, 38]. The protein members of this family are potent 
T-cell antigens which are essential for the pathogenicity of the bacterium [38]. The culture 
filtrate of M. tuberculosis H37Rv profiled in this study, contained many ESAT-6 proteins: 
EsxG (Rv0287), EsxL (Rv1198), EsxN (Rv1793), EsxO (Rv2346c), EsxB (Rv3874) and 
EsxA (Rv3875). One protein spot analysed in this study (Fig. 1, ¤) matched several ESAT-6 
family member proteins that are highly homologous and difficult to resolve by 2D-PAGE or 
MS due to highly similar masses and isoelectric points. Therefore the mass fingerprint from 
this protein spot matched all these proteins: EsxJ (Rv1038c), EsxK (Rv1197), EsxP 
(Rv2347c) and EsxW (Rv3620c).  We also identifed 3 peptides by LC-MS/MS that could be 
derived from any of these proteins or EsxM (Rv1792). Two peptides identified by LC-
MS/MS matched all of these proteins: EsxI (Rv1037c), EsxL (1198), EsxN (Rv1793), EsxO 
(Rv2346c) and EsxV (Rv3619c). One peptide identified by LC-MS/MS matched both EsxK 
(Rv1197) and EsxP (Rv2347c).  
 
3.9 Identifications of Lipoproteins 
 
Lipoproteins (Lpp) represent a distinct class of proteins, associated with the membrane 
compartment of the bacteria by means of post-translational lipid modifications, and several 
are found to be surface accessible [39, 40]. These proteins are functionally diverse, and can be 
involved in interactions between the organism and the host [41]. We identified 36 potential

lipoproteins, predicted to have lipid modification sites by the ScanProsite program. Thirteen 
of these proteins had not been identified previously in M. tuberculosis.  
 
4 Discussion 
 
Proteins secreted by M. tuberculosis are believed to mediate important biological functions by 
interacting with host cells, notably macrophages, and are thus potentially important for 
virulence and pathogenesis [22, 42-45]. Many proteomic studies using culture filtrates from 
M. tuberculosis have been published [9, 10, 16, 29, 46, 47]. However, the number of 
identified proteins predicted to be secreted, as based on the presence of a signal peptide in the 
preprotein, has been relatively low, compared to the total number of proteins identified in 
these studies (Fig.5). This study provides a considerably more comprehensive picture of the 
secreted protein repertoire of M. tuberculosis H37Rv than previously shown. It was achieved 
by analysis of a unique type of culture filtrate with almost neglectible content of 
intracellularly derived proteins, produced by Sadamu Nagai (Osaka, Japan), from cultures of 
M. tuberculosis H37Rv on the wholly synthetic Sauton medium. The first proteomic study of 
M. tuberculosis by Nagai et al. [28], focused on secreted proteins in which 12 culture filtrate 
proteins were chromatographically purified and partially characterized. The presently 
analyzed culture filtrates had similar quality as the previously analysed culture filtrate in 
which the antigen 85 complex constitute a major part of the total protein. Looking further 
back in the literature, similar observations of the composition of culture filtrates of M. 
tuberculosis H37Rv were done by Yoneda and Fukui et. al., 1965 [53] also working in Osaka 
Japan. They found that the α antigen (antigen 85) comprised 40% of the total protein which is 
in line with our present results. These results are different, and much higher than what is 
usually found in M. tuberculosis culture filtrates. The important question is whether the 
phenomenon is due to excellent culture technique or whether this is a strain specific 
phenomenon. It is not possible to determine this at the present stage, but we have previously 
worked with several BCG culture filtrates produced by Nagai in the same way as for M. 
tuberculosis. These culture filtrates had significant levels of intracellular proteins. It is 
therefore possible that the local M. tuberculosis strain of H37Rv used in Osaka, Japan has a 
distinct genetic feature, being resistant to the lysis regularly occurring in M. tuberculosis 
complex organisms. An autolytic toxin, MazF-like toxin gene, has been postulated in M. 
tuberculosis [54], which is proposed to be involved in cell response to starvation and may be

the prokaryotic equivalent of apoptosis. Mutations affecting this enzyme could explain the 
nature of Nagai`s culture filtrate.   
 
The N-terminal peptides of mature secreted proteins were identified in 41 of 159 exported 
proteins predicted by SignalP. These results verify the existence of a cleavable signal 
sequence in those proteins, and shows that the SignalP program provides a correct 
identification of the signal peptide and its cleavage site in a large fraction of the predicted 
secreted proteins. However, a majority of the identified N-terminal peptides of mature 
secreted proteins had an AXA motif N-terminally to their cleavage sites, showing that the 
mycobacterial signal peptidase I, preferentially recognizes the AXA motif. This motif is 
underestimated by SignalP, possibly due to the presence of only a few mycobacterial proteins 
in SignalPs training set. This might partly explain the failure to identify the N-terminal 
peptide of the other predicted secreted proteins identified in this study. Our results shows that 
there is a need for a separate algorithm for prediction of secreted proteins in acid-fast bacilli. 
This has not been possible before because few signal peptidase I cleavage sites in 
mycobacteria have been known, but with the data presented in this paper this goal is much 
closer. 
 
Exported lipoproteins have been shown to be exposed at the surface of M. tuberculosis and M. 
bovis. They are however vulnerable to proteolytic cleavage relatively close to the N-terminal 
cysteine and are subsequently released as soluble protein in the culture filtrate. Similar 
observations have also been reported in Bacillus subtilis [55]. The lipoproteins we identified 
in the culture filtrate may represent such proteolytically processed proteins. Our method for 
identification of N-terminal peptides of mature secreted proteins is not applicable to intact 
processed lipoproteins because information about the masses of secondary modification on 
the N-terminal cysteine is not part of the preferences in MASCOT. However, we found five 
potential N-terminal peptides among the 36 predicted lipoproteins. Closer inspection revealed 
that the cleavage site for signal peptidase I, predicted by SignalP and observed in our study, 
lies C-terminally from the predicted cleavage site for signal peptidase II. This finding 
suggests that some lipoproteins may be alternatively processed by signal peptidase I or II, and 
represent a mechanism for dual localization in A) the extracellular environment or B) as  
lipoprotein in the cell wall.

In conclusion, we have obtained a comprehensive picture of the M. tuberculosis H37Rv 
culture filtrate protein repertoire. Two-hundred-fifty-seven proteins were identified by a 
combination of 2D-PAGE/MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS/MS. Sixty-two percent of them had 
predicted N-terminal signal peptide, suggesting that the culture filtrate was particularly 
enriched with respect to secreted proteins. The 92 novel proteins identified in this study 
provide further insight into the M. tuberculosis secreted proteome, and reveal a large portion 
of previously unidentified proteins with unknown function, which might be involved in the 
pathogenesis of tuberculosis. We have improved the methods for identification of secreted 
proteins by referring mass fingerprints of proteins to a database of secreted proteins with 
predicted signal peptides removed. This method is also useful for determining the cleavage 
site for mycobacterial signal peptidase I, which is shown to preferentially recognize the AXA 
motif.

aProteins not annotated in M. tuberculosis H37Rv strain. 
bExplanation of functional group: (0) virulence, detoxification, and adaptation, (1) lipid metabolism, (2) information pathway, (3) cell wall and 
cell processes, (6) PE/PPE family member proteins, (9) regulatory proteins, (10) conserved hypothetical proteins, and (16) conserved 
hypothetical proteins with an orthologue in M. bovis. 
cProbability to have N-terminal signal peptide predicted by Neural Network (NN).  
dProbability to have N-terminal signal peptide predicted by Hidden Markov Model (HMM). 
These proteins have been observed by others previously: e[8], f[5], g[6], h[9], i[10], j[15], k[29], l[31], m[28], n[7], o[48], p[51], q[49], r[50], s[52], 
t[16], u[47] 
 
Rv3849: The signal peptide prediction by the NN method predicts a very short signal peptide, only 6 amino acids, which is unlikely. 
MT0066.1: The nucleotide seqence of MT0066.1 is identical in M. tuberculosis H37Rv and found in positions 65012..65392 on the minus (-) 
strand overlapping with Rv0061 which is annotated as a conserved hypothetical protein (questionable ORF).  7. 
MT2420: The sequence of the peptide identified to belong to MT2420 is not encoded in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome. The peptide is 
highly homologous to a peptide found in Rv1793, the only difference being an A in MT2420 instead of an S. The peptide may therefore be 
derived from Rv1793 being modified posttranslationally by removal of a hydroxyl group to change S to A. 
MT3437.1: The nucleotide seqence of MT3437.1 is identical in M. tuberculosis H37Rv and found in positions 3720757..3721236 on the pluss 
(+) strand overlapping slightly with Rv3333c (position 3720782), extending in the gap between this gene and Rv3334 which starts at position 
372125

aGene number as annotated for M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Rv) or M. tuberculosis CDC1551 (MT).  Three proteins were only identified with the 
annoted genes for M. tuberculosis CDC1551. The nucleotide sequence of MT0066.1 is identical in M. tuberculosis H37Rv and found in positions 
65012..65392 on the minus (-) strand overlapping with Rv0061 which is annotated as a conserved hypothetical protein (questionable ORF).  The 
sequence of the peptide identified to belong to MT2420 is not encoded in the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome. The peptide is highly homologous to a 
peptide found in Rv1793, the only difference being an A in MT2420 instead of an S. The peptide may therefore be derived from Rv1793 being 
modified posttranslationally by removal of a hydroxyl group to change S to A. The nucleotide sequence of MT3437.1 is identical in M. tuberculosis 
H37Rv and found in positions 3720757..3721236 on the plus (+) strand overlapping slightly with Rv3333c (position 3720782), extending in the gap 
between this gene and Rv3334 which starts at position 3721257. 
bTheoretical molecular mass (kDa) or isoelectric point (pI) calculated after removing the predicted signal peptide as determined by prediction of 
lipoprotein consensus motif using Compute pI/MW tool, publicly available at (http://au.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html). See also supplementary table 
2.

cTheoretical molecular mass (kDa) calculated after removing the predicted signal peptide by Neural Network/Hidden Markov model, using Compute 
pI/MW tool, publicly available at (http://au.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html). Only one figure is given when the predictions were concordant. If one of 
the methods did not predict a signal peptide it is designated with a “-“. See also supplementary table 2. 
dObserved molecular masses as determined by 2D-PAGE. 
eTheoretical isoelectric point (pI) calculated after removing the predicted signal peptide by Neural Network/Hidden Markov model, Compute pI/MW 
tool, publicly available at (http://au.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html). If one of the methods did not predict a signal peptide it is designated with a “-“. 
See also supplementary table 2. 
fObserved pI as determined by 2D-PAGE.  
gPeptides were identified by Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry of spots collected from 2D-PAGE (MS), 
Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-off-flight mass spectrometry combined with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) or Liquid 
chromatography Electrospray Ionisation  with tandem mass spectrometry (LC- MS/MS) 
hNone of the identified peptides by MS or MS/MS were predicted signal peptides, 
iSequence coverage for individual proteins is given as number of peptides/percentage of sequence coverage for MS data, or as number of identified 
peptides for MS/MS and LC-MS/MS data. 
j Fraction number of identified peptide after SDS-PAGE performed as shown in Figure 2. Explanation of the fraction numbers: (1) >160 kDa, (2) 
ranges from 105-160 kDa, (3) ranges from 75-105 kDa, (4) ) ranges from 50-75 kDa, (5) ranges from 35-50 kDa, (6) ranges from 30-35 kDa, (7) 
ranges from 25-30 kDa, (8) ranges from 15-25 kDa, (9) ranges from 15-10 kDa, (10) <10 kDa. Many peptides were observed several times and also 
in more than one fraction. In such cases the fraction with most observations or most reliable observation is given. 
k Batch number refers to the three different batches (A,B or C) of 3 - 4 week old M. tuberculosis H37Rv culture filtrates analysed. 
 
*    Two peptides identified by LC-MS/MS matched all of these proteins: EsxI (Rv1037c), EsxL (1198), EsxN (Rv1793), EsxO (Rv2346c)    
      and EsxV (Rv3619c),

** One protein spot (Fig, 1, ¤) fingerprint matched all of these proteins: EsxJ (Rv1038c), EsxK (Rv1197), EsxP (Rv2347c) and EsxW  
            (Rv3620c) 
      *** One peptide identified by LC-MS/MS matched both EsxK (Rv1197) and EsxP (Rv2347c).
