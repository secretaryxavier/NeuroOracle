Abstract
The glutamate and dopamine hypotheses are leading theories of the pathoaetiology of 
schizophrenia. Both were initially based on indirect evidence from pharmacological studies 
supported by post-mortem findings, but have since been substantially advanced by new lines of 
evidence from in vivo imaging studies. This review provides an up- date on the latest findings on 
dopamine and glutamate abnormalities in schizophrenia, focusing on the in vivo neuroimaging 
studies in patients and clinical high risk groups, and considers their implications for understanding 
the biology and treatment of schizophrenia. These findings have refined both the dopamine and 
glutamate hypotheses, enabling greater anatomical and functional specificity, and have been 
complemented by preclinical evidence showing how the risk factors for schizophrenia impact on 
the dopamine and glutamate systems. The implications of this new evidence for understanding the 
development and treatment of schizophrenia are considered, and the gaps in current knowledge 
highlighted. Finally the evidence for an integrated model of the interactions between the glutamate 
and dopamine systems is reviewed, and future directions discussed.

Introduction
Schizophrenia is a common, severe mental illness (Jablensky et al., 1992; Jablensky, 2000), 
and a leading cause of adult disease burden (Whiteford et al., 2013). It has a lifetime 
prevalence of about 0.7%, with a peak age of onset in the early twenties in men, and three or 
four years later in women (Saha et al., 2005). The disorder is characterised by psychotic

symptoms such as delusions and hallucinations, negative symptoms such as social 
withdrawal and amotivation, and cognitive impairments. In addition to the high morbidity 
and mortality rate associated with schizophrenia, the health and social care costs for the 
illness are substantial: total costs of care for individuals with schizophrenia in the UK 
amount to 16.7 billion EURO per annum, while for Europe the figure is 93.9 billion EURO 
(Gustavsson et al., 2011). Antipsychotic drugs are the mainstay of treatment for 
schizophrenia, but are inadequate in a substantial proportion of patients (Andrews, 2003). 
Better understanding of the neurobiology underlying the disorder is needed to improve the 
use of existing drugs and inform the development of new drugs.
Two of the most influential hypotheses concerning the neurobiology underlying the disorder 
involve dopamine and glutamate. Both hypotheses were proposed several decades ago, but 
new evidence, particularly from in vivo imaging studies and preclinical findings on the role 
of these neurotransmitters has refined understanding of the nature of dopamine and 
glutamate dysfunction in schizophrenia. The purpose of this review is to provide an 
overview of both hypotheses and an up-date on the recent findings relevant to them, 
focussing on the in vivo neuroimaging findings. Finally it considers the degree to which they 
may be integrated, the implications of the new findings for treatment, and the limitations of 
current evidence.
Dopamine
Dopamine: early evidence for its involvement in schizophrenia
The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia initially arose from several indirect sources of 
evidence. A key source was studies showing that administration of amphetamine and other 
compounds which increase extracellular concentrations of dopamine can induce psychotic 
symptoms similar to those seen in schizophrenia (see review (Lieberman et al., 1987)). This 
was supported by studies of drugs, such as reserpine and alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine that 
deplete dopamine levels (Carlsson et al., 1957), which showed that these drugs reduced 
psychotic symptoms (Campden-Main and Wegielski, 1955; Arnold and Freeman, 1956; 
Carlsson et al., 1973; Walinder and Skott, 1976).
Further evidence for dopamine’s involvement in schizophrenia came in the 1970s, with 
observations that the clinical effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs was directly related to their 
affinity for dopamine receptors (Seeman and Lee, 1975; Seeman et al., 1976; Creese et al., 
1976). As a result of this discovery, the leading hypothesis at this time was that 
schizophrenia arises as a result of abnormalities in dopamine receptor density (Matthysse, 
1973; Snyder, 1976).
Whilst these findings implicated dopamine in schizophrenia, this was in a rather general way 
and there were a number of limitations on the interpretation of the evidence. For example, 
both amphetamine and reserpine affect other brain monoamines as well as dopamine (see 
review (Davis et al., 1991)). Furthermore, at this time there was no clear indication of the 
locus of dopaminergic abnormality in the living brain.

Post-mortem studies are able to provide anatomical detail and biochemical specificity. Early 
post-mortem studies suggested that the neuropathological changes in schizophrenia included 
both an increase in striatal dopamine levels, and an increase in D2 receptor density (Owen et 
al., 1978; Mackay et al., 1982), but no change in dopamine transporter (DAT) densities 
(Pearce and Seeman, 1990).
More recent studies have provided greater detail regarding the nature of these pre and post-
synpatic dopamine changes. For example, recent research has shown tyrosine hydroxylase, 
the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of dopamine, is significantly increased in 
the substantia nigra of patients with schizophrenia compared to patients with depression and 
healthy controls (Howes et al., 2013a), indicating that there is increased capacity for 
production of dopamine in the midbrain origin of dopamine neurons as well as their striatal 
terminals. Other recent work has refined understanding of the nature of the D2 receptor 
changes. A study including 176 post mortem samples from patients with schizophrenia 
showed the expression of the presynaptic D2 autoreceptor was increased, while the 
expression of predominantly postsynaptic variants were decreased in the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex compared with controls (Kaalund et al., 2013). The hypothesis that D2 
receptors are somehow altered in schizophrenia is supported by genetics’ findings that have 
shown a clear association between the DRD2 gene and schizophrenia. (Ripke et al., 2014).
The potential relevance of the D4 receptor was initially highlighted by post mortem work 
showing a sixfold increase in D4 receptor density in schizophrenia (Seeman et al., 1993). 
This finding appeared to bear particular relevance given clozapine’s unique clinical 
properties and its high level of binding to the D4 receptor not shared by other antipsychotics. 
Subsequent attempts at replication, however, were mixed (Reynolds and Mason, 1994; 
Murray et al., 1995).
Dopamine receptors form dimers with themselves and with other receptors in in vitro 
models. A number of studies have recently looked at the role that dimerisation of the 
dopamine receptor may play in schizophrenia. In a study of 15 schizophrenia patients Wang 
and colleagues found a 278% increase in expression of D2 dimers compared to controls, 
while D2 monomers were decreased to 69% of the control level (Wang et al., 2010). In 
addition there is preliminary evidence concerning D2 heteromers from a post-mortem study 
that found that D1-D2 heteromers were increased in schizophrenia in the globus pallidus, 
although the study included only 4 patients with schizophrenia (Perreault et al., 2010). This 
is complemented by earlier post-mortem findings that showed the inhibitory link between 
D1 and D2 receptors is reduced in patients with schizophrenia (Seeman et al., 1989). These 
findings highlight the potential impact of changes in dimerization, although, as it is not yet 
possible to directly measure dimerization in vivo, these finding await testing in vivo in 
patients.
In summary, post-mortem studies continue to identify abnormalities in both the presynaptic 
and post-synaptic dopaminergic system in schizophrenia. However, one potential limitation 
of post mortem studies is the difficulty in controlling for the confounding effects of 
antipsychotic medication, and it is plausible that the presynaptic and post-synaptic changes 
observed are predominantly iatrogenic. Another difficulty is linking the changes to the

expression of symptoms and the development of the disorder, often many years before the 
patient died. In order to address these issues evidence from living patients is required. The 
following sections consider the latest in vivo neurochemical imaging evidence in patients.
Dopamine and schizophrenia: in vivo imaging evidence
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography 
(SPECT) imaging allows the in vivo quantification of many aspects of dopaminergic 
function in the brain, including dopamine synthesis, the degree of dopamine release in 
response to stimuli, and the availability of the post-synaptic dopaminergic receptors and 
transporters (Kim et al., 2013a). Over the last two decades or so, advances in PET/SPECT 
technology and their application has enabled the major aspects of the dopaminergic 
hypothesis of schizophrenia to be tested and refined (McGuire et al., 2008). Studies initially 
focussed on dopamine D2 receptors and the action of antipsychotic drugs, before examining 
other aspects of the dopaminergic system
Antipsychotic drugs and dopamine D2 receptors—All currently licensed 
antipsychotic drugs block D2 dopamine receptors. However, they also act at other receptors 
in the brain, including other dopamine receptor subtypes and those for serotonin, histamine, 
norepinephrine and acetylcholine (Stahl, 2013). It was initially far from clear which receptor 
mediated the clinical response to antipsychotic treatment. Molecular imaging studies with 
both SPECT (e.g.: (Brücke et al., 1991; Brücke et al., 1992; Pilowsky et al., 1993; Volk et 
al., 1994; Klemm et al., 1996)) and PET (e.g.: (Farde et al., 1988; Baron et al., 1989; 
Wolkin, 1989; Nordström et al., 1992; Nordstrom et al., 1993; Goyer et al., 1996; Kapur et 
al., 1996)) have extended the in vitro studies on dopamine receptors and antipsychotics from 
the 1970s in several crucial ways. First, they have demonstrated that all antipsychotic drugs 
cross the blood-brain-barrier. Second, they have shown that they block D2/3 striatal 
receptors in vivo at clinically effective doses. These data extended the in vitro findings to 
patients, and have provided the foundation for studies in which the relationship between D2 
occupancy and clinical response could be established.
The relationship between D2 occupancy, clinical response, and side effects is not linear (see 
review Howes et al. 2009a)). Little response is seen when occupancy is below 50%, response 
increases from this point but the risk of extrapyramidal side effects increases when 
occupancy reaches around 75% (Nordstrom et al., 1993). These findings have been 
replicated in a double blind study of first-episode patients. This study found a threshold D2 
occupancy of 65% was found to best separate responders from non-responders: at 65% 
receptor occupancy, 80% of responders were above the threshold whilst 67% of the non–
responders lay below the 65% threshold (Kapur et al., 2000). Given the central role of 
dopamine receptors in the mode of action of antipsychotics, it is not surprising that 
considerable focus has been directed at determining if there are alterations in D2 receptors in 
vivo.
Dopamine D2 Receptor availability in schizophrenia—The action of dopamine on 
post-synaptic receptors constitutes the final stage in transmitting the dopaminergic neuronal 
impulse to post-synaptic neurons. As all clinically available antipsychotics block D2

receptors, over the last three decades many studies have investigated whether D2 receptor 
availability is altered in schizophrenia compared to control subjects.
It is important to note that the radioligands used to image dopamine receptors in vivo such as 
[11C]raclopride (Malmberg et al., 1993) and [123I](S)-(-)-3-iodo-2-hydroxy-6-methoxy-N-
[(1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)methyl]benzamide ([123I]IBZM) (Videbaek et al., 2000) show 
significant D3 receptor binding in addition to their D2 binding. Thus it is theoretically 
possible that an elevation in one could be obscured by a reduction in another. [11C]-(+)-4-
propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine ([11C]-PHNO) is an agonist radiotracer that shows higher 
affinity for D3 receptors than D2. Studies in schizophrenia using this tracer have not shown 
any difference in binding from controls (Graff-Guerrero et al., 2009). This suggests that 
alterations in D3 receptor availability are not masking changes in D2 receptors, although the 
development of selective D2 tracers would be useful to definitively establish this.
There have been at least twenty-two published studies, but, after an initial positive finding, 
subsequent results have been inconsistent. The most recent meta-analysis (Howes et al., 
2012b) found increased D2/3 receptor density in patients with schizophrenia, but the effect 
size was small (d=0.26, p=0.049). However the picture is complicated by large heterogeneity 
between studies. In the subgroup analysis of studies that exclusively considered 
antipsychotic-naïve patients no significant differences from controls was found, whereas 
significant differences were found in the studies that included patients who had received 
antipsychotic treatment. Other sources of heterogeneity include different radiotracers used 
and differences in duration of illness. In addition, elevated baseline dopamine levels in 
schizophrenic patients could potentially mask differences in receptor density. Nevertheless 
the most likely implications are that there is not a major elevation in D2 receptor availability 
in drug naïve patients and that antipsychotic treatment leads to D2 receptor upregulation in 
some patients. The potential effect of antipsychotics on D2 receptors has been tested directly 
in a PET imaging study comparing D2 binding potentials between a group of treatment 
naïve patients with a group that had been treated with antipsychotics long term that 
underwent temporary antipsychotic withdrawal (Silvestri et al., 2000). Significantly 
increased D2 receptor availability was found in the group that had experienced long term 
antipsychotic treatment, consistent with the idea that there is D2 upregulation with 
antipsychotic treatment.
Changes in D1 receptor densities have been less thoroughly investigated and are complicated 
by variation in the populations studied and the radiotracers employed. Two studies looking 
at chronic, medicated patients have shown widespread cortical and striatal reductions in D1 
receptor densities (Hirvonen et al., 2006; Kosaka et al., 2010). One study of antipsychotic 
naïve patients and one of naïve and previously treated patients showed increased densities of 
D1 receptors in the prefrontal cortex in patients (Abi-Dargham et al., 2002; Abi-Dargham et 
al., 2012). Conversely another study of antipsychotic naïve and medication free patients 
showed a decrease in prefrontal cortex densities (Okubo et al., 1997), while a further study 
of purely naïve patients showed no significant differences (Karlsson et al., 2002). 
Interpretation of the studies is further complicated by the discovery that the radiotracers used 
(NNC 112 and SCH 23390) also bind to the 5HT2A receptor (Ekelund et al., 2007; Catafau 
et al., 2010),. This serotonergic receptor has been implicated in the aetiology of 
Howes et al.

schizophrenia, and its involvement has been further supported by a recent meta-analysis of 
post-mortem findings (Selvaraj et al., 2014). Further studies using more specific radiotracers 
are thus needed to determine the nature of D1 changes in schizophrenia.
Fewer studies have investigated D2/3 receptor density in extrastriatal brain regions. A recent 
meta-analysis did not find any significant differences for receptor densities in the thalamus, 
temporal cortex or substantia nigra; while in other brain regions where it was not possible to 
conduct a meta-analysis findings were either statistically insignificant or have not been 
replicated (Kambeitz et al., 2014).
Finally, the D2 receptor may exist in two intraconvertible (high and low) affinity states for 
agonist binding and it has been proposed that the balance between these two states is altered 
in schizophrenia (Seeman et al., 2006). An initial study with [11C]-(+)-PHNO ([11C]-(+)-4-
propyl-9-hydroxynaphthoxazine), a radiotracer selective for the high affinity state as well as 
D3 receptors, suggested that no alteration is apparent in the absence of dopamine depletion 
(Graff-Guerrero et al., 2009). However further work has suggested that the radiotracer used 
may be unable to distinguish between the two receptor states (Seeman, 2012), indicating that 
this issue remains unresolved.
Dopamine transporter levels—The dopamine active transporter (DAT) regulates 
dopaminergic transmission by removing dopamine from the synaptic cleft. The DAT is 
solely present in dopamine synthesising axons (Ciliax and Heilman, 1995), and because of 
this specificity in location it is a useful measure of the integrity of dopaminergic neurons. 
Early neurodegenerative theories of schizophrenia proposed that a change in the density of 
striatal dopamine terminals was fundamental to the disorder; one strand of this hypothesis 
was that hyperdopaminergic activity could itself be neurotoxic and lead to loss of 
dopaminergic neurons in the striatum (Lieberman et al., 1990). Imaging of the DAT has 
allowed this hypothesis to be tested.
There have been thirteen PET or SPECT imaging studies that have addressed DAT density in 
schizophrenia. There is a large degree of heterogeneity between the studies with a number of 
inconsistent findings. Recent meta-analyses (Howes et al., 2012b; Chen et al., 2013) found 
no evidence for a difference in striatal DAT receptor densities in patients with schizophrenia, 
and this finding has been replicated in a subsequent study of almost fifty antipsychotic-naïve 
patients (Chen et al., 2013). This essentially negative result suggests that the dopaminergic 
abnormalities observed in schizophrenia are not secondary to abnormalities in the DAT, nor 
due to differences in the density of pre-synaptic dopaminergic neurons.
Dopamine synthesis and release—In dopamine neurons radiolabelled L-DOPA is 
converted to dopamine and trapped in dopaminergic nerve terminals. The extent of 
radiolabelled L-DOPA uptake measured using PET thus provides an index of presynaptic 
dopamine synthesis capacity and the availability of dopamine for release from presynaptic 
terminals (see review by (Kumakura and Cumming, 2009)), and shows good test retest 
reliability in dopaminergic regions (Egerton et al., 2010a). Meta-analysis of the studies using 
this technique shows a large elevation in dopamine synthesis capacity in schizophrenia 
compared with matched controls, with an effect size of 0.8 (Howes et al., 2012b). With the

addition of three studies published after this meta-analysis, there have now been fourteen 
PET studies of dopamine synthesis capacity in patients with schizophrenia, summarised in 
table 1 (adapted from (Howes et al., 2012b)).
Dopaminergic neurotransmission requires the release of dopamine from presynaptic 
terminals. This can be indexed in vivo using molecular imaging with radiotracers which bind 
to dopamine D2 receptors, such as [11C]raclopride or [123I]IBZM, as these radiotracers 
compete with dopamine to bind to dopamine D2 receptors. Decreased radiotracer binding 
following a pharmacological challenge that releases dopamine thus reflects increased 
extracellular dopamine (Egerton et al., 2010b). All six investigations that have used this 
approach in schizophrenia have found evidence of significantly increased dopamine release 
in patients compared to control subjects (Laruelle et al., 1999; Abi-Dargham et al., 2009; 
Pogarell et al., 2012) (see table 2). The extent of radiotracer displacement was 
approximately doubled in schizophrenic patients, and the degree of displacement correlated 
with the degree of worsening of psychotic symptoms. These findings have been recently 
been extended by using a social stress task in the place of the pharmacological challenge, 
and showing increased dopamine release to stress in schizophrenia (Mizrahi et al., 2012).
An alternative method to index synaptic dopamine levels involves the use of alpha-methyl-p-
tyrosine, a tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor. This depletes intrasynaptic dopamine and 
therefore allows the level of baseline synaptic occupancy to be estimated from the 
subsequent increase in radiotracer binding. Two studies using this technique have shown 
increased baseline occupancy of D2 receptors in schizophrenia, indicating that extracellular 
dopamine concentrations are also increased at baseline in schizophrenia (Kegeles et al., 
2010) (see table 2).
Presynaptic dopamine dysfunction: state or trait marker?—Together, these 
studies provide compelling evidence that presynaptic dopamine availability and dopamine 
release are increased in schizophrenia. This raises the question is increased presynaptic 
dopamine a state marker of psychosis or a trait marker related to risk of schizophrenia?
In the studies where patients were acutely psychotic at the time of investigation, elevated 
dopamine synthesis capacity has been consistently detected (Hietala et al., 1995; Hietala et 
al., 1999; Howes et al., 2009b), whereas elevated dopamine synthesis capacity has been less 
consistently detected in studies of chronic patients, with some studies not finding significant 
differences from controls (Dao-Castellana et al., 1997; Elkashef et al., 2000; Shotbolt et al., 
2011) whilst others have detected significant elevations (Reith et al., 1994; Meyer-
Lindenberg et al., 2002; Mcgowan et al., 2004; Howes et al., 2013a). Similarly patients 
experiencing an acute relapse show evidence of significantly greater dopamine release than 
controls, and although patients in remission show greater dopamine release than controls in 
absolute terms, this was not statistically significant (Laruelle et al., 1999).
In recent years a significant body of work has developed examining the prodromal phase of 
schizophrenia (see table 3). Howes et al. initially showed that dopamine synthesis capacity is 
increased in individuals with prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia (Howes et al., 2009b), 
now replicated in an independent cohort (Egerton et al., 2013), while later work showed that 
Howes et al.

the increase in capacity was specific to individuals that went on to develop a psychotic 
illness (Howes et al., 2011b). Finally, the studies in the prodrome to schizophrenia provide 
evidence that dopamine synthesis capacity increases further with the onset of acute 
psychosis (Howes et al., 2011a).
Taken together these findings suggest there is at least a component of presynaptic 
dysfunction that changes and is related to the acute psychotic state. However, this does not 
exclude the possibility that a further component is related to risk.
In order to determine whether increased synthesis capacity is a marker for risk of 
schizophrenia two studies have examined individuals with an increased genetic risk of 
schizophrenia. In a study of seventeen first degree relatives of individuals with schizophrenia 
Huttenen et al. (Huttunen et al., 2008) found significantly increased dopamine synthesis 
capacity compared to controls. However, Shotbolt et al. did not find altered dopamine 
synthesis capacity in twins discordant for schizophrenia (Shotbolt et al., 2011). As the twins 
in this study were predominantly dizygotic it remains possible that they had not inherited the 
genetic risk, and further studies are needed to determine if genetic risk is associated with 
dopamine dysregulation per se.
A contrasting approach has been to see whether increased synthesis capacity is present in 
individuals who experience psychotic-like symptoms but do not have a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia. Early research showed that psychotic symptoms secondary to temporal lobe 
epilepsy were associated with increased striatal dopamine synthesis capacity to a similar 
degree to that seen in schizophrenia (Reith et al., 1994). This has also been shown to be the 
case in individuals with schizotypal personality disorder (Abi-Dargham et al., 2004), while 
this has not found in healthy individuals who experience persistent sub-clinical auditory 
hallucinations but have never developed schizophrenia or functional impairment (Howes et 
al., 2013b), suggesting presynaptic dopamine dysfunction is linked to clinical disorder rather 
than being a marker of psychotic-like experiences per se.
In summary, evidence from a number of studies indicates that presynaptic dopamine 
dysfunction has at least a state component, but the evidence that it is a trait marker is less 
clear cut. Research using healthy twin pairs has found evidence that environmental factors 
explain a substantial proportion of variation in normal presynaptic dopamine function 
(Stokes et al., 2013). This fits with recent models that stress and other risk factors for 
psychosis impact on a vulnerable dopamine system to dysregulate it and lead to psychosis 
(Howes and Murray, 2014).
Linking dopamine to symptoms and environmental risk factors
The evidence reviewed above indicates there is a presynaptic hyperdopaminergic 
abnormality in schizophrenia and that antipsychotics act by blocking D2 receptors to treat 
psychotic symptoms. In and of themselves however, these findings do not explain how a 
biochemical abnormality can account for the phenomenology of the psychotic experience. 
The aberrant salience model (Kapur, 2003; Heinz and Schlagenhauf, 2010; Winton-Brown et 
al., 2014)seeks to provide this link.
Howes et al.

Animal studies provide support for dopamine’s role as a mediator in assigning motivational 
salience to internal or external stimuli, and thereby determining which stimuli grab attention 
and drive behaviour (Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010). It is proposed that in schizophrenia, the 
elevation in presynaptic dopamine leads to its release in the absence of appropriate stimuli 
(Winton-Brown et al., 2014). Dysregulated release is thought to lead to the attribution of 
salience to irrelevant stimuli simply by virtue of the stimuli’s temporal association with the 
dopaminergic signalling. This aberrant attribution of salience is thought to account for 
psychotic phenomena such as ideas of reference, and patients’ accounts of the prodromal 
phase of psychosis, where everyday occurrences are imbued with a sense of inexplicable 
significance (Fusar-Poli et al., 2008). There is certainly evidence that untreated and drug 
naïve patients with schizophrenia show alterations in processing motivationally salient 
stimuli (Juckel et al., 2006; Schlagenhauf et al., 2009; Nielsen et al., 2012). In addition there 
is also evidence that patients with current delusions and people with prodromal-type 
symptoms who are at risk of psychosis show greater assignment of importance to irrelevant 
stimuli, supporting the aberrant salience hypothesis (Roiser et al., 2009; Roiser et al., 2013). 
This hypothesis has been integrated with cognitive models (Garety et al., 2001) to explain 
the paranoid flavour of many delusional experiences by proposing that social adversity leads 
to the development of paranoid biases, which adds a persecutory colour to the misattribution 
of salience (Howes and Murray, 2014). The subsequent crystallisation of this experience into 
a delusion can be viewed as an individual’s attempt to construct a coherent narrative that 
accounts for their experiences, and influenced by their personal and cultural background.
The combination of this aberrant salience model with the dopaminergic abnormalities 
described above, and evidence on the impact of environmental and neurodevelopmental risk 
factors has contributed to the dopamine hypothesis being revised (Howes and Kapur, 2009; 
Howes and Murray, 2014). However this is predominantly a model of psychosis in 
schizophrenia.
Cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia are responsible for a major proportion of 
the disability associated with the disorder (Ho et al., 1998; Rosenheck et al., 2006). An 
influential reconceptualization of the dopamine hypothesis in the 1990s proposed that sub-
cortical hyperdopaminergia was secondary to cortical hypodopaminergia, in particular in 
frontal regions (Davis et al., 1991). The association between frontal dysfunction and 
cognitive impairment seen in schizophrenia is well established (Barch and Ceaser, 2012). 
Furthermore research in patients with chronic schizophrenia has shown that cortical 
dysfunction is linked to increased striatal dopamine dysfunction (Bertolino et al., 2000; 
Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2002), in line with this hypothesis. However, as these studies were 
in chronic patients, it was not clear whether this reflected the long-term sequelae of the 
condition or was linked to the development of the disorder. More recent research in 
individuals showing prodromal indicators of schizophrenia has found that increased striatal 
dopamine synthesis capacity is associated with worse performance on cognitive tasks 
(Howes et al., 2009b), and that it is correlated with altered cortical function during cognitive 
tasks prior to the onset of schizophrenia as well (Fusar-poli et al., 2010; Allen et al., 2012a; 
Allen et al., 2012b). This indicates that a common factor could underlie both processes, but 
does not indicate which is primary, or what the common factor is. Whilst it remains 
plausible that the common factor is cortical dysfunction, animal models using mice that

selectively overexpress striatal D2 receptors suggest that increased dopaminergic activity in 
the striatum may be able to account for both deficits in incentive motivation (Ward et al., 
2012) and in cognitive functioning (Simpson et al., 2010), indicating that striatal 
dopaminergic dysfunction could contribute to the negative symptoms and cognitive 
impairments. These findings thus suggest that sub-cortical dopamine dysfunction could 
contribute to the cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as well as psychosis.
Limitations of the dopamine evidence in schizophrenia
The findings reviewed above provide evidence that there is a dopaminergic abnormality 
underlying schizophrenia, localise it to presynaptic dopamine dysfunction and link this to 
the symptoms of the disorder. However there are a number of findings that remain 
inadequately accounted for. These are discussed below.
Treatment resistance and non-dopaminergic forms of schizophrenia—One third 
of individuals with schizophrenia do not respond to non-clozapine antipsychotics (Mortimer 
et al., 2010) despite high levels of D2 occupancy (Kapur et al., 2000). Furthermore they do 
not respond to manipulations that deplete presynaptic dopamine either (Remington et al., 
2012). The implication is that for a significant number of patients the pathophysiological 
basis of their symptoms involves more than dopaminergic excess, or may be unrelated to 
dopaminergic dysfunction. Demjaha et al. have shown that dopamine synthesis capacity 
appears was raised in individuals with a treatment responsive illness but not in treatment 
resistant patients (Demjaha et al., 2012). This is in agreement with earlier findings that 
found increased synaptic dopamine was predictive of treatment response (Abi-dargham et 
al., 2000). Overall this suggests that there may be a ‘non-dopaminergic’ sub-type of 
schizophrenia (Howes and Kapur, 2014).
Negative and cognitive symptoms—Whilst dopaminergic dysfunction has been linked 
to negative and cognitive symptoms, and there are plausible mechanisms to explain this (as 
reviewed above), the direction of causality has yet to be established (Howes et al., 2012a). 
Furthermore, the challenge studies provide evidence that dopamine elevation, albeit to 
supra-physiological levels, reduces negative symptoms (Laruelle et al., 1999), which is not 
consistent with a simple model of presynaptic dopamine dysregulation underlying negative 
symptoms. This could be accounted for by the hypothesis that there are regionally selective 
changes, with low cortical dopamine accounting for negative and cognitive symptoms 
(Laruelle, 2014). However, this hypothesis remains to be tested with in vivo imaging studies, 
although this is now possible (Narendran et al., 2009; Narendran et al., 2014). 
Notwithstanding this, in clinical practice the effects of dopamine antagonists and partial 
agonists on cognitive impairments and negative symptoms are modest at best (Murphy et al., 
2006), and may even worsen cognitive function(Kim et al., 2013b). This implies that either 
the dopamine modulating tools currently employed are blunt instruments or that other 
pathways, such as those involving glutamate, contribute to cognitive dysfunction.
Dual diagnosis—Substance dependence is common in people with schizophrenia 
(Buckley et al., 2009) and a number of studies have examined this population. Decreased 
amphetamine induced dopamine release has been demonstrated in dual diagnosis patients 
Howes et al.

compared to healthy controls (Thompson et al., 2013). Similarly, in clinically high risk 
individuals those that were cannabis dependent showed reduced dopamine release (Mizrahi 
et al., 2013). Imaging of dopamine synthesis capacity in individuals who experience 
psychotic symptoms when they smoke cannabis showed significantly reduced striatal [18F]-
DOPA uptake compared to healthy volunteers (Bloomfield et al., 2014). These findings 
indicate that the link between substance abuse and psychosis may involve a pathway that is 
distinct from the striatal presynaptic dopamine dysfunction described above.
Glutamate
The NMDA receptor hypofunction hypothesis
Excitatory neurotransmission in the brain is primarily glutamatergic, with glutamatergic 
neurons utilising between 60 and 80 percent of total brain metabolic activity (Rothman et al., 
2003). Glutamatergic neurotransmission occurs through metabotropic and ionotropic 
glutamate receptors, which are each subdivided into 3 groups. Group I metabotropic 
glutamate receptors (mGluR1 and mGluR5) are mainly postsynaptic, whereas group II 
(mGluR2 and mGluR3) and III (mGluR4, mGluR6, mGluR7 and mGluR8) are primarily 
presynaptic and modulate neurotransmitter release (Kew and Kemp, 2005). Ionotropic 
glutamate receptors are named after the agonists originally found to selectively activate 
them: a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoazolepropionic acid (AMPA), kainate and N-
methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) (Dingledine et al., 1999; Kew and Kemp, 2005).
The involvement of glutamatergic mechanisms in schizophrenia has been hypothesised for 
many years. There are reports as far back as 1949 of patients with schizophrenia being 
treated with glutamic acid (Kintzinger and Arnold, 1949). One of the earliest reports of 
glutamatergic abnormalities in living patients was the finding of reduced CSF glutamate 
levels in patients with schizophrenia (Kim et al., 1980). Despite early optimism, other 
groups failed to replicate this finding (Perry, 1982; Korpi et al., 1987). However, since that 
time, there has a growing body of evidence for alterations in other aspects of glutamatergic 
neurotransmission in schizophrenia. The glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia originally 
formulated that there was a simple deficit in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the 
condition. This theory has been modified and developed over the years and, although many 
glutamate receptors have been implicated, the prevailing hypothesis is for the primary 
involvement of NMDA receptor dysfunction (Stone et al., 2007).
Indirect evidence for glutamate’s involvement
Post mortem and genetic studies—Post mortem studies provide evidence for 
alterations to glutamatergic functioning in schizophrenia. Studies of NMDA receptor 
expression in post mortem samples have produced some positive findings such as reduced 
NMDAR1 subunit density in the superior frontal cortex (Sokolov, 1998) and the superior 
temporal cortex (Humphries et al., 1996). However, overall findings regarding NMDA 
receptor density have been inconsistent (McCullumsmith et al., 2012). It seems that the 
abnormality in schizophrenia may primarily be aberrant glutamate receptor localisation as 
opposed to a generalised deficit (Hammond et al., 2014). This abnormality could arise as a 
result of changes in glutamate receptor trafficking molecules (Funk et al., 2009). 
Howes et al.

Furthermore there is evidence for a variety of functional changes affecting the intracellular 
effects of the NMDA receptor that would have a major impact on glutamatergic 
signalling(Pitcher et al., 2011; Funk et al., 2012).
The potential role of glutamate in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is also supported by 
recent genetics’ findings (Ripke et al., 2014). GRIN2A which codes for an NMDA receptor 
subunit was found to be associated with schizophrenia, as was SRR which plays a key role 
in pathways leading to the activation of the NMDA receptor.
NMDA receptor antagonists—The NMDA receptor dysfunction hypothesis of 
schizophrenia arose initially from the observation that non-competitive NMDA receptor 
antagonists, including phencyclidine (PCP), dizocilpine (MK-801) and ketamine, lead to 
immediate psychological effects, which closely resemble symptoms that occur in 
schizophrenia, including both positive and negative symptom domains (Krystal et al., 1994; 
Morgan and Curran, 2006; Javitt, 2007). Psychotic-like symptoms are also seen in chronic 
ketamine users (Morgan et al., 2009; Stone et al., 2014). These findings led to the use of 
NMDA receptor antagonists as a model system for schizophrenia. Olney and Farber pursued 
this approach in animal models, and put forward the first NMDA receptor dysfunction 
hypothesis of schizophrenia. They showed that animals given NMDA receptor antagonists 
developed neurotoxic changes in cortical brain regions, which they suggested were similar to 
reductions in brain volume seen in patients with schizophrenia (Olney and Farber, 1995). 
They found that AMPA antagonists (among other compounds) could block the downstream 
effects of NMDA receptor antagonism on neurotoxicity, and hypothesized that glutamate 
release might underlie the neurotoxic effects. This was subsequently confirmed in 
microdialysis studies (Moghaddam et al., 1997) and more recently with proton magnetic 
resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) studies following systemic ketamine administration in 
animals (Kim et al., 2011).
Further research demonstrated that injection of the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 
directly into cortical regions did not lead to any evidence of neurodegenerative changes, 
whereas injection into anterior thalamus led to the same cortical changes as seen with 
systemic administration (Sharp et al., 2001), suggesting that the thalamus may be a critical 
site for NMDA receptor blockade in the generation of downstream effects by NMDA 
receptor antagonists, and, by extension, may also be a site of NMDA receptor dysfunction in 
schizophrenia (Olney and Farber, 1995; Stone et al., 2007).
The method of administration of NMDA antagonists may have relevance regarding which 
aspect of the schizophrenia syndrome one is attempting to model. Acute administration of 
NMDA antagonists can perhaps be viewed as a model of acute psychosis. In contrast, 
longer-term administration shows potential as a model for chronic schizophrenia. Sub 
chronic administration of PCP to rats has been shown to cause long lasting deficits in set 
shifting ability (Egerton et al., 2008), and reductions in functional connectivity (Dawson et 
al., 2014) similar to those observed in chronic schizophrenia. While longer term 
administration of ketamine to rats produced cognitive deficits similar to those observed in 
chronic schizophrenia (Featherstone et al., 2012). Furthermore, administration of NMDA

antagonists early in life results in long-term behavioural and neuroanatomical effects (Harris 
et al., 2003) – providing a potential method for examining neurodevelopmental hypotheses.
The complete mechanism by which NMDA receptor antagonists lead to downstream 
increases in glutamate and neurotoxic changes in animals has not been fully elucidated, but 
evidence indicates it involves GABAergic interneurons. Specifically NMDA receptor 
antagonists have been shown to reduce GABAergic interneuron function (Homayoun and 
Moghaddam, 2007), and it is thought that this leads to an increase in pyramidal cell firing 
due to disinhibition (Olney and Farber, 1995). How NMDAR antagonism leads to reductions 
in GABAergic interneuron activity is less clear. It has been suggested that they may have 
preferential effects on NMDA receptors expressed on GABA neurons (Homayoun and 
Moghaddam, 2007), but this hypothesis has been contested (Rotaru et al., 2012). An 
alternative hypothesis is that NMDA receptor antagonist-induced changes in reactive oxygen 
species levels may be a central component of this mechanism since reducing superoxide 
levels prevented ketamine-induced changes in interneuron activity (Behrens et al., 2007). 
Furthermore, inhibiting reactive oxygen species formation blocks the behavioural effect of 
NMDA receptor antagonists in animals (Levkovitz et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007; Sorce et 
al., 2010; Monte et al., 2013).
Glutamatergic drugs treatments for schizophrenia—Findings from small clinical 
trials of glutamatergic drugs give further support to the NMDA receptor hypofunction 
hypothesis of schizophrenia (Stone, 2011). A number of studies have investigated NMDA 
receptor modulation, either via direct agonism at the glycineB modulatory site (using glycine 
or D-serine), or by increasing synaptic glycine levels through inhibition of glycine 
transporters (eg: sarcosine). A meta-analysis of published studies in 2009 reported that these 
drugs led to a significant improvement in residual positive and negative symptoms in 
patients with schizophrenia when administered in addition to existing antipsychotic 
treatment (Tsai and Lin, 2010). However, a subsequent, large clinical trial of D-serine, failed 
to show any benefit (Weiser et al., 2012).
Bitopertin, a glycine transporter inhibiter developed by Roche, showed promising efficacy 
for negative symptoms in an initial trial (Umbricht et al., 2014), and showed similar efficacy 
to olanzapine when used as monotherapy, in terms of patient readiness for discharge at 4 
weeks compared to placebo (Bugarski-Kirola et al., 2014). However, two recent Phase III 
studies, showed no benefit of bitopertin for negative symptoms (Goff, 2014). Thus, whilst 
the results of an ongoing study of bitopertin for reducing positive symptoms in patients with 
schizophrenia are awaited, the results to date suggest the effect size is modest at most. 
Overall there is some evidence that modulation of the glycineB site may be therapeutic in 
schizophrenia but this this has not been fully established.
Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, has more recently raised interest in light of its 
neuroprotective properties. An initial open label study (Miyaoka and Yasukawa, 2008) 
showed large improvements in both positive and negative symptoms. More rigorous 
controlled studies (Levkovitz et al., 2010; Chaudhry et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014) examining 
its effect on negative symptoms have also shown clinically significant benefits. There are a 
number of potential mechanisms of action for minocycline, some of which involve the

glutamatergic system. In animal models minocycline has been shown to counter the effects 
of multiple NMDA antagonists (Levkovitz et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2007; Fujita et al., 
2008). This effect on the glutamatergic system may be indirect and one possibility is that 
minocycline may modulate NMDA receptor signalling by inhibiting the formation of 
reactive oxygen species (Monte et al., 2013).
The striking results recently observed in patients with schizophrenia following a single dose 
of sodium nitroprusside (Hallak et al., 2013), may also have a glutamatergic mechanism 
underlying the clinical response. Preclinical work has shown that sodium nitroprusside is 
able to abolish the behavioural effects of phencyclidine (Bobanovic et al., 2000). The exact 
mechanism responsible for its clinical effects is not yet determined although there is some 
evidence that it may modulate NMDA receptor activity(Manzoni et al., 1992).
Another line of evidence comes from studies of drugs targeting downstream glutamate 
release, such as lamotrigine, LY2140023 and topirimate. Lamotrigine, a drug which reduces 
glutamate release, has been reported to inhibit ketamine-induced psychosis-like effects in 
healthy volunteers (Hosák and Libiger, 2002), and related changes in brain function 
measured using fMRI (Deakin et al., 2008). Early clinical data suggesting a benefit in partial 
responders to clozapine treatment (Dursun et al., 1999) has received subsequent support in a 
meta-analysis, although effects were relatively modest (Tiihonen et al., 2009).
LY2140023 is a drug developed by Eli Lilly as an agonist for presynaptic mGlu2/3 receptors 
to reduce glutamate release. It was found in an initial study to lead to significant 
improvements in positive and negative symptoms in patients with chronic schizophrenia 
(Patil et al., 2007). However, a subsequent phase II trial did not show any significant benefit 
over placebo, possibly due to a particularly high level of placebo response (Kinon et al., 
2010).
Lastly, topiramate is a drug that may alter the downstream effect of excess glutamate 
through AMPA receptor antagonism. An initial positive open trial (Dursun and Deakin, 
2001) using topirimate as an augmentation agent in treatment resistant schizophrenia was 
later replicated in a randomised controlled trial (Tiihonen et al., 2005). It has also been 
shown to reduce the behavioural effects of MK-801 in rats (Deutsch et al., 2002). However, 
as AMPA antagonism only occurs at higher doses, these inhibitory effects may occur 
through its enhancement of GABA transmission (Gibbs et al., 2000), potentially calling into 
question a direct glutamatergic mechanism for the drug.
Overall, whilst there is clearly some evidence that glutamatergic drugs are effective 
treatments for schizophrenia, findings are somewhat mixed and where supported by meta-
analysis the effect size is modest. These studies thus provide some evidence to support the 
involvement of glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia, but there is nothing like the 
weight of evidence for treatment effects that there is for dopamine receptor blockers.
Glutamate – In vivo imaging studies
Neuroimaging studies of glutamatergic function in psychosis began later than the studies on 
the dopamine system. Nevertheless there is a substantial body of evidence from studies of 
Howes et al.

the effects of ketamine on brain function in healthy volunteers, and studies of brain 
glutamate levels in patients with prodromal and first episode psychosis, and with 
schizophrenia. These studies are summarised below, focusing on first episode and high risk 
studies as these ameliorate the risk of confounding by treatment effects (Poels et al., 2014).
SPECT Studies—There is only one published SPECT study of NMDA receptor binding 
in patients with schizophrenia to date (Pilowsky et al., 2006). This showed evidence of a 
relative deficit in NMDA receptor activity in the left hippocampus in unmedicated patients 
with schizophrenia (Pilowsky et al., 2006). The study is relatively small, and no other groups 
have attempted to replicate the findings, possibly because of concern around levels of non-
specific binding associated with the tracer used (N-(1-napthyl)-N'-(3-[(123)I]-iodophenyl)-
N-methylguanidine (123I-CNS 1261)), a problem that affects all NMDA receptor tracers 
currently available (Knol et al., 2009). Nevertheless it provides in vivo support for the 
NMDA hypofunction hypothesis, although this clearly requires further confirmation.
Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Studies—Proton Magnetic Resonance 
Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) has been used to measure glutamate and glutamine levels in 
individuals at high risk of psychosis, as well as patients with first episode psychosis and 
chronic schizophrenia (Poels et al., 2014). Glutamine has been suggested to be a marker of 
glutamatergic neurotransmission, as it is generated after synaptic glutamate is taken up into 
astrocytes(Bak et al., 2006). 1H-MRS studies in schizophreniform psychosis and 
schizophrenia to date have generally found that individuals with clinical or familial risk, and 
those with first episode psychosis have increased glutamine in anterior cingulate cortex 
(Bartha et al., 1997; Théberge et al., 2002; Tibbo et al., 2004; Stone et al., 2009; Marsman et 
al., 2013; Tandon et al., 2013). The 1H-MRS studies of at risk or first episode populations 
are summarised in tables 4 and 5. In contrast, studies of patients with chronic schizophrenia 
have generally found normal or reduced cortical glutamate and glutamine levels (Block et 
al., 2000; Kegeles et al., 2000b; Théberge et al., 2003; Ohrmann et al., 2005; Ongur et al., 
2009; Rowland et al., 2009; Tayoshi et al., 2009; Lutkenhoff et al., 2010; Natsubori et al., 
2013). However, a recent large, well designed study found, that patients with chronic 
schizophrenia had elevated glutamine:glutamate ratio (Gln/Glu) in anterior cingulate cortex, 
with a correlation between frontal Gln/Glu and positive psychotic symptoms (Bustillo et al., 
2014). Furthermore, in contrast to the data from a recently published meta-analysis 
(Marsman et al., 2013), Gln/Glu increased with the age of patients rather than decreased 
(Bustillo et al., 2014). The reason for this discrepancy is not clear, but may be due to 
differences in acquisition methodology, with this study employing a slightly longer echo 
time (40ms) for 1H-MRS acquisition (Bustillo et al., 2014).
Another brain region with growing evidence for glutamatergic abnormalities in 
schizophrenia is the caudate nucleus. Glutamate and glutamine levels have been reported to 
be increased in individuals at familial risk for schizophrenia (Tandon et al., 2013), and 
individuals at clinical risk and unmedicated patients with first episode psychosis have been 
reported to have increased glutamate in this brain region (de la Fuente-Sandoval et al., 
2011), although it appears to be affected by treatment, with four weeks of antipsychotic

medication leading to a normalisation of caudate glutamate levels (de la Fuente-Sandoval et 
al., 2013).
There has been considerable interest in the possible utility of 1H-MRS in predicting 
treatment response in schizophrenia – with the theory that poor responders to conventional 
dopaminergic antipsychotic treatments may have more of a glutamatergic basis to their 
illness (Stone et al., 2010). There have now been a number of studies that give preliminary 
support to this hypothesis. We recently found that patients with first episode psychosis who 
were poor responders to antipsychotic drugs had increased levels of glutamate scaled to 
creatine (Glu/Cr) in anterior cingulate cortex compared to those patients who had responded 
(Egerton et al., 2012). Similarly we found that patients with established treatment resistant 
schizophrenia had increased anterior cingulate glutamate levels compared to controls and 
good responders (Demjaha et al., 2014).
One problem with these studies is that the data were acquired cross-sectionally, and so it is 
not possible to determine whether the elevated glutamate measures in anterior cingulate 
were associated with treatment resistance, or were simply a surrogate marker of increased 
psychopathology at the time of scanning. For example, it has been shown that panic induced 
by cholecystokinin tetrapeptide leads to an acute increase in measured glutamate in anterior 
cingulate (Zwanzger et al., 2013), and it is conceivable that a similar mechanism may occur 
in patients with symptoms of schizophrenia. However, a recent longitudinal study 
demonstrated that baseline Glx/Cr (reflecting the combination of GABA, glutamate and 
glutamine scaled to creatine) levels in the anterior cingulate of unmedicated patients 
predicted subsequent response to antipsychotic medication, with immediate responders 
having lower Glx/Cr (Szulc et al., 2013). Thus, although mental state may modulate 
glutamate levels in anterior cingulate, this measure may, nonetheless, be a useful marker in 
predicting antipsychotic response. Longitudinal studies in first episode patients are required 
to clarify this point.
Limitations of the glutamate evidence in schizophrenia
Although several lines of evidence point to there being glutamatergic abnormalities in 
schizophrenia, there are a number of potential limitations to the theory. The use of 1H-MRS 
as the primary tool for the in vivo imaging of the glutamatergic system has some limitations. 
In particular 1H-MRS may not be able to distinguish between intra and extracellular 
compartments – so changes could reflect alterations in either compartment. The 
development of specific radiotracers for imaging of NMDA and AMPA receptors(Miyake et 
al., 2011; Majo et al., 2013; McGinnity et al., 2014) will potentially enable the extracellular 
release of glutamate to be studied. 13C MRS is another potentially useful tool for allowing 
clearer understanding of the glutamatergic system(Mason et al., 2007). A further limitation 
of the glutamate hypothesis is that it is not clear exactly what NMDA hypofunction means at 
the molecular level. This partly reflects the limitations of the evidence available at the 
moment.
Another major shortcoming at present is that there are no glutamatergic drugs currently on 
the market for schizophrenia, and trials of glutamatergic treatments have not shown a 
conclusive or strong effect in most cases. Secondly, due to the close interactions between 
Howes et al.

glutamate and dopamine, and the fact that ketamine has been reported to have effects on 
dopamine release, and may directly interact with high affinity D2 receptors(Kapur and 
Seeman, 2002; Egerton et al., 2012), it may not be possible to interpret some of the ketamine 
findings as purely glutamatergic. Thirdly, it is clear that schizophrenia is unlikely to arise 
from a single cause in all cases (Horvath and Mirnics, 2014; Howes and Kapur, 2014), and 
thus glutamate abnormalities may be present only in a subset of patients with the illness, and 
possibly only at a particular phase of illness in these individuals(Marsman et al., 2013). 
Finally, there is as yet no clear model to account for how the glutamate abnormalities 
observed could underlie the phenomenology of psychosis as seen in patients.
Integrating the dopamine and glutamate hypotheses
Whilst the evidence for the involvement of presynaptic dopamine dysfunction in the 
majority of cases of schizophrenia is compelling, dopamine dysfunction is most clearly 
linked to psychotic symptoms and the evidence for dopamine’s involvement in the negative 
and cognitive symptoms is much less clear-cut (Javitt and Zukin, 1991; Tamminga et al., 
1995). In this respect glutamate models involving NMDA receptor blockade appear to be 
better able account for the range and nature of these aspects of schizophrenia (Javitt, 2010). 
A combination of both NMDA hypofunction and presynaptic dopamine dysfunction may 
therefore provide the best explanation of all the clinical aspects of schizophrenia.
The possibility that mesolimbic dopaminergic hyperactivity is secondary to diminished 
inhibitory control had been suggested before the glutamatergic system was explicitly 
identified as a candidate (Weinberger, 1987). Dopamine neurons are regulated by 
glutamatergic projections to the midbrain dopamine nuclei, which makes them potentially 
sensitive to changes in glutamatergic function (Miller and Abercrombie, 1996). This 
suggests that the dopamine function seen in schizophrenia could be secondary to altered 
glutamatergic function (McGuire et al., 2008) (Figure 1.). Supporting this, preclinical studies 
show that NMDA blockers such as ketamine and PCP change dopamine neuron firing 
patterns, and increase dopamine release to a challenge such as amphetamine (Miller and 
Abercrombie, 1996; Tsukada, 2000; Balla et al., 2003; Jackson et al., 2004). There is also in 
vivo imaging evidence that ketamine administration leads to increased dopamine release in 
humans, as indexed by change in D2/D3 receptor PET tracer binding (Breier et al., 1998; 
Smith et al., 1998; Vollenweider et al., 2000). Moreover baseline D2/D3 receptor availability 
is associated with increased sensitivity to the psychotogenic effects of ketamine in humans 
(Vernaleken et al., 2013), further supporting the close interaction between these two systems. 
However, other groups have found evidence for elevated dopamine release following 
ketamine only in individuals treated with amphetamine (Kegeles et al., 2000a; Aalto et al., 
2002; Kegeles et al., 2002; Aalto et al., 2005), suggesting that ketamine’s effects may be 
more marked when the dopamine system is challenged. Thus, in schizophrenia NMDA 
hypofunction may make the dopamine system more sensitive to the effects of psychological 
stress.
Whilst the studies discussed above provide evidence that dopamine dysregulation in 
schizophrenia could be secondary to glutamatergic dysfunction, they do not identify the 
specific brain circuits or regions involved. The prefrontal cortex and hippocampus have both 
Howes et al.

been suggested as potential sites as both regulate midbrain dopamine neurons via 
glutamatergic projections to the midbrain (Christie et al., 1985; Grace, 1991; Sesack and 
Pickel, 1992).
Hippocampus—Studies using a rodent developmental model of schizophrenia show that 
altered hippocampal activity is associated with increased dopamine neuron population 
activity, and that inactivating the hippocampus reverses the dopamine alterations (Lodge and 
Grace, 2006). Altered hippocampal activity is also seen in patients with schizophrenia 
(Heckers et al., 1998; Harrison, 2004; Malaspina et al., 2004) and prodromal psychosis, and 
has been linked to the subsequent development of schizophrenia (Schobel et al., 2013). 
Furthermore, we recently reported in individuals with prodromal symptoms of psychosis had 
a negative correlation between hippocampal glutamate and striatal [18F]DOPA uptake, and 
this was most marked in those that went on to develop schizophrenia (Stone et al., 2010).
Prefrontal cortex—Whilst there are data linking altered frontal function to striatal 
presynaptic dopamine dysfunction in patients and at risk subjects (Bertolino et al., 2000; 
Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2002; Fusar-Poli et al., 2011), we are not aware of any studies 
investigating the relationship between frontal glutamate to striatal dopamine dysfunction in 
patients.
There are thus several converging lines of data to suggest that glutamate dysfunction could 
underlie the dopamine dysfunction seen in schizophrenia and its prodrome, supporting an 
integrated hypothesis. However, as the data in patients are limited to date (Stone et al., 
2010), this requires further testing. Furthermore, it is important to note that the glutamate 
and dopamine systems show extensive and reciprocal interactions, and thus it may be 
difficult to determine which is primary, with different authorities on the subject suggesting 
that both glutamate and dopamine drive abnormalities in the other system (Olney and Farber, 
1995; Harrison and Weinberger, 2005; Coyle, 2006; Stone et al., 2007). Finally, an 
integrated hypothesis cannot readily explain the findings in treatment resistant patients 
discussed above, where glutamate dysfunction alone or other pathways may be critical.
Conclusions and Future Directions
The first decade or so of the 21st century has seen the accumulation of evidence that has 
allowed major refinements of the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia. We can now say 
that the major dopaminergic abnormality is presynaptic, it is present at the onset of illness 
and is related to the onset of psychosis. These findings appear robust: they are seen across 
methods and settings and, given their consistency, it would take a large body of new, 
contradictory evidence to bring them into doubt. Furthermore, we have plausible models of 
how presynaptic dopamine dysfunction might lead to the symptoms we see in the clinic, 
providing an explanation at both a neurobiological and clinical level. Nevertheless there are 
important limitations to our current understanding, in particular of how the dopamine 
changes might account for negative and cognitive symptoms. The 21st century has also seen 
continued empirical support for the glutamate hypothesis, with several converging lines of 
evidence indicating that a glutamatergic abnormality could underlie schizophrenia. However, 
whilst there have been undoubted advances in understanding the nature of glutamate

dysfunction in schizophrenia, at present there are some inconsistencies and this has not led 
to significant advances in treatment. This should not be surprising given the lessons from the 
imaging studies of the dopamine system in schizophrenia, in particular that it takes time 
(more than two decades in the case of dopamine), and the application of a variety of imaging 
techniques to develop a clear understanding of the nature of the dysfunction affecting a 
system. Given the limitations of current approaches to imaging glutamate using MRS, 
progress requires the development of new methods to image the glutamate system. 
Notwithstanding these caveats, there are two possible explanations for the involvement of 
both dopamine and glutamate in schizophrenia. One is that they underlie different sub-types 
of the disorder, in line with the recent findings in treatment resistance. The other is an 
integrated hypothesis which could explain positive symptoms in terms of presynaptic 
dopamine, and negative and cognitive symptoms in terms of glutamate. Of course these are 
not mutually exclusive. Both possibilities require further testing in patient studies and this is 
likely to be needed to inform the development of new treatment approaches.
