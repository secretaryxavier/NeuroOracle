Abstract
Development of new drug regimens that allow rapid, sterilizing treatment of tuberculosis has been 
limited by the complexity and time required for genetic manipulations in Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis. CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) promises to be a robust, easily engineered, and 
scalable platform for regulated gene silencing. However, in M. tuberculosis, the existing 
Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9-based CRISPRi system is of limited utility because of relatively 
poor knockdown efficiency and proteotoxicity. To address these limitations, we screened eleven 
diverse Cas9 orthologues and identified four that are broadly functional for targeted gene 
knockdown in mycobacteria. The most efficacious of these proteins, the CRISPR1 Cas9 from 
Streptococcus thermophilus (dCas9Sth1), typically achieves 20–100 fold knockdown of 
endogenous gene expression with minimal proteotoxicity. In contrast to other CRISPRi systems, 
dCas9Sth1-mediated gene knockdown is robust when targeted far from the transcriptional start site,

thereby allowing high-resolution dissection of gene function in the context of bacterial operons. 
We demonstrate the utility of this system by addressing persistent controversies regarding drug 
synergies in the mycobacterial folate biosynthesis pathway. We anticipate that the dCas9Sth1 
CRISPRi system will have broad utility for functional genomics, genetic interaction mapping, and 
drug-target profiling in M. tuberculosis.
Introduction
Treatment of drug-susceptible M. tuberculosis requires a regimen of four drugs taken for six 
months. One of the overarching goals of the M. tuberculosis research community is to 
develop a regimen of novel agents that can treat both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant M. 
tuberculosis in less than 2 weeks. This will necessitate the development of new genetic tools 
to identify drug target synergies that accelerate pathogen clearance while avoiding drug 
target antagonisms. Current genetic approaches for drug target characterization include 
promoter replacement and inducible protein degradation systems that allow regulation of 
target protein levels over two orders of magnitude1–3, but can take months to target a single 
gene. Transposon-sequencing (Tn-seq) allows the simultaneous assessment of hundreds of 
thousands of loss-of-function mutants, but as currently implemented in M. tuberculosis is 
not conditional and thus does not allow manipulation of essential genes4. Furthermore, 
neither method provides a simple mechanism to modulate multiple genes simultaneously 
and thereby elucidate genetic interactions.
The re-purposing of the bacterial CRISPR-Cas (clustered regularly interspersed short 
palindromic repeats-CRISPR associated proteins) system as a site-specific transcriptional 
repressor could fill this methodological gap5–7. CRISPR systems use small RNAs to target 
and cleave foreign nucleic acid in a sequence-specific manner8–11. The best-characterized 
system is the type IIA system from Streptococcus pyogenes. Here, a single nuclease Cas9 
and two small RNAs, a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and a partially complementary trans-acting 
RNA (tracrRNA), are necessary and sufficient for RNA-guided silencing of foreign 
DNA9,11,12. This dual RNA system can be further simplified by the fusion of the crRNA and 
tracrRNA to generate a chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA)11. Targeting specificity is 
determined both by Watson-Crick base pairing of the sgRNA and target DNA as well as a 
short DNA motif (protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)) within the target DNA sequence8,13,14. 
To repurpose Cas9 for transcriptional repression (CRISPR interference or CRISPRi), Cas9 
nuclease activity is inactivated by point mutations within its HNH and RuvC nuclease 
domains5,7. Co-expression of the nuclease-dead S. pyogenes Cas9 protein (dCas9Spy) with 
an sgRNA designed with 20 nucleotides of complementarity to the target gene juxtaposed to 
an appropriate PAM yields specific silencing of the gene of interest (Figure 1A)5,7.
CRISPRi has been extensively characterized in the model bacteria Escherichia coli and 
Bacillus subtilis5,7,15. In these organisms, the dCas9Spy-sgRNA complex represses target 
gene transcription by either occluding RNA polymerase from the target promoter or by 
causing a steric block to transcription elongation (Figure 1A). When targeting the promoter, 
sgRNAs specific for either the template or non-template strand can be used, whereas an 
elongation block is most effective when targeting the non-template strand, producing up to

300-fold repression5,7. However, despite successes in E. coli and B. subtilis, first attempts to 
introduce a similar dCas9Spy-based CRISPRi system in mycobacteria were less impressive, 
typically resulting in ~4-fold knockdown of gene expression16,17.
Results
Limited utility of first-generation dCas9Spy CRISPRi in mycobacteria
We sought to develop a CRISPRi system for targeted gene knockdown in mycobacteria. 
Given the efficacy of dCas9Spy CRISPRi in model bacteria5,7,15, we first attempted to build 
a similar dCas9Spy–based system for mycobacteria. While some degree of dCas9Spy toxicity 
has been reported, dCas9Spy is in general well tolerated in E. coli18. In contrast, however, 
high-level expression of dCas9Spy with a non-genome targeting control sgRNA was lethal in 
M. smegmatis, and this lethality was not relieved by site-specific mutations that abrogate 
PAM interaction19 (Supplementary Figure 1A). While lowering dCas9Spy expression levels 
largely eliminated the growth defect, this first-generation dCas9Spy CRISPRi system resulted 
in poor target gene knockdown (~3–4 fold repression; Supplementary Figure 1B,C), 
consistent with published data16,17.
Identification of efficacious Cas9 alleles
While 4-fold gene knockdown is sufficient to generate loss-of-function phenotypes for some 
mycobacterial genes, many genes appear to require higher-level knockdown to reveal a 
phenotype3,20–23. Thus, we sought to develop a more efficacious CRISPRi system for 
mycobacteria. Given the extensive sequence diversity across the Cas9 family24, we 
hypothesized that orthologous Cas9 proteins might function more robustly than dCas9Spy in 
mycobacteria. We selected 11 diverse Cas9 proteins from the Type IIA and Type IIC 
subfamilies based on their relatively small size (range 984–1388 amino acids) and 
availability of data to predict crRNA, tracrRNA, and PAM sequences (Figure 1B, 
Supplementary Figure 2)24–26. We built single-plasmid platforms that expressed a 
mycobacterial codon-optimized nuclease-dead dcas9 allele under the control of an 
anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-inducible promoter and the cognate sgRNA under the control of a 
strong, constitutive promoter. To evaluate the performance of each dCas9 protein, we 
developed a Renilla luciferase-based reporter assay. The Renilla 5’ untranslated region 
(UTR) was engineered such that the optimal PAM for each dCas9 protein could be tested 
with an identical sgRNA targeting sequence (UTR1) for all dCas9 proteins. Each dCas9 
orthologue was then co-expressed with its cognate sgRNA (UTR1) and gene silencing was 
measured by luciferase assay.
We observed a wide-range of gene silencing mediated by the dCas9 proteins (Figure 1C). Of 
the 11 tested dCas9 proteins, only five produced >5-fold gene knockdown. The effective 
dCas9 proteins included all five Type IIA but none of the Type IIC proteins, which may 
reflect the recently described limited double-stranded DNA helicase activity of Type IIC 
Cas9 proteins27. We next tested multiple Renilla-targeting sgRNA sequences to control for 
variation in sgRNA efficacy and, where relevant, variations in the PAM sequence. While 
there was variability in the fold knockdown observed across different sgRNA sequences for 
each dCas9 protein, this more extensive evaluation broadly confirmed the results obtained

with the UTR1 sgRNA (Figure 1D–G, Supplementary Figure 3). The dCas9 protein derived 
from the CRISPR1 locus of S. thermophilus28 (dCas9Sth1) produced by far the most robust 
and consistent gene silencing in our Renilla reporter system (Figure 1C,E), although 
interestingly the expression systems used in this second-generation platform improved even 
dCas9Spy gene silencing relative to our first-generation system (Figure 1D, Supplementary 
Figure 1B,C).
dCas9Sth1 enables robust gene knockdown in mycobacteria
We next extended our analysis of this second-generation CRISPRi platform by targeting 
endogenous M. smegmatis genes with dCas9Sth1 and, as a point of comparison, dCas9Spy. 
We initially targeted two essential genes, dnaE1 and pptT21,29. In both cases, dCas9Sth1 
allowed robust target gene knockdown with resulting inhibition of bacterial growth (Figure 
2A,B). In the case of dnaE1, our second-generation dCas9Spy platform was capable of 
achieving high-level knockdown of endogenous gene expression that was roughly 
comparable to levels seen with dCas9Sth1 (Figure 2A). However, targeting pptT, which 
requires ~95% knockdown in M. tuberculosis in order to reveal a growth defect21, was 
successful with 7 out of 8 sgRNAs with dCas9Sth1 but only 1 out of 8 sgRNAs with 
dCas9Spy (Figure 2B).
These results were surprising in light of two published reports in E. coli and human cells 
where Cas9Spy is more efficacious than Cas9Sth126,30. Thus, we next sought to explore the 
basis for the relative underperformance of dCas9Spy relative to dCas9Sth1 in mycobacteria. 
To determine if this difference in efficacy could be the result of differences in dCas9 
expression, we performed western blots to monitor the expression of both dCas9 proteins. 
Despite induction from identical promoters and 5’UTRs, we consistently saw higher levels 
of full-length dCas9Sth1 than dCas9Spy (Figure 2C), although both proteins showed some 
degree of degradation. However, this relatively poor expression of dCas9Spy was not 
phenotypically silent, since expression of dCas9Spy sensitized cells to sub-minimum 
inhibitory concentrations (sub-MIC) of aminoglycosides and rifampicin, which cause 
proteotoxic stress by inducing mis-translation and inhibiting transcription, respectively 
(Figure 2D). Thus, it appears that under ideal conditions (e.g. defined medium at 37°C) the 
second-generation dCas9Spy platform can produce high-level gene knockdown, but it also 
sensitizes mycobacteria to stress, which is likely to affect both bacterial viability and gene 
knockdown levels under desired screening conditions. Such target-independent dCas9Spy 
phenotypes could confound the identification of target-dependent phenotypes.
Identification of functional PAM variants for dCas9Sth1
Given its robust performance, we chose to move forward with a dCas9Sth1-based CRISPRi 
system. The published Cas9Sth1 PAM consensus sequence (NNAGAAW) allows limited 
targeting opportunities in GC-rich mycobacterial genomes13,14,24. However, recent work has 
highlighted the ability of Cas9Sth1 to tolerate deviations from this consensus 
sequence26,31–33. Thus, we defined the repertoire of PAMs available to dCas9Sth1 in vivo. 
Leveraging our Renilla reporter system, we created single-base mutations in the Renilla 
5’UTR within the context of the consensus NNAGAAT PAM while maintaining the same 
UTR1 sgRNA sequence. We found that dCas9Sth1 functions with “non-canonical” PAM

sequences (Figure 3), tolerating a G at position 3, G or C at position 4, and any base at 
position 7. Given that each possible permissive PAM position variant may not be functional 
with all other variants, we next tested all 24 possible PAM combinations (Table 1). These 
PAM variants produced a range of target knockdown, spanning 2.7–216.7 fold. The more 
divergent the PAM sequence was from the consensus, the less well the PAM functioned in 
gene silencing (Table 1). By defining a cutoff score of >25-fold knockdown, this analysis 
increased the number of possible dCas9Sth1 PAMs from 2 to 15, thereby increasing the 
number of possible target sites in the M. tuberculosis genome from 4,624 to 83,091, or 
approximately one targetable site every 53 base pairs.
Parameters for silencing endogenous genes
We next sought to assess our dCas9Sth1 system by silencing a larger panel of endogenous 
genes. To confirm the functionality of the alternative dCas9Sth1 PAMs, we chose to 
benchmark our system by targeting the same genes investigated by Choudhary et al. which 
produced, on average, 3–4 fold knockdown with a first generation dCas9Spy CRISPRi 
system16. In our first attempts to target these essential genes with dCas9Sth1, we found that 
for some sgRNAs, leaky expression of dCas9Sth1 from the ATc-regulated promoter resulted 
in growth inhibition even in the absence of CRISPRi induction. We therefore built and 
optimized a new set of ATc-regulated promoters that minimize leaky expression without 
compromising high-level induction and used these to control expression of dCas9Sth1 and 
the sgRNA (Supplementary Figure 4).
Consistent with our Renilla assay results, the optimized dCas9Sth1 system produced robust 
knockdown (11.1–226 fold) of all five M. smegmatis genes tested (Figure 4A–E). This high-
level knockdown is quantitatively similar to that produced with CRISPR-based gene 
knockdown platforms in both E. coli and B. subtilis5–7,15. The robust knockdown achieved 
with our system was sufficient to silence genes that had previously been difficult to target. 
For example, we found that yidC is indeed essential in M. smegmatis as it is in M. 
tuberculosis, in contrast to published results achieved with a dCas9Spy system (Figure 4B)16. 
In addition, target mRNA knockdown kinetics were rapid, with near complete knockdown 
occurring in 1–2 hours or less than one cell cycle after ATc addition (Supplementary Figure 
5A,B).
Given that the dCas9Sth1 system effectively silenced endogenous targets, we next sought to 
test its specificity. To do this, we tested the ability of the homologous M. tuberculosis dnaE1 
gene29 to complement the dCas9Sth1-mediated silencing of the endogenous M. smegmatis 
dnaE1 gene (Figure 4F). All three M. smegmatis dnaE1 targeting sgRNAs (sgRNA1–3) have 
perfect PAM matches to M. tuberculosis dnaE1 and either one (sgRNA1), two (sgRNA2), or 
four (sgRNA3) mismatches between the sgRNA targeting sequence and M. tuberculosis 
dnaE1. Our results indicate that as few two mismatches between the sgRNA and the target 
are sufficient to abrogate phenotypic silencing (Figure 4F)5. Thus, off-target silencing with 
the dCas9Sth1 system would require near-perfect sgRNA sequence complementarity, an 
appropriately spaced PAM, as well as requiring targeting of the promoter or non-template 
strand (Supplementary Figure 5C), the combination of which is likely to be exceedingly rare 
in the context of compact bacterial genomes.

Gene silencing with CRISPRi in M. tuberculosis
Having developed this system in the model mycobacterium M. smegmatis, we then 
confirmed that our dCas9Sth1 system was effective in M. tuberculosis. As in M. smegmatis, 
the use of optimized ATc-regulated promoters was essential to prevent leaky expression of 
CRISPRi from inhibiting bacterial growth (Supplementary Figure 4). We designed sgRNAs 
to target eight essential genes in H37Rv4, including genes known or predicted to require 
high-level gene knockdown in order to reveal a growth defect3,21. Consistent with our results 
in M. smegmatis, dCas9Sth1-mediated silencing prevented growth and produced robust gene 
knockdown for all genes and PAM variants tested (Figure 4G, Supplementary Figure 5D). 
Moreover, our dCas9Sth1 system again reached maximal mRNA knockdown within one-to-
two cell divisions after addition of ATc (Supplementary Figure 5E).
Interestingly, in both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, dCas9Sth1 achieved high-level gene 
knockdown when targeted far from the predicted transcriptional start site (TSS); for 
example, yidC is predicted to be the fourth gene in an operon in M. tuberculosis and shows a 
syntenic operon structure in M. smegmatis34. This high-level silencing was somewhat 
unexpected given published observations describing an inverse correlation between 
repression efficacy and sgRNA targeting site distance from the TSS5,35. To explore this 
relationship, we quantified knockdown for 26 sgRNAs tiled along the pptT gene operon in 
M. smegmatis and 60 sgRNAs tiled along the groES-groEL1 operon or dnaE1 gene in M. 
tuberculosis34. First, these results further confirmed that the permissive PAM variants 
identified in our Renilla assay (Table 1) were also functional in the context of endogenous 
gene targeting in both M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis (Figure 4H–I, Supplementary 
Figure 5F, Supplementary Table 2). Second, in contrast to published work with dCas9Spy, 
we observed no correlation between repression efficacy and the sgRNA targeting site 
distance from the TSS (Figure 4H–I, Supplementary Figure 5F)5. However, consistent with 
published work, CRISPRi is polar: any operonic gene downstream of the dCas9 binding site 
will be silenced in addition to the targeted gene (Figure 4H,I)5. In addition to a 
“downstream” polar effect, an “upstream” polar effect of CRISPRi was also recently 
reported in B. subtilis, in which the targeting of a downstream gene in an operon represses 
the transcription of the upstream genes15. To query for this effect, we quantified the 
expression level of the upstream gene in the pptT and groES-groEL1 operon targeting 
sgRNAs (Figure 4H,I). Knockdown of the upstream gene occurred only when the sgRNAs 
were targeted within or very close to the 3’ end of the upstream gene coding sequence 
(Supplementary Figure 5G,H).
Identification of synergistic interactions in the folate biosynthesis pathway
Finally, we tested the ability of our optimized CRISPRi system to interrogate genetic and 
chemical interactions in an essential metabolic pathway (Figure 5A). In both prokaryotes 
and eukaryotes, reduced folate species serve as essential co-factors in the transfer of one-
carbon groups in pathways for the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein. While mammals 
lack the de novo folate synthesis pathway, many microbes are unable to acquire folates from 
their environment and rely entirely on de novo folate biosynthesis36. The dichotomy in 
essentiality of this pathway makes it an ideal target for the development of antibiotics. Two 
such antifolate antibiotics, trimethoprim (TMP) and sulfamethoxazole (SMX), have been

used clinically for 40 years. TMP and SMX inhibit successive steps of the folate synthesis 
pathway (Figure 5A). SMX inhibits dihydropteroate synthase FolP1, which catalyzes the 
addition of dihydropterin diphosphate to p-aminobenzoic acid. The product of FolP1, 7,8-
dihydropteroate, reacts with glutamate in a FolC-catalyzed reaction to form dihydrofolate. 
Dihydrofolate is then reduced to tetrahydrofolate by the dihydrofolate reductase FolA, the 
target of TMP. The combination of SMX and TMP has been demonstrated to be synergistic 
in many bacteria37. However, the efficacy of TMP, SMX, and whether or not these drugs act 
synergistically is controversial in mycobacteria. Initially, M. tuberculosis was reported to be 
resistant to the combination of TMP+SMX37. Consistent with this, TMP is a relatively weak 
in vitro inhibitor of M. tuberculosis FolA38. However, subsequent studies demonstrated that 
the combination of TMP and SMX is effective against M. tuberculosis39. One study 
evaluated the synergy between these two drugs and found that sub-MIC concentrations of 
SMX sensitized cells to TMP40; in contrast, a parallel study found that SMX alone was 
responsible for the observed M. tuberculosis inhibition, with no improvement by the 
addition of TMP41.
Elucidation of the mycobacterial folate synthesis pathway has been hampered by the 
inability to generate conditional loss-of-function alleles of folate biosynthesis genes. 
Previous attempts to target FolA with an inducible protein degradation system achieved 
~97% knockdown but no significant reduction in growth rate3. We therefore first sought to 
determine whether our optimized CRISPRi system would be robust enough to block growth 
when targeting folate biosynthesis genes. We designed a panel of sgRNAs against folP1, 
folC, and folA. Due to the operonic nature of these genes, the targeting of folP1 is also 
expected to knockdown the expression of folB and folK (Supplementary Figure 6). 
Strikingly, we identified sgRNAs for all three genes that produced knockdown of sufficient 
magnitude to inhibit growth, consistent with these genes being essential in M. smegmatis 
(Figure 5B).
To investigate genetic synergy within this pathway, we tuned gene knockdown by using 
“weaker” dCas9Sth1 PAM variants to generate “hypomorphic” sgRNAs, which could then be 
combined to assess pairwise knockdown phenotypes. These hypomorphic sgRNAs cause 
partial knockdown of their targeted genes but not to levels high enough to completely inhibit 
growth (Figure 5C). Whereas folA, folP1, and folC hypomorphic sgRNAs induced moderate 
growth defects individually, they were synthetic lethal when co-expressed (Figure 5C). 
These genetic data suggest that knockdown of these targets should sensitize cells to TMP 
and SMX. Consistent with this hypothesis, partial knockdown of all three targets sensitized 
M. smegmatis to TMP and SMX (Figure 5D). Thus, CRISPRi-mediated silencing 
demonstrates that drugs targeting successive steps within the mycobacterial folate 
biosynthesis pathway (folP1, folC, and folA) can interact to produce a synergistic 
antimicrobial effect.
Discussion
We report here an optimized CRISPRi platform for mycobacteria and believe that this 
system presents a number of advantages relative to more conventional methods of gene 
perturbation. First, our system represents the simplest and fastest method for programmable

gene regulation in mycobacteria. With our single-plasmid platform, all that is required for 
gene knockdown is the cloning of a unique ~20-bp targeting region into the sgRNA scaffold. 
Second, CRISPRi is scalable. With advances in array-based oligo synthesis, generating large 
pools of oligos that contain unique ~20-bp targeting regions is fast and inexpensive. Third, 
unlike complementary methods like Tn-seq, CRISPRi is inducible, thereby allowing the 
facile manipulation of essential genes. Fourth, the magnitude of CRISPRi knockdown is 
tunable, either by varying targeted PAM “strength” in the case of dCas9Sth1 (Table 1, Figure 
5C,D), varying the concentration of the small molecule CRISPRi inducer15, modulating the 
degree of sgRNA-target complementarity5, or truncating the sgRNA targeting region5. 
Finally, CRISPRi can be multiplexed, which is of particular importance in slow-growing 
pathogens like M. tuberculosis in which serial genetic manipulation is prohibitively time 
consuming.
The primary disadvantage of CRISPRi is the polar effect- any operonic gene downstream of 
the dCas9 binding site will be silenced in addition to the targeted gene (Figure 4H,I)5. The 
fact that genes in an operon typically function in the same biological pathway partially 
mitigates this problem. Moreover, the fact that dCas9Sth1 can mediate robust gene 
knockdown irrespective of distance from the TSS (Figure 4H,I, Supplementary Figure 5F) 
with a minimal upstream polar effect (Supplementary Figure 5G,H) means that dCas9Sth1 
CRISPRi can be used to target deep into bacterial operons and thereby increase the 
resolution of phenotyping.
In addition to facilitating study of Mtb biology, our dCas9Sth1 CRISPRi system will have 
broad utility in Mtb drug discovery. High-level gene knockdown can be used to define 
essential drug targets, and here CRISPRi will be a complementary and confirmatory 
approach to Tn-seq. The ability to tune the level of gene knockdown can then be used to 
define drug target vulnerability (i.e. the degree of knockdown required to inhibit growth) as 
well as serve as a platform for target-based whole cell screening to identify novel small 
molecules active against the desired drug target. Furthermore, the ability to generate 
hypomorphic alleles of essential genes will enable chemical and genetic interaction studies 
to define the interactions amongst essential drug targets, including the identification of drug 
target synergies. Using large-scale chip synthesis of unique sgRNA targeting regions, it will 
be possible to perform these studies at genome-scale. The identification of such drug target 
synergies will be a significant step towards the goal of developing novel drug regimens to 
shorten the duration of tuberculosis chemotherapy.

OADC (M. tuberculosis), and the appropriate antibiotics. Where indicated, antibiotics or 
small molecules were used at the following concentrations: ATc (100 ng/ml 
anhydrotetracycline); AMK (25 ng/ml amikacin); NAT (800 ng/ml nourseothricin); STR 
(100 ng/ml streptomycin); RIF (1.25 µg/ml rifampicin); TMP (5 µg/ml trimethoprim); SMX 
(625 ng/ml sulfamethoxazole).
Plasmid construction and cloning
Cas9 sequences were identified by Blast42 or obtained from published studies24–26. Cas9 
nuclease activity was inactivated by making the homologous D10A and H840A (S. 
pyogenes numbering) mutations in the RuvC and HNH nuclease domains for each Cas9 
protein. dcas9 alleles were then codon optimized for mycobacterial expression with Jcat43 
and synthesized by Genscript. dCas9 protein sequences used in this study are listed in 
Supplementary Table 1. Single-plasmid platforms were generated for all dcas9 alleles that 
contained: 1) the dcas9 allele under the control of a Tet repressor (TetR)-regulated UV15-Tet 
promoter1 or an optimized, synthetic TetR-regulated promoter (Supplementary Figure 4, 
Supplementary Table 1); 2) the cognate sgRNA under the control of a minimal synthetic 
constitutive promoter or an optimized, synthetic TetR-regulated promoter (Supplementary 
Figure 4, Supplementary Table 1); 3) a Tet repressor; 4) a single-copy L5-integrating 
backbone44; 5) a pBR322-derived E. coli replication origin; and 6) a kanamycin-selectable 
marker. sgRNA scaffold sequences were obtained from published studies25,26 or engineered 
by fusing the crRNA direct repeat to the tracrRNA in an analogous manner to the S. 
pyogenes sgRNA11. We attempted to enrich for highly active dCas9Spy sgRNAs by selecting 
top-scoring sgRNAs based on the algorithm described in Doench et al.45. All sgRNA 
scaffold sequences used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
To clone sgRNA targeting sequences, the sgRNA scaffolds were designed with two unique 
BsmBI restriction sites immediately 5’ to the sgRNA scaffold sequence. Complementary 
sgRNA targeting oligos (N20–25) were then annealed and ligated (T4 DNA ligase, NEB) 
into the BsmBI-digested CRISPRi vector backbone. To clone multiple sgRNAs into the 
same vector, the CRISPRi vector backbones were designed with a SapI-based Golden Gate 
cloning site 3’ to the first sgRNA scaffold. sgRNA targeting sequences are listed in 
Supplementary Table 2.
To construct the Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid, the Renilla gene was cloned 
downstream of the G13 promoter from Mycobacterium marinum46 with a synthetic 5’ 
untranslated region (UTR) in a single-copy Giles integrating vector47. The Renilla 5’UTR 
was engineered such that the optimal PAM for each dCas9 protein could be tested with an 
identical sgRNA targeting sequence (UTR1) for all dCas9 proteins. The Renilla reporter 
sequences used for each dCas9 protein are shown in Supplementary Table 1.
Phenotying
To visually monitor the effects of CRISPRi-mediated gene silencing, cultures were grown to 
log-phase and plated on solid media with or without ATc. Plates were incubated at 37°C for

vector expressing M. tuberculosis dnaE1 (Rv1547) under the control of the endogenous 
Rv1547 promoter.
Western blots
HA-dCas9Sth1 and HA-dCas9Spy were detected using an anti-HA antibody (Cell Signaling, 
C29F4) at a 1:1,000 dilution; RpoB was detected using an anti-RpoB antibody (Neoclone, 
WP023) at a 1:1,000 dilution. IRDye-800 anti-mouse and IRDye-680 anti-rabbit were used 
at 1:15,000 dilution (Licor). Immunoblots were imaged on a Licor Odyssey scanner. The full 
scans for the western blot shown in Figure 2C are provided as Supplementary Figure 7.
Cas9 phylogeny
Representative Cas9 sequences were pooled from published sources48,49 and aligned with 
FastTree50 with the default parameters. Tree visualization was done with FigTree.
Luciferase assays
For each sample, cultures were grown to log phase and then diluted back with or without 
100 ng/ml ATc to maintain the cultures in log phase and induce CRISPRi. Renilla 
knockdown was allowed to proceed for 24 hours. One OD600 equivalent of cells was 
harvested by centrifugation and processed for Renilla luciferase assay as per manufacturers 
instructions (Promega Renilla Luciferase Assay system). Luciferase activity was quantified 
in 96-well white plates (Costar; 3362) using a VarioSkan Flash plate reader (Thermo 
Scientific). Error bars represent standard deviations of three technical replicates.
mRNA quantification
For each sample, cultures were grown to log phase and then diluted back in the presence of 
100 ng/ml ATc to maintain the cultures in log phase and induce CRISPRi. Target 
knockdown was allowed to proceed for 14 hours (M. smegmatis) or 4 days (M. 
tuberculosis). One-to-two OD600 equivalents of cells from each culture were harvested by 
centrifugation, resuspended in TRIzol (Thermo Fisher), and disrupted by bead beating 
(Lysing Matrix B, MP Biomedicals). Total RNA was isolated by RNA miniprep (Zymo 
Research), residual contaminating genomic DNA digested with TURBO DNase (Ambion), 
and samples cleaned with RNA cleanup columns (Zymo Research). cDNA was prepared 
with random hexamers as per manufacturer instructions (Life Technologies Superscript IV). 
RNA was then removed by alkaline hydrolysis and cDNA was purified by spin column 
(Qiagen). cDNA levels were then quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) on a 
Viia7 light cycler (Applied Biosystems) using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix 
(BioRad). All qPCR primer pairs were verified to be >95% efficient and cDNA masses 
tested were experimentally validated to be within the linear dynamic range of the assay. 
Signals were normalized to the housekeeping sigA transcript for both M. tuberculosis 
(Rv2703) and M. smegmatis (Ms2758) and quantified by the ΔΔCt method. Error bars are 
95% confidence intervals of three technical replicates.

M. smegmatis operon predictions
The homologs of M. tuberculosis folate biosynthesis genes were identified in M. smegmatis 
by Blast42; note that folC is incorrectly annotated as a pseudogene in mc2155. Operon 
predictions from the TB Database51 or primary data52 were used to predict syntenic operons 
in M. smegmatis. Gene essentiality predictions are based on essentially predictions of M. 
tuberculosis homologs4.

Figure 1. In vivo screen for functional Cas9 orthologues in mycobacteria
(A) Schematic of CRISPRi-mediated transcriptional repression (adapted from reference15). 
Anhydrotetracycline (ATc)-inducible (PTet) dcas9 is directed to specific DNA targets by 
ATc-inducible or constitutively (Pcon) expressed sgRNA, which prevents transcription 
initiation or elongation.

(C) dCas9 orthologues show variable efficacy in mycobacteria. The Renilla reporter 5’UTR 
was engineered such that the optimal PAM for each dCas9 protein could be tested with an 
identical sgRNA targeting sequence (UTR1) for all dCas9 proteins. The x-axis denotes each 
dCas9 protein tested; the y-axis shows the ratio of the luminescence repression observed 
with the UTR1 targeting sgRNA normalized to the luminescence repression observed with a 
non-targeting control sgRNA. The fold inhibition is shown in white type for each column.
(D) sgRNAs targeting NGG PAMs were co-expressed with dCas9Spy (+ATc) and the effects 
on the Renilla target measured by luciferase assay. Shown above the graph is a schematic 
depicting the Renilla gene (yellow arrow) and transcriptional start site (black arrow) and the 
relative targeting position of each sgRNA (P = promoter; UTR = 5’ untranslated region, NT 
= Renilla non-template strand). The ΔRL promoter sample depicts basal levels of 
luminescence.
(E) sgRNAs targeting NNAGAAW PAMs were co-expressed with dCas9Sth1 (the cas9 allele 
derived from the CRISPR1 locus; +ATc) and luminescence repression measured as in Figure 
1D. Fewer sgRNAs were tested for dCas9Sth1 because of the less frequent PAM occurrence 
in the Renilla target.
(F) sgRNAs targeting NGGNG PAMs were co-expressed with dCas9Sth3 (the cas9 allele 
derived from the CRISPR3 locus; +ATc) and luminescence repression measured as in Figure 
1D.
(G) sgRNAs targeting NNGTGA PAMs were co-expressed with dCas9Spa (+ATc) and 
luminescence repression measured as in Figure 1D. Fewer sgRNAs were tested for dCas9Spa 
because of the less frequent PAM occurrence in the Renilla target.
Error bars are standard deviations of three technical replicates (C–G).

confidence intervals of three technical replicates.
(B) sgRNAs targeting pptT (Ms2648) in M. smegmatis were co-expressed with the indicated 
dCas9 protein (+ATc) and plated as in Figure 2A.
(C) The indicated dCas9 proteins were HA-tagged, co-expressed with a non-targeting 
control sgRNA (+ATc), and monitored by western blot. RpoB protein levels are shown as 
loading controls. *: background α-HA cross-reactive band.
(D) dCas9Spy sensitizes M. smegmatis to sub-minimum inhibitory concentration (sub-MIC) 
drug treatment. Non-targeting control sgRNAs were co-expressed with dCas9Spy or 
dCas9Sth1 (+ATc); the consequences of dCas9 expression in the presence of a sub-MIC 
concentrations of the indicated drugs were monitored by spotting serial dilutions of each 
culture as in Figure 2A. Approximately 5,000 cells are deposited in the first spot and each 
subsequent spot is a 10-fold serial dilution. AMK: amikacin; NAT: nourseothricin; STR: 
streptomycin; RIF: rifampicin. Data shown in B–D are representative of three independent
