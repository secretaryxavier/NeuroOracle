Summary
Ubiquitin-mediated targeting of intracellular bacteria to the autophagy pathway is a key innate 
defense mechanism against invading microbes, including the important human pathogen 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the ubiquitin ligases responsible for catalyzing ubiquitin 
chains that surround intracellular bacteria are poorly understood. PARKIN is a ubiquitin ligase 
with a well-established role in mitophagy, and mutations in the PARKIN gene (Park2) lead to 
increased susceptibility to Parkinson’s disease. Surprisingly, genetic polymorphisms in the Park2 
regulatory region are also associated with increased susceptibility to intracellular bacterial

pathogens in humans, including Mycobacterium leprae and Salmonella typhi, but the function of 
PARKIN in immunity remains unexplored. Here we show that PARKIN plays a role in ubiquitin-
mediated autophagy of M. tuberculosis. Both PARKIN-deficient mice and flies are sensitive to 
various intracellular bacterial infections, suggesting PARKIN plays a conserved role in metazoan 
innate defense. Moreover, our work reveals an unexpected functional link between mitophagy and 
infectious disease.
Eukaryotic cells target invading microbes to autophagosomes via a process termed 
xenophagy, which plays a key role in innate immune defense. Various intracellular bacterial 
pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, are targeted for xenophagy via a 
ubiquitin-mediated pathway that surrounds bacteria with conjugated ubiquitin chains1–3. 
Marking with polyubiquitin presumably recruits ubiquitin-binding autophagy adaptors such 
as p62, which in turn engage the autophagic machinery for autophagosome formation and 
delivery of bacteria to the lysosome1,3,4. While ubiquitin binding adaptors are required for 
xenophagy, whether ubiquitin itself directly mediates bacterial autophagy is not clear as the 
identities of the ubiquitinated substrate(s) and ligase(s) responsible for coating cytosol-
exposed bacteria are poorly understood.
In a fashion similar to xenophagy, the process of mitophagy eliminates damaged 
mitochondria through ubiquitin-mediated targeting to autophagosomes. A key step in 
mitophagy is marking of damaged mitochondria by the ubiquitin ligase PARKIN, which 
localizes to the organelle and directly ubiquitinates proteins on its surface5. Ubiquitin-tagged 
mitochondria are directed to the autophagosome pathway via p626–8 and several other 
factors10, ultimately delivering the organelle to the lysosome5.
Park2 mutations in humans are well-known risk factors for the development of Parkinson’s 
disease, but polymorphisms in the regulatory region of Park2, some of which result in 
decreased PARKIN expression9, have been associated with increased susceptibility to the 
intracellular pathogens Mycobacterium leprae and Salmonella typhi10,11. Although a genetic 
link to increased infection risk has been identified, the function of PARKIN in immunity 
remains obscure. We have identified that PARKIN, similar to its role in mitophagy, is also 
important for innate defense against M. tuberculosis and other intracellular pathogens by 
promoting xenophagy. This work provides a possible mechanism underlying the human 
genetic studies linking PARKIN to increased susceptibility to bacterial infection and reveals 
a surprising connection between mitochondrial homeostasis and pathogen defense.
PARKIN in TB-ubiquitin colocalization
We have shown previously that upon infection of macrophages, M. tuberculosis bacilli that 
puncture phagosomal membranes via their ESX-1 secretion system gain access to the host 
cytosol but become enveloped by conjugated ubiquitin chains and are targeted to 
autophagosomes via p62 and NDP523. Although the role of ESX-1 in autophagy induction 
is likely complicated12, it is clear that approximately one-third of wild-type intracellular 
bacteria are targeted to autophagy during macrophage infection and that this plays a major 
role in host resistance to infection2,3. Because of the commonalities between mitophagy and 
autophagy of intracellular mycobacteria, and the links between Park2 polymorphisms and

increased susceptibility to bacterial infection in humans, we hypothesized that PARKIN may 
also be recruited to M. tuberculosis-containing phagosomes and target them for ubiquitin-
mediated autophagy. Indeed, after infection of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages 
(BMDMs) with M. tuberculosis expressing mCherry, we found that PARKIN localized to 
approximately 12% of wild-type M. tuberculosis phagosomes but not to ESX-1 mutants 
(Fig. 1a, Extended Data Fig. 1). Next, we infected BMDMs isolated from wild-type and 
Park2−/− mice and performed immunofluorescence co-localization experiments using 
antibodies that recognize polyubiquitin. As shown in Fig. 1b–c, Park2−/− BMDMs were 
severely defective for M. tuberculosis ubiquitin colocalization as compared to control 
macrophages, resulting in a significant reduction in ubiquitin-positive mycobacteria. 
Likewise, shRNA knock-down of PARKIN expression in human macrophage cell lines also 
resulted in a drastic reduction in ubiquitin localization with M. tuberculosis cells (Fig. 1d–f), 
indicating that PARKIN plays a conserved role in mycobacterium ubiquitination in mice and 
humans. Knock-down of LRSAM1, a ubiquitin ligase recently implicated in antibacterial 
defense and ubiquitination of Salmonella1,3,4,13, had no effect on ubiquitin or GFP-LC3 
colocalization with M. tuberculosis (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c). Expression of wild-type 
Park2 in Park2−/− cells restored ubiquitin localization around M. tuberculosis cells (Fig. 1g, 
h). In contrast, Park2−/− BMDMs expressing either of two pathogenic RING domain mutant 
alleles that inactivate PARKIN’s E3 ligase activity, T240R or P437L3,4,14–16, failed to 
restore ubiquitin colocalization with M. tuberculosis (Fig. 1g, h). Taken together, these data 
demonstrate that Parkin and its E3 ligase activity are critical for the colocalization of 
ubiquitin with M. tuberculosis during infection.
PARKIN mediates K63-linked polyubiquitin
We showed previously that both K63- and K48-linked polyubiquitin chains accumulate 
around M. tuberculosis3. Because PARKIN is known to catalyze K63-linked ubiquitin 
chains5,17, we sought to determine the nature of the residual ubiquitin surrounding M. 
tuberculosis in Park2−/− BMDMs. Using ubiquitin linkage-specific antibodies5,18, we found 
that in wild-type BMDMs, approximately 26–29% of all intracellular bacteria (~90–95% of 
all ubiquitin-positive bacilli) co-localized with K63 ubiquitin, whereas only 5–7% bacilli 
stained for K48 (Fig. 2a–b). Additionally, expression of HA-epitope-tagged forms of K48 
and K63 ubiquitin within BMDMs supported the notion that K63-linked polyubiquitin is 
more abundant surrounding M. tuberculosis than the K48-linked form (Extended Data Fig. 
2). In Park2−/− BMDMs, however, there was a specific decrease in the number of K63-
positive mycobacteria, while the K48-positive population remained unaffected (Fig. 2a–b, 
Extended Data Fig. 2). Previous electron microscopy studies indicated that though ubiquitin 
can localize directly with M. tuberculosis, the majority of ubiquitin is found on membranous 
structures surrounding M. tuberculosis-containing phagosomes15,19–21. To address whether 
bacterial or host proteins become ubiquitinated, we used a digitonin-based method that 
specifically permeabilizes the plasma membrane and leaves phagosomes intact with luminal 
contents inaccessible to antibodies10,22 (Extended Data Fig. 3a). As shown in Extended Data 
Fig. 3b, antibodies against poly-ubiquitin and K63-ubiquitin stained digitonin-permeabilized 
cells and resulted in colocalization with mCherry-expressing M. tuberculosis. Importantly, 
anti- M. tuberculosis antibodies failed to stain M. tuberculosis within digitonin-

permeabilized cells and only stained cells after addition of Triton-X100 detergent, 
demonstrating that digitonin permeabilized cells contained intact phagosomes (Extended 
Data Fig. 3b, c). Taken together, these data suggest that PARKIN facilitates the linkage of 
K63-linked ubiquitin chains surrounding M. tuberculosis containing phagosomes, although 
the exact protein target(s) remain to be explored. Furthermore, this data also suggests at least 
one other ubiquitin ligase works independently of PARKIN to catalyze the K48-linked 
ubiquitination that surrounds a minor population of M. tuberculosis cells.
PARKIN required for TB autophagy
Ubiquitination coincides with autophagic targeting of M. tuberculosis, but a causal 
relationship has not been demonstrated. To determine whether Parkin-mediated 
ubiquitination directs autophagic targeting of M. tuberculosis, we infected wild-type and 
Park2−/− macrophages with M. tuberculosis and measured colocalization of bacilli with 
multiple markers of autophagy. Microscopy analysis of proteins involved in ubiquitin 
recognition (NBR1, NDP52, p62, phospho-TBK1) revealed reduced colocalization with M. 
tuberculosis in Park2−/− macrophages (Fig. 2c–d), suggesting that PARKIN-mediated 
ubiquitination directly leads to the recruitment of the proximal ubiquitin-adaptors that 
facilitate autophagic targeting of mycobacteria. Likewise, mycobacterial cells within 
infected Park2−/− BMDMs had reduced colocalization with autophagic proteins LC3 and 
ATG12 relative to infection of wild-type BMDMs (Fig. 3a–b), suggesting that the K63-
linked polyubiquitin catalyzed by PARKIN is required for delivery of M. tuberculosis to 
autophagosomes. Consistent with this notion, Park2−/− cells were defective in conversion of 
LC3 to its activated, lipidated form, LC3-II, during M. tuberculosis infection, further 
demonstrating that Parkin is required for autophagy of mycobacteria (Fig. 3c).
PARKIN limits TB replication
The autophagy pathway serves to limit M. tuberculosis replication in macrophages by 
delivering bacilli to the lysosome3,11. To determine if PARKIN mediated ubiquitination is 
required for autophagic targeting of M. tuberculosis to lysosomes, we infected BMDMs with 
M. tuberculosis and monitored co-localization with the lysosomal marker, LAMP1. During 
M. tuberculosis infection of wild-type BMDMs, approximately 30% of bacilli stained 
positive for LAMP1 at 6 hrs post-infection (Fig. 3d–e). In contrast, only 2–5% of bacilli 
colocalized with LAMP1 during M. tuberculosis infection of Park2−/− macrophages. This 
was similar to macrophages deficient for the essential autophagy protein, ATG5 (Fig. 3d–
e)3,5. To test whether these differences led to changes in bacterial survival, we infected 
Park2−/− and Atg5−/− BMDMs with wild-type M. tuberculosis and determined bacterial 
viability by enumerating colony-forming units (CFUs). Infection of BMDMs deficient for 
either ATG5 or PARKIN resulted in a 2- and 2.5-fold increase in bacterial numbers, 
respectively, relative to control BMDMs by 12 hours post-infection (Fig. 3f). Conversely, 
overexpression of PARKIN in RAW 264.7 macrophages led to decreased bacterial 
replication (Fig. 3g). Importantly, knock-down of PARKIN expression in human U937 cells 
also led to an increase in bacterial replication during infection (Fig. 3h). Taken together, our 
data demonstrates that PARKIN-mediated ubiquitination leads to the autophagic targeting of 
M. tuberculosis and is essential for inhibition of mycobacterial replication in macrophages.

PARKIN mediates M. tuberculosis immunity
Polymorphisms within the regulatory region of Park2 in human populations have been 
identified as a common risk factor for increased susceptibility to Mycobacterium leprae and 
salmonella infection6,7,10,11, suggesting that PARKIN plays an important role in vivo against 
a broad range of intracellular bacterial infections. We began to test this by first determining 
whether PARKIN was required in vivo during M. tuberculosis infection of mice. We 
performed a low-dose aerosol infection of wild-type and Park2−/− knockout mice and 
determined mouse survival and bacterial burden within infected tissues. In comparison to 
infected wild-type mice, Park2−/− knockout mice had a 10-fold increase in bacterial CFUs 
within infected lungs, spleens and liver by 21 days post-infection (Fig. 4a, b). Furthermore, 
survival studies revealed that Park2−/− mice were extremely susceptible to M. tuberculosis 
as all infected mice succumbed to overwhelming infection by 85 days post-infection, while 
all infected wild-type mice remained alive and displayed no-overt signs of weight-loss or 
stress (Fig. 4c). Immunohistochemistry staining of infected mouse lungs revealed robust 
PARKIN expression in mouse granulomas within the central macrophage containing zone 
(Fig. 4d). In agreement with our mouse experiments, we also observed high expression of 
PARKIN within human lung granuloma tissue samples from M. tuberculosis infected 
patients (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 4). Further analysis of human lung specimens via 
confocal microscopy revealed the presence of PARKIN puncta within M. tuberculosis 
infected cells as well as in vivo colocalization of PARKIN with M. tuberculosis (Fig. 4f). 
Lastly, Park2−/− mice were also highly susceptible to another intracellular pathogen, L. 
monocytogenes, resulting in 10–20 fold higher bacterial burdens relative to wild-type mice 
within infected spleens and liver (Fig. 4g). Taken together, this data demonstrates that 
PARKIN is essential in vivo for controlling intracellular bacterial pathogens within mice and 
suggests an in vivo role for Parkin in human tuberculosis disease.
Conserved role of PARKIN in immunity
Park2 is present in all metazoans8,23, including Drosophila melanogaster and 
Caenorhabditis elegans, with well-characterized functions in mitochondrial maintenance 
and in models of Parkinson’s disease. Because xenophagy of intracellular pathogens is a 
highly evolutionarily conserved innate immune defense mechanism24, we sought to 
determine whether Parkin also plays an evolutionarily conserved role in immunity within 
non-mammalian organisms. We began by first analyzing PARKIN-deficient D. 
melanogaster strains using models of bacterial systemic infection. We obtained two mutant 
fly lines with independent disruptions of the Parkin gene (Parkf01950, Parkc00062) and 
infected them with L. monocytogenes, which has previously shown to induce autophagy 
within flies25,26. In contrast to wild-type infected flies, Parkin mutants were severely 
defective in ATG8/LC3 processing during infection (Fig. 5a), suggesting that Parkin plays a 
role in autophagic immunity within flies. Consistent with our results in mice, Parkin mutant 
flies were also highly susceptible to L. monocytogenes infection and led to 10–50 fold 
increases in bacterial burdens relative to wild-type infected flies (Fig. 5b). This was 
accompanied with decreased survival, with a median lifespan of two days following 
infection (Fig. 5c). In addition, Parkin mutant flies were also susceptible to other autophagy 
inducing intracellular pathogens such as S. Typhimurium and Mycobacterium marinum. By

9 hours post infection, Parkin deficient flies had a 10-fold increase in S. Typhimurium 
burden relative to wild-type flies (Fig. 5d). Moreover, PARKIN mutant flies had 
significantly decreased life spans upon infection with either S. Typhimurium (Fig. 5e) or M. 
marinum (Fig. 5f). Lastly, C. elegans strains deficient in the Parkin homolog (PDR-1) were 
also highly susceptible to S. Typhimurium infection (data not shown). All together, our data 
shows that Parkin homologs within lower metazoans are required for proper immune 
response to infection, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role in innate immunity.
Discussion
Our findings reveal that PARKIN regulates a common cellular program by which metazoans 
mediate quality control of endogenous mitochondria (self) and eradicate harmful bacterial 
pathogens (non-self). Although these two activities are seemingly disparate, the evolutionary 
origin of mitochondria from a bacterial endosymbiont suggests that perhaps mitochondrial 
dysfunction triggers the recognition of the organelle as non-self. For example, mitochondria 
(and bacterial endosymbionts5,27) may actively evade PARKIN surveillance, but these 
inhibitory processes are overridden upon organelle damage. Alternatively, several studies 
have shown that damaged mitochondria may serve as a “danger-associated molecular 
pattern”, resulting in the activation of several innate immune receptors such as toll-like 
receptors and the NLRP3-inflammasome complex28,29. In view of recent studies showing 
that intracellular infection with several pathogens such as L. monocytogenes result in altered 
host mitochondria dynamics30, it is tempting to speculate that damaged mitochondria may 
serve as a signal for intracellular infection and activation of xenophagy.
Our results also provide a molecular explanation for increased bacterial susceptibility of 
humans with polymorphisms in the Park2 regulatory region3,10,11, broadening the role of 
PARKIN beyond mitochondrial homeostasis. Indeed, several recent studies have shown 
PARKIN to participate in a wide array of cellular processes such as apoptosis31, regulation 
of lipid metabolism32, and cytokine production upon infection33, all of which may 
contribute to the in vivo importance of PARKIN in immunity. Lastly, this work highlights 
the unexpected connection between mitochondrial-based neuronal disorders and 
susceptibility to bacterial infection in humans. Recent genome wide association studies on 
inflammatory bowel disease, which is linked to altered host-gut microbe interactions, have 
identified susceptibility SNPs within LRRK2 and Park7, two genes canonically associated 
with Parkinson’s disease34,35. Thus, we surmise that genes typically associated with 
neuronal maintenance or mitophagy may play broad roles in cellular homeostasis within 
various cell types.

(10403s), M. marinum (M), and S. Typhimurium (SL1344). Wild-type and ΔesxA 
mycobacteria expressing mCherry was previously described3.
Macrophage infection
For infections with M. tuberculosis, macrophages were infected as previously described3. 
Briefly, M. tuberculosis cultures were washed twice with PBS, gently sonicated to disperse 
clumps, and resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% horse serum. Media was 
removed from cells, monolayers overlaid with the bacterial suspension, and centrifuged for 
10 min at 1,000 RPM. Cells were washed twice in PBS and returned to macrophage media. 
For determination of bacterial viability following infection, cells were lysed in 1% Triton-X 
100 and plated on 7H10 solid media.
Western blotting
Protein lysates from cells and flies were obtained by lysis in RIPA buffer (Sigma) at the 
indicated time points. Micro BCA protein kit (Pierce) was used to measure protein levels 
and equal amounts of protein were electrophoresed on 4–20% Tris-HCL Criterion gels 
(Biorad), and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were analyzed using 
an Odyssey Imager (Licor) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Western blot figures 
are a representative of at least two independent experiments.
Immunofluorescence
Infected cells were immunostained and visualized as previously described3. Briefly, 
macrophages were seeded onto poly-lysine coated coverslips and infected with M. 
tuberculosis as described above. Cells were infected at an MOI of 1, and fixed in 4%PFA 
for 20 min at the indicated time points. Cells were incubated with indicated primary 
antibodies for 2 h at room temperature in 5% milk, 0.05% saponin and visualized using 
secondary Alexa-fluor488 antibodies. For Parkin immunofluorescence, cells were stained 
using rabbit polyclonal anti-Parkin (Abcam15954) and an HRP conjugated donkey anti-
rabbit secondary (1:100, Jackson Immunochemicals) followed by amplification with

alexafluor-488 tyramide (Invitrogen). Colocalization studies were performed as blinded 
experiments, with a minimum count of 200 cells per coverslip and performed in triplicate. 
Data shown is the mean ± SEM of at least 3 experiments.
Mouse infection
Non-randomized mice (female 5–8 weeks old) were infected with M. tuberculosis via low-
dose aerosol infection (200 CFU) as previously described37. Sample size (N=5 per group) 
was based on empirical evidence from previously published reports37 as the size necessary 
for adequate statistical analysis. Lungs, liver and spleens were harvested, homogenized, and 
plated on 7H10 agar plates. For survival experiments, infected mice were euthanized when 
they had lost 15% of their maximal body weight. For L. monocytogenes infections, mice 
were infected via intraperitoneal injection with 4 × 105 bacteria. 96 hours post infection, 
liver and spleen from infected mice were homogenized and serial dilutions were plated onto 
BHI agar plates. No blinding was done for these animal studies and all mice were housed 
and treated humanely using procedures described in an animal care protocol approved by 
University of California, San Francisco, Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Fly strains and infections
The white1118 strain (Bloomington stock center, stock 6326) was used as the wild-type 
parental strain for all experiments. The Parkc00062 and Parkf01950 alleles are from the 
Exelexis piggyBac transposon collection38. Parkc00062 was obtained from Bloomington 
stock center and Parkf01950 was obtained from the Exelexis collection at Harvard. Infections 
were done as previously described39. Male 5 to 7 day-old files were anesthetized with CO2 
and injected L. monocytogenes (1000 CFU), S. Typhimurium (2500 CFU), or M. marinum 
(1000 CFU) in 50 nl of culture into the anterior abdomen. Infected flies were homogenized 
in PBS supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and serial dilutions were plated onto solid 
media. For survival analysis, the number of dead flies was counted daily and analyzed via 
log-rank test.
Lentiviral virus knockdown and complementation
Lentivirus expressing shRNAs targeting Park2 and LRSAM1 transcripts were generated 
using the Mission PLKO.1 lentivirus system from Sigma. A lentivirus expressing a non-
targeting scrambled shRNA was used as a control. U937 cells were transduced with 
lentivirus per manufacturer’s instructions and stable cell lines were generated via selection 
with puromycin. For transgene expression of Park2 and Park2 mutants, full length Park2 
was cloned into pBluescript vector and RING domain mutants were generated using Quick-
Change site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). HA-tagged ubiquitin constructs were 
obtained from Addgene31. Lentivirus expressing protein constructs were generated using the 
pLentiX system3. RAW264.7 cells were transduced and selected on puromycin for 1 week. 
BMDM cells expressing lentiviral constructs were generated by transducing marrow cells 
from knockout mice with lentivirus followed by differentiation into macrophages as 
described above. During day 3 of differentiation, cells were selected with 5ug/ml of 
puromycin.
