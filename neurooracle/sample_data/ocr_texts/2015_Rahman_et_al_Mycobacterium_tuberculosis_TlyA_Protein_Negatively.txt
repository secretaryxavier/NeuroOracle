Background: TlyA is a virulence factor in several bacterial infections and is evolutionarily conserved in many Gram-positive
bacteria, but its function in Mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis has not been elucidated.
Results: TlyA mutant M. tuberculosis induces enhanced host-protective Th1 and Th17 responses.
Conclusion: TlyA significantly contributes to the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis.
Significance: TlyA warrants consideration for designing TB vaccines and therapies.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tubercu-
losis, is an ancient pathogen and a major cause of death world-
wide. Although various virulence factors of M. tuberculosis have
been identified, its pathogenesis remains incompletely under-
stood. TlyA is a virulence factor in several bacterial infections
and is evolutionarily conserved in many Gram-positive bacteria,
but its function in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis has not been
elucidated. Here, we report that TlyA significantly contributes
to the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis. We show that a TlyA
mutant M. tuberculosis strain induces increased IL-12 and
reduced IL-1 and IL-10 cytokine responses, which sharply con-
trasts with the immune responses induced by wild type M. tuber-
culosis. Furthermore, compared with wild type M. tuberculosis,
TlyA-deficient M. tuberculosis bacteria are more susceptible to
autophagy in macrophages. Consequently, animals infected
with the TlyA mutant M. tuberculosis organisms exhibited
increased host-protective immune responses, reduced bacillary
load, and increased survival compared with animals infected
with wild type M. tuberculosis. Thus, M. tuberculosis employs
TlyA as a host evasion factor, thereby contributing to its
virulence.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tubercu-
losis (TB),3 is responsible for millions of deaths each year
throughout the world (1). M. tuberculosis is the most successful
Gram-positive intracellular bacterial pathogen and primarily
infects human lungs through the aerosol route. M. tuberculosis
is phagocytosed by resident macrophages in the lungs, where it
evades hostile killing mechanisms, and later it forms granu-
loma-like structures with recruitment of immune cells around
infected macrophages (2, 3). Despite intense research on M.
tuberculosis pathogenesis, detailed molecular mechanisms of
the role of distinct mycobacterial virulence factors remain
incompletely understood. To understand its mechanism of
pathogenesis, the functions of numerous M. tuberculosis gene
products are being characterized in animal models (3–5). The
antigenic components that are absent in the vaccine strain
Bacillus Calmette Guérin (BCG) to elicit critical protective
immune responses against TB have been an area of intense
research. Early secreted antigenic target protein-6 (ESAT-6) is
one of the most prominent antigens expressed by M. tubercu-
losis but not by BCG (6, 7). Thus, ESAT-6 is being extensively
studied for its potential activity as a subunit vaccine (6, 7). In
continued efforts to search for virulence factors of M. tubercu-
losis, many researchers have identified clusters of genes that
may serve as potential targets for vaccine development (8–10).
Among the many unexplored gene products of M. tuberculosis,
TlyA (Rv1694) was recently identified as a possible virulence
gene in M. tuberculosis (11). A TlyA homologue is present in
many pathogenic bacteria, and the encoded factors exhibit vir-
ulence-promoting properties by functioning as a pore-forming
hemolysin in Serpulina hyodysenteriae and Helicobacter pylori,
and with adherence properties to host cells or tissues in many
pathogens (11–13). Moreover, the TlyA gene is also present in
several pathogenic mycobacterial species, including M.
tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae. Although, M. tuber-
culosis and M. leprae evolved from a common ancestor, M.
leprae possesses fewer genes (14). Genes conserved between
the two species are hence considered important for patho-
genicity and virulence. Recently, Rahman et al. (11) reported
that TlyA (Rv1694) of M. tuberculosis possesses hemolytic
activity by binding with and oligomerizing into host cell
membranes.

Macrophages are critical innate immune cells, engulfing
microbes into phagosomes that later fuse with lysosomes con-
taining enzymes that degrade the invaded organisms. This pro-
cess also makes antigens available for priming of T cell
responses (15–20). However, M. tuberculosis has evolved
mechanisms to evade phagosome maturation and to alter the
levels of cytokine secretion to ensure its unhindered survival
and replication within phagocytes (17, 18). Mycobacterial rep-
lication in hosts facilitates recruitment of macrophages, epithe-
lioid cells, and lymphocytes that ultimately leads to formation
of granulomas that contain the organisms (21, 22). Further-
more, an equilibrium develops between the protective immune
response and growth of the harbored mycobacteria, causing
persistent infection. A later perturbation in immune responses
may result in uncontrolled growth of M. tuberculosis, leading to
symptomatic disease. Adaptive immunity against M. tubercu-
losis infection predominantly consists of interferon (IFN)-–
producing CD4T lymphocytes that activate macrophages to
restore phagolysosome activation and enhance autophagy (23–
25). IFN- is an essential component of the immunological
defense against intracellular infections (26). Both mice and
humans with genetic defects in IFN- signaling are highly sus-
ceptible to mycobacterial diseases (27). It has been established
that T helper 1 (Th1) cells producing IFN- play a central role
in host immunity against M. tuberculosis infection, and this
type of immune response is generated in the presence of inter-
leukin (IL)-12 secretion by infected macrophages (27). IFN--
induced autophagosomes target M. tuberculosis-containing
phagosomes for lysosomal destruction. Additionally, lysosomal
degradation products are presented via MHC class II molecules
to MHC class II-restricted CD4 T cells, and these helper T
cells orchestrate the specific immune response. However, M.
tuberculosis promotes the differentiation of regulatory Th2 and
Treg cells, and this is associated with inhibition of protective T
cell responses in the host (28–30). M. tuberculosis has also
developed several strategies to escape entry and destruction by
phagolysosomes and macroautophagy and, hence, to be recog-
nized by MHC class II-restricted CD4 T cells.
Here, we report that TlyA assists M. tuberculosis survival in a
mouse infection model by inhibiting Th1 cytokines (IL-12 and
IFN-) as well as autophagy. Furthermore, deletion of the TlyA
gene in wild type M. tuberculosis H37Rv impedes its pathoge-
nicity in mice. Therefore, TlyA is a virulence factor for M.
tuberculosis that deserves more in depth study and needs to be
considered when designing TB vaccines and therapies.
Experimental Procedures
Ethics Statement—All animal experiments were performed
according to the guidelines approved by the Institutional Ani-
mals Ethics Committee meeting held on 16 August 2010 and 28
January 2013 at International Centre for Genetic Engineering
and Biotechnology (ICGEB) (approval numbers ICGEB/IAEC/
IMM-22/2010 and ICGEB/AH/2013/01/IMM-34), New Delhi,
India, and Department of Biotechnology guidelines, Govern-
ment of India. All mice used for experiments were ethically
sacrificed by asphyxiation with carbon dioxide according to
institutional and Department of Biotechnology (Govt. of India)
regulations.
Mice—BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks of age) were
initially purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. ERK, TLR-2,
and MyD88 knock-out mice on the B6 background were the
kind gift, from Prof. Ruslan Medzhitov, Yale University. All
animals were subsequently bred and maintained in the animal
facility of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and
Biotechnology (ICGEB), New Delhi, India.
Bacteria—M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv was a kind gift from
the Colorado State University repository. H37RvTlyA was a
kind gift from Tanya Parish, University of Washington (13).
H37Rv and H37RvTlyA were grown in 7H9 (Middlebrook,
Difco) medium supplemented with 10% albumin, dextrose, and
catalase (Difco) and with 0.05% Tween 80 and 0.5% glycerol,
and cultures were grown to mid-log phase. Aliquots of the cul-
tures in 20% glycerol were preserved at 80 °C, and these cryo-
preserved stocks were used for infections.
M. tuberculosis Infection of Mice and Estimation of Colony-
forming Units (cfu)—Mice were infected with wild type myco-
bacterial strain H37Rv or mutant strain H37RvTlyA via the
aerosol route using a Madison aerosol chamber (University of
Wisconsin, Madison, WI) with its nebulizer pre-calibrated to
deposit a total of 110 bacilli/lung/mouse to the lungs of each
mouse as described previously (7, 22). Briefly, mycobacterial
stocks recovered from a 80 °C freezer were quickly thawed
and subjected to light ultrasonication to obtain a single cell
suspension. Fifteen ml of the bacterial cell suspension (10  106
cells/ml) was placed in the nebulizer of the pre-calibrated Mad-
ison aerosol chamber and administered to mice. One day after
the aerosol exposure procedure, three randomly selected mice
were sacrificed to determine the infectious dose in each exper-
iment. To determine viable at various time points, lungs and
spleens were harvested and homogenized in sterile PBS con-
taining 0.05% Tween 80 and plated onto 7H11 Middlebrook
(Difco) plates containing 10% oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, and
catalase (Difco). Undiluted, 10-fold diluted, and 100-fold
diluted lung and spleen homogenates were plated in duplicate
on the above 7H11 plates and incubated at 37 °C for 15–21 days.
Colonies were counted, and colony-forming units were
estimated.
T Cell Proliferation Assay—Spleens were isolated from unin-
fected and H37Rv- and H37RvTlyA-infected mice. Spleens
were macerated by frosted slides in 10% RPMI 1640 medium
(Gibco, Invitrogen) and made into a single cell suspension. Red
blood cells (RBCs) were lysed with RBC lysis buffer and incu-
bated at room temperature for 3–5 min and washed with 10%
RPMI 1460 medium. Cells were counted, and 2  105 cells per
well were seeded in 96-well plates and stimulated with different
concentrations of M. tuberculosis complete soluble antigen.
Cells were cultured for 48 h and then pulsed with tritiated thy-
midine (3H-labeled tritiated thymidine, 1.0 Ci per well; Amer-
sham Biosciences). One day later, cells were harvested on filter
mats using a semi-automated cell harvester (PerkinElmer Life
Sciences). Thymidine incorporation was determined by using a
plate -counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).
Flow Cytometry, Surface and Intracellular Staining—Spleens
were isolated from H37Rv- and H37RvTlyA-infected mice
and macerated by frosted slides in 10% RPMI 1640 medium
(Gibco, Invitrogen) and made into a single cell suspension.

RBCs were lysed with RBC lysis buffer, incubated at room tem-
perature for 2–3 min, and washed with 10% RPMI 1640
medium. The cells were counted, and 1  106 cells were used
for surface staining. Cells were harvested and washed twice
with PBS and stained with fluorescent antibodies directed
against surface markers. For intracellular staining, 1  106 cells
were cultured per well in 24-well plates (Corning, Co-star) and
activated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(Sigma) and 750 ng/ml ionomycin (Sigma) overnight, and 10
mg/ml brefeldin A (eBiosciences) was added during the last 3 h
of culture. After staining, cells were washed again with PBS, and
cells were fixed with 100 l of fixation buffer (eBiosciences) for
15 min, then resuspended in 200 l of 1 permeabilization
buffer (eBiosciences), and stained with fluorescently conju-
gated monoclonal antibodies as follows: anti-IL-4 (clone, 8D4-
8), anti-IL-17 (clone, 17B7), and anti-IFN- (clone, XMG1.2),
all from Pharmingen. Fluorescence intensity of fluorochrome-
labeled cells was acquired and analyzed by flow cytometry
(FACS Canto II, BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed
by Flow Jo (Tree Star).
Generation of Dendritic Cells—C57BL/6 mice were eutha-
nized, and the femurs were isolated. Bone marrow was flushed
out with RPMI 1640 medium using a 2.0-ml syringe (26-gauge).
The cells were washed twice with PBS and then cultured in
complete RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with
GM-CSF (40 ng/ml) and IL-4 (10 ng/ml) on 24-well plates (1
million cells/ml). On the 3rd day, 75% of the medium was
replaced with fresh DC culture medium. On day 5, the sus-
pended cells were removed, and the loosely adherent cells were
collected as immature DCs. Flow cytometric analysis by using
anti-CD11c, -CD11b, -CD80, -CD86, -MHC class II, and
-IgG2a (isotype control) antibodies suggested that 95% of the
cells were conventional DCs.
Detection of Cytokines—Bone marrow cells were isolated
from mice (BALB/c), differentiated into immature DCs as
described above, and cultured in 24-well plates (1 million cells/
well). Cells were infected with H37Rv or H37RvTlyA at a mul-
tiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1:10. Supernatants from cells
were collected at 24, 48, and 72 h for cytokine profiling. Cyto-
kines in the culture supernatant of DCs were assayed by a
Luminex microbead-based multiplexed assay using commer-
cially available kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol
(BioPlex, Bio-Rad).
Histology—Lung tissues were stained with Acid Fast Bacilli
stain and H&E dyes as described previously (7, 22). Data are
presented here as the number of granulomas viewed under 10
objective and 10 ocular lens. Granulomas were counted
from 25 different areas of the lungs of each mouse, and the
bar graph represents the mean number of granulomas of 12
mice  S.E. The results are representative of three indepen-
dent experiments.
Preparation of Peritoneal Macrophages and Surface Labeling
of Bacteria—C57BL/6 mice were injected intraperitoneally
with 2 ml of 4% thioglycollate (Brewer modified, BBL, BD Bio-
sciences). Five days later, peritoneal exudate cells were isolated
from the peritoneal cavity by washing with ice-cold RPMI 1640
medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS,
Thermo Scientific HyClone). Cells were cultured overnight at
37 °C, 5% CO2, and washed with RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FBS
to remove nonadherent cells. Adherent monolayer cells were
used as peritoneal macrophages. Surface labeling of H37Rv and
H37RvTlyA with FITC was performed according to standard
methods (31), just prior to infection. The bacteria were har-
vested, washed twice with PBS, pH 7.4, and resuspended with
0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.5, containing FITC (1
mg/ml, Sigma); the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room
temperature with gentle shaking. The bacteria were collected
by centrifugation, washed three times, suspended in RPMI 1640
medium (without antibiotics), and passed through a 26-gauge
needle. Peritoneal macrophages were plated in 12-well plates
(1  106 cells/well), and infected with FITC-labeled bacteria
at an m.o.i. of 10:1. The purity of macrophages obtained from
thioglycollate-elicited peritoneal exudates and infections with
FITC-labeled H37Rv and H37RvTlyA in macrophages was
examined by flow cytometry (FACS Canto II; BD Biosciences),
and data were analyzed with FlowJo.
Cell Viability Assay—Peritoneal macrophages, uninfected or
infected with M. tuberculosis-WT or M. tuberculosis-TlyA,
were cultured for 48 h. Cell viability was determined by flow
cytometric analysis of cells stained with propidium iodide at a
concentration of 10 M.
Measurement of Autophagy—Peritoneal macrophages were
plated in 12-well plates (1  106 cells/well) and infected with
FITC-labeled H37Rv or H37RvTlyA. Before harvesting, the
medium was removed, replenished with medium containing 75
ng/ml of LysoTracker Red DND-99 (32), and incubated at
37 °C, 5% CO2 for 15 min. Finally, the control and treated cells
were harvested with trypsin/EDTA and washed in 1 ml of cold
PBS. For LC3II staining, we infected the peritoneal macro-
phages with H37Rv and H37RvTlyA, and 48 post-infection,
we removed the cells and stained them with anti-LC3II anti-
bodies. The stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on
channel APC-A for LysoTracker and FITC-A for the LC3II
staining using the FACS Canto II cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Confocal Microscopy—Peritoneal macrophages were plated
in 12-well plates (1  106 cells/well) on glass coverslips and
infected with FITC-labeled bacteria at m.o.i. of 10:1. Bacteria
were briefly sonicated before infection. After 4 h of infection,
cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FBS and
treated with 100 g/ml gentamicin for 1 h at 37 °C to remove
extracellular bacteria. After 1 h, medium was replaced with
fresh RPMI 1640 medium, 10% FBS, and cells were cultured at
37 °C and 5% CO2. The medium was removed, and fresh
medium containing 2 M LysoTracker Red DND-99 was added
and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Medium was removed from the
wells, washed twice with PBS, and cells were fixed with 2% para-
formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 20–30 min. After fixation,
cells were washed three times with PBS, and coverslips were
transferred into fresh plates and stored at 4 °C until use. Cov-
erslips were mounted in Prolong Gold antifade reagent (catalog
no. P36934; Invitrogen) and sealed using adhesives. Confocal
microscopy images were acquired on a Nikon A-1R confocal
microscope with 60 (for statistical data) and 100 (for
images) objectives and analyzed using NIS element software.
For each sample, triplicate slides were prepared, and for each
slide at least four different fields containing 10–15 cells were

analyzed. Co-localization studies were performed after back-
ground correction using the NIS element software.
Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed to
detect the expression of TRAF-6. Whole cell lysates were pre-
pared from peritoneal macrophages uninfected or infected
(H37Rv or H37RvTlyA) by using lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 8.0, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM
dithiothreitol, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) along
with phosphatase inhibitor mixture (78420; Thermo Scientific)
and protease inhibitor mixture (78410; Thermo Scientific).
Samples were electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide
gel and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes. Blots were blocked for 2 h in 5% nonfat dried milk
in TBST (1 M Tris, pH 8.0, 4 M NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20).
TRAF-6 protein was detected with anti-TRAF-6 (H-274 and
Sc-7221) antibodies at a dilution of 1:500 for 2 h at room tem-
perature. Bound antibody was detected with goat anti-rabbit
(Sc-2004, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody at a dilution of
1:1000 for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were stripped and
re-probed for GAPDH as an equal loading control.
qPCR Analysis—Bone marrow-derived DC were isolated
and infected with different bacterial strains (H37Rv and
H37RvTlyA) and cultured for 48 h for RNA isolation. Total
RNA, including miRNAs, was isolated by miRNeasy isolation
kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. cDNA was synthesized by the miRCURY LNA
universal reverse transcriptase microRNA cDNA synthesis
kit (EXIQON), and the reaction was set up according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Real time quantitative RT-PCR
analysis was performed using real-time thermal cycler (Bio-
Rad) and miRCURY LNA universal reverse transcriptase
microRNA PCR SYBR Green master mix (EXIQON, Ved-
baek, Denmark) for miRNA amplification. Fluorescence data
were collected at each amplification step. The relative
expression level of miRNAs was normalized to that of inter-
nal control 5S rRNA by using 2-Ct cycle threshold
method.
Statistical Analysis—All data were derived from at least three
independent experiments. A value of p  0.05 was accepted as
an indication of statistical significance. For all statistical analy-
ses, Student’s t test was performed to compare two groups.
Results
TlyA Is a Virulence Determinant in M. tuberculosis H37Rv—
Previously, it has been reported that TlyA is a virulence factor in
many pathogenic bacteria. Consistent with its virulence prop-
erties, TlyA possesses hemolytic activity in several organisms
and assists H. pylori to adhere to and colonize gastric epithelial
cells (11).To investigate the role of TlyA in M. tuberculosis
infection, we infected mice with M. tuberculosis H37Rv or a
TlyA mutant of H37Rv (H37RvTlyA), using a low dose (110
cfu) infection model by the aerosol route. At different time
points after infection, we harvested lungs and spleen for analy-
sis of bacterial load and cytokine expression. We found that
mice infected with H37RvTlyA developed lower numbers of
granulomatic lesions than mice infected with H37Rv (Fig. 1A).
These results were further strengthened by histological analy-
sis, which showed lower numbers of granulomatic regions and
bacilli in lungs of mice infected with H37RvTlyA, compared
with H37Rv (Fig. 1B), as well as numbers of granulomas in the
FIGURE 1. General analysis of lungs and spleen of H37Rv- and H37RvTlyA-challenged BALB/c mice. BALB/c mice were challenged with H37Rv or

lungs (Fig. 1C) and the presence of acid fast bacilli in the lung
sections (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, H37RvTlyA and H37Rv rep-
licated to a similar extent during the first 2 weeks of infection;
however, at later time points, growth of H37RvTlyA bacilli
gradually slowed down and reached a plateau in both lungs and
spleen (Fig. 1, E and F). This observation suggested that adap-
tive immune responses play an important role in diminished
growth of H37RvTlyA in organs. Therefore, TlyA is a viru-
lence determinant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, which assists M.
tuberculosis in host evasion by controlling adaptive immune
responses.
H37RvTlyA Induces Enhanced Antigen-specific T Helper
Cell Activation—M. tuberculosis maintains an unhindered life-
style within susceptible hosts by evading host protective
immune responses. In addition to its innate immune evasion
mechanisms within macrophages, M. tuberculosis is also suc-
cessful in modulating adaptive immune responses. Above, we
showed that H37RvTlyA mutants only exhibited enhanced
clearance during the late phase of infection, suggesting that
TlyA plays a role in inhibiting adaptive immune responses dur-
ing disease progression. It is well accepted that Th1 and Th17
cells play a central role in host protection against M. tuberculo-
sis infection. Therefore, we examined the status of adaptive
immune components in animals infected by H37RvTlyA. As
expected, we observed significantly higher T cell proliferative
responses upon in vitro challenge with complete soluble M.
tuberculosis antigen in mice infected with H37RvTlyA, com-
pared with H37Rv (Fig. 2A). This was also reflected by the
prevalence of activated CD4T cells and CD8T cells in
H37RvTlyA-infected mice, as deduced by the numbers of
CD69-expressing cells. These results suggested that deletion of
TlyA in H37Rv promotes activation and proliferation of anti-
gen-specific CD4T cells in infected animals (Fig. 2, B and C). It
is now clear that Th1 and Th17 cells play host-protective roles,
whereas Th2 and Treg cells potentiate disease progression.
Therefore, we evaluated whether H37RvTlyA induced a
biased T helper response. Indeed, we found that H37RvTlyA-
infected animals produced dramatically higher numbers of
IFN-- and IL-17-producing cells, whereas IL-4-producing
cells were significantly reduced as compared with H37Rv-in-
fected mice (Fig. 2, D and E). We also observed that
H37RvTlyA induced significantly reduced Treg responses
compared with H37Rv (Fig. 2, F and G).

deletion of the TlyA gene from H37Rv results in significantly

TlyA directly or indirectly regulates these host-protective
immune responses. To provide insight into the mechanism
whereby deletion of TlyA promotes Th1 and Th17 differentia-

tion, we compared the cytokines induced by dendritic cells
(characterized with CD11c, CD11b, CD80, CD86, and MHC
class II markers) infected with H37Rv or H37RvTlyA. We
found that H37Rv-infected DCs produced significantly higher
amounts of IL-1, IL-10, and TNF- than DCs infected with
H37RvTlyA (Fig. 3A). Additionally, we observed significantly
higher amounts of IL-12p40, a key component of both IL-12p70
and IL-23, which are the growth factors for Th1 and Th17
cells, respectively, in the supernatant of DCs infected with
H37RvTlyA, compared with DCs infected with H37Rv (Fig.
3A). We also noticed that both H37Rv and H37RvTlyA
induced similar amounts of IL-6 and TGF- (Fig. 3A), which
orchestrate Th17 cell differentiation. These observations sug-
gested that deletion of TlyA from H37Rv creates an environ-
ment that is conducive for the differentiation of both Th1 and
Th17 cells. Therefore, we concluded that TlyA inhibits Th1 and
Th17 cell differentiation, either directly or indirectly.
To investigate the molecular basis for the failure of H37Rv to
induce high levels of IL-12 in DCs, we compared induction of
microRNA-146a, a negative regulator of innate immune com-
ponents in infected DCs (33). Interestingly, we found that
H37Rv significantly up-regulated miR146a in DCs as compared
with H37RvTlyA-infected or uninfected DCs (Fig. 3B). Con-
sistent with these findings, the virulent strain H37Rv but not its
H37RvTlyA variant inhibited the expression of TRAF-6, a tar-
get of miR146a, in DCs (Fig. 3, C and D). Collectively, these data
suggested that H37RvTlyA promotes the differentiation of
both Th1 and Th17 cell responses by modulating miR-146a and
TRAF-6 expression.
H37RvTlyA Induces Autophagy in Macrophages—Previous
reports have indicated that virulent strains of M. tuberculosis
suppress autophagy to inhibit antigen presentation, which
represents an astute mechanism of host evasion (24, 25). Fur-
thermore, the cellular stress associated with an increased
autophagic influx stimulates lysosomal proton pumping, thus
establishing a correlation between autophagic activity and
overall lysosomal acidity. This process promotes antigen pres-
entation and, in turn, T cell priming. Therefore, we tested
whether H37RvTlyA promotes autophagy. Fig. 4A illustrates
our procedure to isolate viable macrophages from peritoneal
exudates of mice and to infect these cells with H37Rv or
H37RvTlyA. M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages were
stained with propidium iodide to test for apoptotic cells by
FACS analysis. We only found 6–8% apoptotic cells at 72 h
post-infection in M. tuberculosis-infected macrophages, com-
pared with 4% in uninfected cells (Fig. 4B). Autophagy in M.
tuberculosis-infected macrophages was measured with Lyso-
Tracker DND-99 at different time points after infection. We

found that H37RvTlyA-infected macrophages exhibited
exaggerated autophagic activity compared with uninfected and
H37Rv-infected macrophages (Fig. 4, C and D). Moreover, anal-
ysis of the kinetics of autophagy showed that H37RvTlyA-
infected macrophages exhibited enhanced autophagy at 48 h
post-infection compared with H37Rv-infected macrophages
(Fig. 4D). To confirm these data, we also measured autophagy
by LC3II expression (Fig. 4E). As expected, we observed higher
LC3bII expression in H37RvTlyA-infected cells. These results
were further strengthened by confocal microscopy, which
showed that H37RvTlyA organisms co-localized with Lyso-
Tracker-stained acidic compartments in infected macro-
phages, although this co-localization was less profound for
H37Rv (Fig. 4F). These results were further supported by stud-
ies with M. tuberculosis-TlyA-transformed E. coli bacteria,
where we observed that TlyA-expressing E. coli showed
reduced autophagy as compared with mock vector-trans-
formed E. coli (Fig. 4, G and H). Confocal microscopy studies
with TlyA-expressing E. coli failed to show co-localization with
LysoTracker-stained acidic compartments in infected macro-
phages, whereas complete co-localization was observed in vec-
tor-transformed E. coli (Fig. 4I). These results indicate that
TlyA of M. tuberculosis inhibits autophagy. This finding may
explain why H37RvTlyA induces higher antigen-specific
immune responses than the parental strain H37Rv.
TlyA Modulates the TLR-2-MyD88 Signaling Pathway in a
p38-MAPK-dependent Manner—Our results clearly demon-
strated that H37RvTlyA promotes Th1 and Th17 cytokine
expression and autophagy. To determine the molecular mech-
anism of TlyA-mediated signaling in macrophages, we evalu-
ated the viability of H37RvTlyA in macrophages isolated from
wild type C57BL/6 and C57BL/6 mice selectively deficient in
either ERK, TLR2, or MyD88. We isolated macrophages from
wild type and ERK, TLR-2, and MyD88 knock-out mice,
infected these cells with H37Rv or H37RvTlyA, and investi-
gated bacterial loads at different time points post-infection. We
found that, in both wild type and ERK knock-out macrophages,
relative colony-forming units of H37RvTlyA were about 50%
of the colony-forming unit levels of H37Rv-infected macro-
phages at 72 h post-infection (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, no differ-
ences were observed in relative colony-forming unit levels of
H37RvTlyA-infected macrophages isolated from TLR-2/
and MyD88/ mice compared with H37Rv-infected macro-
phages (Fig. 5A). These results indicated that TlyA of H37Rv
modulates the TLR-2-MyD88 signaling pathway in an ERK-
independent manner.

It has been well established that many hemolysins and
toxic proteins activate the p38-MAPK pathway through its
phosphorylation. To examine p38 activation, we infected
murine macrophages isolated from wild type, ERK/, TLR-
2/, and MyD88/mice with H37Rv or H37RvTlyA.
These infected macrophages were harvested after 48 h and
assayed for p38 phosphorylation. We found that phospho-
p38 levels in H37Rv-infected macrophages were higher as
compared
with
H37RvTlyA-infected
and
uninfected
macrophages (Fig. 5B). The phosphorylation pattern of p38
in ERK/ macrophages was similar to that in wild type
macrophages, whereas no differences in phospho-p38 levels
for H37Rv- and H37RvTlyA-infected and uninfected TLR-
2/ macrophages were observed (Fig. 5B). These results
suggest that TlyA modulates p38-MAPK activation down-
stream of the TLR-2-MyD88 pathway and that this is inde-
pendent of the ERK pathway.
Discussion
M. tuberculosis is the oldest known human pathogen and
successfully co-evolved with vertebrate evolution. For its sur-
vival within macrophages, the natural host of M. tuberculosis,
the organism inhibits phagolysosome fusion, neutralizes the
lysosomal acidic environment, inhibits autophagy, and translo-
cates to the cytosol (18, 24, 31, 32). Each of these measures
assists the organism to evade innate immune responses. How-
ever, for its long term survival, M. tuberculosis also needs to
modulate adaptive immune responses. Previous studies have
shown that M. tuberculosis inhibits expression of MHC class II
and co-stimulatory molecules, which can partially suppress T
cell activation (34, 35). However, during its evolution M. tuber-
culosis evolved more sophisticated means to modulate host
immune responses and has been shown to influence T helper
cell responses (36–38). As Th1 and Th17 responses provide
host protection against TB, M. tuberculosis inhibits these
responses in susceptible hosts, which in turn enhance Th2 and
Treg cell responses that assist disease progression (28, 29, 39).
During its co-evolution with mammalian hosts, M. tuberculosis
gradually acquired multiple means to evade various host-pro-
tective immune responses to avoid host elimination. Therefore,
the virulence of M. tuberculosis is dependent on multiple host
targets (40–42).
TlyA is a virulence determinant of many pathogenic bacteria
such as S. dysenteriae and H. pylori (11–13). However, the role
of TlyA in M. tuberculosis pathogenesis has not been previously
investigated. Mycobacterial TlyA is present in virulent strains
but absent in avirulent strains of M. tuberculosis. Interestingly,
M. tuberculosis-TlyA shows high homology with the hemoly-
sin/cytolysin TlyA of the swine pathogen S. hyodysenteriae,
where TlyA was first characterized (12). The TlyA homologue
in some bacteria exhibits hemolytic activity by forming pores,
as confirmed in S. hyodysenteria (13), and TlyA in H. pylori
functions as a hemolysin as well as an adherence factor for col-
onization of the gastric mucosa (12). The LsaA product of Law-
sonia intracellularis, the TlyA homologue of this organism,
lacks hemolytic activity but has been suggested to play a role in
adherence and/or invasion (43). Moreover, TlyA is known as
ribosomal RNA methyltransferase, which methylates 50S and
30S ribosomal RNA and makes M. tuberculosis susceptible to
the peptide antibiotic capreomysin (12, 13, 44). Furthermore,
TlyA has been shown to exhibit rRNA methyltransferase activ-
ity and to function as a hemolysin in M. tuberculosis (12, 13, 44).
We observed that growth of H37RvTlyA in mice was similar
to the parental strain during the initial phase of infection but
that the bacteria were rapidly slowed down at later stages of
FIGURE 5. TlyA activates p38-MAPK in the TLR2-MyD88 signaling pathway. A, macrophages from wild type C57BL/6 and ERK/, TLR2/, and MyD88/

contrast, p38-MAPK was equally activated in TLR2/ and wild type mice for uninfected and H37Rv-or H37RvTlyA-infected macrophages. The results shown
are representative of three independent experiments with three replicates.

infection. This observation suggests that adaptive immunity
plays an important role in the inhibition of its growth. Further-
more, H37RvTlyA induced enhanced Th1 and Th17 re-
sponses in mice, suggesting that TlyA inhibits such responses
during M. tuberculosis infection to subvert adaptive immunity.
This modulation of adaptive immunity is mediated by cytokine
regulation in infected cells. H37RvTlyA selectively alters
expression of IL-12p40, suggesting that TlyA was evolutionarily
acquired by mycobacteria to combat host immunity.
Earlier studies have indicated that M. tuberculosis infection
in the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 inhibits phago-
some maturation, whereas treatment of infected macrophages
with IFN- induces autophagy (45). Treatment of macrophages
with IFN- resulted in accumulation of the autophagy marker
LC3II on endomembranes (46). ESAT-6 from M. tuberculosis
directly inhibits IFN- production by human T cells. This inhi-
bition was due to the induced phosphorylation and increased
activity of p38 MAPK and independent of the activation of ERK
or JNK (46). Furthermore, additional studies have suggested
that M. tuberculosis induces p38 MAPK phosphorylation to
inhibit phagosome maturation (47). After this activation, p38
MAPK negatively regulates autophagic maturation. However,
inhibition of p38 by its inhibitor SB203580 was sufficient to
activate autophagy maturation (48). It has been established that
Gram-positive bacteria like M. tuberculosis that contain TLR2
ligands activate host cells via a signaling cascade involving
TLR2, MyD88, IRAK4, TRAF6, and finally NF-B (49). It has
been shown that TLR2 signaling is required for phagolysosome
maturation in macrophages in response to M. tuberculosis
infection (50, 51). Our results further suggest that inhibition of
IFN- in M. tuberculosis H37Rv-infected mice causes enhanced
growth in organs as compared with H37RvTlyA-infected
mice. Furthermore, H37Rv-infected murine macrophages
showed reduced autophagy (Fig. 4, C–E), increased bacillar
growth (Fig. 5A), and increased activation of p38 phosphoryla-
tion (Fig. 5B) compared with H37RvTlyA. Moreover, the
increase in p38 activation induced by M. tuberculosis-TlyA was
dependent on the TLR2-MyD88 signaling pathway. These find-
ings also suggest that TlyA either directly binds with TLR2 or
regulates expression of another TLR2 ligand. In this context,
previous studies have shown that M. tuberculosis Esat-6 and
lipoarabinomannan bind with TLR2 (52). Whether TlyA regu-
lates the expression of these factors remains to be determined
and is one of our future goals.
Previously, it has been shown that IL-1, a pro-inflammatory
cytokine, is necessary to impart protection against TB. Virulent
M. tuberculosis strains cause more inflammation than avirulent
strains. In our laboratory, we have further shown that H37Rv
induces more IL-1 compared with its RD-1 deleted mutant
(28). In another study, H37Rv infection in IL-1 knock-out
mice showed 10-fold more colony-forming units in lungs at 7
weeks after infection compared with wild type mice (53). It has
also been reported that, H. pylori induces expression of
miR146a in gastric epithelial cells and proinflammatory cyto-
kine secretion. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-146a
reduced H. pylori-induced IL-8, TNF-, and IL-1 levels (54).
In a recent study, Li et al. (55) showed that BCG-infected (10
m.o.i.) macrophages induce miR146a around 8-fold, but IL-1
expression was not analyzed. Furthermore, these investigators
overexpressed miR146a in RAW264.7 cells around 100–200-
fold (miR-146a mimics) followed by BCG infection (miR146a
inhibitor), but there were no significant differences in the pro-
duction of IL-1 (55). In our study we have shown 8- and 4-fold
increased miRNA146a expression in H37Rv-infected DCs
compared with uninfected and H37RvDTlyA-infected DCs,
respectively, and this induction in miRNA146a expression was
comparable with the study by Li et al. (55). Such an increased
miRNA-146a expression was only seen at high IL-1 concen-
trations, suggesting that this negative feedback loop is only acti-
vated during severe inflammation and that this might be crucial
in preventing potentially dangerous inflammation from spiral-
ing out of control. However, examination of the mechanism
showed that this was not caused by down-regulation of IRAK1
or TRAF6 but instead occurred at the translational level,
through as yet unidentified mechanisms (56).
M. tuberculosis-TlyA is also a homologue of bacterial hemo-
lysins and possesses pore forming hemolytic activities (11).
Recently, we and others have shown that M. tuberculosis trans-
locates from the phagolysosome to the cytosol of macrophages
(32). As TlyA has pore forming activities and plays a role in the
pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis and other organisms, it will be
interesting to explore whether TlyA is involved in this process,
which is one of our future goals.
In summary, we have demonstrated that the TlyA protein
contributes to the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis by inhibiting
host-protective, adaptive immune responses. The increased
clearance of H37RvTlyA, a deletion mutant of TlyA in the
virulent M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv, is dependent on subver-
sion of the adaptive immune response. Cytokine analysis
revealed that this mutant induces enhanced host-protective
Th1 and Th17 responses. Hence, TlyA warrants consideration
for designing TB vaccines and therapies.
