Intracellular survival plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To identify M.
tuberculosis genes required for intracellular survival within macrophages, an M. tuberculosis H37Rv plasmid
library was constructed by using the shuttle vector pOLYG. This plasmid library was electroporated into
Mycobacterium smegmatis 1-2c, and the transformants were used to infect the human macrophage-like cell line
U-937. Because M. smegmatis does not readily survive within macrophages, any increased intracellular survival
is likely due to cloned M. tuberculosis H37Rv DNA. After six sequential passages of M. smegmatis transformants
through U-937 cells, one clone (p69) was enriched more than 70% as determined by both restriction enzyme
and PCR analyses. p69 demonstrated signiﬁcantly enhanced survival compared to that of the vector control,
ranging from 2.4- to 5.3-fold at both 24 and 48 h after infection. DNA sequence analysis revealed three open
reading frames (ORFs) in the insert of p69. ORF2 (1.2 kb) was the only one which contained a putative
promoter region and a ribosome-binding site. Deletion analysis of the p69 insert DNA showed that disruption
of ORF2 resulted in complete loss of the enhanced intracellular survival phenotype. This gene was named the
enhanced intracellular survival (eis) gene. By using an internal region of eis as a probe for Southern analysis,
eis was found in the genomic DNA of various M. tuberculosis strains and of Mycobacterium bovis BCG but not
in that of M. smegmatis or 10 other nonpathogenic mycobacterial species. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacryl-
amide gel electrophoretic analysis showed that all M. smegmatis eis-containing constructs expressed a unique
protein of 42 kDa, the predicted size of Eis. The expression of this 42-kDa protein directly correlated to the
enhanced survival of M. smegmatis p69 in U-937 cells. These results suggest a possible role for eis and its
protein product in the intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an important human pathogen
responsible for 3.1 million deaths worldwide per year (9). Al-
though both virulent and avirulent mycobacteria are internal-
ized by monocytes and macrophages (35, 43), only pathogenic
mycobacteria survive and replicate intracellularly (28). M. tu-
berculosis is resistant to macrophage killing, and its survival
during phagocytosis and its subsequent multiplication within
these professional phagocytes are critical to its pathogenesis. A
variety of mechanisms have been suggested to contribute to the
survival of M. tuberculosis within macrophages (15, 39), includ-
ing inhibition of phagosome-lysosome fusion (2), inhibition of
the acidiﬁcation of phagosomes (41), resistance to killing by
reactive oxygen intermediates (26) and reactive nitrogen inter-
mediates (12, 27), and modiﬁcation of the lipid composition of
the mycobacterial cell membrane, thereby altering its capacity
to interact with immune or inﬂammatory cells (19). However,
little progress has been made in identifying the genes and their
corresponding products responsible for these properties. Be-
cause they represent potentially interesting targets for novel
drugs and vaccines, the identiﬁcation of the mycobacterial
products that promote intracellular survival remains a priority.
Recent development of genetic techniques applicable to
studying mycobacteria is advancing our understanding of how
mycobacteria survive in phagocytic cells (3, 7, 29, 31, 33).
Several groups have recently used Escherichia coli to express
M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae genes which may be
involved in entry and survival within mammalian cells (3, 22,
35, 36). However, because of the diverse genetic and structural
differences between mycobacteria and enterobacteria, E. coli
systems may be limited in the number of tuberculosis virulence
gene products which can be successfully expressed, processed,
and exported or transported to appropriate functional sites.
New vectors and methodologies for the transformation of
mycobacteria have been developed that allow for the study of
virulent mycobacterial genes in their homologous hosts. Myco-
bacterium smegmatis was selected for use in these studies be-
cause it grows rapidly in the laboratory, readily expresses genes
from other mycobacteria (20, 40, 44), and can be genetically
manipulated by various techniques (21). Numerous genes from
virulent mycobacteria have been expressed in M. smegmatis,
including the superoxide dismutase gene from M. tuberculosis
(46), genes for the production of glycopeptidolipid antigens
and the Mig protein from Mycobacterium avium (8, 34), a gene
expressing a 19-kDa glycosylated antigen from M. tuberculosis
(16), the noxR1 gene from M. tuberculosis (14), and the tr-trx
gene from M. leprae (44).
In the present study, the vector pOLYG was used to con-
struct a genomic plasmid library from the DNA of the virulent
M. tuberculosis strain H37Rv. The library was then introduced
into M. smegmatis. A human histocytic macrophage-like cell
line, U-937 (18, 42), was used for selecting transformants with
enhanced intracellular survival. U-937 cells may be converted
from a nonadherent, weakly phagocytic form to an adherent,
actively phagocytic state with phorbol esters and other agents.
This cell line has been widely used and accepted as a model
system for the study of macrophage interactions with a variety
of intracellular pathogens (10, 11, 22, 30, 32, 35, 45) (C. Ja-

gannath, E. Sepulveda, L. Srinivasan, R. M. Emanuele, and
R. L. Hunter, Abstr. 97th Gen. Meet. Am. Soc. Microbiol.,
abstr. U-97, p. 560, 1997). M. tuberculosis H37Rv replicates and
is not killed in U-937 cells (Jagannath et al., Abstr. 97th Gen.
Meet. Am. Soc. Microbiol.), while M. smegmatis does not mul-
tiply and is readily killed. By serial passage through U-937
cells, an M. smegmatis transformant clone that showed en-
hanced intracellular survival over M. smegmatis containing the
vector alone was isolated. Evidence that this enhanced intra-
cellular survival phenotype is due to an M. tuberculosis H37Rv
gene which we have named eis is presented.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains and growth media. M. smegmatis 1-2c, a derivative of strain mc26
selected for improved transformation efﬁciency (46), was grown in Middlebrook
7H9 broth (Difco) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol or plated on 7H10 agar
(Difco) with 0.2% glucose at 37°C. M. tuberculosis H37Rv was grown in Middle-
brook 7H9 broth as previously described (47). Hygromycin B at 50 mg/ml (Boehr-
inger Mannheim) was used in mycobacterial media to maintain the presence of
pOLYG. Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or agar with 200 mg of hygromycin B/ml or
100 mg of ampicillin/ml was used for growing E. coli transformants. Human
macrophage-like U-937 cells (ATCC 1593.2 CRL) were grown in RPMI 1640
medium (Sigma) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Atlanta Biologicals)
under 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Construction of an M. tuberculosis H37Rv genomic DNA library. Genomic
DNA was isolated from M. tuberculosis H37Rv as previously described (47).
Brieﬂy, fresh liquid cultures of H37Rv were inoculated with a 3-week starter
culture and then grown for 7 days before harvesting. M. tuberculosis H37Rv DNA
was partially digested with the restriction enzyme Sau3AI, and 4- to 12-kb
fragments were recovered after electrophoresis on a 0.7% agarose gel. DNA was
extracted from the gel and cloned into the BamHI site of the plasmid pOLYG
(17). The library was transformed into Max Efﬁciency E. coli DH5a (Gibco BRL)
competent cells, plated on LB agar containing 200 mg of hygromycin B/ml, and
incubated overnight at 37°C. Approximately 7,000 independent E. coli transfor-
mants were generated by using this plasmid library. Restriction analysis of plas-
mids isolated from E. coli transformants demonstrated that 81% had insert DNA
with an average size of 5.4 kb. The library pool was mixed in LB–30% glycerol,
and aliquots were frozen at 270°C. E. coli DH5a containing the M. tuberculosis
plasmid library was ampliﬁed by growth on LB plates, and plasmids were isolated
by following the Qiagen Maxi-plasmid puriﬁcation protocol. The isolated plas-
mid library DNA was then used to transform M. smegmatis.
Electroporation of M. smegmatis and E. coli. M. smegmatis 1-2c was trans-
formed via electroporation by the method of Snapper et al. (40). Electroporation
was performed with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Electrocompetent M. smegmatis
(0.4 ml) was pipetted into a 0.4-cm-gap-size cuvette with 1- to 10-mg aliquots of
plasmid DNA and electroporated at settings of 2.5 kV, 25 mF, and 1,000 V. To
analyze the recombinant clones, plasmid DNA was electroporated directly from
M. smegmatis transformants to E. coli cells. Electrocompetent E. coli DH5a cells
were prepared as previously described (4). Sixty microliters of E. coli cells was
pipetted into a 0.1-cm-gap-size cuvette containing 40 ml of transformed M.
smegmatis cells. Electroporation into E. coli was performed at settings of 2.5 kV,
25 mF, and 200 V.
Intracellular survival assay. The intracellular survival assay was devised by
modifying the procedure of Ramakrishnan and Falkow (35) developed for My-
cobacterium marinum and the mouse macrophage-like cell line J-774. Suspension
cultures of U-937 cells were grown in RPMI 1640–10% FCS medium in 75-cm2
tissue culture ﬂasks for 3 days before overnight treatment with 0.4 mg of phorbol
12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma)/ml to transform U-937 into an adherent
state. PMA-containing supernatants were removed the next day, and the adher-
ent cells were washed with Hanks’ Ca21- and Mg21-free balanced salt solution
(HBSS). Adherent U-937 cells were released by gentle rocking with 3-mm-
diameter glass beads. Released cells were recovered by centrifugation, washed in
HBSS, quantitated with a hemocytometer, and diluted in RPMI 1640–10% FCS
medium to a density of 2 3 105 cells per ml. U-937 cells (1 ml/well) were plated
into each well of 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar) and incubated overnight
under 5% CO2 at 37°C.
Cultures of M. smegmatis 1-2c containing the M. tuberculosis plasmid library
were grown on 7H10 agar plates with 50 mg of hygromycin B/ml for 3 to 4 days.
Inocula were prepared by swabbing the plate growth into HBSS, sedimenting the
mycobacteria at 1,300 3 g for 10 min, resuspending in HBSS, vortexing for 30 s,
and centrifuging again at 250 3 g for 5 min. This yielded a supernatant consisting
almost entirely of single mycobacterial cells, as observed by phase-contrast mi-
croscopy. On the assumption that an optical density at 650 nm (OD650) of 0.1
equals 108 CFU per ml, the inoculum was diluted to a density of 2 3 106 CFU
per ml in RPMI 1640–10% FCS containing 2.5% fresh human serum (Omega
Scientiﬁc). U-937 cells resemble human mononuclear phagocytes (38) in that
phagocytosis of mycobacteria is greatly augmented in the presence of fresh
human serum (complement component C3). Aliquots of the inocula were rou-
tinely plated on 7H10 plates containing hygromycin B for CFU determinations
(see below) to conﬁrm that equivalent bacterial inocula were used in all exper-
iments. After 20 min of opsonization at room temperature, 1 ml of inoculum was
added to each well containing 2 3 105 U-937 cells to give a multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 10. At this MOI, no cytotoxicity was observed. The 24-well
plates were incubated for 2 h at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Acid-fast staining
showed that after 2 h of incubation approximately half of the U-937 cells con-
tained at least one M. smegmatis organism. The infected monolayers were then
washed once with warm HBSS and treated with RPMI 1640–10% FCS contain-
ing 200 mg of amikacin per ml for 1 h at 37°C to kill extracellular organisms. The
monolayers were washed again with HBSS, and those monolayers in which
survival for 24 and 48 h was to be measured were incubated in medium contain-
ing 20 mg of amikacin/ml to prevent extracellular growth of any bacteria that
might be released by premature lysis of infected U-937 cells. Cells in duplicate
wells were lysed at 3, 24, and 48 h postinfection by adding 1 ml of water, waiting
for 30 min, and vigorously pipetting ﬁve times to ensure cell lysis and the release
of surviving intracellular bacteria. The lysates were serially diluted in 7H9 broth
and plated onto 7H10 agar plates containing hygromycin B. CFU were counted
after incubation at 37°C for 3 days. M. smegmatis(pOLYG) was included in every
assay as a negative control. Clones that were recovered on plates at 24 and 48 h
in each passage were pooled and passed through the U-937 survival assay for the
next passage. A total of 6 passages were carried out to enrich for recombinant M.
smegmatis with increased capacity for intracellular survival. After each step in the
passage, bacterial pools were frozen at 270°C for further analysis.
Transmission electron microscopy. U-937 cell monolayers were prepared in
24-well tissue culture plates as described for the intracellular survival assay and
infected with M. smegmatis(p69) at an MOI of 50. This higher MOI was used to
assist in the observation of M. smegmatis(p69) in the transmission electron
microscopy preparations. At 3 and 24 h after infection, monolayers were washed
and ﬁxed for 1 h at room temperature in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2)
containing 2% glutaraldehyde. Cells from ﬁxed monolayers were then released
into suspension by use of a rubber policeman. Specimens were postﬁxed in 2%
osmium tetroxide, dehydrated via graded alcohol steps, and embedded in Spurr
low-viscosity resin. Sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate,
and viewed on a Philips CM12 transmission electron microscope.
Recombinant DNA techniques. Standard techniques were used for plasmid
isolation, endonuclease restrictions, DNA modiﬁcations, ligations, and plasmid
transformations (37). Restriction endonucleases and other enzymes were used as
recommended by the suppliers (Life Technologies and New England Biolabs).
Construction of eis deletion derivatives. The DNA insert of p69 was released
from pOLYG by digestion with BamHI and cut in the middle of open reading
frame 2 (ORF2) by digestion with SphI. The resulting 1.3- and 1.7-kb fragments
were ligated into BamHI-SphI-digested pUC18 to yield the subclones p62-8 and
p62-16, respectively. The 1.3-kb BamHI-HindIII fragment from p62-8 was cloned
into BamHI-HindIII-digested pOLYG to obtain p69-8. The 1.7-kb BamHI-HindIII
fragment from p62-16 was then cloned into BamHI-HindIII-digested pOLYG to
obtain p69-16. p62-97 was created by digestion of p69 with ApoI and PvuI. The
PvuI site was ﬁlled in with DNA polymerase. This 1.6-kb ApoI-PvuI fragment
carrying only ORF2 and its putative promoter region was isolated and subcloned
into EcoRI-SmaI-digested pSP72 (Promega). p69-97 was constructed by insert-
ing the 1.6-kb EcoRV-HindIII fragment from p62-97 into EcoRV-HindIII-digested
pOLYG. p69-96 was made by inserting the 1.6-kb ClaI-HindIII fragment from
p62-97 into ClaI-HindIII-digested pOLYG. The transcriptional orientation of
p69-96 is opposite that of p69-97. ORF2 was disrupted by removing an internal
367-bp ApaI fragment from p69-96, creating p69-96A, which is an in-frame
deletion. All p69 derivatives and p69 itself were then retransformed into M.
smegmatis cells for use in the intracellular survival assay.
Nucleotide sequence data analysis. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA
insert of p69 was determined with a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems model
373A) at the Laboratory of Molecular Systematics and Evolution, University of
Arizona. Computation was performed by using the Genetics Computer Group
sequence analysis software package (version 10, University of Wisconsin, Bio-
technology Center) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information
BLAST (1) network service.
PCR analysis for enrichment of p69 after serial passages through U-937 cells.
Fifty isolates each from the third, fourth, ﬁfth, and sixth rounds of M. smegmatis
transformant passage in U-937 cells were analyzed for the presence of eis by
using PCR ampliﬁcation. After 5 days of growth on 7H10 agar containing 50 mg
of hygromycin B/ml, individual colonies were picked and boiled in 50-ml aliquots
of H2O for 15 min, and then 5-ml aliquots of the lysed cells were added to
separate 50-ml PCR mixtures containing 13 PCR buffer (Gibco BRL), 5 mM
MgCl2, 0.6 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphates, 4 mM each oligonucleotide
primer (69.4F, 59-GGATCCGTCAGACCCACCGAGCAT-39, and 69.8R, 59-C
GGATCCCCATCCATGGCGTGT-39; Gibco BRL), and 2.5 U of Taq DNA
polymerase (Gibco BRL). Thermocycling reactions were performed in a Perkin-
Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400 with the following parameters: an initial
denaturing at 94°C for 2 min, a ﬁnal additional extension at 72°C for 2 min, and
30 cycles of 94°C for 1.5 min, 56°C for 1.5 min, and 72°C for 1.5 min. For each
set of reactions, pOLYG and p69 were included as negative and positive controls,
respectively. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel
with an eis-speciﬁc product expected to be 824 bp in length.

Southern hybridization. For isolation of genomic DNA of M. smegmatis, the
procedure of Jacobs et al. (21) was followed. Genomic DNA of M. tuberculosis
Erdman, M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. tuberculosis H37Ra, and M. bovis BCG was
kindly supplied by John T. Belisle of Colorado State University. These materials
were provided through the National Institutes of Health (NIH, Rockville, Md.)
contract entitled “Tuberculosis research materials and vaccine testing.” Genomic
DNA preparations isolated from M. abscessus, M. aurum, M. avium, M. peregri-
num, M. phlei, M. triviale, M. vaccae, M. chelonae, M. fortuitum, and M. gordonae
were received as a kind gift from Benjamin Schroeder and Clifton Barry III
(NIH).
The DNA probe for Southern hybridization was prepared by using a PCR DIG
Probe Synthesis Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). PCRs to generate a digoxigenin
(DIG)-labeled probe included plasmid p69 as template DNA and primers 69.4F
and 69.8R (described above). The reaction proﬁle was identical to that used in
PCR analysis of M. smegmatis transformant pools for the presence of eis. Sam-
ples of genomic DNA (5 mg) were digested with PstI, and the resulting fragments
were separated on a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a GeneScreen Plus
membrane (NEN Research Products) by standard methods (37). Southern blots
were prepared as previously described (6). DIG-labeled fragments were detected
according to the manufacturer’s directions by using the DIG DNA Labeling and
Detection Kit (Boehringer Mannheim).
SDS-PAGE analysis of M. smegmatis transformants containing derivatives of
eis. M. smegmatis transformants containing pOLYG, p69, p69-16, p69-8, p69-97,
p69-96, and p69-96A were grown on Middlebrook 7H10 agar with 0.2% glucose
and 50 mg of hygromycin B/ml for 3 to 4 days at 37°C before harvesting. Cells
were swabbed into HBSS and pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 3 g for 10 min.
Pelleted cells were resuspended in an equal volume of HBSS. One-milliliter
aliquots of these cell suspensions were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes
containing 0.25 g of 0.1- to 0.15-mm-diameter glass beads (Biospec Products,
Bartlesville, Okla.). Cells were vortexed with glass beads for 30 min at room
temperature by using a Vortex-Genie Turbomix device (Fisher Scientiﬁc). This
procedure resulted in a 96% loss of cell viability, as determined by viable plate
counts. After vortexing, the glass beads were allowed to settle before the super-
natant was transferred. Protein concentrations of various lysates were deter-
mined by using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS)-loading dye was mixed with 140-mg protein samples and boiled for 10 min
before samples were loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) gel (12% polyacrylamide) with a 4% stacking gel (24). Samples were
electrophoresed for 4 to 5 h at 200 V and 100 mA. Gels were stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue and photographed by using an Alpha Imager 2000
Documentation and Analysis System (Alpha Innotech Corporation).
Statistical analysis of data. Results of assays for intracellular survival are

RESULTS
Selection of M. smegmatis transformed with M. tuberculosis
H37Rv DNA for enhanced survival in U-937 cells. To enrich
for recombinants with increased ability for intracellular sur-
vival, M. smegmatis transformants containing the M. tubercu-
losis H37Rv DNA plasmid library were used to infect mono-
layers of U-937 as described in Materials and Methods. One
hundred twenty independent clones randomly selected from
the 3rd passage were screened individually in the intracellular
survival assay to look for individual M. smegmatis recombinants
with enhanced survival compared to M. smegmatis containing
only the vector pOLYG. Twenty-one of the recombinants
showed $2-fold-increased survival 48 h after infection (data
not shown). One clone (p69) demonstrated signiﬁcantly en-
hanced survival, ranging from 2.4- to 5.3-fold at 24 and 48 h
after infection, respectively (Fig. 1), and was further charac-
terized.
Electron microscopy was performed to conﬁrm that M.
smegmatis(p69) had indeed been internalized by U-937 cells
and was present intracellularly. Figure 2 shows typical obser-
vations of intracellular M. smegmatis(p69) in the cytoplasm of
U-937 cells. At 3 h postinfection, numerous M. smegmatis ba-
cilli were present in the cytoplasm of U-937 cells either in
tightly ﬁtting phagosomes (Fig. 2A) or in more spacious phago-
somes (Fig. 2B). The mycobacteria were also seen within
phagosomes and not free in the cytoplasm. Similar electron
micrographs were obtained at 24 h after infection (data not
shown). These electron micrographs of M. smegmatis in U-937
cells are comparable to those of M. smegmatis in human mono-
nuclear phagocytes (5).
The shuttle vector pOLYG is a multicopy, hygromycin B-
resistant plasmid (17). Since hygromycin B was not present
during serial passages and assays for survival in U-937 cells, it
was necessary to verify that antibiotic selection pressure is not
required to maintain the plasmid library in M. smegmatis.
When infected monolayer lysates from different passages were
plated on 7H10 agar plates with or without hygromycin B,
equivalent numbers of CFU were recovered (data not shown).
This demonstrates that hygromycin B is not required for main-
tenance of the genomic plasmid library in M. smegmatis during
passage in the U-937 cells.
In the survival assay, amikacin (200 mg/ml) is used initially to
kill uningested extracellular M. smegmatis. Following this 1-h
treatment, 20 mg of amikacin/ml is present to prevent bacterial
replication in the tissue culture medium. Theoretically, it might
be possible to select for amikacin-resistant mutants in the
survival assay. To clarify this, the MICs of amikacin were
determined for M. smegmatis(pOLYG) and M. smegmatis(p69)
recovered after passage in the survival assay and for unpassed
M. smegmatis transformed with each vector. In both passaged
and freshly transformed M. smegmatis(pOLYG) and M. smeg-
matis(p69), the MIC was 0.3 mg/ml. Thus, M. smegmatis(p69)
has no increased resistance to amikacin.
We also sought evidence that amikacin kills extracellular
microbes only and does not inhibit the intracellular survival of
M. smegmatis. If the levels of amikacin used in the survival
assay do indeed kill ingested M. smegmatis, then doubling the
exposure of U-937 cells to the antibiotic should reduce intra-
cellular survival. U-937 cells were pretreated with amikacin at
20 mg/ml for 48 h and then at 200 mg/ml for 1 h prior to
infection with M. smegmatis(pOLYG) and M. smegmatis(p69)
in the survival assay. A comparable population of U-937 cells
not pretreated with the antibiotic was also infected with the
same inocula, and the survival of the four sets of M. smegmatis-
infected U-937 cells was then compared in the customary as-
say. Equivalent numbers of M. smegmatis transformants were
recovered in both the amikacin-pretreated (two rounds of ami-
kacin exposure) and non-pretreated (one round of amikacin

exposure) groups at 3, 24, and 48 h after infection. Therefore,
amikacin is not signiﬁcantly internalized into U-937 cells to
levels that interfere with the intracellular survival of M. smeg-
matis.
Restriction digestion and sequence analysis of p69. To fa-
cilitate analysis of p69, the plasmid was directly transformed by
electroporation from M. smegmatis into E. coli DH5a cells.
Restriction mapping indicated that p69 contained a 2.99-kb
DNA insert. The p69 insert was sequenced and analyzed. The
insert DNA was GC rich (68% G1C) and was identical to a
nucleotide sequence found in the M. tuberculosis genome da-
tabase (13). This is a 9-kb region in which none of the potential
ORFs has a known function. Nucleotide sequencing revealed
the presence of three potential ORFs designated ORF1,
ORF2, and ORF3s in the insert (Fig. 3). These ORFs corre-
spond to the hypothetical genes Rv2417c, Rv2416c, and Rv2415c,
respectively, in the M. tuberculosis genome (13). The deduced
amino acid sequences of the three ORFs were used in searches
of the GenBank/EMBL and SWISSPROT databases with the
BLAST and FASTA programs. Some homology (34% identity)
was found between ORF2 and a hypothetical 45-kDa protein
(orf5), of unknown function, downstream from the amfC gene
of Streptomyces griseus, which is involved in aerial mycelium
formation in this microbe (23). Only one of the three ORFs
encoded on the p69 insert, ORF2, contains both a putative
promoter region and a ribosome binding site (Fig. 3 and 4).
These results suggest that ORF2 of p69 is likely to be the gene
which confers the enhanced intracellular survival phenotype on
M. smegmatis. ORF2 can potentially express a 42.2-kDa pro-
tein (387 amino acids).
Subcloning and deletion analysis of ORF2. Deletion analysis
of the p69 insert DNA was carried out to verify that intact
ORF2 is indeed essential for the enhanced intracellular sur-
vival phenotype observed in M. smegmatis(p69) (Fig. 3). Plas-
mid p69-8 contains a complete ORF1 and the 59 half of ORF2,
while plasmid p69-16 contains the 39 half of ORF2 and an
intact ORF3. Both plasmids p69-96 and p69-97 contain a
1.6-kb ApoI-PvuI fragment with the intact ORF2 and its puta-
tive promoter region, but in opposite orientations. Plasmid
p69-96A is an in-frame deletion of p69-96, in which ORF2 has
been disrupted by removal of the 367-bp ApaI fragment. These
deletion constructs were electrotransformed into M. smegmatis
and compared in the intracellular survival assay with p69 and
pOLYG as controls (Fig. 5). M. smegmatis transformants with
p69-8, p69-16, and p69-96A all contain a disrupted ORF2 and
survived no better than pOLYG transformants. M. smegmatis
containing p69-96 and p69-97 had levels of intracellular sur-
vival comparable to that of p69 and signiﬁcantly higher than
that of pOLYG (P , 0.001). The activity of ORF2 in either
orientation provides evidence that ORF2 can be expressed
from its own promoter. These results conﬁrm that the M.
tuberculosis gene ORF2 is directly responsible for the en-
hanced intracellular phenotype associated with p69 in M. smeg-
matis. Therefore, ORF2 was named the enhanced intracellular
survival (eis) gene.
Efﬁciency of selection of eis-bearing transformants by U-937
cells. With the identiﬁcation of eis, it became possible to mea-
sure its rate of selection during serial passages in U-937 cells.
Ten independent clones were selected at random from the 3rd
to 6th passages of the M. smegmatis transformant pools. Plas-
mids from these clones were isolated and characterized by
digestion with BamHI and SmaI to determine the percentage
with the same restriction digest patterns as p69. In addition, 50
independent clones were randomly selected from each of these
same passages and two eis-speciﬁc oligonucleotide primers
(Fig. 3) were used in PCR analysis for the presence of the eis
gene in each clone. Results showed that the eis-bearing trans-
formants, undetectable in the 3rd passage, were enriched by
the 6th passage to 70 or 88% of the transformant pool, as
determined by restriction digestion or PCR analysis, respec-
tively (Fig. 6). Similar results were obtained in a second inde-
pendent series of passages of the recombinant library in the
U-937 survival assay.
There is a possible alternative explanation for the enrich-
ment of eis-bearing transformants during library passage in
U-937 cells. It may be that eis-bearing transformants grew
faster in the medium used to prepare the inocula for each
round of selection in U-937 cells. However, the growth curves
of M. smegmatis, M. smegmatis(pOLYG), and M. smegma-
tis(p69) in 7H9 medium were found to be indistinguishable

(data not shown). Therefore, these results show that the intra-
cellular survival assay efﬁciently enriches for the transformants
with enhanced survival phenotypes and that eis confers a real
survival advantage on M. smegmatis containing this gene.
Demonstration of eis only in M. tuberculosis and M. bovis
BCG. If eis contributes to the survival of M. tuberculosis in
macrophages, it might be present in pathogenic species but
absent in nonpathogenic species. The genomic DNAs of a
number of mycobacterial species were examined by Southern
analysis using a PCR-generated DIG-labeled probe to detect
the presence of eis (Fig. 7). The eis gene was identiﬁed as a
12-kb band present only in M. tuberculosis H37Rv, H37Ra, and
Erdman and in M. bovis BCG. None of the nonpathogenic
mycobacterial species tested, including M. smegmatis, hybrid-
ized with the DIG-labeled eis probe. These results demonstrate
that eis occurs only in pathogenic mycobacteria and their lab-
oratory-produced derivatives.
Identiﬁcation of the putative gene product of eis. To assay
for the presence of an eis gene product, M. smegmatis trans-
formants containing vector alone, p69, or deletion derivatives
of p69 were lysed by vortexing with glass beads. Proteins from
the various cell lysates were separated on a 12% SDS–PAGE
gel. Figure 8 shows that in the presence of an intact eis gene
(p69, p69-97, and p69-96), there is a unique Coomassie blue-
stained band corresponding to a protein matching the pre-
dicted size of Eis (42 kDa). This protein band is not present in
M. smegmatis transformants containing eis gene deletion con-
structs (p69-16, p69-8, and p69-96A). Therefore, the appear-
ance of this 42-kDa protein directly correlates with enhanced
intracellular survival of the various transformants containing
an intact eis gene (compare Fig. 5 and 8).
DISCUSSION
Previous workers have used similar approaches to look for
genes of M. tuberculosis needed for survival in macrophages.
Arruda et al. cloned DNA from avirulent M. tuberculosis
H37Ra and isolated the mce gene, which augmented the ability
of E. coli to enter and survive in nonphagocytic HeLa cells (3).
Mundayoor and Shinnick (29) passed recombinant DNA li-
braries of M. leprae in E. coli through a mouse macrophage-like
cell line to enrich for clones with increased survival in those
host cells. Using pOLYG as a cloning vector, Wieles et al. (44)
cloned the thioredoxin-thioredoxin reductase gene of M. leprae
into M. smegmatis and showed that the transformant was less
rapidly killed by human mononuclear phagocytes than M.
smegmatis with pOLYG alone.
In the present study, the human macrophage-like cell line
U-937 was used to show that a clone of avirulent M. smegmatis
transformed with DNA from the virulent M. tuberculosis strain
H37Rv exhibited signiﬁcantly enhanced intracellular survival
for at least 48 h. Evidence indicates that the prolonged survival
of this clone (p69) in U-937 cells resulted from the presence of
a M. tuberculosis gene we have designated eis and that disrup-
tion of this gene was followed by loss of the enhanced intra-
cellular survival phenotype.
Identiﬁcation of eis using M. smegmatis and U-937 cells
suggests the potential of this system for identifying additional
genes contributing to the survival of virulent mycobacteria in
macrophages. Of the 21 clones isolated from the 3rd passage of
M. smegmatis transformants in U-937 cells, only p69 has been
characterized in detail. The restriction patterns of many of the
remaining 20 clones are not the same as that of p69, which
suggests that further investigation may lead to identiﬁcation of
additional genes contributing to the intracellular survival of
mycobacteria. A limitation of this system is the size of the
H37Rv DNA insert used in this library, 5.4 kb on average. This
effectively limits the probability of ﬁnding more than one gene
of interest in a single DNA insert. It is possible that cosmid
libraries of M. tuberculosis DNA, with insert sizes of up to 40
kb, may be used to identify virulence factors that require the
concerted action of several separate genes or the presence of
an entire operon.
Still unanswered is the question of how the eis product acts
to prolong the survival of M. smegmatis, and perhaps ultimately
that of M. tuberculosis, in macrophages. Numerous mycobac-
terial activities must be required for long-term survival of these

organisms in human phagocytes. These include housekeeping
activities necessary for intracellular growth and survival, activ-
ities needed to defend the mycobacteria against stressful con-
ditions, and activities speciﬁcally evolved to promote entry,
proliferation, and latency in host cells (25). The ﬁnding that eis
is present only in virulent mycobacteria or their laboratory-
generated derivatives and not in M. smegmatis and numerous
other nonpathogenic mycobacteria argues against eis being a
mere housekeeping gene.
A 42-kDa protein has been identiﬁed as the putative eis gene
product, Eis. Two lines of evidence support this conclusion.
First, the unique size of the protein matches the size predicted
for an eis gene protein product. Second, the appearance of the
42-kDa protein in M. smegmatis transformants containing an
intact eis gene directly correlates with the enhanced intracel-
lular phenotype conferred by the gene in M. smegmatis. Ex-
ploratory studies suggest that Eis expressed in M. smegmatis is
surface located. Such a location suggests participation of the
Eis protein in the interactions between the surfaces of myco-
bacteria and the membranes of host cells, either in entry or
during the subsequent sojourn of the mycobacteria in phago-
somes. Studies are currently in progress to demonstrate that
Eis is expressed in M. tuberculosis and to determine its cellular
location in the pathogen.
The increased survival in U-937 cells conferred on M. smeg-
matis by the presence of the eis gene is modest but still signif-
icant, considering that it is the result of introducing a single

gene from a highly pathogenic bacterium into a nonpathogenic
relative. Since the survival-enhancing effect of eis may depend
on its overexpression in the multicopy vector pOLYG, it will be
necessary to see if eis placed in a single-copy chromosomal
location still enhances M. smegmatis intracellular survival. To
examine if eis also prolongs the survival of virulent M. tuber-
culosis H37Rv, eis deletion mutants of this organism must be
studied in human macrophages and in animal models.
