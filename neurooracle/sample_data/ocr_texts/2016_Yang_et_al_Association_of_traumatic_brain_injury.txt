Background: We evaluated the risk of attention-deﬁcit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) following childhood traumatic 
brain injury (TBI).
Methods: Using Taiwan’s National Health Insurance 
Research Database, we included 10,416 newly diagnosed TBI 
children (aged ≤12 y) between 2001 and 2002 and 41,664 chil-
dren without TBI, who were frequency matched by sex, age, 
and year of the index medical service with each TBI child, as 
controls. Children who had been diagnosed with ADHD prior 
to their medical service index were excluded. Each individual 
was followed for 9 y to identify ADHD diagnosis. We also com-
pared the ADHD risk in children who were treated for fractures 
but not TBI as sensitivity analysis.
Results: During the 9-y follow-up period, children with TBI 
had a higher ADHD risk (adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) = 1.32, 95% 
conﬁdence interval (CI) = 1.19, 1.45) than did those without 
TBI. Furthermore, children with mild and severe TBI had higher 
AHRs for ADHD than did those without TBI (AHR = 1.30; 95% 
CI = 1.10, 1.53; and AHR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.22, 1.55). However, 
no signiﬁcant association was observed between fractures and 
ADHD.
Conclusion: TBI in childhood is associated with a greater 
likelihood of developing ADHD.
T
raumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death 
and disability in children and ofen results in persistent 
behavioral disturbances and neurocognitive deﬁcits in atten-
tion, learning, and memory (1–3). Children with cognitive 
impairment following TBI impose a great economic and social 
burden on their families and communities. In addition, these 
children are more likely to have slower psychosocial develop-
ment and exhibit poor academic achievement. Terefore, the 
relationship between TBI and neuropsychiatric consequences 
has become a crucial research topic.
Attention-deﬁcit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a neu-
rodevelopmental disorder, is associated with impulsivity, 
excessive talking, diﬃculty in sustaining attention, being easily 
distracted, and injuries (4–6). Studies have reported a relation-
ship between ADHD and childhood TBI (7–10). Unlike other 
diseases resulting from various pathogenic mechanisms, TBI is 
caused by a complex interplay among damages occurring in the 
neuroanatomy, neurochemistry, and neurophysiology because 
of primary and secondary processes (11). A ­meta-analytic 
review showed that neurocognitive outcomes afer pediatric 
TBI have a dose-response relationship with injury severity. 
Babikian and colleagues found that patients with severe TBI 
exhibited poorer performance in intelligence quotient tests, 
executive functioning, processing speed, attention main-
tenance, verbal immediate memory, and delayed memory, 
whereas patients with mild TBI exhibited no change (12). In 
addition, several studies have suggested that children with 
moderate to severe TBI are signiﬁcantly more likely to develop 
ADHD symptoms than are those with mild TBI (8,13–17). 
A longitudinal birth cohort study reported no association 
between preschool mild TBI and ADHD afer adjusting for 
potential covariates (18). Nevertheless, a prospective cohort 
study reported that children with mild TBI have a higher risk 
of hyperactivity in the ﬁrst year afer injury (19). Nevertheless, 
a prospective cohort study reported children with mild TBI 
were associated higher risk for hyperactivity in the ﬁrst year 
afer injury (20). However, the restricted sample size and rela-
tively brief follow-up period may cause diﬃculty in general-
izing results and reﬂecting the true incidence. Terefore, the 
relationship between TBI and ADHD remains controversial 
in children. Using a nationwide population-based longitudi-
nal study and including an injury severity range from mild to 
severe would facilitate clarifying the relationship between TBI 
and ADHD and developing a more satisfactory care procedure 
for children with TBI.
Earlier studies have shown that children diagnosed or pre-
diagnosed with ADHD are more likely to have suﬀered from 
injuries including TBI, fractures, or burns (21,22). In this 
study, we evaluated the relationship between TBI and ADHD

TBI in childhood and ADHD         Articles
through sensitivity analysis to compare the ADHD risk in 
children receiving index treatment for fractures but not TBI. 
We conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study 
by using a nationwide population-based data set to examine 
the long-term ADHD risk in children afer TBI or fractures. 
Furthermore, we predicted the cause-speciﬁc risk of post-TBI 
ADHD among diﬀerent TBI patterns on the basis of clinical 
characteristics. Te ﬁndings may facilitate developing an inte-
grated healthcare strategy for children with TBI.
RESULTS
Te distribution of sociodemographic characteristics for chil-
dren with and without TBI is shown in Table 1. Of 52,080 
children aged ≤12 y enrolled between 2001 and 2002, 10,416 
children newly diagnosed with TBI were included as cases and 
41,664 children without TBI as controls. Te mean age of the 
52,080 children was 5 y and 7 mo (SD = 3 y and 4 mo), and 60.9% 
of them were male. Afer the cases and controls were matched 
by age and sex, the children with TBI were signiﬁcantly more 
likely to have self-employed (farmer, crafsman, and ﬁsher) 
parents (P < 0.001) and reside in less urbanized areas (P < 
0.001) compared with the children without TBI. For sensitivity 
analysis, we included 2,179 children who received treatment 
for fractures but not TBI between 2001 and 2002 in the frac-
ture group as cases and 8,716 children without fractures or TBI 
in the nonfracture group as controls (Supplementary Table S1 
online). No diﬀerences were observed in urbanization level 
and parental occupation between the fracture and nonfracture 
groups.
Table 2 shows crude and covariate-adjusted hazard ratios 
(HRs) and their 95% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for children 
who developed ADHD during the 9-y follow-up period. 
Compared with the children without TBI, those with TBI had 
a signiﬁcantly higher incidence of ADHD (5.42 vs. 4.01%) dur-
ing the 9-y period following their medical service index use. 
HRs were calculated afer excluding children who had previ-
ous history of preterm births, congenital anomaly, mental ill-
ness, epilepsy or cerebral palsy. Conditional Cox proportional 
hazard regression analysis revealed that TBI was signiﬁcantly 
associated with ADHD (adjusted HR (AHR) = 1.24, 95% CI 
=  1.14, 1.37). Afer adjustment for children’s age, parental 
occupation, and urbanization level, the results showed that TBI 
was signiﬁcantly associated with ADHD (AHR = 1.32, 95% CI 
= 1.19, 1.45). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis revealed that 
the ADHD incidence did not diﬀer between the children with 
fractures and those without fractures (2.89 vs. 2.96%), and 
no signiﬁcant association was observed between fracture and 
ADHD (AHR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.77, 1.37) (Supplementary 
Table S2 online).
Te median time for children diagnosed with ADHD ­during 
the follow-up period to develop ADHD afer their medical ser-
vice index use was 4 y and 8 mo (4 y and 7 mo; 4 y and 9 mo 
for children with TBI and those without TBI, respectively). 
Te log-rank test showed that the children with TBI had a sig-
niﬁcantly higher 9-y cumulative ADHD incidence (P < 0.001) 
than did those without TBI. Te 9-y cumulative incidence 
curve is shown in Figure 1.
Te AHRs for ADHD for subgroups stratiﬁed by age, sex, 
types of brain injury, and subtypes of severe brain injury are 
presented in Table 3. Afer adjustment for age, parental occu-
pation, and urbanization level, conditional Cox proportional 
hazard regression analysis showed that children with TBI 
onset age, at aged ≤4 and 5–8 y were signiﬁcantly associated 
with a higher risk of ADHD compared with those without 
TBI (AHR = 1.39, 95% CI =1.23, 1.58; AHR = 1.23, 95% CI 
= 1.03, 1.48, respectively). Boys and girls with TBI showed 
a signiﬁcantly increased ADHD risk compared with that in 
the children without TBI (AHR = 1.32, 95% CI = 1.18, 1.47; 
AHR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.65, respectively). Children with

mild and severe TBI had 1.30-fold (95% CI = 1.10, 1.53) and 
1.37-fold (95% CI = 1.22, 1.55) increased ADHD risks during 
the 9-y follow-up period compared with that of the children 
without TBI, respectively. However, children with skull bone 
fractures showed no signiﬁcant increase in the ADHD risk 
compared with that in the children without TBI. Furthermore, 
according to types of severe brain injury, the ADHD risk was 
signiﬁcantly increased in children with brain contusion or sub-
dural haemorrhage (SDH) (AHR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.22, 2.13; 
AHR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.72, respectively) afer adjustment 
for age, parental occupation, and urbanization level. However, 
sensitivity analysis showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in the HRs 
for ADHD between the fracture and nonfracture groups strati-
ﬁed by age, sex, afer adjustment for parental occupation, and 
urbanization level (Supplementary Table S3 online).
DISCUSSION
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study comprehen-
sively describing an association between TBI and ADHD on 
the basis of large-scale investigation and by considering clini-
cal characteristics of patients in Asia. Afer adjusting for chil-
dren’s parental occupation and their residential communities’ 
urbanization level, we observed that children with TBI had a 
higher ADHD risk than did those without TBI during the 9-y 
follow-up period. In addition, we observed that children with 
mild TBI and brain contusion on arrival at the hospital were 
more likely to develop ADHD than those who did not have a 
brain injury.
Findings from earlier studies are in accordance with those 
of our study. Allen et al. reported that TBI results in unique 
patterns of neurocognitive impairment, such as deﬁcient in 
memory and attention abilities (23). Keenan et al. observed a 
signiﬁcant relative risk of 1.9 compared with healthy controls, 
but they did not distinguish between mild and severe TBI (24).

TBI in childhood and ADHD         Articles
However, two recent longitudinal investigations conducted in 
New Zealand and Germany, respectively, concluded that TBI 
is not likely to cause neurocognitive impairment in children 
and adolescent (18,19). Te discrepancy between our study 
and these two investigations may be explained by diﬀerences 
in study designs and the environmental characteristics of the 
target populations. Te relatively small sample populations 
in these two studies were obtained from only a few hospitals 
and study centers. In contrast, our study focused on evaluating 
the ADHD risk in children with TBI in a large population in 
Taiwan, thus preventing the selection bias inherent in volun-
tary registration and hospital referral systems.
Te characteristics of ADHD include impairment in atten-
tion, hyperactivity, inappropriate motor activity, and disrup-
tive behavior that is inappropriate for the person’s age. Our 
observation that ADHD frequency was higher in the children 
with TBI in the age group of 0–8 y than that in the age group of 
9–12 y suggests a preinjury condition of ADHD, which might 
have not yet been formally diagnosed. In contrast, children 
aged 9–12 y were more likely to have been diagnosed with 
ADHD if they developed the condition. Although a delayed 
diagnosis of ADHD among children with TBI may confound 
the relationship between TBI and ADHD, our sensitivity anal-
ysis showed no signiﬁcant ADHD risk in children with frac-
tures. In addition, the cumulative incidence rate of ADHD 
among the children with TBI was consistently higher than that 
in the children without TBI during the follow-up period. Our 
ﬁndings strengthen the evidence that TBI is an independent 
risk factor for ADHD.
Our ﬁndings have valuable clinical implications for man-
aging children with mild TBI and brain contusion. Intensive 
medical monitoring, support, and intervention are mostly 
required in the ﬁrst year following a TBI event because the 
risk of developing neurocognitive disorders increases most 
rapidly in this period. Early detection of neurocognitive disor-
ders helps children attain their full potential and prevents poor 
academic performance (25). Awareness of factors that lead to 
neurocognitive disorders and early signs or symptoms of neu-
rocognitive disorders should be created in families, which have 
children with TBI through health education and interventions. 
Inquiry into the history of TBI in children with potential 
ADHD symptoms seeking medical assistance and consulta-
tion can help psychiatrists and clinical psychologists identify 
the high-risk group. Te long-term surveillance of children 
with mild TBI and brain contusion for potential symptoms of 
ADHD would be helpful for early detection. Tese ﬁndings 
could provide clinicians to identify potential risk factors relat-
ing to ADHD.
Using a large database has both limitations and strengths. Te 
strengths of our study include the use of a data set that is based 
on a nationwide population and enabled us to follow up chil-
dren with and without TBI over a long time period. Te com-
prehensive coverage of the National Health Insurance (NHI) 
system and the large sample size minimized the selection and 
nonresponse biases and enabled us to make reasonable esti-
mates of the eﬀects of TBI on neurodevelopmental outcomes. 
Diagnoses are validated by the National Health Insurance 
Administration (NHIA) in Taiwan. Te NHIA requires that 
every hospital provide a ﬁxed percentage of claims record from 
random samples to validate and preserve the quality of diagno-
ses. In addition, the high validity of TBI and ADHD diagnoses 
was conﬁrmed by board-certiﬁed psychiatrists or physicians; 
however, some heterogeneity may have occurred in the assess-
ment because of the absence of standardized instruments for 
diagnosis.
Te study is subject to some limitations. First, a limitation 
imposed by the data set is the lack of details about parental and 
family factors (family functioning, maternal psychological dis-
tress, and social support) as well as biological factors (prema-
ture birth, birth weight, and genetic mutations). Terefore, we 
did not consider these factors in our research. Te unavailabil-
ity of these unmeasured confounders might have biased our 
results. Additionally, parents might pay more attention to their 
child who had TBI history than those without TBI exposure 
and bring their child to a physician when they suspect ADHD 
symptoms. Also, neurologists may have higher possibility to 
make a diagnosis when the child has TBI history. Although 
the diagnosis of ADHD follows the principle of clinical guide-
lines in Taiwan, the diﬀerential surveillance may inﬂate the 
ADHD risk and thus would be subject to some information 
bias. Second, although several TBI studies have reported that 
the locations of lesions were correlated with neurocognitive 
impairment (26,27), we were unable to obtain detailed infor-
mation of neuroimages (lesion characteristics) from Taiwan’s 
National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). 
Information on some external causes of TBI, such as falls, 
motor vehicle crashes, and violence, was also unavailable. 
Tird, TBI outpatients who may have very minor TBI or minor 
symptoms were not considered in this study. We included only 
children with TBI who were treated at emergency medical care 
or inpatient care centers, potentially leading to underestima-
tion of the number of children with TBI.
Conclusions
In summary, our results suggest that early TBI in childhood 
is a potential independent risk factor for ADHD. To facili-
tate reducing the risk of ADHD among children with TBI, a 
coordinated and systematic approach including a comprehen-
sive assessment of behavioral outcomes, evolution over time 
postinjury, cognitive correlates, and therapeutic intervention 
or rehabilitation should be adopted. Additional studies are 
required in the future for exploring the mechanisms underly-
ing the relationship between TBI and ADHD and developing 
speciﬁc diagnostic markers for identifying ADHD in children 
with TBI.
METHODS
Database
Data in this population-based retrospective cohort study were 
obtained from the NHIRD, which contains the enrollment and claims 
data of all beneﬁciaries of Taiwan’s NHI program, including data on 
ambulatory care, records on inpatient expenditures by admissions, 
and a registry for beneﬁciaries. Te single-payer NHI program was

established in 1995 and provides mandatory universal health insur-
ance to all Taiwanese residents, covering more than 98% of the popu-
lation of ~23 million people. As one of the largest databases of medical 
information in the world, the NHIRD provides a unique opportunity 
for evaluating the risk of neurocognitive disorders following TBI. Tis 
study was approved by the Taipei Medical University Institutional 
Review Board (TMU-JIRB-201408018). To protect patient privacy, 
the National Health Research Institutes manages claims data and 
denotes them with random identiﬁcation numbers in the NHIRD. 
Te requirement for informed consent was waived because we ana-
lyzed encrypted anonymous secondary data provided in the NHIRD.
Study Population
Tis study was designed as a population-based retrospective cohort 
study. From the NHIRD database, we selected children aged ≤12 y 
who had visited ambulatory care centers (including the outpatient 
departments of hospitals or clinics) or had been hospitalized with 
the principal diagnosis of TBI (ICD-9-CM codes 800–804 or 850–
854) between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2002 (n = 11,453) 
(Figure 2). We assigned these children’s ﬁrst ambulatory care visit or 
hospitalization for TBI treatments as their medical service index use. 
We excluded children diagnosed with ADHD (ICD-9-CM code 314) 
or TBI (ICD-9-CM codes 800–804, 850–854) prior to their medical 
service index use (n = 586). Because Taiwan’s NHI program was ini-
tiated in 1995, our study could not account for children diagnosed 
with neuronal disorders prior to 1996. In addition, we excluded chil-
dren with a past medical history of preterm birth (28) (ICD-9-CM 
codes 765.0, 765.1) (n = 62), congenital anomaly (29) (ICD-9-CM 
codes 758, 759.9) (n = 27), mental illness (30) (ICD-9-CM codes 
290–319, except 314) (n = 183), epilepsy (31) (ICD-9-CM code 345) 
(n = 131), and cerebral palsy (32) (ICD-9-CM code 343) (n = 48) for 
minimizing potential confounding inﬂuence from other known risk 
factors for ADHD. Finally, we included 10,416 children with TBI. We 
further categorized TBI children into mild brain injury (ICD-9-CM 
code 850), severe brain injury (ICD-9-CM codes 851–854), and skull 
fracture (ICD-9-CM codes 800–804). Mild TBI was deﬁned as brain 
concussion without structural brain damage. Severe TBI was deﬁned 
as brain injury including brain contusion, SDH, epidural haemor-
rhage subarachnoid haemorrhage and intracranial haemorrhage. 
According to earlier studies (33,34), we categorized the diagnoses 
of skull fracture combined with intracerebral hemorrhage (children 
with both skull fracture and intracerebral hemorrhage diagnostic 
codes (800–804 and 851–854) conditions, or diagnostic codes include 
skull fracture with intracranial injury (800.1–800.4, 800.6–800.9, 
etc.)) into the severe brain injury group. We furthermore deﬁned skull 
fracture group as a fracture of the vault of skull, base of skull, or facial 
bone as well as multiple skull bone fractures without any intracerebral 
hemorrhage.
Te non-TBI cohort was selected from the Longitudinal Health 
Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000). As a subset of the NHIRD, the 
LHID2000 contains all original claims data for 1 million beneﬁciaries 
randomly sampled from the Registry for Beneﬁciaries of the NHIRD. 
In addition, we excluded children aged >12 y. Finally, we randomly 
selected 41,664 children without TBI (four times the number of 
patients with TBI) who were frequency matched with the children 
with TBI by sex, age (≤4, 5–8, and 9–12 y), and the year of the medi-
cal service use index. We assigned their ﬁrst ambulatory service use 
that occurred in the year of the index healthcare use, as the medi-
cal service index use. We veriﬁed that these children had no history 
of neuronal disorders, TBI and ADHD prior to their medical index 
use since 1995. In total, we included 52,080 children (children with 
and without TBI). Each child was individually followed up for 9 y

TBI in childhood and ADHD         Articles
from the medical service index use to identify patients who subse-
quently developed ADHD (ICD-9-CM code 314). ADHD diagnosis 
by pediatric neurologists was based on ICD-9-CM diagnostic criteria. 
In Taiwan, pediatric neurologists usually provide the ﬁrst diagnosis of 
ADHD according to an examination performed on observing ADHD 
symptoms. However, a second ADHD diagnosis is based on previ-
ous test results and clinical examination outcomes and thus provides 
conﬁrmation. Recent studies reported on participants who were diag-
nosed at least twice for ADHD by psychiatrists and clinical psycholo-
gists to ensure diagnostic validity (35–37). Terefore, we included 
only patients with TBI who received two or more ADHD diagnoses 
to increase the diagnostic validity.
Sensitivity Analysis
To consider that ADHD may predispose children to TBI, we performed 
sensitivity analysis in children who received index treatment for frac-
tures but not TBI. Children aged ≤12 y diagnosed with fracture (ICD-
9-CM codes 805–829), including inpatients and outpatients, between 
1 January 2001 and 31 December 2002 (n = 2,974) were selected from 
the LHID2000. We assigned their ﬁrst ambulatory care visit or hospi-
talization for fracture treatment as their medical service index use. We 
excluded children with a history of preterm birth, congenital anomaly, 
mental illness, and cerebral palsy and those with ADHD or fracture 
diagnoses prior to their medical service index use (n = 326). In addi-
tion, children diagnosed with TBI prior to their medical service index 
use and 9-y follow-up duration (n = 469) were excluded. In the non-
fracture group, children who were not diagnosed with a fracture or TBI 
were included. Children were randomly selected by frequency match-
ing the fracture cohort patients with the nonfracture controls accord-
ing to their age (≤4, 5–8, and 9–12 y), sex, and the year of the medical 
service index use at a ratio of 1:4. Finally, 2,179 children with fractures 
but not TBI and 8,716 children without fractures were selected as cases 
and controls, respectively (Supplementary Figure S1 online).
Statistical Analysis
In this study, used the chi-square test for comparing diﬀerences 
between the cases and controls in socio-demographic characteris-
tics such as parental occupation (white collar, employee or manual 
worker, self-employed (farmer, crafsman, or ﬁsherman), and others) 
and the patients’ urbanization level (ranging from “most urbanized” 
(level 1) to “least urbanized” (level 5)) at the baseline. Te cumulative 
incidence rate was calculated using the life table method. Te log-rank 
test was performed for evaluating the diﬀerence in the cumulative 
incidence between cases and controls. In addition, stratiﬁed Cox pro-
portional hazard regression, stratiﬁed by sex, age, and follow-up year, 
was conducted for evaluating the association between TBI and subse-
quent neurocognitive outcomes during the 9-y follow-up period. We 
presented HRs and their 95% CIs as our results. Two-tailed P values 
were calculated, and statistical signiﬁcance was set at P < 0.05. All 
analyses were performed using the Statistics Analysis System (SAS) 
statistical sofware, Version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
