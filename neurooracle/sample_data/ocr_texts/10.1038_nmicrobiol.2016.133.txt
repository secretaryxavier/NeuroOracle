Abstract
Suppression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigen presentation is believed 
to be among the major mechanisms used by Mycobacterium tuberculosis to escape protective host 
immune responses. Through a genome-wide screen for the genetic loci of M. tuberculosis that 
inhibit MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation by mycobacteria-infected dendritic cells, we 
identified the PE_PGRS47 protein as one of the responsible factors. Targeted disruption of the 
PE_PGRS47 (Rv2741) gene led to attenuated growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro and in vivo, and a 
PE_PGRS47 mutant showed enhanced MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation during in vivo 
infection of mice. Analysis of the effects of deletion or over-expression of PE_PGRS47 implicated 
this protein in the inhibition of autophagy in infected host phagocytes. Our findings identify 
PE_PGRS47 as a functionally relevant, non-redundant bacterial factor in the modulation of innate 
and adaptive immunity by M. tuberculosis, suggesting strategies for improving antigen 
presentation and the generation of protective immunity during vaccination or infection.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) persists within mammalian hosts through a variety of 
immune evasion strategies, including the inhibition of multiple antigen presentation

pathways that are central to adaptive immunity1. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) 
class II molecules, which control CD4+ T-cell responses, are critical for host resistance to 
Mtb, and the bacilli have evolved the ability to modulate the expression and function of 
these molecules2–8. Autophagy is a ubiquitous cellular process that participates in the 
processing of antigens for MHC class II antigen presentation9–12, and in cells infected by 
vacuolar pathogens like Mtb it provides a potential mechanism to initiate phagosome 
maturation and enhance the processing and presentation of their antigens to T cells12–14. 
Recent evidence suggests that Mtb has developed immune evasion strategies that interfere 
with autophagy, thus improving its intracellular survival and limiting the presentation of its 
antigens by MHC class II. Although several mycobacterial factors have been implicated in 
this aspect of immune evasion15–17, the mechanisms and specific mediators involved remain 
mostly unknown.
In the current study, we undertook a genome-wide gain of function screen to identify genes 
of Mtb involved in the inhibition of MHC class II presentation in Mtb-infected cells. This 
identified at least five genomic loci of Mtb that independently contribute to the inhibition of 
MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation, several of which also blocked autophagy. 
Detailed analysis of one of these loci implicated PE_PGRS47, a member of a large family of 
virulence-related genes in Mtb, as an inhibitor of autophagy and a factor contributing to 
evasion of both innate and adaptive immunity by Mtb. These findings identify a specific 
mycobacterial factor involved in the evasion of innate and adaptive immunity against Mtb 
and provide new insight into the role of PE_PGRS proteins in tuberculosis.
Results
Isolation of Mtb genes that inhibit MHC class II presentation
A cosmid library of random Mtb genomic DNA fragments (~20–35 kilobases) was used to 
transform the nonpathogenic mycobacterium M. smegmatis (Msmeg), and several hundred 
individual clones were screened for their ability to impair MHC class II presentation of 
bacterial antigens by bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs). We used Msmeg 
expressing an Mtb ESAT-6 protein extended at its C terminus to include a well-characterized 
MHC class II presented epitope (I-Eα52–68) for this screening, which allowed direct 
measurement of antigen presentation using monoclonal antibody Y-Ae, specific for 
complexes of I-Eα52–68 bound to MHC class II (I-Ab) molecules18 (Supplementary Fig. 1). 
From a total of 365 Msmeg transformants harbouring random Mtb genomic cosmids, five 
were identified that gave a significant and reproducible reduction of cell surface Y-Ae 
staining while maintaining the expression of the ESAT6-IEα fusion protein (Fig. 1a and 
Supplementary Fig. 2). Restriction mapping of re-extracted cosmid DNA revealed that each 
cosmid contained distinct and non-overlapping inserts of Mtb genomic DNA 
(Supplementary Fig. 2). None of these Msmeg clones affected the level of total cell surface 
MHC class II expression on infected BMDCs (Fig. 1b). This indicated that the reduced 
antigen presentation was not due to global down-regulation of MHC class II expression, 
which has been previously attributed to Mtb (ref. 5). The reduction in cell surface expression 
of MHC class II/peptide complexes was also confirmed in assays of T-cell responses using 
CD4+ T cells specific for I-Ab/Eα52–68 peptide complexes (Fig. 1c). Taken together, our

results indicate at least five genomic loci in Mtb encoding the potential to inhibit the 
processing or presentation of bacteria-derived MHC class II presented antigens.
Effects of Mtb genes on autophagy
The inhibition of antigen presentation by Mtb genes without reduction in total surface MHC 
class II suggested effects on the digestion of intra-phagosomal bacteria and reduced delivery 
of their antigens to endocytic compartments containing MHC class II molecules. Consistent 
with this, we observed that three of the five Msmeg transformants inhibiting antigen 
presentation showed a significant increase in persistence of viable bacteria at 24 h following 
in vitro infection of BMDCs (Fig. 1d). These findings suggested an effect on autophagy, a 
basic cellular process that restricts the survival of intracellular mycobacteria13,14,19 and also 
promotes intracellular antigen processing for MHC class II presentation20. To examine this, 
we assessed the distribution of microtubule-associated light chain 3 (LC3), a central 
component of autophagosome formation that undergoes cleavage, lipid modification and 
cellular redistribution during autophagosome formation21. Initial experiments showed that 
infection of a macrophage cell line with wild-type Msmeg triggered the formation of LC3 
punctate structures in the cytoplasm, which were visualized by staining with an anti-LC3 
mAb. In contrast, infections with Msmeg transformed with cosmid M2D10, M2H6 or S1G7 
were associated with a significant reduction of the LC3 puncta formation as compared with 
cells infected with control Msmeg harbouring empty cosmid (pYUB412; Fig. 1e,f). Similar 
results were obtained using an LC3–GFP reporter fusion protein (Supplementary Fig. 3a,b). 
Biochemical analysis of LC3 protein also confirmed an effect on autophagy, showing that 
the increase in the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio was substantially reduced (25–85%) in cells infected 
with bacteria harbouring the same cosmids that reduced LC3 puncta formation 
(Supplementary Fig. 3c).
Identification of PE_PGRS47 as an autophagy-inhibiting Mtb gene
As a first step towards the identification of specific Mtb genes responsible for the inhibition 
of autophagy and antigen presentation, we focused on cosmid M2D10 and generated a 
complete map of open reading frames (ORFs) from the sequence of its ~35 kb insert 
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Based on annotation of the Mtb genome and published literature, 
one gene among the 33 intact ORFs stood out as a candidate for direct involvement in host–
pathogen interactions. This was PE_PGRS47 (Rv2741), a member of the large family of 
PE_PGRS genes implicated in pathogenesis and intracellular survival of virulent 
mycobacteria (Supplementary Fig. 5)22,23. Initial experiments showed that expression of 
PE_PGRS47 in Msmeg phenocopied the inhibition of autophagy in infected macrophages 
observed with Msmeg transformed with cosmid M2D10, and also demonstrated that 
PE_PGRS47 was secreted by the bacteria and could gain access to the cytosol of infected 
phagocytic cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). We thus proceeded to directly explore the role of 
PE_PGRS47 in Mtb infection by constructing a precise deletion mutant in the virulent Mtb 
H37Rv strain using specialized phage transduction (Supplementary Fig. 7a–d)24. In 
addition, a complemented strain was generated by reintroducing PE_PGRS47 into the 
ΔPE_PGRS47 mutant. The ΔPE_PGRS47 and complemented strains showed identical 
growth in standard liquid medium as wild-type Mtb, and similar growth in vivo in the lungs

during the first four weeks following low-dose aerosol infection of C57BL/6 mice 
(Supplementary Fig. 7e,f).
To assess the role of PE_PGRS47 in blocking autophagy during Mtb infection, mouse 
macrophage cell line RAW264.7 was infected with wild-type, mutant or complemented 
strains and examined for LC3 punctate structures by fluorescence microscopy. This revealed 
an increase in LC3 puncta with infection by the mutant (Fig. 2a,b). Following infection of 
RAW264.7 cells with the ΔPE_PGRS47 mutant we also observed an increase in conversion 
of LC3-I to LC3-II compared to cells infected with wild-type or complemented strains (Fig. 
2c). We also examined effects on the levels of p62 (sequestosome 1), which is recruited to 
newly formed autophago-somes and subsequently degraded25. We observed a greater level 
of p62 in cells infected with wild-type Mtb than ΔPE_PGRS47 mutant infection, which was 
reversed by complementation (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, using wild-type, ΔPE_PGRS47 and 
complemented strains of Mtb expressing TdTomato, an increase in the co-localization of 
intracellular bacteria with LC3 punctate structures was shown for the ΔPE_PGRS47 mutant 
in infected RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2e,f). Transmission electron microscopy of cells infected 
with the mutant showed bacilli within the characteristic double-membrane autophagosomes 
associated with the initial stages of engulfment by autophagy; such structures were not 
observed in cells infected with wild-type Mtb (Fig. 2g). Altogether, these results indicate a 
significant role for PE_PGRS47 in preventing the formation or a detectable level of 
accumulation of autophagosomes containing intracellular Mtb.
Effects of PE_PGRS47 on maturation of mycobacterial phagosomes
The engulfment of mycobacteria within autophagosomes can lead to further maturation of 
these compartments, including acidification and fusion with lysosomes. We thus carried out 
studies to assess the role of PE_PGRS47 in blocking mycobacterial phagosome acidification 
and phagolysosomal fusion. RAW264.7 cells were labelled with LysoTracker dye, which 
labels acidic late endosomes and lysosomes, and then infected with wild-type, 
ΔPE_PGRS47 or complemented strains of Mtb. This revealed a significant increase in co-
localization with the mutant compared to wild-type Mtb, which was reversed by 
complementation (Fig. 3a,b). We also observed a significant increase in co-localization 
between the ΔPE_PGRS47 mutant and the lysosomal marker lysosome-associated 
membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) (Fig. 3a,b), indicating enhanced lysosomal fusion with 
infected phagosomes.
Role of PE_PGRS47 during chronic Mtb infection
Whereas initial findings showed that deletion of PE_PGRS47 had no effect on the growth of 
Mtb in mice early after infection (Supplementary Fig. 7f), subsequent analysis of colony-
forming unit (c.f.u.) levels from tissues of wild-type mice at 15 or 25 weeks post-infection 
showed that the ΔPE_PGRS47 strain was significantly attenuated in chronic stages of 
disease (Fig. 4a). Histological examination of the lungs at 15 weeks post-infection showed 
reductions in leukocyte accumulation and in the total area of histologically infiamed lung 
tissue in animals infected with the mutant compared to wild-type or complemented strains 
(Fig. 4b). To examine this in the absence of adaptive immunity, severe combined 
immunodeficient (SCID) mice were infected intravenously with a high dose (106 c.f.u.) of

Mtb mutant, wild-type and complemented strains, then followed for survival. This also 
showed that the ΔPE_PGRS47 strain was significantly attenuated in vivo (Fig. 4c), 
indicating an increased susceptibility to innate immune mechanisms. Similarly, in vitro 
infection in RAW264.7, human THP-1 myelomonocytic cells and BMDCs showed that the 
mutant had very little capacity for intracellular growth, remaining at static levels based on 
sampling at various intervals during the five days of culture compared to the wild-type or 
complemented strains (Supplementary Fig. 8a). To confirm a role for autophagy in this 
reduced intracellular survival of ΔPE_PGRS47, we infected RAW264.7 cells or BMDCs 
with the ΔPE_PGRS47, wild-type Mtb and complemented strains in the presence or absence 
of 3-methyladenine (3MA), an inhibitor of autophagy. This showed that the reduced 
bacterial burden of the ΔPE_PGRS47 mutant could be fully restored to wild-type Mtb levels 
by the addition of 3MA (Fig. 4d). In contrast, no significant changes in c.f.u. levels were 
observed with 3MA treatment of cells infected with wild-type Mtb or complemented strains 
(Supplementary Fig. 8b). These results are consistent with an important role for the 
PE_PGRS47 gene in the growth and survival of Mtb, particularly during intracellular growth 
and in the later chronic phase of infection.
Inhibition of MHC class II antigen presentation by PE_PGRS47
To assess the ability of PE_PGRS47 to suppress MHC class II dependent antigen 
presentation during Mtb infection, we carried out studies both in vitro and in vivo. 
Presentation to MHC class II-restricted T-cell hybridomas was assessed in vitro for BMDCs 
infected with the ΔPE_PGRS47 mutant compared to wild-type or complemented strains. 
This showed enhanced responses for hybridomas specific for Mtb secreted antigens TB9.8 
or antigen 85B (Ag85B). Treatment of the BMDCs with the autophagy inhibitor 3MA 
reduced the responses to both antigens and eliminated the increase associated with deletion 
of PE_PGRS47. Conversely, addition of rapamycin to activate autophagy gave increased T-
cell responses, while also eliminating the enhanced responses to the ΔPE_PGRS47 strain 
compared to wild-type or complemented strains (Fig. 5a). Overall, these results were 
consistent with an autophagy-dependent enhancement of MHC class II presentation with 
deletion of PE_PGRS47. To rule out the possibility that PE_PGRS47 deletion could alter the 
total surface level of MHC class II on infected BMDCs, we analysed this by flow cytometry. 
This showed no significant effect of PE_PGRS47 deletion on the total surface level of MHC 
class II expression in infected BMDCs compared to wild-type Mtb or complemented strains 
(Fig. 5b).
To assess MHC class II presentation in vivo, we infected C57BL/6 mice with wild-type, 
ΔPE_PGRS47 or complemented Mtb strains and measured CD4+ T-cell responses against 
well-defined Mtb antigens. Lungs, spleen and mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) were 
collected on different days post-infection and processed to obtain single-cell suspensions. 
Using flow cytometry to quantitate cells binding an MHC class II (I-Ab) tetramer containing 
a peptide from the secreted antigen TB9.8 (EsxG), we detected significantly more TB9.8-
specific CD4+ T cells in all the organs of mice infected with the ΔPE_PGRS47 mutant 
compared to mice infected with wild-type or complemented strains on day 24 post-infection 
(Fig. 6a). However, we were not able to detect effects on the frequency of TB9.8-specific 
CD4+ T cells at very early phases of infection on days 9 or 14 (Supplementary Fig. 9),

suggesting that PE_PGRS47 is not active in the initial stages of infection and may not affect 
the initial priming of T cells.
We also performed interferon-γ (IFNγ) enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) on cells 
isolated from infected mice to quantitate responses to immunodominant I-Ab presented 
epitopes from Mtb antigens ESAT-6, TB9.8 and Antigen 85B (Ag85B P25) (Fig. 6b). This 
showed significant increases in IFNγ-secreting CD4+ T cells specific for TB9.8 in all tissues 
studied on day 24 in ΔPE_PGRS47-mutant-infected mice, compared to mice infected with 
wild-type Mtb or the complemented strains. At this time point, we also detected a significant 
increase in the lungs of CD4+ T cells specific for Ag85B P25, which is known to be highly 
expressed by Mtb as an immunodominant antigen during early infection26. Surprisingly, we 
were not able to detect any increase in the frequency of CD4+ T cells specific for ESAT-6, 
possibly reflecting the rapid expression of this antigen in the early phase of infection when 
PE_PGRS47 may not be active, or alternatively due to the ability of ESAT-6 to directly lyse 
phagosomal membranes and gain access to other cellular compartments27–29. These effects 
on TB9.8 and Ag85 P25 responses persisted or became more prominent by day 60 post-
infection. Together, these results indicate a significant role for PE_PGRS47 in the inhibition 
of MHC class II mediated antigen presentation of a subset of immunodominant CD4+ T-cell 
antigens beginning in early infection and persisting into the later chronic phase.
Discussion
We have provided evidence for at least five distinct genomic loci and the identity of one 
specific gene of Mtb that contribute to the inhibition of MHC class II restricted antigen 
presentation. Expression of several of these loci in Msmeg significantly prolonged 
intracellular survival of the bacteria, and three of them also suppressed autophagy in infected 
cells. Overall, these findings are consistent with the prevalent view of a highly complex 
programme of immune evasion that allows survival of Mtb despite an intact immune 
system5. Sequence analysis of the five cosmids isolated in our screening did not identify 
known virulence-related genes, but the presence of Rv2741, encoding a member of the 
expanded PE_PGRS protein family of Mtb, provided a strong candidate for a relevant 
immune evasion gene in one of the five cosmids (M2D10). Although the precise functions of 
PE_PGRS proteins or potential non-protein coding functions of PE_PGRS genes remain 
mostly unknown, previous studies have implicated members of this family in virulence and 
immune evasion by pathogenic mycobacteria22,23.
Our studies focusing on PE_PGRS47 showed that this gene significantly modulates 
intracellular infection. The ΔPE_PGRS47 deletion mutant of Mtb showed a reduced capacity 
to inhibit autophagy and an increased acidification and lysosomal fusion of phagosomes 
during infection of phagocytic cells (Figs 2 and 3). In addition, infection of mice with the 
mutant revealed attenuated growth (Fig. 4) and a significant increase in CD4+ T-cell 
responses against MHC class II presented antigens (Figs 5 and 6). These findings indicated a 
non-redundant role for PE_PGRS47 in modulating innate intracellular host responses, as 
well as in the generation of adaptive immune responses that are critical for control of Mtb. 
We have not yet carried out experiments using mouse strains with specific mutations in 
autophagy-related genes to further confirm and explore the effects of PE_PGRS47.

However, our current data using pharmacologic agents to manipulate this pathway (Figs 4d 
and 5a) support the hypothesis that PE_PGRS47 mediates linked inhibition of autophagy 
and antigen presentation in Mtb-infected cells. It is noteworthy that the expression of many 
PE_PGRS family members, including PE_PGRS47, is upregulated by mycobacteria after 
entering macrophages30, and that PE_PGRS47 has been reported as one of the members of 
this family showing the highest level of evolutionary conservation31.
Autophagy has received considerable attention as a basic cellular mechanism contributing to 
both innate and adaptive immunity32, and as a mechanism that enhances clearance of 
intracellular myco-bacteria33. It has been frequently emphasized that Mtb inhibits 
phagosome maturation, preventing acidification of phagosomes harbouring live bacilli and 
their fusion with lysosomes34. Recent work suggests that this critical feature of Mtb survival 
and immune evasion is at least in part due to the suppression of auto-phagy14,35,36. Although 
a recent report has called into question the relevance of autophagy as a mechanism of host 
protection in the mouse model37, this may reflect the ability of Mtb to efficiently disable and 
manipulate this pathway. Several of our findings were consistent with the expected effect of 
enhanced autophagy on promoting killing of Mtb by innate immunity (Fig. 4c and 
Supplementary Fig. 8a), but it was surprising that growth of the ΔPE_PGRS47 mutant was 
not significantly attenuated in the early phase of infection in wild-type mice (Fig. 4a and 
Supplementary Fig. 7f). This suggests that other mediators may be produced by Mtb that 
play a more dominant role during the early phases of infection in vivo to prevent autophagy 
or to neutralize its microbicidal effects.
Overall, our results identify the product of the PE_PGRS47 gene as one potentially 
important factor contributing to the modulation of the host cell environment by Mtb. The 
mechanism by which PE_PGRS47 mediates this function remains to be determined, 
although our results indicate that this protein is secreted by the bacteria and gains access to 
the cytosol of infected host cells (Supplementary Fig. 6). Access to the host cell cytoplasm 
has been described for other PE_PGRS proteins, such as PE_PGRS33, which has been 
reported to localize to mitochondria to modulate cell death38. Specific interacting partners 
for PE_PGRS proteins within the host-cell proteome have not yet been identified, and this 
represents an important future area of discovery that may yield clues to the mechanisms of 
action of PE_PGRS47 and other members of this family.
Methods
Antibodies and other reagents
Monoclonal antibody Y-Ae was purified from hybridoma culture supernatants by standard 
protein G column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). Purified mAbs 
(2.0 mg ml−1 in PBS) were biotinylated overnight at 4 °C using NHS–LC–biotin (N-
Hexanoate-succinimidyl-long chain-biotin, Thermo scientific), dissolved to 10 mM with 
DMSO just before use, with a biotin-to-mAb molar ratio of 30:1. Unbound biotin was not 
removed, as this did not interfere with downstream applications. Anti-I-A/I-E-FITC 
(fluorescein isothiocyanate ) and anti-CD11c-PE mAbs were obtained from BD Biosciences. 
Rapamycin was from Calbiochem and IFNγ was from Peprotech. 3-Methyladenine was

purchased from Sigma. Anti-LC3 antibodies for western blotting and immunofluorescence 
analysis were purchased from Novus Biologicals and Cell Signaling, respectively. 
Antibodies to LAMP-1, β-actin and p62 were purchased from Abcam.
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
Wild-type Mtb (strain H37Rv), mutant and complemented strains or Msmeg (strain 
mc 2155) were cultured at 37 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 broth, or on 7H10 or 7H11 agar 
containing 10% (vol/vol) oleic acid–albumin–dextrose–catalase (OADC), 0.5% glycerol and 
0.05% (vol/vol) tyloxapol. Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for cloning purposes and 
grown on Luria–Bertani agar or broth at 37 °C. Strains bearing antibiotic resistance cassettes 
were cultured in the presence of hygromycin (50 μg ml−1 for mycobacterial selection or 150 
μg ml−1 for E. coli) or kanamycin (20 μg ml−1 for mycobacterial selection or 40 μg ml−1 for 
E. coli). Strains of Msmeg and Mtb were transformed using published protocols39. The 
PE_PGRS47 gene was deleted from Mtb H37Rv by allelic exchange via the previously 
described specialized phage transduction method24. Colonies were selected for hygromycin 
resistance following transduction, screened for gene deletion by PCR and confirmed by 
Southern blotting using previously described methods24. For complementation of the 
ΔPE_PGRS47 mutant, a full-length Mtb PE_PGRS47 (Rv2741) gene was amplified by PCR 
from Mtb H37Rv genomic DNA and cloned into pMV361, an integrating Mtb vector with 
an hsp60 promoter40.
Construction of Mtb genomic DNA library
The strategy for generation of the Mtb genomic library in cosmid vector pYUB412 has been 
described previously47. Briefly, M. tuberculosis (strain H37Rv) genomic DNA was purified 
and partially digested with Sau3A. Agarose gel purification was used to enrich for DNA 
fragments of ~40 kb, which were ligated into the arms of cosmid vector pYUB412 digested 
with BamH1. DNA was packaged into phages in vitro with Gigapack XL (Stratagene) and 
E. coli were transduced and selected on LB plates containing 100 μg ml−1 ampicillin. Over 1 
× 105 independent clones were pooled, and DNA for transformation was obtained using 
standard alkaline lysis method.
Construction and expression of ESAT6-IEα fusion protein
A sequence of 87 bp containing the coding sequence for the MHC class II-presented IEα 
epitope (EFAKFASFEAQGALANIAVDKANLD)48 was synthesized (GenScript) and then 
ligated into pMV261 containing the ESAT6 sequence to create a fusion of the IEα sequence 
to the C-terminal sequence of ESAT6. The resulting plasmid, pMV261-ESAT6-IEα, was 
introduced into M. smegmatis by electroporation.
Construction and screening of M. smegmatis clones expressing Mtb cosmids
The Mtb cosmid DNA library was electroporated into M. smegmatis harbouring the 
pMV261-ESAT6-IEα plasmid. A total of 365 random clones from the cosmid 
transformation of M. smegmatis were picked and grown in liquid medium (7H9) containing 
hygromycin (50 μg ml−1). Assuming a random distribution of Mtb sequences among the 
cosmid transformants and an average insert size of ~40 kb, the 365 cosmid clones

represented approximately three times coverage (×C) of the entire Mtb genome (that is, ×C 
= L[N/G], where L is the average length of the genomic fragments represented by the 
inserts, N is the number of inserts, and G is the entire genome length). At this level of 
coverage, the probability of any given genomic 40 kb fragment being represented in a group 
of N cosmids is given by the formula P = 1 − e−R, where R = NL/G (ref. 49). For a library of 
365 random cosmid clones, P ≅ 0.95, indicating an approximately 95% chance that any 
given gene in Mtb will be assessed at least once in the initial screening. Cultures of BMDCs 
were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20:1 for 3 h individually with each of 
the 365 M. smegmatis clones containing Mtb cosmids. As a positive control, BMDCs were 
similarly infected with M. smegmatis expressing ESAT6-IEα and transformed with the 
empty pYUB412 cosmid vector. After 3 h, cells were treated with gentamicin (100 μg ml−1; 
Invitrogen) for 1 h to inhibit the growth of extracellular bacteria and the cells were then 
washed two times with PBS and cultured in fresh medium containing 20 μg ml−1 of 
gentamicin. Cells were detached with cold PBS containing 1 mM EDTA at 24 h post-
infection and were stained with the Y-Ae monoclonal antibody (specific for complexes of I-
Ab/Eα peptide) and with mAbs specific for CD11c and for total MHC class II (I-A/I-E 
specific). Cell surface staining was measured by flow cytometry using a FACSCalibur (BD 
Biosciences). A total of 72 transformant clones of M. smegmatis showing significantly 
reduced Y-Ae staining (>3 standard errors below the mean value of 12 replicates of control 
clones containing an empty cosmid vector) were identified in primary screening. These were 
assessed for maintenance of expression of the ESAT6-IEα fusion protein by western blotting 
using anti-ESAT6 and anti-Hsp65 mAbs to assess the relative levels of the fusion protein 
with endogenous Hsp65 in each clone (see Supplementary Fig. 2a for an example). Eighteen 
of the 72 transformant clones initially selected by the primary screen (that is, 25%) showed 
reduced expression of the ESAT6-IEα fusion protein (ratio of Hsp65:ESAT6-IEα > 3 
standard errors above values for empty cosmid control transformants) and these were 
excluded from subsequent secondary screening to eliminate false positives.
Cosmid recovery from M. smegmatis
Although pYUB412 is an integrating vector that inserts at a specific chromosomal site in M. 
smegmatis50, we observed in preliminary studies that a small but significant amount of our 
integrated cosmids could be recovered by simple extraction from lysozyme-treated bacteria. 
This is due to a low rate of spontaneous excision and reinsertion of cosmids built in the 
pYUB412 backbone, which results in a constant low level of cells containing unintegrated 
circular cosmids. To recover these cosmids, M. smegmatis clones were grown in 250 ml of 
7H9 medium at 37 °C overnight, collected by centrifugation, and resuspended in 4 ml of Glu 
TE buffer (50 mM glucose, 10 mM EDTA, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5) with 10 mg ml−1 of 
lysozyme. The samples were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Then 40 ml of lysis buffer 
(1%SDS and 0.2 M NaOH) was added, mixed by inversion and incubated for 10 min on ice. 
After this, 40 ml of neutralization buffer (3 M potassium acetate, 2 M acetic acid) was 
added, mixed, and incubated for 10 min on ice. The samples were centrifuged and cleared by 
filtration through tissue paper to remove insoluble debris. Then 40 ml of 2-propanol was 
added to the supernatant, mixed and incubated for 10 min on ice, followed by centrifugation 
at 1,400g for 20 min. The pellets were recovered and resuspended in 4 ml of ultrapure water. 
A 4 ml volume of RNA precipitation buffer (5 M LiCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 7.6) was then added

and incubated for 10 min on ice. The samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,400g, and the 
supernatant was transferred to a new tube in which the DNA was precipitated by adding 80 
μl of 10 M sodium acetate and 650 μl of ethanol, incubated at −20 °C for 20 min and then 
centrifuged. The pellets were washed twice with 70% ethanol, dried at room temperature 
and then resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer.
DNA sequencing
The Mtb genomic DNA insert of each cosmid was first sequenced using primers specific for 
the sequences of the pYUB412 vector flanking the insert (pYB412F-5′-
gtacgccaccgcctggttc-3′ and pYUB412R-5′-gtgccacctgacgtctaag-3′) which provided ~400 
bp of Mtb genomic sequence corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the insert. Because 
initial analysis of the ends of the inserts revealed that they were composed of more than one 
fragment of genomic DNA that had been ligated in tandem, it was necessary to use a cosmid 
walking approach to obtain the complete sequences of the cosmid inserts. Sequencing by 
cosmid walking was done by starting from the distal portion of the known sequences at the 
ends of each insert. Deoxyoligonucleotides were designed based on the Mtb H37Rv genome 
sequence (http://genolist.pasteur.fr/TubercuList/) to be complementary to sequences located 
at 1 kbp intervals upstream of the known sequence and standard sequencing reactions were 
carried out using these as primers. Sequence information obtained from these reactions was 
used to design a second set of primers, and the process was repeated until all of the regions 
of the insert that were non-contiguous with the Mtb genomic sequence had been sequenced 
directly. This information was then used together with the published genomic sequence to 
assemble the complete insert sequence.
Animal experiments
Wild-type C57BL/6 or severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID; also in C57BL/6 
background) female mice between six and eight weeks of age were purchased from Jackson 
Laboratories. Formal power calculations were not done for animal group size selection, 
although the minimum group size (N = 5) is typical for experiments to assess major effects 
on mycobacterial growth and virulence in the mouse infection model. This group size allows 
valid statistical testing in experiments with multiple groups. Animals were assigned 
randomly to experimental groups and studies using mice were not blinded. T cell receptor 
transgenic TEα mice (rag1−/−and expressing CD90.1) were a gift from Marc K. Jenkins 
(University of Minnesota). C57BL/6 mice were infected with Mtb or ΔPE_PGRS47 or 
complemented strains through aerosol exposure as previously described41. SCID mice were 
infected i.v. via the tail vein with 1 × 106 c.f.u. per mouse. Lung tissues were processed for 
histopathology using standard paraffin fixation, sectioning and H&E staining. All mice were 
maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. All procedures involving the use of 
animals were in compliance with protocols approved by the Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine Institutional Animal Use and Biosafety Committees.
Primary cell culture and cell lines
BMDCs were prepared as described42. Briefly, bone marrow was obtained from tibiae and 
femurs of six- to eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. Cells were seeded at 2 × 106 per 
100 mm in bacteriological Petri dishes (VWR) in 10 ml of complete RPMI-1640 medium

(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM L-glutamine, 55 μM 2-
mercaptoethanol, 50 μg ml−1 penicillin/streptomycin and 10% ultralow IgG heat-inactivated 
(56 °C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals) and murine granulocyte-
macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (20 ng ml−1) (Peprotech). Cell cultures 
were fed with 10 ml of medium on days 3, 6 and 8 and collected on day 10. Bone marrow 
macrophages (BMMs) were derived according to previously published methods43. Briefly, 
marrow flushed from the tibia and femurs of six- to eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice was 
collected aseptically and cultured in non-tissue-culture-treated 100 × 20 mm serological 
plates (Fisher) at a density of 2 × 105 cells per ml in BMM medium (DMEM supplemented 
with 1% HEPES, 1% L-glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 U ml−1 penicillin and 
100 μg ml−1 streptomycin (all from Invitrogen), 10% FBS (HyClone/GE Healthcare) and 
10% L929 fibroblast-conditioned medium) for 6 days. On day 6, adherent cells were 
collected after detachment by incubation for 20 min at 4 °C with 5 mM EDTA in PBS.
THP-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) were grown in RPMI-1640 
(Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% HEPES, 1% non-essential amino acids and 
essential amino acids and 50 μg ml−1 of penicillin and streptomycin (complete RPMI). 
THP-1 cells were treated with 40 ng ml−1 phorbol ester (PMA; Sigma-Aldrich) overnight to 
induce their differentiation into macrophage-like cells. The J774 macrophage cell line 
(ATCC) was transduced to express a GFP-LC3 fusion protein using a lentivirus construct 
provided by N. Mizushima (Department of Physiology and Cell Biology, Tokyo Medical and 
Dental University)44. The J774-GFP-LC3, RAW 264.7 (ATCC) and AMJ2-C8 (ATCC) 
mouse macrophage lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with 1% HEPES, 1% l-
glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 100 U ml−1 penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin 
(all from Invitrogen) and 10% FBS (HyClone). Immediately before infection with 
mycobacteria, these cells were washed and incubated with antibiotic-free media containing 
non-decomplemented FBS. Infections of cultured cells with mycobacteria were generally 
done for 3 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator, followed by washing three times with PBS and 
then culturing in fresh medium containing 100 μg ml−1 of gentamicin for 1 h. This was 
followed by washing and then incubation in media with gentamicin at 20 μg ml−1 for the 
additional indicated time periods. Approximately half of the culture medium was removed 
and replaced with fresh medium on day 3 of culture to improve viability through day 5.
The cell lines used in this study were authenticated and tested for mycoplasma at their 
source (ATCC) and were not tested subsequently for mycoplasma contamination.
Analysis of T-cell responses
To derive CD4+ T-cell lines specific for the I-Ab presented Eα peptide, splenocytes from 
TEα transgenic mice were isolated by negative depletion (Pan T cell isolation kit, Miltenyi 
Biotech) and cultured with IEα peptide (10 μg ml−1) in the presence of Gardiquimod (1 μg 
ml−1) and poly I:C (10 μg ml−1) for 7 days. The cells were then rested for an additional 7 
days in the presence of irradiated syngeneic splenocytes, IL-2 (20 ng ml−1) and IL-7 (10 ng 
ml−1), after which they were again stimulated using IEα peptide plus irradiated splenocytes. 
After three cycles of restimulation followed by resting, the cells were collected and used for 
T-cell activation experiments.

Capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for the detection of cytokines in 
supernatants of T-cell cultures were carried out as described previously45. Briefly, culture 
supernatants were collected after 72 h at 37 °C, and levels of IL-2 and IFNγ were quantified 
using specific capture and biotinylated detection mAb pairs (BD Biosciences), streptavidin-
HRP (BD Biosciences) and TMB substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) as substrate. Recombinant 
cytokines (PeproTech) were used to generate standard curves. Measurements were 
performed in triplicate. Quantitation of IFNγ secreting CD4+ T cells by ELISPOT was done 
as described previously41, using synthetic peptides (10 μg ml−1) corresponding to Mtb 
epitopes Ag85B240–254 (Peptide 25), ESAT61–20 and TB9.846–61 for in vitro restimulation.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
Cells were suspended in FACS buffer (PBS, 2% FCS and 0.05% NaN3) and Fc receptors 
were blocked by incubation for 5 min with a 1/10 dilution of a culture supernatant of the rat 
2.4G2 hybridoma (specific for murine FcγRIII (CD16) and FcγRIIb (CD32)). Cells were 
stained with specific fluorochrome-labelled antibodies or peptide-loaded MHC class II 
tetramers in FACS buffer for 1 h at room temperature, washed twice and then resuspended in 
FACS buffer. Cells were analysed using a four-colour FACSCalibur cytometer (BD 
Biosciences).
Fluorescence microscopy and autophagy analysis
Autophagy was evaluated in infected cells by immunostaining of LC3 or by western blotting 
analysis as described previously46. For the quantification of autophagy, the percentages of 
GFP-LC3-positive autophagic vacuoles in J774 GFP-LC3 transfected cells, or the numbers 
of endogenous LC3 puncta in primary cells were evaluated using fluorescence microscopy. 
For immunostaining, macrophages with or without previous mycobacteria infection were 
seeded in wells of 24-well plates that contained round-glass coverslips at a density of 1×105 
cells per well in 1 ml of medium. For endogenous LC3 staining, cells were fixed with 
methanol at −20 °C for 20 min. For LAMP-1 staining, cells were fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100 in 
PBS for 12 min before being treated with 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at 
25 °C. The cultures were then stained with primary antibodies, including rabbit anti-mouse 
LC3 (1:200; Cell Signaling) or rat anti-mouse LAMP-1 (1:200; Abcam) overnight at 4 °C. 
After washing to remove excess primary antibodies, the cultures were incubated for 2 h at 
room temperature with anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa 488 or anti-rat IgG-Alexa 647. In some 
experiments, RAW264.7 cells were loaded with Lysotracker DND RED (Life Technologies) 
and infected with different Mtb strains (wild type, ΔPE_PGRS47 or complemented strain), 
which were fluorescently labelled with FITC (Sigma) for the indicated time periods and then 
washed three times with PBS before fixation for immunostaining. After washing, the 
sections were mounted with ProLong Gold (Invitrogen). Confocal images were acquired 
with a Leica SP5 AOBS (Leica Microsystems). Co-localization of fluorescent bacilli with 
lysosomal or autophagosomal markers was quantitated by direct visual scoring by a blinded 
observer, and by computer-assisted image analysis using ImageJ software (http://
rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Criteria for the visual scoring were that positive scoring for co-
localization had to satisfy two criteria: (1) the fluorescence from the marker being assessed 
had to surround more than half of the bacterial surface; and (2) the marker staining had to be

of sufficient intensity for the co-localized bacteria to appear distinctly yellow. In terms of 
quantitation, similar results were obtained using direct visual scoring and ImageJ analysis. 
The values of means ± s.e. of co-localization shown in Figs 2 and 3 were obtained with the 
direct visual scoring method. Endogenous LC3 conjugation was evaluated by western blot 
analysis using an antibody specific for LC3-I/II. As a positive control for autophagy 
activation, cells were treated with complete media contained 1 μM rapamycin (Sigma) for 12 
h.
Electron microscopy
Transmission-electron microscopy was used to analyse the morphology of phagosomal 
membranes and to confirm the induction of autophagy. After infection with mycobacteria, 
cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M cacodylate at room temperature for 2 h 
and then incubated overnight in 4% formaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde and 0.1% PBS. After 
fixation, the samples were stained for 90 min in 2% osmium, then serially dehydrated in 
ethanol and embedded in Spurr’s epoxy resin. Thin sections were obtained on an Ultracut 
cryotome and stained with 0.5% uranyl acetate and 0.5% lead citrate (Reichart). Samples 
were examined in a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope operating at 80 kV. 
Immunogold electron microscopy was performed to analyse the presence of PE_PGRS 
protein after infection of macrophages with Msmeg or Msmeg-PE_PGRS47 using 
previously described methods51. Briefly, the macrophages were fixed in 0.1 M sodium 
cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 
infiltrated in 25% polyvinylpyrrolidone and 2.1 M sucrose and then rapidly frozen by 
immersion in liquid nitrogen. Cryosections were obtained in the temperature range from −70 
to −90 °C using an Ultracut cryotome. After blocking with PBS–BSA with 50 mM NH4Cl, 
the cryosections were incubated overnight in the presence of the mouse monoclonal 
antibody mAb 7C4.1F7. After incubation with Immunogold-labelled anti-mouse IgG, 
specimens were observed in a JEOL1200EX transmission electron microscope operating at 
80 kV.

Figure 1. Identification of Mtb cosmid clones that inhibit MHC class II antigen presentation
a, BMDCs were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20:1 for 3 h with Msmeg 
expressing ESAT6-IEα and either the Mtb genomic cosmid clones indicated (filled bars) or 
an empty cosmid (pYUB412, hatched bar). Cells were collected 24 h after infection, stained 
with mAb Y-Ae and analysed by flow cytometry. The increase in mean fluorescence 
intensity (MFI) compared to the background level of BMDCs infected with Msmeg not 
expressing ESAT6-IEα was determined (ΔMFI). All ΔMFI values are plotted as a 
percentage of the value for the pYUB412 control, which was normalized to 100. b, BMDCs 
were infected as in a, but stained with mAb specific for total MHC class II. Values are 
plotted as MFI of surface staining as a percentage of the pYUB412 control (hatched bar), 
which was normalized to 100. c, Cells from a Th1-polarized CD4+ T-cell line derived from 
TEα TCR transgenic mice were cultured with BMDCs infected as outlined in a. 
Supernatants were collected after 72 h and the levels of IFNγ were measured by capture 
ELISA. d, BMDCs were infected as in a. Cells were collected after 24 h of incubation and 
lysates were plated to determine the number of intracellular viable bacteria. e, Fluorescence 
images of AMJ2-C8 infected as in a and immunostained with anti-LC3 and with DAPI after 
a total of 24 h. Representative images of cells uninfected or infected with Msmeg

Figure 6. Suppression of CD4+ T-cell responses by PE_PGRS47
a, C57BL/6 mice (n = 5 per group) were infected with low-dose aerosol (~100 c.f.u.) of 
wild-type Mtb, ΔPE_PGRS47 mutant or complemented strains. Lungs, mediastinal lymph 
nodes (MLNs) and spleens were collected on day 24, and cells from each tissue were pooled 
for each group. Five samples from each pool were then stained with anti-CD4 mAb and 
MHC class II (I-Ab) tetramers loaded with TB9.8 peptide. Dot plots (top) show 
representative examples of flow cytometry analysis for TB9.8 tetramer positive cells in the 
lungs of either uninfected control mice (naive), or mice infected with the indicated Mtb 
strains. Rectangular regions enclose tetramer-positive cells and frequencies as a percentage 
of total CD4+ cells are shown. Bar graphs (bottom) show mean values ± 1 s.e. for tetramer 
positive cells in each tissue for five replicate samples from the pooled cells of each group of
