Abstract
To accelerate data sharing and research on traumatic brain injury (TBI), several federal agencies have been collabo-
rating to support the development and implementation of common data elements (CDEs). The ﬁrst recommendations for
CDEs were made in 2010, and were well suited for hospital-based studies of acute TBI in adults. To broaden the utility
of the TBI CDEs, experts were asked to update the recommendations to make them relevant to all ages, levels of injury
severity, and phases of recovery. The second version of the TBI CDEs (v.2) was organized around four major study
types: 1) epidemiological research; 2) studies on acute, hospitalized patients; 3) studies of the rehabilitation for
moderate/severe TBI; and 4) mild TBI/concussion research. Given the heterogeneity of TBI, only a small set of core
CDEs were found to be relevant across all study types. However, within groups, a much larger set of highly relevant
CDEs were identiﬁed, and these were called basic CDEs. In addition, an expanded number of supplemental CDEs were
speciﬁed and recommended for use depending upon the study goals. Version 2 provides a rich data dictionary for TBI
research with about 900 CDEs. Many of the CDEs overlap across the study types, which will facilitate comparisons and
meta-analysis across studies. Further modiﬁcations of the CDEs should be based on evaluation of their usefulness
following implementation across a range of studies.

Introduction
T
here is an urgent need to accelerate traumatic brain injury
(TBI) research, because of the enormous and growing
worldwide health burden of this disorder. To address this need, the
Interagency Common Data Elements Project was established in
2008 to promote data sharing and collaboration through the stan-
dardization of deﬁnitions and protocols for TBI research.1 Data
elements are basic units of data that have precise deﬁnitions, and
those that are commonly used are referred to as common data el-
ements (CDEs). The original recommendations for TBI research
were developed and scientiﬁcally vetted in 2010.1–7 One year later,
the CDEs were modiﬁed to make them more compatible with the
needs of pediatric TBI research.8–14 From the inception of this
project, the CDEs were expected to require regular updating to
ensure their continued feasibility and utility.
The ﬁrst version of the CDEs (v.1) was a major advance toward
standardization of TBI research, but there were also limitations
that needed to be addressed. One limitation was that 242 CDEs
were deﬁned as core, meaning that they were recommended for all
clinical TBI studies. However, many of the core items, for ex-
ample, Apgar scores and intracranial pressure measurements, were
not relevant to all TBI research, and collecting them was imprac-
tical or impossible in studies of certain TBI populations.1,15,16
Another major limitation of v.1 was the lack of elements relevant to
studies on milder injuries and on more chronic phases of TBI.
Finally, it became apparent that several of the CDEs were redun-
dant, and that one or the other should be eliminated. To address

these limitations, the TBI CDEs have been updated in version 2
(v.2). An overview of the updated TBI CDE recommendations, and
the process and rationale for the creation of this update, are de-
scribed in this article.
Methods
After agreeing that there was a need for further modiﬁcations to
the TBI CDEs, liaisons from the participating agencies nominated
scientiﬁc experts to serve on new workgroups formed around the
following types of TBI studies.
 The workgroup on epidemiology studies addressed two tasks:
1) reﬁning the core CDEs to ensure their relevance to all TBI
research; and 2) recommending additional data elements for
epidemiological studies. Epidemiology studies tend to have
large sample sizes and a small number of data elements in
order to characterize a population or examine incidence and
prevalence of TBI in a population. The workgroup also
considered epidemiological studies that focus on medical
record reviews, studies using registries such as trauma reg-
istries, and large survey studies.
 The focus of the workgroup on studies of acute, hospital-
ized subjects was on patients who are admitted to a hospital
because of a TBI. The brain injury may have occurred in
isolation or in conjunction with systemic injuries. Most
patients in this type of study demonstrate acute trauma-
related intracranial pathology on CT scans. The spectrum of
subjects ranges from the most severely injured patients to
those with good neurological status and relatively minor
imaging abnormalities. The exact boundary between the
least severely injured acute, hospitalized patients and the
most severely injured concussion/mild TBI patients is ad-
mittedly ambiguous, and drawing it is left to the individual
researcher’s discretion. The acute, hospitalized domain in-
cludes military and civilian populations, as well as both
children and adults.
 The workgroup on studies of rehabilitation for moderate–
severe TBI reviewed research data elements pertinent to the
assessment and rehabilitation of persons who receive a
Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 3–12 within 24 h of
injury or demonstrate post-traumatic amnesia for ‡ 24 h.
The workgroup focused on CDEs related to physical and
cognitive assessment, treatment interventions, and out-
come measures administered to both adult and pediatric
populations. The resulting CDE recommendations were
intended to apply to rehabilitation research conducted
within acute hospital, inpatient rehabilitation, and outpa-
tient settings.
 The workgroup on mild TBI/concussion studies addressed
research data elements pertinent to subjects who either re-
quire no hospitalization or acute medical care, only a brief
visit to the emergency department or physician without
hospital admission, or only a brief hospitalization related to
the TBI. The workgroup considered both acute and chronic
phases of mild TBI.
The composition of the four workgroups was determined by the
type of research facility the member represented, their TBI sub-
specialty, the types of TBI cohorts they had previously studied, and
their geographic location; diversity of perspectives was a major
consideration. Approximately half of the workgroup members were
former members, and the other half were new. Experts in both
pediatric and adult TBI research were included, as well as experts in
civilian and military TBI. New chairs were also appointed for the
workgroups (see Appendix for a list of the workgroup chairs and
members). Rather than separating workgroups into ‘‘imaging,’’
‘‘biomarkers,’’ ‘‘outcomes,’’ and ‘‘demographics’’ as was done in
creating v.1, all these topics were considered for respective TBI
patient groups within the new structure.
The process for updating the CDEs was similar to that used to
develop earlier versions and has been previously described.5,14
Brieﬂy, the CDEs are identiﬁed, deﬁned, and vetted by experts in
the scientiﬁc community, both nationally and internationally. The
participating agencies had a ‘‘hands off’’ approach, their staff
primarily serving to facilitate the process but not to determine the
content of the recommendations. Following an introductory call,
the workgroups held conference calls every 3–5 weeks for 4–6
months to reach consensus based on evidence and expert opinion.
In addition, the experience and knowledge gained from a
pilot study to test the feasibility and utility of collecting the TBI
CDEs was incorporated into the workgroup recommendations.17
In cases in which disagreements could not be resolved within the
workgroup, the issues were presented to the steering committee,
where a decision was agreed upon. The major criteria for inclu-
sion used by all the workgroups were that the v.1 data elements
should be preserved and that both new and previously identiﬁed
data elements should adhere to the updated category deﬁnitions
for core, basic, and supplemental CDEs (Table 1). After each
workgroup had reached consensus, the workgroup chairs met to
review all of the recommendations across groups. Next, the draft
CDEs were posted on the National Institute of Neurological
Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) CDE web site for external review

and vetting by the larger research community.18 The process was
transparent and inclusive, and collaboration with other agencies
and groups that have an interest in CDEs for TBI research was
encouraged.
Results
The most signiﬁcant changes overall between v.1 and v.2 of the
TBI CDEs were 1) a marked decrease in the number of core CDEs,
2) an expansion of the total number of CDEs to include more items
relevant to milder injuries and the more chronic phases of TBI, 3)
reorganization of the categories to include a second tier for items
highly relevant to speciﬁc types of studies but not to all studies,
called basic, 4) dropping the emerging tier for lack of evidence to
discriminate it from supplemental CDEs (Table 1), and 5) changing
the name to the International TBI Common Data Elements Project.
Additional minor changes included alignment of demographic data
elements with those endorsed by the National Library of Medicine,
to increase their generalizability across other disease areas, and
separation of the lists of individual data elements from outcome
measures, because the latter often include multiple data elements.
Revisions to the core CDEs
There was a 15-fold reduction in the number of core CDEs
between v.1 and v.2. The smaller number now more accurately
reﬂects ‘‘a very small set of items that are relevant to all TBI
clinical studies.’’ Despite their limited number, the core CDEs
cover several domains, including demographic characteristics, so-
cial status, injury characteristics, etiology, severity indicators, and
outcomes (Table 2). Most of the core CDEs pertain to both adults
and children, but a few items are age-speciﬁc (Table 2).

Recommendations for basic and supplemental CDEs
As mentioned, another major revision was that highly relevant
items beyond the core were added to meet the needs of four
common types of studies in the areas of: epidemiology, acute-
hospitalization; rehabilitation for moderate–severe TBI, and mild
TBI/concussion. CDEs and outcome measures that are highly rel-
evant or essential for these speciﬁc types of studies, but not nec-
essarily relevant to all other types of studies, were called basic
(Fig. 1). A summary of the basic CDEs for each study type follows.
Epidemiology studies.
The recommendations for the 24
basic CDEs for epidemiological studies were based on a logical
expansion beyond the core, and include: additional subject/par-
ticipant characteristics; details of educational and job status;
marital/partner status; details of the injury, for example, the Ohio
State University TBI Identiﬁcation Method (OSU TBI ID); reli-
ability of injury date; likelihood of abusive head trauma; Abbre-
viated Injury Scale score; duration of alteration of consciousness;
details of types of care received related to the injury, that is,
location of deﬁnitive clinical care and immediate medical services
received after injury, and emergency department and hospital
discharge destinations; and outcomes such as return to work/
school, type of residence, and date and cause of death.19,20 The
epidemiology basic CDEs contained one that was only for pedi-
atric populations (education status), and eight only for adults,
including job and marital status and the OSU TBI ID (Table 3).
Studies of acute, hospitalized patients.
As mentioned, the
acute, hospitalized subgroup refers to studies in which the sub-
jects are admitted to a hospital because of an acute TBI. Patients
in this category are commonly described as having ‘‘moderate’’
or ‘‘severe’’ TBI. However, members of this workgroup wished
to avoid use of the ‘‘mild/moderate/severe’’ classiﬁcation
scheme, which may blur important distinctions and oversim-
plify. The name of this category recognizes the immediate post-
injury time period during which these patients are seen. It also
acknowledges that all of these patients are admitted to the hos-
pital, even if only brieﬂy. The workgroup recommended 58 basic
CDEs for all ages, plus 1 pediatric-speciﬁc item (Fig. 1 and
Table 4).
Studies of rehabilitation for moderate–severe TBI.
The
workgroup for these kinds of studies endorsed 48 basic CDEs for all
ages, plus 1 adult-speciﬁc item and 1 pediatric-speciﬁc item (Fig. 1
and Table 5). Of these, ten are unique to rehabilitation research.
Four items were selected from the assessments and exams domain
to reﬂect early prognostic indicators (i.e., pupil reactivity, size and
shape, alteration of consciousness: reporter type), and are intended
to complement the GCS score from the core CDEs. Four items were
chosen from the treatment domain to characterize the nature of
therapeutic interventions applied (i.e., type of therapy, frequency
and duration of sessions, duration of course) (Table 5). The
workgroup acknowledged that TBI rehabilitation lacks a coherent
taxonomy to adequately characterize treatment approaches and

methods. This impedes the development of foundational treatment
constructs and places signiﬁcant constraints on comparative ef-
fectiveness research.
Mild TBI/concussion studies.
In the recommendations for
mild TBI/concussion studies, basic elements included 60 items for
all ages, plus 1 item speciﬁc to children (Fig. 1 and Table 6). The
basic CDEs included items that are relevant to studies of both the
acute and chronic phases of injury. An effort was made to incor-
porate some of the variables and outcome measures that are spe-
ciﬁcally used in military and sport-related concussion studies as
supplemental CDEs. Whereas the outcome measures were other-
wise generally retained from v.1, several were added to speciﬁcally
address research questions that are common within this area of
study. For example, the workgroup added symptom validity testing,
computerized batteries, and telephone follow-up as these were
considered important in many studies in this area.
Supplemental data.
In addition to the core and basic CDEs
there are hundreds of optional supplemental data elements and
outcome measurement tools that may be useful depending upon the
aims of the study.20 The list of supplemental items was intended to
be large and inclusive, in order to provide a broad range of options,
but is expected to gradually narrow as evidence accumulates in
favor of speciﬁc CDEs. The entire core, many of the basic, and
most of the supplemental CDEs are shared across two or more study
types, which will facilitate meta-analyses not only within, but also
across study types. It is also worth noting that the supplemental data
elements are not viewed as comprising an exhaustive list, and,
depending upon the purpose of the particular study, additional
items may be needed.
Recommendations for outcome measures
The four workgroups also reviewed an extensive list of assessment
instruments and scales for use in TBI research. One outcome measure
was recommended as a core recommendation, the Glasgow Outcome
Score - Extended, but only for older children and adults. The Pe-
diatric Glasgow Outcome Score - Extended was not recommended as
a core CDE for pediatric TBI, reﬂecting differences in expert opinion
regarding its utility for studying milder forms of TBI. In addition to
the one core outcome measure, a battery of basic outcome measures
was also recommended by three of the four workgroups (Table 7).
For studies of adults, the battery includes the Motor and Cognitive
subscales of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) to assess

motor and cognitive activity limitations, respectively. The Disability
Rating Scale (DRS) was chosen for global outcome assessment. To
investigate speciﬁc neuropsychological functions, the Processing
Speed Index from the Wechsler Adult Scale of Intelligence-IV was
recommended for evaluating speed of processing, the Trail Making
Test for attention and mental control, and the Rey Auditory Verbal
Learning Test or the California Verbal Learning Test for memory.
For evaluation of quality of life, the Satisfaction with Life Scale was
recommended; the Craig Handicap Assessment and Reporting
Technique (Short Form) was recommended for measuring societal
participation after moderate to severe TBI; and the Rivermead
Postconcussive Symptom Questionnaire was recommended for as-
sessing post-concussive symptoms after mild TBI. Finally, the Brief
Symptom Inventory-18 was recommended for assessment of psy-
chological status. Most of the measures described have comple-
mentary pediatric versions (Table 7).
Discussion
The goal of updating the CDEs was to maintain as much of the v.1
data elements as possible while addressing the need to reduce the
core CDEs, ﬁll critical gaps, and eliminate redundancies. This was
achieved by creating workgroups in which half of the members were
carried over from the v.1 workgroups to ensure continuity of the
concepts and process, and half were from new participants chosen to
bring in new perspectives. The reﬁnement of the core CDEs, the
creation of a new category called basic to target CDE recommen-
dations to speciﬁc types of studies, and the expansion of CDEs rel-
evant to milder and/or chronic TBI are all major strengths. At ﬁrst
glance, some data points that are routinely collected in TBI studies,
such as GCS score, may seem to have overlooked in compiling the
basic CDEs. However, it must be remembered that such elements are
classiﬁed as core and are recommended to be collected by all of the
various types of studies. Other improvements of v.2 are the elimi-
nation of redundant CDEs and alignment with the National Library
of Medicine standards. Finally, moving the emerging category of
CDEs into the supplemental category is another improvement, be-
cause it will facilitate data-driven comparisons of their usefulness.
A remaining issue across both versions of the CDEs is that the
battery of outcome measures that are highly recommended (basic)
includes ﬁve to nine assessments or tools depending up the study
type, which may be too many for practical use by most research
studies. Although a smaller battery of assessment tools would fa-
cilitate universal implementation, the workgroups were unable to
narrow the recommendations because of the breadth of symptoms
associated with TBI, the all-inclusive age range embraced by this
project, and the lack of evidence to strongly support one tool over
another. However, there are two new computer-adapted testing tools
that sound very promising. One is the Neuro-QOL, which is a very
comprehensive, patient-report outcome measure that has undergone
validation studies on adults with a variety of neurological disorders,
including TBI, but still needs pediatric validation studies.21 The
other is the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Toolbox for Neuro-
logical Function, which consists of a 2 h battery to assess cognitive,
emotional, executive, and sensorimotor function.22 The toolbox has
been validated in healthy subjects, but not yet in those with TBI.
Employing state-of-the-art technology makes it possible for these
tools to be very comprehensive, but also brief, because of the

adaptive testing utilized. Following validation studies in TBI popu-
lations, these two tools may provide brief, inexpensive, and reliable
outcome measures for both pediatric and adult TBI research.
One remaining concern with respect to v.2 is the seemingly
arbitrary nature by which some data elements are classiﬁed, such as
basic versus supplemental. This potential weakness is readily ac-
knowledged. This version of the CDEs balanced the evidence-
based practice approach with the imperatives of practicality. Future
revisions of the TBI CDEs will have a greater emphasis on con-
sidering the evidentiary basis for making such categorizations.
Before updating to v.3, many workgroup members recommend the
real-world use of v.2 to determine which CDEs and outcome
measures are most valuable for characterizing patient populations,
evaluating
tools,
and
predicting
outcomes.
Therefore,
im-
plementation of the TBI CDEs is the next major challenge. Im-
plementation will be facilitated by the newly developed Federal
Interagency TBI Research (FITBIR) Informatics System, which
will use the TBI CDEs as its data dictionary.23 FITBIR provides a
platform for data sharing, which will accelerate research by al-
lowing individual subject meta-analysis and rigorous comparisons
across studies. A further important step toward implementation will
be obtaining endorsements by professional organizations. Cur-
rently, the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the
Congress of Neurological Surgeons have endorsed v.2 of the TBI
CDEs. Translation into other languages to allow use in interna-
tional studies is also a priority for the future.
Looking beyond implementation, there is the larger question of
whether the International TBI Common Data Elements Project will
lead to signiﬁcant advances in knowledge. The concept of har-
monization of data elements to enable meta-analysis and collabo-
ration has emerged over the past decade. There are numerous
neurological diseases with CDEs, including stroke, epilepsy, and
Parkinson’s disease, which were created in a manner similar to
those for TBI.24 The Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
has demonstrated that data sharing can be very productive, and can
accelerate the development of biomarkers and address other
questions of high clinical relevance.25 The Institute of Medicine has
also described a vision for creating knowledge networks, which are
built on CDEs and data sharing, as a platform for personalized
medicine and better patient outcomes.26
Conclusion
The International CDE Project for TBI research has been en-
dorsed by numerous Federal agencies and professional organiza-
tions and will serve as the data dictionary for the newly developed
FITBIR Informatics System. The creation of v.2 was necessary to
increase the feasibility and relevance of the TBI CDEs to a wide
range of study types and populations. It is anticipated that addi-
tional new data elements and small modiﬁcations to the current
ones may occur in the near term, but that major revisions will be
postponed until enough data are in hand to justify the changes.
