Abstract. Understanding the effectiveness of air pollution
control policies is important for future policy making. China
has implemented strict air pollution control policies since the
11th Five-Year Plan (FYP). There is still a lack of overall
evaluation of the effects of air pollution control policies on
PM2.5 pollution improvement in China since the 11th FYP.
In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of air pollution
control policies from 2005 to 2017 on PM2.5 using satel-
lite remote sensing. We used the satellite-derived PM2.5 of
2005–2013 from one of our previous studies. For the data
of 2014–2017, we developed a two-stage statistical model to
retrieve satellite PM2.5 data using the Moderate Resolution
Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 aerosol
optical depth (AOD), assimilated meteorology, and land use
data. The ﬁrst stage is a day-speciﬁc linear mixed effects
(LME) model and the second stage is a generalized addi-
tive model (GAM). Results show that the Energy Conserva-
tion and Emissions Reduction (ECER) policy, implemented
in the 11th FYP period and focused on SO2 emissions con-
trol, had co-beneﬁts with PM2.5 reductions. The increasing
trends of PM2.5 pollution (1.88 and 3.14 µg m−3 year−1 for
all of China and the Jingjinji region in 2004–2007, p<0.005)
were suppressed after 2007. The overall PM2.5 trend for all
of China was −0.56 µg m−3 year−1 with marginal signiﬁ-
cance (p = 0.053) and PM2.5 concentrations in the Pearl
River Delta region had a big drop (−4.81 µg m−3 year−1,
p<0.001) in 2007–2010. The ECER policy during the 12th
FYP period was basically an extension of the 11th FYP pol-
icy. PM2.5 is a kind of composite pollutant which comprises
primary particles and secondary particles such as sulfate,
nitrate, ammonium, organic carbon, elemental carbon, etc.
Since the ECER policy focused on single-pollutant control, it
had shown great limitation for PM2.5 reductions. The PM2.5
concentrations did not decrease from 2010 to 2013 in pol-
luted areas (p values of the trends were greater than 0.05).
Therefore, China implemented two stricter policies: the 12th
FYP on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Key Re-
gions (APPC-KR) in 2012, and the Action Plan of Air Pol-
lution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP) in 2013. The goal
of air quality improvement (especially PM2.5 concentration
improvement) and measures for multi-pollutant control were
proposed. These policies led to dramatic decreases in PM2.5
after 2013 (−4.27 µg m−3 year−1 for all of China in 2013–
2017, p<0.001).

Introduction
Fine particulate matter (PM2.5, aerodynamic particulate mat-
ter with a diameter less than 2.5 µm) is a major atmospheric
pollutant, which has been shown to be strongly associated
with adverse health effects (e.g., cardiovascular and respira-
tory morbidity and mortality) in many epidemiological stud-
ies (Crouse et al., 2012; Dominici et al., 2006; Pope et al.,
2002). With the rapid economic development and industri-

Z. Ma et al.: Effects of air pollution control policies on PM2.5 pollution improvement in China
alization in the past decades, PM2.5 pollution has gradually
become a major environmental issue in China (Liu et al.,
2017a). However, the Chinese government did not focus on
the PM2.5 issues until 2012. Therefore, air pollution control
policies implemented before 2012 mainly focus on SO2, in-
dustrial dust, and soot emission control. The air pollution
control policies of China started to pay attention to PM2.5
since late 2012.
Understanding the effectiveness of air pollution control
policies is important for future air pollution control in China.
Several studies have examined the historical air pollution
control policies and their association with the trends of SO2,
NO2, and PM10 (Jin et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2011; Hu et
al., 2010). Since the national PM2.5 monitoring network was
established in late 2012, few studies have evaluated the ef-
fects of air pollution control policies on PM2.5 concentrations
before 2013 due to the lack of historical ground-monitoring
data. Therefore, it is difﬁcult to understand whether the air
pollution control policies had synergistic effects on PM2.5
reductions before 2012.
In recent years, many studies have shown that satellite
remote sensing provides a powerful tool to assess the spa-
tiotemporal trends of air pollution for both global and re-
gional scales (Miyazaki et al., 2017; Itahashi et al., 2012;
Krotkov et al., 2016). Estimating ground PM2.5 using satel-
lite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data was also an effective
way to ﬁll the spatiotemporal PM2.5 gaps left by ground-
monitoring networks (Liu, 2013, 2014; Hoff and Christopher,
2009). There are two major methods to estimate ground-
level PM2.5 concentrations using AOD data, i.e., the scal-
ing method and statistical approach (Liu, 2014). The scal-
ing method uses atmospheric chemistry models to simulate
the association between AOD and PM2.5, and then calcu-
late the satellite-derived PM2.5 using the equation Satellite-
derived PM2.5 = Simulated PM2.5
Simulated AOD × Satellite AOD (Liu, 2014).
Boys et al. (2014) and van Donkelaar et al. (2015) esti-
mated the global satellite PM2.5 time series using the scaling
method. Compared to the scaling method, statistical mod-
els have greater prediction accuracy but require large amount
of ground-measured PM2.5 data to develop the models (Liu,
2014). By taking advantage of the newly established ground
PM2.5 monitoring network, we developed a two-stage sta-
tistical model to estimate historical monthly mean PM2.5
concentrations using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-
radiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 Aqua AOD data in one
of our previous studies (Ma et al., 2016). Validation results
shows that this monthly PM2.5 dataset has high prediction
accuracy (R2 = 0.73). This accurate historical PM2.5 dataset
from 2004 to 2013 allowed us to examine the effects of pol-
lution control policies on PM2.5 concentrations. In this pre-
vious study (Ma et al., 2016), we preliminarily analyzed
the effects of Energy Conservation and Emissions Reduc-
tion (ECER) policy in the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2006–
2010). We found an inﬂection point around 2008, after which
PM2.5 concentration showed a slight decreasing trend, show-
ing the co-beneﬁts of the ECER policy. From 2013 to 2017,
China implemented the Action Plan of Air Pollution Preven-
tion and Control (APPC-AP), which focused on PM2.5 pol-
lution. Currently, there is still a lack of overall evaluation of
the effects of air pollution control policies on PM2.5 pollution
improvement in China from 2005 to 2017.
In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of air pollution
control policies from 2005 to 2017 on PM2.5 using satellite
remote sensing. We used the satellite-derived PM2.5 dataset
developed in our previous study (Ma et al., 2016). Since this
dataset was from 2004 to 2013 and data after 2014 have been
lacking, we extended the dataset to 2017 in the present work.
To keep consistent with our previous satellite PM2.5 dataset,
we used the same method as described in our previous study
(Ma et al., 2016).

Overview of air pollution control policies in China
from 2005 to 2017
During 2005 to 2017, China implemented a series of air
pollution prevention and control policies, including the 11th
FYP on Environmental Protection (2006–2010), ECER pol-
icy during the 11th FYP period, the 12th FYP on Environ-
mental Protection (2011–2015), the 12th FYP on ECER, the
12th FYP on Air Pollution Prevention and Control in Key
Regions (APPC-KR), and APPC-AP (2013–2017). The base
year, implementation period, major goals, and major mea-
sures are listed in Table 1.
During the 11th FYP period, there was no speciﬁc air pol-
lution control policy. Air pollution prevention and control
measures were incorporated into the whole environmental
protection plan or policy (i.e., 11th FYP on Environmen-
tal Protection and ECER policy). From Table 1 we can see
that the air pollution policies during the 11th FYP mainly
focused on total emission reduction. In this period, environ-
mental management in China was emission control oriented;
that is, the indicators for local governments’ environmental
performance assessment were emission reduction rates, not
the environmental quality. The 12th FYP on Environmental
Protection and ECER policy were basically the extension of
the 11th FYP policies, which mainly focused on emission
reduction.
The 12th FYP on APPC-KR is the ﬁrst special plan for
air pollution prevention and control. This plan proposed the
idea of uniﬁcation of total emission reduction and air quality
improvement. And it proposed the goals of air pollutant con-
centration control for the ﬁrst time. PM2.5 pollution control
was also incorporated into this plan. Although the implemen-
tation period of the 12th FYP on APPC-KR was 2011–2015,
it was issued in 29 October 2012. After that, China issued
the APPC-AP (2013–2017) in 10 September 2013, which
strengthened the air pollution control and the goals of air
quality improvement. These policies indicated that the focus

Data and methods
3.1
Satellite-based PM2.5 from 2004 to 2013
We estimated the monthly satellite-based PM2.5 data from
2004 to 2013 at 0.1◦resolution in our previous work (Ma et
al., 2016). Brieﬂy, we developed a two-stage statistical model
using MODIS Collection 6 AOD and assimilated meteorol-
ogy, land use data, and ground-monitored PM2.5 concentra-
tions in 2013. The overall model cross-validation R2 (coef-
ﬁcient of determination) was 0.79 (daily estimates) for the
model year. Since ground-monitored data before 2013 have
been lacking and therefore it is not possible to develop sta-
tistical models before 2013 to estimate historical PM2.5 con-
centrations. Thus, the historical PM2.5 concentrations (2004–
2012) were then estimated using the model developed based
on the 2013 model. Two methods were used to validate the
accuracy of historical estimates. First, we compared the his-
torical estimate monitoring data from Hong Kong and Tai-
wan before 2013. Second, we estimated PM2.5 concentra-
tions in the ﬁrst half of 2014 using the 2013 model and com-
pared them with the ground measurements to evaluate the
accuracy of PM2.5 estimates beyond the model year, which
can represent the accuracy of historical estimates. Valida-
tion results indicated that it accurately predicted PM2.5 con-
centrations with little bias at the monthly level (R2 = 0.73,
slope = 0.91).
For PM2.5 concentrations from 2004 to 2013, we used the
abovementioned satellite-based PM2.5 dataset, which was es-
timated using the model developed in 2013. First, this dataset
has shown high accuracy and has been widely used in envi-
ronmental epidemiological (Liu et al., 2016a; Wang et al.,
2018a), health impact (Liu et al., 2017b; Wang et al., 2018b),
and social economic impact (Chen and Jin, 2019; Yang and
Zhang, 2018) studies in China. Second, a recent study has
shown that the historical hindcast ability of the annual model
decreased when hindcast year was long before the model
year (Xiao et al., 2018). Therefore, we did not use the models
of 2014 to 2017 to estimate the hindcast PM2.5.
3.2
Satellite-based PM2.5 from 2014 to 2017
Unlike historical estimates from 2004 to 2012, we have
sufﬁcient ground-monitored PM2.5 data to develop statisti-
cal models after 2013, which allows us to estimate daily
PM2.5 concentrations accurately. Therefore, we developed
a separate PM2.5–AOD statistical model for each year of
2014–2017 to estimate the spatially resolved (0.1◦resolu-
tion) PM2.5 concentrations. To keep satellite PM2.5 estimates
of 2014–2017 consistent with our previous satellite PM2.5
dataset, we used the same method as described in our previ-
ous study (Ma et al., 2016). The data, model development,
and model validation are brieﬂy introduced as follows.
The data used in this study include ground-monitored
PM2.5 concentrations (µg m−3), Aqua MODIS Collection
6 Dark Target (DT) AOD and Deep Blue (DB) AOD
data, planetary boundary layer height (PBLH, 100 m), wind
speed (WS, m s−1) at 10 m above the ground, mean rel-
ative humidity in PBL (RH_PBLH, %), surface pressure
(PS, hPa), precipitation of the previous day (Precip_Lag1;
mm), MODIS active ﬁre spots, urban cover ( %), and for-
est cover ( %). ground-monitored PM2.5 data were col-
lected from the China Environmental Monitoring Center
(CEMC), environmental protection agencies of Hong Kong
and Taiwan. Figure 1 shows the ground PM2.5 monitors
used in this study. AOD data were downloaded from the
Level 1 and Atmospheric Archive and Distribution Sys-
tem (https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/, last access:
29 March 2019). Meteorological data were extracted from
Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation Sys-
tem GEOS-5 Forward Processing (GEOS 5-FP) meteorolog-
ical data (ftp://rain.ucis.dal.ca, last access: 29 March 2019).
MODIS ﬁre spots were from the NASA Fire Information
for Resource Management System (https://earthdata.nasa.
gov/earth-observation-data/near-real-time/ﬁrms, last access:
29 March 2019). Land use information were downloaded
from Resource and Environment Data Cloud Platform of
Chinese Academy of Science (http://www.resdc.cn/data.
aspx?DATAID=184, last access: 29 March 2019).
Previous studies have shown the data quality issue of
ground PM2.5 measurements from the CEMC network (Liu
et al., 2016b; Rohde and Muller, 2015). We performed the
data screening procedure before model ﬁtting. Abnormal val-
ues (extreme high or extreme low values for a site com-
pared with its neighboring sites, repeated values for contin-
uous hours, etc.) were deleted before model ﬁtting. We re-
quired at least 20 hourly records to calculate the daily aver-
age PM2.5 concentrations. DT and DB AOD were combined
using an inverse variance weighting method to improve the
spatial coverage of AOD data (Ma et al., 2016). These com-
bined AOD data have shown good consistency (R2 = 0.8,
mean bias = 0.07) with ground AOD measurements from the
Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) (Ma et al., 2016).
All data were assigned to a predeﬁned 0.1◦grid. Then all of
the variables were matched by grid cell and day of the year
(DOY) for model ﬁtting.
A two-stage statistical model was developed for each year
separately from 2014 to 2017. The ﬁrst-stage linear mixed ef-
fects (LME) model included day-speciﬁc random intercepts
and slopes for AOD, season-speciﬁc random slopes for me-
teorological variables, and ﬁxed slope for precipitation and
ﬁre spots. The model structure of ﬁrst-stage model is shown

was ﬁtted for each province separately. We created a buffer
zone for each province to include data with at least 3000 data
records and at least 300 d. We averaged overlapped predic-
tions from neighboring provinces to generate a smooth na-
tional PM2.5 concentration surface.
The second-stage generalized additive model (GAM) es-
tablished the relationship between the residuals of the ﬁrst-
stage model and smooth terms of geographical coordinates,
forest and urban cover.

s, s(ForestCover)s and s(UrbanCover)s are the smooth func-
tions of forest cover and urban area for grid cell s, and εst is
the error term.
To evaluate the model over-ﬁtting, 10-fold cross-validation
(CV) was used; that is, the model could have better prediction
performance in the model ﬁtting dataset than the data, which
are not included model ﬁtting. In 10-fold CV, all samples in
the model dataset are randomly and equally divided into 10
subsets. One subset was used as testing samples and the rest
of the subsets are used to ﬁt the model. This process was re-
peated for 10 rounds until each subset was used for testing
for once. Statistical indicators of coefﬁcient of determination
(R2), mean prediction error (MPE), and root mean squared
prediction error (RMSE) were calculated and compared be-
tween model ﬁtting and CV to assess model performance and
over-ﬁtting.
3.3
Time series analysis
Monthly mean PM2.5 concentrations for each grid cell were
calculated to perform the time series analysis. Following our
previous study (Ma et al., 2016), we required at least six daily
PM2.5 predictions in each month to calculate the monthly
mean PM2.5. We deseasonalized the monthly PM2.5 time se-
ries by calculating the monthly PM2.5 anomaly time series
for each grid cell to remove the seasonal effect. The PM2.5
trend for each grid cell was calculated using least squares
regression (Weatherhead et al., 1998):
(PM2.5)anomaly,s,m = (PM2.5)s,m −(PM2.5)s,j
m = 1,2,3,...,M; j = 1,2,3,..., 12,

s for month m during the calculating period; (PM2.5)s,m
is the estimated PM2.5 concentration at grid cell s for
month m; m is the month index and M is the total num-
ber of months during the calculating period (2004–2017,

tercept; β is the slope, which is also the trend of PM2.5
(µg m−3 month−1); and ε is the error term. The annual PM2.5
trend (µg m−3 year−1) is 12 × β. A t test was used to ob-
tain the statistical signiﬁcance of the trends. This method has
been successfully applied to trend analyses of monthly mean
PM2.5 and AOD anomaly time-series data (Hsu et al., 2012;
Boys et al., 2014; Zhang and Reid, 2010; Xue et al., 2019).
We analyzed the PM2.5 trend for different periods to examine
the effects of air pollution control policies on PM2.5 pollution
improvement.

Results and discussion
4.1
Validation of satellite-based PM2.5 concentrations
from 2014 to 2017
Table S1 in the Supplement summarized the statistics of
all variables for the modeling dataset from 2014 to 2017.
Overall, there are 95 649, 110 805, 113 490, and 123 652
matchups for the model ﬁtting datasets for years of 2014,
2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. The average PM2.5 con-
centration decreases year by year, from 65.66 µg m−3 in 2014
to 48.32 µg m−3 in 2017. Correspondingly, the average AOD
also shows a decreasing trend from 0.67 in 2014 to 0.50 in
2017.
Figure 2 shows the model ﬁtting and cross-validation re-
sults for each year’s model. The model ﬁtting R2 ranges from
0.75 (2015) to 0.80 (2017) and CV R2 ranges from 0.72
(2015) to 0.77 (2017), which is similar to the 2013 model
(0.82 for model ﬁtting and 0.79 for CV) developed in our
previous study (Ma et al., 2016). The model prediction accu-
racy is different among years, which is consistent with pre-
vious studies. Hu et al. (2014) studied the 10-year spatial
and temporal trends of PM2.5 concentrations in the south-
eastern US from 2001 to 2010. They developed a separate
two-stage statistical model for each year and found the CV
R2 ranged from 0.62 in 2009 to 0.78 in 2005 and 2006. Kloog
et al. (2011, 2012) conducted two studies in the northeastern
US and also found that the validation R2 varied among years.
Compared to the model ﬁtting R2, the CV R2 only decreases
by 0.02 in 2016 and 0.03 in 2014, 2015, and 2017, show-
ing that our models were not substantially over-ﬁtted. For
the monthly mean concentrations calculated from at least six
daily PM2.5 predictions, the validation R2 values range from
0.75 to 0.81 (Fig. 3). The results show that the overall predic-
tion accuracy of the models from 2014 to 2017 is satisfying.
The ﬁxed effects, model ﬁtting, and CV results of the ﬁrst-
stage LME model for each province are shown in Tables S2–
S5. AOD is the only variable that was statistically signiﬁcant
in all provincial models for all years (p<0.05). Wind speed,
relative humidity, precipitation, and ﬁre spots were signiﬁ-
cant in most provincial models. The CV R2 varies for differ-
ent provinces and different years. The CV R2 values range
from 0.61 in Xinjiang to 0.77 in Heilongjiang for 2014, from
0.34 in Xinjiang to 0.76 in Hebei for 2015, from 0.44 in Ti-
bet to 0.77 in Jiangsu for 2016, and from 0.38 in Xinjiang
to 0.79 in Sichuan for 2017. We also ﬁtted a ﬁrst-stage LME
model for all of China. Results show that the overall CV R2
values for the ﬁrst-stage LME model dropped to 0.57, 0.52,
0.56, and 0.54, for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.
Therefore, ﬁtting the ﬁrst-stage model for each province sep-
arately can greatly improve the prediction accuracy.
A potential source of uncertainties in statistical models
is the uneven spatial distribution of ground PM2.5 moni-
tors. The CEMC air quality network mainly covers large ur-
ban centers with very limited site coverage in rural areas,
especially in western part of the country. Since it requires
a large amount of ground-measured PM2.5 data to develop
satellite-based statistical model, this bias cannot be avoided.
Despite this limitation, high model performances, which are
much better than those using the scaling method, have been
achieved in this study and previous similar studies (Zheng et
al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018; Xue et al., 2019). For example,
Geng et al. (2015) estimated long-term PM2.5 concentrations
in China using a scaling method and found the validation R2
of PM2.5 predictions was 0.72 compared to the 5-month aver-
aged ground PM2.5 concentrations for January–May 2013. A
global study of PM2.5 estimates combining scaling and sta-
tistical methods shows that their validation R2 of long-term
average PM2.5 was 0.67 for their ﬁrst-stage scaling method
(van Donkelaar et al., 2016).
4.2
Overall spatial and temporal trend of PM2.5
concentrations in China from 2004 to 2017
Figure 4 shows that spatial distribution characteristics of
annual mean PM2.5 concentrations are similar among the
years from 2004 to 2017. The most polluted area was the
North China Plain (including the south of the Jingjinji re-
gion, Henan, and Shandong Provinces), which was also the
largest polluted area. The Sichuan Basin (including eastern
Sichuan and western Chongqing) is another polluted area.
The cleanest areas were mainly located in Tibet, Hainan, Tai-
wan, Yunnan, and the north of Inner Mongolia. The spatial
distributions of satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations from
2013 to 2017 are consistent with the spatial characteristics of
ground-monitored PM2.5 (Fig. S2).
Figure 5 shows the spatial distributions of PM2.5 trends
and signiﬁcance levels in China from 2004 to 2017. Overall,

the PM2.5 pollution level of most areas in China showed a de-
creasing trend (p<0.05). Figure 6 and Table 2 show that the
overall trends of 2004–2017 for all of China and the Jingjinji,
Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and Pearl River Delta (PRD) re-
gions were −1.27, −1.55, −1.60, and −1.27 µg m−3 year−1
(all p<0.001), respectively. Back to Fig. 4, we can see
that the decrease in PM2.5 mainly happened after 2013.
PM2.5 concentrations showed an obvious increase from 2004
to 2007. The area with PM2.5 concentrations higher than
100 µg m−3 continuously expanded during this period. From
2008 to 2013, the pollution levels plateaued in most areas.
After 2013, the PM2.5 concentrations obviously decreased.
4.3
Effect of ECER policy during the 11th Five-Year
Plan period
To assess the effect of ECER policy during the 11th FYP, we
calculated the trends of PM2.5 for 2005–2010, 2004–2007,
and 2007–2010 for each grid cell (Fig. 7).
Compared to the base year (2005) of the 11th FYP pe-
riod, the overall PM2.5 pollution of 2010 did not show ob-
vious change. Some of the area showed decreasing trends
(Fig. 7a) but the trends were insigniﬁcant (Fig. 7b). Some re-
gions (Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu provinces and north-
eastern China) showed a slight increasing trend (∼1–
2 µg m−3 year−1, p<0.001). Overall, the trends for all of
China and the Jingjinji, YRD, and PRD regions were all in-
signiﬁcant (0.41, 0.26, 0.61, and −1.26 µg m−3 year−1, and
all p>0.1) during the 11th FYP period.

Figure 5. Spatial distributions of PM2.5 trends and signiﬁcance levels in China from 2004 to 2017.
However, when separating this period into two periods, we
can see that before 2007, the PM2.5 concentrations generally
had signiﬁcant increasing trends (Fig. 7c, d), especially in
the south of the Jingjinji region and in Henan, Shandong, and
Hubei provinces. The overall trends for all of China and the
Jingjinji region are 1.88 (p<0.001) and 3.14 µg m−3 year−1
(p<0.005) (Table 2). The trends for YRD and PRD regions
are insigniﬁcant. During the 10th FYP period, China missed
the emission control goals. The emission of sulfur dioxide in-
creased by ∼28 % (Xue et al., 2014; Schreifels et al., 2012).
The 11th FYP for National Economic and Social Develop-
ment of China released in 2006 proposed the ECER goals.

However, China did not achieve the annual goal in 2006.
These could explain the increasing trend of PM2.5 during
2004–2007.
After that, China released the Comprehensive Work-
ing Plan on ECER (http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2007-06/03/
content_634545.htm, last access: 29 March 2019) in 2007 to
strengthen the ECER measures. Major control measures in-
cluded (Schreifels et al., 2012) implementing ﬂue gas desul-
furization for coal-ﬁred power plants, closing inefﬁcient and
backward production centers, implementing energy conser-
vation projects, increasing the pollution levy for SO2 emis-
sion, recommending baghouse dust ﬁlters for industrial soot
and dust emission control, etc. As a result, great achieve-
ments had been made at the end of 11th FYP (Schreifels
et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2015): total emission of SO2 de-
creased by ∼14 % compared to the level of 1995; approxi-
mately 86 % of the power plants were installed with desulfu-
rization facilities in 2010 compared to 14 % in 2005; nearly
80 GW of small coal-ﬁred power units were closed during
2006–2010; soot emission of coal-ﬁred power plants in 2010
was reduced by 55.6 % compared with that in 2005, etc.
Due to these control measures, the increasing trend of
PM2.5 pollution was suppressed after 2007. PM2.5 concentra-
tions of central and southern China decreased signiﬁcantly,
with highest trend of around −9 µg m−3 year−1 (Fig. 7e, f),
p<0.01). The south of Jingjinji region and Henan, Shan-
dong, and Hubei provinces, which had signiﬁcantly in-
creased before 2007, showed insigniﬁcant trends (Fig. 7f,
p>0.05). Table 2 shows that the overall PM2.5 trend for all of
China was −0.56 µg m−3 year−1 with marginal signiﬁcance
(p = 0.053). Overall trends for the Jingjinji and YRD regions
were not signiﬁcant during the latter half of the 11th FYP
period. And PM2.5 concentrations in the PRD region had
a big drop (−4.81 µg m−3 year−1, p<0.001). Results show
that although air pollution control policies of the 11th FYP
were not designed for PM2.5 prevention and control, they still
had co-beneﬁts on PM2.5 pollution control. There were two
main reasons. First, SO2 is the precursor gas of sulfate. Pre-
vious studies have shown that sulfate was the major compo-
nent of PM2.5 during the 11th FYP period (Li et al., 2009,
2010; Pathak et al., 2009). The reduction of SO2 could there-
fore contribute to the suppression of increasing PM2.5 pollu-
tion. Second, the control of industrial dust and soot, which
include a portion of primary PM2.5 (Yao et al., 2009), also
contributed to the PM2.5 pollution reduction.

Effect of air pollution control policies in the 12th
Five-Year Plan period (2011–2015)
Figure 8a and b show that most of the areas of China show
a signiﬁcant decreasing trend during the 12th FYP period.
PM2.5 concentrations of all of China, Jingjinji, and YRD
dropped by 2.89, 3.63, and 3.33 µg m−3 year−1 (p<0.001).
When considering the years from 2010 to 2013, although
the overall trend of all of China was −1.03 µg m−3 year−1
(p<0.05, Table 2), the decreasing trend mainly happened
in Xinjiang and central Inner Mongolia. The deserts in Xin-
jiang and Inner Mongolia are the major sources of dust pollu-
tion in China. A recent study showed that dust is the largest
contributor to PM2.5 over this region (Philip et al., 2014).
The change in natural dust in desert areas may be the major
contributor to the decreasing trend of PM2.5 during 2010–
2013. Most of the polluted area in China did not show ob-
vious change (Fig. 8c and d). As we mentioned above, The
ECER policy during the 12th FYP period was basically the
extension of the policy in the 11th FYP, which mainly fo-
cused on emissions reduction. Due to the development of the
social economy, the ECER policy has shown limitations in
PM2.5 reduction. PM2.5 is a kind of composite pollutant and
its constituents includes primary particles and secondary par-
ticles such as sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, organic carbon, el-
emental carbon, etc. With the deepening of SO2 and indus-

trial dust and soot emission reduction, their contributions to
PM2.5 pollution control would be reduced, although the 12th
FYP on Environmental Protection also proposed a 10 % re-
duction of NOx from 2010 to 2015. However, along with eco-
nomic growth in China, the beneﬁts of emission control for
a single pollutant could be offset by increased energy usage.
Considering the complicated PM2.5 compositions, compre-
hensive and coordinated control measures for multiple pollu-
tants are urgently needed.
Therefore, China issued the 12th FYP on APPC-KR in
late 2012, which is the ﬁrst special plan for air pollution pre-
vention and control and focused on air quality improvement.
APPC-KR proposed a series of key projects which included
477 SO2 treatment projects, 755 NOx treatment projects,
10 073 industrial soot and dust treatment projects, 1311 VOC
treatment projects in key industrial sectors, 281 vapor re-
covery projects for oil and gas, 188 yellow-sticker vehicle
elimination projects, 192 fugitive dust comprehensive treat-
ment projects, and 122 capacity building projects. An En-
glish translation of APPC-KR and its key projects has been
prepared by the Clean Air Alliance of China (CAAC) and can
be found elsewhere (http://www.cleanairchina.org/product/
6347.html, last access: 29 March 2019) (CAAC, 2013c, a).
In addition, in 2012, China issued a new air quality stan-
dard, i.e., the National Ambient Air Quality Standard of
China (NAAQS) (GB 3095-2012). Compared with the for-
mer NAAQS (GB 3095-1996) issued in 1996, this new stan-
dard incorporated PM2.5 as a major control pollutant. Ac-
cording to GB 3095-2012, the Level 1 annual mean standard
of PM2.5 is 15 µg m−3, which is assigned for protecting the
air quality of natural reserves and scenic areas and is equiv-
alent to the World Health Organization (WHO) Air Quality
Interim Target-3 (IT-3). The Level 2 standard of 35 µg m−3 is
designated for residential, cultural, industrial, and commer-
cial areas, which is equivalent to WHO Air Quality Interim
Target-1 (IT-1). Meanwhile, a comprehensive real-time air

quality monitoring network covering 74 major Chinese cities
was established in late 2012.
The implementation of APPC-KR, together with the im-
plementation of APPC-AP starting from 2013 (shown in the
following section), led to dramatic drops in PM2.5 concen-
trations in China after 2013. Table 3 shows PM2.5 concentra-
tion improvement goals and ﬁnal accomplishments for key
regions (see Fig. S1) of the 12th FYP on APPC-KR calcu-
lated from satellite PM2.5. Results show that all key regions
accomplished the goals except for Yinchuan. The changes
in population-weighted averages also show similar results.
Overall, the 12th FYP on APPC-KR accomplished its air
pollution control goals. And the decrease in PM2.5 concen-
trations was mainly attributable to the decrease after 2013.

Effect of Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention
and Control (2013–2017)
China issued the APPC-AP (2013–2017) in late 2013, which
further strengthened the air pollution control measures and
air quality improvement goals. The air pollution control mea-
sures included 10 categories:
– increase effort for comprehensive pollution control, re-
duce emissions of multi-pollutants;
– optimize industrial structure and promote industrial re-
structuring;
– accelerate technology transformation and improve inno-
vation capability;
– adjust energy structure and increase clean energy sup-
ply;

Detailed measures of the APPC-AP can be found in
English translation at http://www.cleanairchina.org/product/
6349.html (last access: 29 March 2019) (CAAC, 2013b). To
ensure that APPC-AP goals could be accomplished, China
adopted a temporary measure in 2017, i.e., the intensi-
ﬁed supervision for air pollution control in Jingjinji and
the surrounding area (http://www.gov.cn/hudong/2017-07/
14/content_5210588.htm, last access: 29 March 2019). There
had been great achievements at the end of 2017. For ex-
ample (Zheng et al., 2018), 71 % of the power plants met
the ultralow emission levels; the average efﬁciency of coal-
ﬁred power units decreased from 321 g.c.e. kWh−1 in 2013
to 309 g.c.e. kWh−1 in 2017; non-methane volatile organic
compound (NMVOC) emissions were cut down by 30 %
through the implementation of a leak detection and repair
(LDAR) program for the petrochemical industry; all coal
boilers smaller than 7 MW in urban areas were shut down;
and all “yellow label” vehicles (referring to gasoline and
diesel vehicles that fail to meet Euro 1 and Euro 3 standards,
respectively) were eliminated by the end of 2017, to name a
few.
The implementation of APPC-AP, together with the 12th
FYP on APPC-KR, had led to a dramatic drop in PM2.5 con-
centrations from 2013 to 2017 (Fig. 8e and f). PM2.5 trends
of 2013–2017 for all of China, Jingjinji, YRD, and PRD re-
gions were −4.27, −6.77, −6.36, and −2.11 µg m−3 year−1
(all p<0.05), respectively (Table 2). This is compara-
ble to a recent study (Silver et al., 2018), which found
that the median trend in annual mean PM2.5 concentra-
tion across all ground air pollution monitoring stations is
−3.4 µg m−3 year−1 from 2015 to 2017. Table 4 shows
PM2.5 concentration improvement goals and ﬁnal accom-
plishments for APPC-AP. The goals required that PM2.5
concentrations in Jingjinji, YRD, and PRD regions in 2017
should decrease by 25 %, 20 %, and 15 % compared to
2012, and the annual mean PM2.5 of Beijing should reach
around 60 µg m−3. Since there were no ground measure-
ments in 2012, the Ministry of Ecology and Environment
(MEE) of China used 2013 as the base year to assess the
performance of APPC-AP (http://www.mee.gov.cn/gkml/

sthjbgw/stbgth/201806/t20180601_442262.htm, last access:
29 March 2019). To maintain consistency with the ofﬁcial
performance assessment, we also used 2013 as the base
year. Results show that the arithmetic average of satellite
PM2.5 concentrations for Jingjinji, YRD, and PRD regions
decreased by 36.9 %, 37.1 %, and 14.0 %, respectively, and
annual mean PM2.5 of Beijing was 44.67 µg m−3 in 2017.
From the view of satellite, Jingjinji, YRD, and Beijing ac-
complished their goals, and PRD was very close to the goal.
However, the pollution level was still higher than WHO Air
Quality IT-1 level and NAAQS (GB 3095-2012) Level 2 an-
nual PM2.5 standards (both 35 µg m−3).
According to the ofﬁcial results of APPC-AP performance
assessment (Table 4), PM2.5 of Jingjinji, YRD, and PRD re-
gions decreased by 39.6 %, 34.3 %, and 27.7 %, respectively.
And annual mean PM2.5 of Beijing was 58 µg m−3 in 2017.
Compared to the arithmetic average satellite PM2.5, the pop-
ulations weighted average results (Table 4) are closer to the
ofﬁcial results. The main reason is that ofﬁcial performance
assessment used ground measurements. However, the spatial
distribution of ground monitors is uneven. Most of the sites
are distributed in populated urban areas and only a few are
located in rural areas. Compared to ground monitors, satel-
lite remote sensing has more comprehensive spatial cover-
age. Figure S3 shows the spatial distribution of satellite and
ground PM2.5 concentrations of 2017 in Beijing. It can be
seen that the ground monitors are clustered in polluted ur-
ban centers. The cleaner north and northwest of Beijing have
few sites. Thus the population-weighted results of satellite
PM2.5 are closer to the ofﬁcial results, but still have dif-
ferences. Since satellites have better spatial coverage than
ground monitors, satellite PM2.5 can better represent the spa-
tial variation of PM2.5 pollution. The population-weighted
average satellite PM2.5 can better represent the health impact
of PM2.5 pollution. When using ground monitors to calcu-
late the regional mean concentrations, the weights of area
and population for each site should be considered.

Discussion and conclusions
Xue et al. (2019) developed a machine learning method
to estimate PM2.5 concentrations in China from 2000 to
2016. They reported that overall trends of PM2.5 in China
were 2.097 µg m−3 year−1 (p<0.001), 0.299 µg m−3 year−1
(p>0.05), and −4.511 µg m−3 year−1 (p<0.001) in 2000–
2007, 2008–2013, and 2013–2016, respectively. Lin et
al. (2018) estimated high-resolution PM2.5 in annual scale in
China from 2001 to 2015, and found national-scale trends of
0.04, −0.65, and −2.33 µg m−3 year−1 in 2001–2005, 2005–
2010, and 2011–2015, respectively. Overall, our satellite-
based PM2.5 trends are consistent with these two recent stud-
ies, except that we found no signiﬁcant trend from 2005 to
2010 (0.41 µg m−3 year−1 but p>0.05), which is different
from the study of Lin et al. (2018). The main reason could be
that they did not include western China in their study area,
and statistical signiﬁcance levels were not reported in their
study, which means that it is not known whether the trend
was signiﬁcant or not.
Although there have been several studies on the histori-
cal trends of PM2.5 in China, few have looked at the relations
between the trends and air pollution control policies. This pa-
per reviewed the air pollution control policies from 2005 to
2017. And for the ﬁrst time we gave an overall evaluation of
the effects of these policies on PM2.5 pollution improvement
in China from the perspective of satellite remote sensing. Re-
sults show that our satellite PM2.5 dataset is a good source to
evaluate the performance of air pollution policies. The trends
of satellite-derived PM2.5 concentrations are consistent with
the implementation of air pollution control policies in differ-
ent periods.
The ECER policy implemented in the 11th FYP period
(see Table 1 and Sect. 4.3) had co-beneﬁts with PM2.5 pol-
lution control. The overall PM2.5 pollution decreased to a
certain extent (−0.56 µg m−3 year−1 for all of China, p =
0.053) after 2007, but the effects were limited. The Envi-
ronmental Protection Plan and ECER policy during the 12th
FYP period were basically the extension of the 11th FYP pol-
icy, with additional total emission control on NOx. However,
the total emission control oriented policy had shown its lim-

itation. The PM2.5 concentrations of polluted areas did not
decrease from 2010 to 2013 (e.g., −0.45 µg m−3 year−1 for
the Jingjinji region, p = 0.783).
To address the PM2.5 pollution issue, China implemented
two strict policies: the 12th FYP on APPC-KR in 2012 and
APPC-AP in 2013. The goal of air quality improvement
was proposed for the ﬁrst time. Besides, China incorporated
PM2.5 as a major control pollutant into the National Ambient
Air Quality Standard (GB 3095-2012). All these policies (de-
tails can be found in Table 1 and Sect. 4.4 and 4.5) led to dra-
matic decreases in PM2.5 after 2013 (−4.27 µg m−3 year−1
for all of China, p<0.001). And the implementation of these
policies was also an important mark that environmental man-
agement in China began to change from total emission con-
trol oriented mode to environmental quality improvement
oriented mode.
It should be noted that interannual variation in meteorol-
ogy has also contributed to the changes in PM2.5. A recent
study shows that meteorological conditions contributed ap-
proximately 20 % of the PM2.5 reduction in Beijing from
2013 to 2017, while the control of anthropogenic emissions
contributed 80 % (Chen et al., 2019). In addition, the slow-
down of economic development after the ﬁnancial crisis in
2008 might contribute to the PM2.5 emissions reduction. Ac-
cording to the China Statistical Yearbook (NBS, 2018), the
gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate decreased from
14.2 % in 2007 to 6.9 % in 2017. However, the GDP growth
rates are still relatively high at the current stage (6 %–7 %).
Contrarily, the PM2.5 concentrations have decreased dramat-
ically. Without effective air pollution control policies, the
PM2.5 pollution level would not decrease rapidly. Therefore,
the effective air pollution control policy was the main rea-
son for PM2.5 pollution reduction after 2013. Meteorological
conditions also contributed a small portion of PM2.5 reduc-
tions.
The trends in PM2.5 concentrations in China also showed
spatial heterogeneity. Multiple reasons may explain the re-
gional differences, e.g., the pollution levels of base year,
the regional differences of industrial structures, the spatial
heterogeneity of anthropogenic and natural emissions, eco-
nomic and industry development differences, variations of
regional policies, and variations of meteorological condi-
tions.
Currently, China has achieved great success in PM2.5 pol-
lution control. However, PM2.5 concentrations in many areas
are still much higher than the Level 2 annual PM2.5 standard
of 35 µg m−3 of GB 3095-2012, which corresponds to WHO
Air Quality IT-1. China has implemented a new air pollution
control policy from 2018, i.e., the Three-year Action Plan to
Win the Battle for Blue Skies (2018–2020). China’s air qual-
ity is expected to be further improved in the next 3 years.
This study extended the satellite PM2.5 dataset in our pre-
vious study (Ma et al., 2016) to the year of 2017 and obtained
longer time series of satellite PM2.5 data, which can provide
more spatially resolved and highly accurate PM2.5 data for
epidemiological, health impact assessment, and social eco-
nomic impact studies in China.
