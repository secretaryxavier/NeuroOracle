EsxA is required for virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and plays an essential role in 
phagosome rupture and translocation to the cytosol of macrophages. Recent biochemical studies have 
demonstrated that EsxA is a membrane-permeabilizing protein. However, evidence that link EsxA 
membrane-permeabilizing activity to Mtb cytosolic translocation and virulence is lacking. Here we 
found that mutations at glutamine 5 (Q5) could up or down regulate EsxA membrane-permeabilizing 
activity. The mutation Q5K signiƤcantly diminished the membrane-permeabilizing activity, while Q5V 
enhanced the activity. By taking advantage of the single-residue mutations, we tested the effects of 
EsxA membrane-permeabilizing activity on mycobacterial virulence and cytosolic translocation using 
the esxA/esxB knockout strains of Mycobacterium marinum (Mm) and Mtb. Compared to wild type (WT), 
the Q5K mutant exhibited signiƤcantly attenuated virulence, evidenced by intracellular survival and 
cytotoxicity in mouse macrophages as well as infection of zebra Ƥsh embryos. The attenuated virulence 
of the Q5K mutant was correlated to the impaired cytosolic translocation. On the contrary, the Q5V 
mutant had a signiƤcantly increased cytosolic translocation and showed an overall increased virulence. 
This study provides convincing evidence that EsxA contributes to mycobacterial virulence with its 
membrane-permeabilizing activity that is required for cytosolic translocation.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis, is considered one of the most successful 
pathogens. It is estimated that Mtb infects one-third of the world’s population and kills more than one million 
people each year1,2. At the early stage of infection, Mtb is internalized into the phagosome of host alveolar mac-
rophage. Instead of being destroyed in the phagolysosomal compartment, Mtb inhibits phagosome-lysosome 
fusion, persists and replicates within the phagosome3–5. Recent studies have also shown that upon 
lysosome-phagosome fusion, Mtb progressively translocates from phago-lysosomes into the cytosol6, where Mtb 
replicates and spread to new cells7,8. Phagosomal maturation arrest and cytosolic translocation have been attrib-
uted, at least in part, to a Type VII secretion system, termed ESX-16–11. Te esx-1 locus was ﬁrst revealed by the 
comparative genomic studies, in which Region of Diﬀerence 1 (part of the esx-1 locus) was found to be present in 
Mtb, but not in the attenuated vaccine strain Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG)12,13. Deletion

of esx-1 from Mtb resulted in attenuation of virulence and retention of mycobacteria in the phagosome, while 
transfer of esx-1 into BCG partially restored virulence14–21. Te esx-1 locus comprises nine genes that encode the 
ESX-1 secretion system and two secreted eﬀector proteins: 6-kDa early-secreted antigenic target (ESAT-6, EsxA 
or Rv3875) and 10-kDa culture ﬁltrate protein (CFP-10, EsxB or Rv3874)22–24. Te two proteins form a heterodi-
mer and are secreted out of Mtb in a co-dependent manner25,26.
EsxA was ﬁrst identiﬁed as a potent T-cell antigen in the short-term culture ﬁltrate of Mtb27,28. Since then EsxA 
has been intensively characterized as a potential candidate of novel vaccines and immune-therapeutics against 
tuberculosis29. In recent years, EsxA has been recognized as a virulence factor essential for Mtb pathogenesis. It 
was found that Mtb and M. leprae were able to translocate from the phagolysosomal compartment into the cytosol 
of myeloid cells, and the cytosolic translocation was dependent on secretion of EsxA and EsxB6. Moreover, the 
ESX-1/EsxA-mediated cytosolic translocation controlled virulence of mycobacteria7. Using a β​-lactamase-based 
FRET microscopy, a recent study showed that M. marinum (Mm) wild type strain induced phagosomal rupture 
and translocated to the cytosol, while the EsxA secretion–deﬁcient strain did not8. Similarly, Mtb translocated 
from the phagosome to the cytosol, while BCG did not. Introduction of RD1 into BCG conferred it the ability to 
translocate to the cytosol. While deletion of the C-terminus of EsxA did not aﬀect EsxA secretion, it disabled the 
cytosolic translocation6, which is consistent to the recent biochemical study that deletion of C-terminal ﬂexible 
arm of EsxA caused defects in membrane permeabilization30. Mycobacterial cytosolic translocation was also 
observed in the infected mice by a FRET-based ﬂow cytometry11. All of the compelling evidence suggests that 
EsxA plays an essential role in cytosolic translocation, and the ability of cytosolic translocation links to mycobac-
terial virulence.
However, the molecular details how EsxA functions in phagosome rupture and mycobacterial cytosolic trans-
location is not known. Several independent studies have suggested that EsxA has a membrane-lytic activity. In an 
earlier planar lipid bilayer study, either EsxA alone or in combination with EsxB caused disruption of the artiﬁcial 
membranes17. EsxA, but not EsxB, exhibited strong association with the liposomes and lysed the liposomes at 
acidic pH31. Mm infection or incubation with the puriﬁed EsxA induced pore formation on the red blood cell 
membranes with an estimated pore size ~4.5 nm in diameter32.
In the past several years, we have been systematically characterizing the membrane-permeabilizing activity of 
EsxA. We have found that EsxA, but not EsxB, induced leakage of liposomes in an acidic pH-dependent manner, 
which was accompanied by signiﬁcant conformational changes and increased solvent-exposed hydrophobicity33. 
We have presented the ﬁrst direct evidence that EsxA inserts into membranes with the two α​-helixes forming a 
membrane-spanning domain30. More interestingly, compared to EsxA from Mtb, the orthologous EsxA from 
non-pathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis (Ms) was inactive in membrane interaction, despite that they share 
over 76% homology33. Tis ﬁnding has raised a notion that the membrane-permeabilizing activity of EsxA is a 
major determinant for virulence phenotype of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Here, we present evi-
dence that single-residue mutations at Q5 of EsxA either up or down regulate the membrane-permeabilizing 
activity, which consequently enhances or attenuates mycobacterial virulence in macrophages and in zebra ﬁsh 
embryos through up or down regulation of mycobacterial cytosolic translocation.
Results
Mutations at Q5 up or down regulated the membrane-permeabilizing activity of MtbEsxA.  
Sequence alignment shows that MtbEsxA shares 93% homology with MmEsxA and 76% homology with MsEsxA 
(Fig. 1a). It promoted us to characterize the diﬀerential membrane-permeabilizing activities among diﬀerent 
EsxA proteins. Presumably, the residues that are common or similar between MtbEsxA and MmEsxA, but diﬀer-
ent in MsEsxA, are likely associated to membrane-permeabilizing activity. In a systematic mutagenesis analysis, 
we serendipitously found that mutations at Q5 were able to up- or down-regulate its membrane-permeabilizing 
activity using the ANTS/DPX (ﬂuorophore and quencher) liposome leakage assay (Fig. 1b), in which the lipos-
omes are pre-loaded with ANTS/DPX and the ANTS ﬂuorescence is de-quenched when EsxA forms pores on the 
liposomal membrane to release DPX30,33. Te MtbEsxA(Q5V) mutant had a stronger activity than wild type (WT). 
Similarly, the Q5L mutant had a similar activity as Q5V, suggesting that a hydrophobic residue at this position 
enhances the activity. Interestingly, replacing Q5 with the basic residues K or R signiﬁcantly reduced the activity, 
while replacing Q5 with the acidic residue E had little eﬀect. Tis result was probably due to diﬀerent charge 
states of basic and acidic residues at low pH (pH ~4), where K and R are positively charged, while E (pKa ~4.1)  
is (at least partly) protonated and neutral. Together, the result indicates that residues of diﬀerent properties 
(charged, neutral or hydrophobic) at the ﬁfh position are able to up or down regulate the membrane-permeabi-
lizing activity of MtbEsxA.
To further conﬁrm the result, we set out to test the eﬀects of Q5K and Q5V mutations on membrane inser-
tion. NBD (N,N′-Dimethyl-N-(Iodoacetyl)-N′-(7-Nitrobenz-2-Oxa-1,3-Diazol-4-yl)Ethylenediamine), an 
environment-sensitive dye, emits ﬂuorescence when it is shifed from an aqueous solution to a hydrophobic envi-
ronment (e.g. lipid membranes). Tus, NBD ﬂuorescence is an excellent marker for protein membrane insertion. 
In our previous study, we generated dozens of single-Cysteine mutants of EsxA and labeled them with NBD at the 
engineered Cys residues by maleimide reaction. Using NBD ﬂuorescence, we have mapped the trans-membrane 
domain of EsxA, showing that both Helix 1 and 2 insert into the membrane upon acidiﬁcation30. We have found 
that the NBD labeled at S35C emitted a strong ﬂuorescence, suggesting that S35C is a good position for NBD labe-
ling and for testing membrane insertion30. Tus, we introduced Q5K and Q5V mutations into the EsxA(S35C) 
construct. Unfortunately, EsxA(Q5V/S35C) was not expressed for unknown reasons. So we compared the NBD 
ﬂuorescence (membrane insertion) between WT and Q5K. Consistent with previous result, the NBD-labeled 
EsxA(S35C) emitted a strong ﬂuorescence in the presence of liposomes, indicating that it inserts into the mem-
brane upon acidiﬁcation (Fig. 1c). In contrast, the NBD-labeled EsxA(Q5K/S35C) had a signiﬁcantly lower ﬂu-
orescence, suggesting that it is defected in membrane insertion. Interestingly, however, we noticed that in the

absence of liposomes, the NBD-labeled EsxA(Q5K/S35C) had a higher background than EsxA(S35C). Tis sug-
gests that upon acidiﬁcation EsxA(Q5K/S35C) undergoes a diﬀerent conformational change than EsxA(S35C), 
in which NBD inserts into hydrophobic pockets of the protein. Afer calibrating oﬀ the backgrounds, EsxA(Q5K) 
has ~25% of membrane insertion of EsxA(WT) (Fig. 1d), which is consistent with the membrane leakage assay.
In the rest of the study, we used Q5K and Q5V to test the eﬀects of EsxA membrane-permeabilizing activity 
on mycobacterial virulence and cytosolic translocation. We hypothesize that Q5K will reduces, but Q5V will 
enhance mycobacterial cytosolic translocation and the virulence.
Construction and complementation of Mm∆EsxA/B. 
Mm causes tuberculosis-like diseases in ﬁsh and 
it is considered as a surrogate model for Mtb34,35. More importantly, Mm and Mtb share high homology in the 
ESX-1/EsxA system (Fig. 1a)36,37. To test the eﬀects of Q5K on mycobacterial virulence, we generated an esxA/
esxB knockout strain of Mm (termed Mm∆​EsxA/B) by homologous recombination (Fig. 2a). Deletion of esxA 
and esxB was conﬁrmed by PCR using either lef-arm primers (Fig. 2b), right-arm primers (Fig. 2c), or the prim-
ers ﬂanked the two ends of esxA/esxB locus (Fig. 2c). Te deletion was further conﬁrmed by probing EsxA and 
EsxB proteins in both cell lysate (CL) and culture ﬁltrate (CF) in western blots (Fig. 2d). As expected, MmEsxA 
was detected in both CL and CF of Mm, but not in Mm∆​EsxA/B. Interestingly, a protein band similar to EsxB 
was detected in CL of Mm∆​EsxA/B, but not in CF, suggesting that this band may be an EsxB homologous protein 
in CL that cross-reacted with the EsxB antibody. Te Mm∆​EsxA/B was then complemented with the plasmid 
pMH406 that constitutively expresses MtbEsxB as well as MtbEsxA WT, Q5K or Q5V respectively. Expression 
and secretion of the complemented MtbEsxA proteins were conﬁrmed by western blots (Fig. 2e).
Effects of Q5K and Q5V on mycobacterial in vitro growth, adherence, uptake and intracellular 
survival in macrophages. 
We set out to test if Q5K and Q5V aﬀect mycobacterial in vitro growth, which 
was monitored by OD600 over time. Compared to Mm, Mm∆​EsxA/B had a similar growth rate, indicating that 
deletion of EsxA/B does not aﬀect in vitro growth. As expected, the complemented WT, Q5K and Q5V strains 
showed similar in vitro growth (Fig. 3a).
Mycobacterial infection of host cells is a multi-step event. To dissect the role of EsxA in mycobacterial infec-
tion, we tested the eﬀects of Q5K and Q5V on mycobacterial adherence, uptake and intracellular survival in 
macrophages. Interestingly, compared to Ms, which had little adherence to the pre-ﬁxed RAW264.7 cells, Mm

volume of 1 M NaAc (pH 4). Te solution was continuously stirred in the cuvette. NBD ﬂuorescence emission 
was recorded as a function of time. Te representative curves from at least three repeats were shown. (d) Te 
NBD emission intensity at 90 s post-acidiﬁcation was calculated from three independent experiments. Te

had a signiﬁcantly higher adherence (Fig. 3b). Tis result is consistent to the previous report38. Te ability of Mm 
to adhere to macrophages appears to depend on EsxB/EsxA, because Mm∆​EsxA/B had a greatly reduced adher-
ence, while complementation with EsxB/EsxA largely restored the adherence. More interestingly, there was no 
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in adherence between the complemented strains Mm∆​EsxA/B(WT), Mm∆​EsxA/B(Q5K), 
and Mm∆​EsxA/B(Q5V), suggesting that Q5K and Q5V don’t aﬀect adherence (Fig. 3b). Subsequently, the abil-
ity of each Mm strain to enter macrophages was tested in the live RAW264.7 cells, and the result (CFU) was 
normalized to the adherence level of each strain (Fig. 3c). All strains showed similar entry eﬃciency, suggesting 
that once attached, deletion of EsxA/B or mutations at Q5 do not aﬀect mycobacterial entry into macrophages. 
Finally, we tested the eﬀects of Q5K and Q5V on mycobacterial intracellular survival. As expected, Mm had a 
much higher intracellular survival than Ms and Mm∆​EsxA/B (Fig. 3d). Notably, Mm∆​EsxA/B(WT) and Mm∆​
EsxA/B(Q5V) had higher intracellular survival than that of Mm∆​EsxA/B(Q5K). Tis data strongly suggests that 
the membrane-permeabilizing activity of EsxA is essential for mycobacterial intracellular survival.
Effects of Q5K and Q5V on mycobacterial cytotoxicity. 
Infection is a live-or-perish process between 
host cells and bacteria. Te more intracellular survival of bacteria usually means more host cell death. We further 
tested the eﬀects of Q5K and Q5V on mycobacterial cytotoxicity in RAW264.7 cells. Here, we used a live/dead 
assay to stain the infected cells with dead cells in red and live cells in green. As expected, Ms showed little cyto-
toxic eﬀect on the cells, while Mm caused cytotoxicity that was signiﬁcantly higher than Mm∆​EsxA/B (Fig. 4). 
Among the complemented strains, Mm∆​EsxA/B(WT) and Mm∆​EsxA/B(Q5V) induced cytotoxicity that was

much higher than Mm∆​EsxA/B(Q5K) (Fig. 4). Te result of cytotoxicity is well consistent to the result of intra-
cellular survival. Both assays have clearly demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing activity of EsxA is an 
essential factor for mycobacterial intracellular survival and cytotoxicity.
Effects of Q5K and Q5V on mycobacterial cytosolic translocation. 
We hypothesized that the 
membrane-permeabilizing activity of EsxA contributes to mycobacterial intracellular survival and cytotoxic-
ity through catalyzing translocation of mycobacteria from the phagosome to the cytosol. To probe mycobac-
terial cytosolic translocation, we used CCF4-AM, a well-established bacterial β​-lactamase sensitive FRET 
reporter8,39–41. CCF4-AM is composed of a ﬂuorescence donor (7-hydroxycoumarin, blue), a ﬂuorescence accep-
tor (ﬂuorescein, green) as well as a cephalosporin core, which is the cleavable substrate of bacterial β​-lactamase. 
When mycobacteria rupture the phagosomal membrane and replicate in the cytosol, mycobacterial β​-lactamase 
cleaves CCF4, which separates the ﬂuorescence donor and acceptor and results in loss of FRET signal (shif from 
green to blue). To ensure timely, accurate quantiﬁcation of FRET signal change from the infected RAW264.7 
cells, we used an ISS-K2 ﬂuorometer, which allows us to monitor the overall change of FRET signal from a large 
number of cells in a single measurement. To validate the approach, we ﬁrst used the CHO (Chinese hamster 
ovary) cell line that stably expresses β​-lactamase (CHO-β​-lac) in comparison with the parental CHO cell line

and plated on 7H10 plates with appropriate antibiotics. CFU was counted and the adherence (%) was calculated 
as adhered bacteria/total input (%). Te data is presented as mean ±​ S.E (n =​ 6, *p <​ 0.05). (c) Mycobacterial 
uptake by RAW264.7 cells. Single-cell suspensions were incubated with RAW264.7 cells at MOI 10:1 for 2 h. Te

(Fig. 5a). We found that with excitation at 409 nm, CHO cells had the emission peak at ~530 nm (green). In con-
trast, CHO-β​-lac cells had the emission peak at ~450 nm (blue), indicating that CCF4 is cleaved by β​-lactamase. 
Tus, the K2 ﬂuorometer is suitable to measure CCF4-FRET signal in cells. Next, we measured the FRET changes 
(blue/green ratio) in the RAW264.7 cells infected by the mycobacterial strains. As shown in Fig. 5b,c, the blue/
green ratio of the Mm-infected cells is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the Mm∆​EsxA/B-infected cells, indicating 
EsxA/B is required for cytosolic translocation. In the infection by the complemented strains, the cells infected by 
MmΔ​EsxA/B(Q5V) had the highest blue/green ratio, which was followed by MmΔ​EsxA/B(WT) and by MmΔ​
EsxA/B(Q5K), Te phenotype of cytosolic translocation is correlated very well to the membrane-permeabilizing 
activity.
Effects of Q5K and Q5V on mycobacterial infection in zebra Ƥsh embryos. 
To test the eﬀects of 
Q5K and Q5V on mycobacterial infection in vivo, we used zebra ﬁsh as an animal model34,42. Te zebra ﬁsh are 
engineered to express a green ﬂuorescent protein, Dendra2, in macrophages43. We also expressed a mCherry

protein in the mycobacterial strains so that bacteria can be also tracked inside the ﬁsh. Te ﬁsh embryos at the 
day 3 of post-fertilization were infected by the indicated strains through ear injection and were examined under 
a microscope everyday afer infection (Fig. 6a,b). At the day 3 of post-infection (DPI), a signiﬁcant number of 
Mm foci were found at the remote sites of the ﬁsh bodies, indicating that Mm disseminated in the ﬁsh. On the 
contrary, we found few MmΔ​EsxA/B foci disseminated from the injection site. As expected, the number of MmΔ​
EsxA/B(Q5V) foci at the remote sites is signiﬁcantly higher than that of MmΔ​EsxA/B(WT), and the number of 
MmΔ​EsxA/B(WT) foci is signiﬁcantly higher than that of MmΔ​EsxA/B(Q5K) (Fig. 6b). In parallel to dissemina-
tion experiment, we calculated the survival rate up to 7 DPI. Consistent to the dissemination data, Mm-infected 
embryos had ~55% survival at 7 DPI, while MmΔ​EsxA/B-infected embryos still had ~88% survival. Within 
the complemented strains, MmΔ​EsxA/B(Q5V) caused the highest death (~53% survival), which was followed 
by MmΔ​EsxA/B(WT) (~74% survival) and by MmΔ​EsxA/B(Q5K) (86% survival) with signiﬁcant diﬀerence 
(Fig. 6c) (Table S1).

Effects of Q5K and Q5V on Mtb-induced cytotoxicity in THP-1 cells. 
Finally, we tested whether 
the ﬁndings made in Mm can be replicated in Mtb infection in human macrophages. Similarly, we generated 
the complemented Mtb strains by transferring pMH406(WT), pMH406(Q5K) and pMH406(Q5K) into MtbΔ​
EsxA/B. Expression and secretion of the MtbEsxA WT, Q5K and Q5V were detected by western blot (Fig. 7a). 
Interestingly, we noticed that there was much less Q5V protein in the culture ﬁltrate relative to other proteins 
(Fig. 7b). To measure the Mtb-induced cytotoxicity, we used the crystal violet uptake assay, which is a colori-
metric method that quantiﬁes the cytotoxic eﬀect as a function of the remaining live cells afer infection44. Te 
reason why we quantiﬁed live cells instead of dead cells as described in Live/Dead assay (Fig. 4) was because that 
a large number of dead cells were washed oﬀ the plates afer a long-period of infection, which undercounted 
dead cells (cytotoxicity), especially for the virulent strains. As expected, Mtb had the least remaining cells (OD600 
~0.5), while MtbΔ​EsxA/B had the most remaining cells (OD600 ~ 1.2). Within the complemented strains, MmΔ​
EsxA/B(Q5V) was the most cytotoxic (OD600 ~ 0.52), which was followed by MmΔ​EsxA/B(WT) (~0.75) and by 
MmΔ​EsxA/B(Q5K) (~1.1) (Fig. 7b).

location of Mtb in THP-1 cells were tested using CCF4-AM FRET by two independent approaches: confocal 
ﬂuorescence microscopy (Fig. 8a,b) and emission spectra in the ﬂuorometer (Fig. 8c). Consistent to the results 
obtained in Mm, the blue/green ratio of Mtb-infected cells is signiﬁcantly higher than that of MtbΔ​EsxA/B. 
Among the complemented strains, the MtbΔ​EsxA/B(Q5V)-infected cells had the highest blue/green ratio, which 
was followed by MtbΔ​EsxA/B(WT) and by MtbΔ​EsxA/B(Q5K).
Discussion
While current studies strongly suggest that EsxA is required for virulence of mycobacteria, particularly 
through facilitating mycobacterial phagosome-to-cytosol translocation6–8,11, direct evidence is missing that the 
membrane-permeabilizing activity of EsxA catalyzes the critical pathogenic process. In the present study, we 
unambiguously demonstrated that Q5V and Q5K either up or down regulated the membrane-permeabilizing 
activity of EsxA, and consequently up or down regulated mycobacterial cytosolic translocation and virulence 
both in cultured macrophages and in zebra ﬁsh. As one of the most successful bacterial pathogens, Mtb has been 
reported to establish infection by using multiple virulence factors45. Tus, it is surprising that single-residue 
mutations of a single virulence factor caused such a dramatic eﬀect on the virulence. Te results strongly argue 
that the EsxA-catalyzed phagosome-to-cytosol translation is one of the major mechanisms in mycobacterial 
pathogenesis. Tus, the membrane-permeabilizing activity of EsxA can be a promising therapeutic target.

It is an interesting finding that various mutations of Q5 either up or down regulated the 
membrane-permeabilizing activity of EsxA, which was apparently aﬀected by the degree of charge state or hydro-
phobicity at this position upon acidiﬁcation. Since the structure of the putative EsxA pore is not available, the 
mechanism underlying this observation is not clear. Our earlier study has shown that the N- and C-terminal 
ﬂexible arms are required for pore formation, but they do not physically insert into the membrane, instead they 
may function in attaching EsxA to the membrane surface and supporting membrane insertion of the central 
Helix-turn-Helix motif 30. Moreover, EsxA pore is likely to be an oligomeric complex in the membrane. Tus, the 
N- and C-terminal ﬂexible arms may be involved in intra- and/or inter-molecular interactions within the complex 
to facilitate pore formation. One can imagine that mutations at Q5 could regulate membrane-permeabilizting 
activity through any of the potential mechanisms described above.
Recently, we have found that the differential membrane-permeabilizing activity between MtbEsxA and 
MsEsxA is at least partly attributed to the residues at position 25–26, where MtbEsxA has I-H, which serve a pH 
sensor, while MsEsxA has T-A. Exchange of IH and TA completely restored MsEsxA membrane-permeabilizing 
activity to a level equivalent to MtbEsxA, but only partly aﬀected MtbEsxA46. Because V is on MsEsxA, we ini-
tially predicted that replacing Q5 with V would decrease the membrane-permeabilizing activity of MtbEsxA. Te 
results in this study made us to believe that besides Q5 and I25H26, there are other residues responsible for the 
diﬀerential membrane-permeabilizing activity between MtbEsxA and MsEsxA, which warrants further investi-
gation into the mechanism of EsxA membrane permeabilization.
Relative to the complemented WT strain, the complemented Q5V exhibited signiﬁcantly stronger virulence 
in zebra ﬁsh embryos and in THP-1 infection measured by crystal violet uptake assay (Fig. 6, Fig. 7b). However, 
Q5V showed intracellular survival (Fig. 3d) and cytotoxicity (by Live/Dead assay) that were similar to the com-
plemented WT (Fig. 4). Tis discrepancy is mainly due to the loss of dead cells during washes afer infection. 
Tis is especially true for the cells infected by the virulent strains. Te more virulent, the more cell loss. Tus, the 
number of dead cells (e.g. Fig. 4) is usually undercounted for the virulent strains. CCF-4 FRET assay is a quanti-
tative approach that measures blue/green ratio for each individual cell, and it is more independent of the number 
of remaining cells on the plates. Tus, Q5V showed signiﬁcantly higher cytosolic translocation in most CCF-4 
FRET assays (Fig. 5c, Fig. 8b). Finally, we observed that the amount of Q5V protein in culture ﬁltrate of MtbΔ​
EsxA/B(Q5V) was lower than others (Fig. 7a), suggesting that Q5V may have a lower secretion in Mtb. Te exact 
mechanism is not known and may be investigated in future study. Even though the secretion of Q5V protein was 
lower, MtbΔ​EsxA/B(Q5V) still exhibited stronger cytotoxicity (Fig. 7b) and cytosolic translocation (Fig. 8) than 
MtbΔ​EsxA/B(WT), which further supports our conclusion that Q5V enhanced virulence through increasing 
membrane-permeabilizing activity.

protein in Mtb. Te cell lysate (CL) and culture ﬁltrate (CF) of the indicated Mtb strains were loaded to SDS-

a loading control in both CL and CF. GroEl was used to control the potential cross-contamination between 
CF and CL. (b) THP-1 cells were infected with the indicated strains for 72 h at MOI of 10:1. Te attached live

Another interesting observation is that MmΔ​EsxA/B failed to adhere to the ﬁxed RAW264.7 cells. To the 
best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report that EsxA is required for mycobacterial adherence to macrophages. 
While only ~10% of Mm was found to be adhered to the ﬁxed cells, which is consistent to the previous study by 
another group38, it represented a large number of mycobacteria that provided us a big enough sample size for 
analysis of statistical signiﬁcance. More importantly, all of strains used in the experiments, including Ms, Mm, 
MmΔ​EsxA/B, MmΔ​EsxA/B(WT), MmΔ​EsxA/B(Q5K), and MmΔ​EsxA/B(Q5V), were excellent internal con-
trols to each other, which demonstrated the speciﬁcity of the results. It is generally accepted that EsxA is a secreted 
protein, but it has been reported that Mm and Mtb with deﬁcient EsxA exhibited diﬀerent colony morphologies, 
implicating that EsxA binds to mycobacterial cell walls47. Recently, Champion et al. showed that some EsxA 
molecules remained bound to the surface of mycobacteria instead of being secreted into the medium. Moreover, 
EsxA on the surface of mycobacteria caused more cytotoxicity than those secreted48,49. Tere are also reports 
that EsxA binds to the host cells through interacting with speciﬁc receptor molecules on the cell surface50–52. In 
zebra ﬁsh, ESX-1/EsxA has been implicated in recruitment of macrophages to granuloma53,54. Together, all the 
evidence suggests that EsxA may play a role in adhering mycobacteria to host cells, which requires further inves-
tigation. Since Q5K and Q5V did not aﬀect adherence (Fig. 3b), suggesting that adherence is independent of EsxA 
membrane-permeabilizing activity.
Tis study has directly linked the membrane-permeabilizing activity of EsxA to mycobacterial cytosolic trans-
location, intracellular survival and cytotoxicity. It clearly supports the model that EsxA membrane-permeabilizing 
activity catalyzes phagosome rupture and mycobacterial translocation to the cytosol, where mycobacteria rep-
licate and undergo cell-to-cell spreading. Since the structure of the putative EsxA pore is not available, the

molecular mechanism by which EsxA causes phagosome rupture is largely unknown. It is possible that other 
mycobacterial and/or host factors may be also involved in this process55. It is well known that EsxB and EsxA 
form a heterodimer25,26, but EsxB does not have membrane-lytic activity and is considered as a putative chaper-
one that protects EsxA from being degraded or prevents pre-matured membrane permeabilization by EsxA31,33. 
Using surface plasmon resonance, de Jonge et al. showed that CFP10 was dissociated from EsxA in an acidic 
pH-dependent manner31. In our earlier pH titration experiment, EsxA only formed pores on the liposomal mem-
brane at pH 5 or below33. All the data argue that an acidic pH is required for EsxA to permeabilize the membrane. 
However, recent studies also suggest that EsxA plays a role in arresting phagosome maturation, where most intra-
cellular mycobacteria stayed in poorly acidiﬁed phagosomes, while ESX-1 knockout strains stayed in acidiﬁed 
phagosomes9,10. Most recently, Simeone et al. showed that partial prevention of phagosome acidiﬁcation is a 
prerequisite for mycobacterial phagosome rupture and cytosolic access11. Tis discrepancy may be due to the dif-
ference between in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions, where in vivo mycobacterial and/or host factors may 
allow EsxA to form pores at a higher pH. Another possibility is that the two events may actually occur at diﬀerent 
stages of infection. Tat is, EsxA may inhibit phagosome maturation at early stage of infection to establish latency, 
while at the later stage of infection EsxA catalyzes mycobacterial escape from the phagosome. An earlier report 
has shown that upon lysosome-phagosome fusion, Mtb progressively translocates from phago-lysosomes into the 
cytosol6. Terefore, one can imagine that phagosome-lysosome fusion may be a trigger for mycobacteria to escape 
from the phagosome to the cytosol. Upon phagosome-lysosome fusion, acidiﬁcation induces EsxA-mediated 
membrane permeabilization, which allows mycobacteria escape to the cytosol before being killed by the hostile 
environment.
In addition to catalyzing mycobacterial cytosolic translocation, several independent studies have sug-
gested that even prior to full-ﬂedged phagosomal rupture, EsxA may permeabilize the phagosomal membrane 
to expose mycobacterial DNA to the host cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, which results in a series of host 
anti-mycobacterial immune responses, including induction of autophagy and cytokine release56–62.
As a potent T-cell antigen, EsxA has been intensively studied as a potential candidate for novel TB vaccines63. 
However, the membrane-permeabilizing activity raises a safety concern when EsxA WT is used as a vaccine. Te 
single-point mutations at Q5, such as Q5K or Q5R, reduce cytotoxicity, but still possibly maintain antigenicity. 
Tus, they have potentials to be developed into safer vaccines and therapeutics against tuberculosis.
Experimental Procedures
Protein puriƤcation. 
MtbESAT6 WT, Q5E, Q5V, and Q5L were cloned into pET22b vector and expressed 
and puriﬁed from the inclusion body of E. coli BL21(DE3) as previously described33. Q5R and Q5K had little 
expression in pET22b vector, so they were sub-cloned into pGEX4T-1 to be expressed as fusion proteins with a 
N-terminal GST and a C-terminal His-tag. Te GST-EsxA fusion proteins were expressed and puriﬁed as previ-
ously described30,33.
ANTS/DPX Membrane leakage assay. 
Te liposomes containing the dye/quencher pair, 8-aminonapthalene- 
1,3,6- trisulfonic acid (ANTS)/p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide (DPX), were prepared by rehydrating the dry 
lipid ﬁlm in 50 mM ANTS, 50 mM DPX, 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), followed by extrusion through a 200-nm ﬁlter 
and by desalting in a G-25 column in 5 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.3).
ANTS ﬂuorescence dequenching was measured in an ISS K2 multiphase frequency and modulation ﬂuorom-
eter with excitation 380 nm and emission at 520 nm as described previously30,33. Brieﬂy, 100 μ​l of the liposomes 
containing ANTS/DPX was diluted into 1.3 ml of 50 mM sodium acetate and 150 mM NaCl (pH 4.0) with con-
tinuous stirring. Afer the baseline was stabilized, 100 μ​l of puriﬁed proteins (total of 100 μ​g) was injected into the 
cuvette, and the ﬂuorescence signal was monitored in real time.
Membrane insertion assay by NBD. 
EsxA(S35C) and EsxA(Q5K/S35C) were puriﬁed and then labeled 
with IANBD (Invitrogen) as described previously30,64,65. Te labeling eﬃciency is ~100%. Te NBD-labeled pro-
teins (80 μ​g) were incubated in 20 mM TrisHCl, 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.0) with or without liposomes for 30 min, 
and were transferred to a cuvette with a stirring bar in the ISS K2 ﬂuorometer. Acidiﬁcation was triggered by 
adding 0.1 volume of 1 M NaAc (pH 4.0) to the cuvette. NBD was excited at 488 nm, and emission was recorded 
at 544 nm. Crossed polarizers on excitation and emission beams and a 520-nm-long ﬁlter were used to reduce the 
background scatter.
Cell culture. 
RAW264.7 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% NCBS 
in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. THP-1 cells (ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS in 5% CO2 
at 37 °C. Before experiments, THP-1 cells were induced with 20 ng/ml of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) 
for 72 h to diﬀerentiate into macrophage-like cells. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and CHO-β​-Lac cells  
(Life Technologies Inc.) were maintained in F-12 medium supplemented with 10% NBS in 5% CO2 at 37 °C.
Construction esxB/esxA knockout Mm strain. 
Te knockout strain MmΔ​EsxA/B was generated by 
homologous recombination with modiﬁcations36. Te fragments at lef arm and right arm of the esxB/esxA 
operon were ampliﬁed from Mm genomic DNA using the primers PLA-1/PLA-2 and PRA-1/PRA-2 (Table S2). Te 
PCR products of lef arm and right arm were then cloned into the pJSC407 plasmid (generous gif from Dr. 
Jeﬀery Cox, UCSF) using ligation-free PCR cloning kit (Clontech). Te resultant plasmid was digested by Pac I 
and ligated to a sucrose resistance gene from pGOAL17 (Addgen). Te resultant plasmid was then introduced 
into Mm by electroporation. Single-crossover clones were ﬁrst selected on 7H10 plates supplemented with 10% 
OADC and containing 50 μ​g/ml hygromycin, followed by counterselection of double-crossover clones on 7H10 
plates containing 2% sucrose plates. Deletion of esxB/esxA was conﬁrmed by PCR and western blot. Te hygr gene 
was later removed using Cre recombinase.

Complementation of MmΔEsxA/B and MtbΔEsxA/B. 
Te plasmids pMH406 constitutively expresses 
MtbEsxB and MtbEsxA in mycobacteria18. Te plasmids pMH406(WT), pMH406(Q5K) and pMH406(Q5V) 
were electroporated into MmΔ​EsxA/B to generate the complemented strains, named MmΔ​EsxA/B(WT), MmΔ​
EsxA/B(Q5K) and MmΔ​EsxA/B(Q5V), respectively.
Similarly, pMH406(WT), pMH406(Q5K) and pMH406(Q5V) were transferred into MtbΔ​EsxA/B to generate 
MtbΔ​EsxA/B(WT), MtbΔ​EsxA/B(Q5K) and pMH406(Q5V).
Mycobacterial adherence, uptake and intracellular survival. 
Mycobacterial adherence were carried 
out as previously described with modiﬁcations38. Brieﬂy, RAW264.7 (0.5 ×​ 106 cells/well) were ﬁxed in 4% para-
formaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min. Mycobacteria were prepared as single-cell solution as previously described66, and 
then added to the cells with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. Afer 30 min of incubation, the free mycobac-
teria were removed by 3 washes with PBS. Te bound mycobacteria were harvested and plated onto 7H10 plates to 
determine colony-forming units (CFU). Te rate of adherence was calculated as adhered bacteria/total input (%).
In the uptake assay the mycobacteria were incubated with live RAW264.7 cells for 2 h at 37 °C. Te extracel-
lular mycobacteria were removed by washes and amikacin. Te cells were then lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 
plated on 7H10 plates to determine CFU of the intracellular mycobacteria. Te rate of uptake was calculated as 
engulfed bacteria/the adhered (%).
In intracellular survival assay, the infection was same as the uptake assay. Te infected cells were maintained in 
growth medium for 3 days before lysed and plated. Te rate of intracellular survival is expressed as the CFU afer 
3 days of infection/the CFU of adherence (%).
Western blot analysis. 
Mm or Mtb grown in Sauton’s medium were harvested, and the supernatant was 
ﬁltered through a 0.22 μ​m ﬁlter twice to generate culture ﬁltrate (CF). Te CF was concentrated by 100 folds as 
described previously36. Te whole cell lysate (CL) was obtained by lysing mycobacterial cells in a bead beater.
20 μ​g of CL and equivalent amount of CF were separated in 12% Tricine-SDS gels. Proteins were transferred 
to PVDF membrane and subjected to western blot using antibodies against EsxA (AB26246; Abcam, Cambridge, 
MA), EsxB (NR-13801; BEI Resources, Manassas, VA). GroEL (NR13813, BEI) and Ag85 (NR-13807; BEI) were 
used as loading controls for CL and CF fractions.
Mycobacteria-induced cytotoxicity. 
Live/dead assay for the Mm–infected RAW264.7 cells–RAW264.7 
cells (5 ×​ 105) were infected with the indicated Mm strains at an MOI of 20 for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by another 
3 h incubation afer washing oﬀ the free bacteria. Te infected cells were stained with ethidium homodimer and 
calcein-AM (Life Technologies) at 37 °C for 1 h, and images were taken in a Floid Cell Imaging Station. Te rela-
tive cytotoxicity was quantiﬁed by enumeration of dead cells in at least 6 random ﬁelds for each infection.
Crystal violet uptake assay for the Mtb-infected THP-1 cells–Te PMA-diﬀerentiated THP-1 cells (5 ×​ 105) 
were infected with the indicated Mtb strains at an MOI of 10 for 72 h at 37 °C and ﬁxed with 4% PFA for 30 min, 
and then stained with 0.1% aqueous crystal violet for 30 min with gentle shaking. Te excessive dye was washed 
oﬀ with water. Te plates were allowed to air dry and the stained cells were lysed in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min 
at RT with gentle shaking. Te supernatant was transferred into a 96-well plate for OD600 measurement.
Mycobacterial cytosolic translocation. 
For Mm strains, RAW264.7 cells (3 ×​ 106) were infected with 
single-cell solutions of the indicated Mm strains at MOI of 10 for 2 h at 30 °C, followed by another 48 h incubation 
afer removing free mycobacteria. Te cells were harvested by centrifugation and incubated with 1 μ​M CCF4-AM 
for 2 h in dark by following the manufacturer’s instruction (Liveblazer FRET B/G loading kit, Life Technology). 
Afer washing oﬀ the free CCF4-AM, the cells were incubated in 2 ml of EM buﬀer with 2.5 μ​M probenecid acid. 
Te spectrum of CCF4 was measured in the ISS-K2 ﬂuorometer with excitation at 409 nm and emission from 
425–600 nm. Te blue/green ratio was calculated as the ratio of I450/I530.
For Mtb strains, the PMA-induced THP-cells (1.5 ×​ 106) were infected by the single-cell solutions of the indi-
cated Mtb stains at MOI of 3 for 2 h. Afer removing the free bacteria, the cells was continuously incubated at 
37 °C for 7–9 days. We found that at 9 days of post-infection, Mtb and Mtb∆​EsxA/B started to show signiﬁcant 
diﬀerence in blue/green ratio (Figure S1). Te cells were loaded with 2 μ​M CCF4-AM at RT for 2 h. Afer washing 
oﬀ the free dye, the cells were harvested and ﬁxed by 4% PFA in the presence of 2.5 μ​M probenecid acid. Te blue/
green ratio were measured in the ISS-K2 ﬂuorometer and calculated as described above.
For ﬂuorescence microscopy, THP-1 cells were seeded in a 96-well plate (3 ×​ 104 cells/well) and the infec-
tion was exactly same as above described except with MOI of 2. Afer 6 days of infection, the cells were loaded 
with CCF4-AM as described above. Te CCF4 ﬂuorescence was measured in a Zeiss LSM 700 inverted confocal 
microscope. Blue (450 nm) and green (520 nm) ﬂuorescent pictures were simultaneously taken at the excitation 
laser (405 nm). Automated image analysis including cell segmentation and quantiﬁcation was achieved using Cell 
Prolifer.
Fish husbandry and embryo infection. 
Te transgenic zebra ﬁsh line Tg(mpeg:dendra2) was obtained 
from Dr. Anna Huttenlocher’s lab (UW-Madison, WI, USA). Te zebra ﬁsh embryos from Tg(mpeg:dendra2) 
were used in this experiment43. Mm strains harboring a pMSP12::mCherry plasmid (Addgene) were cultured 
and prepared into single-cell solution with sterile PBS. Te embryos were maintained and infected at the day 3 
of post-fertilization. About 1000 CFU of mycobacteria were injected in the embryos’ ears. Afer infection each 
embryo was housed separately in a 96-well plate. Te death of each group (total 20 embryos) was recorded every-
day afer infection. At the day 3 of post-infection, mycobacterial dissemination was detected with a Zeiss ZV16 
stereo-microscope. Te infection experiment was repeated three times.
