Covid-19 and Guillain-Barré
syndrome:
e e Check fo
More than a coincidence! Se
A 70-year-old woman, receiving 7.5mg prednisone as a
maintenance therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), presented
with a rapidly, bilateral weakness and tingling sensation in all
four extremities resulting in a total functional disability within
48 hours. The patient denied any sphincter disturbances,
dyspnea or swallowing difficulties. She first received a
diagnosis of RA exacerbation but no improvement was seen
after corticosteroids increase. At admission to our Neurology
department, at the tenth day of symptom’s onset (Apmil 13),
neurological examination showed quadriplegia, hypotonia,
areflexia and bilateral positive Laségue sign. Cranial nerves
were intact. Temperature, lung and cardiac auscultation were,
also normal. On April ist, three days prior to the ongoing
symptom’s onset, the patient presented an episode of dry
cough without dyspnea or fever, spontaneously resolving
within 48 hours. Initial blood tests showed no abnormality,
except for a lymphocytopenia (520/ml, normal: 1500-5000). A
nerve conduction study (NCS), on day 10, revealed a marked
reduction or absence of electrical potentials in both motor and
sensory nerves in all four limbs, with little or no abnormalities
in conduction velocities and latencies. The needle electro-
myography (EMG) found diffuse and abundant fibrillation
potentials at rest. These findings were consistent with an
Acute Motor and Sensory Axonal Neuropathy (AMSAN) subtype
of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). CSF analysis showed
increased protein level at 1g per liter (normal range: 0,2-0,4)
with normal white blood cell count. Chest CT (day 10) revealed
ground-glass opacities in the left lung (Fig. 1). SARS-CoV-2 on
Fig. 1 - Chest computer tomography revealed a ground-
glass opacities in the upper lobe of the left lung.
RT-PCR assay was positive at oropharyngeal swab (day 10),
negative in CSF. The patient was treated with intravenous
immunoglobulin (2 g/kg for 5 days) and a combination of
Hydroxychloroquine (600mg per day) and Azithromycine
(500 mg at the first day, then 250 mg per day). No significant
neurological improvement is seen after one week of treatment.
The Covid-19 infection hides many secrets that are yet to be
revealed and little is known about its neurological manifesta-
tions. Here, we describe a case of a patient with mild
respiratory symptoms linked to a COVID-19 infection, follo-
wed by a rapidly evolving quadriplegia arguing for a SARS-
Cov-2-induced GBS. A negative PCR analysis in the CSF
supports a post infectious, dysimmune mechanism.
Zhao et al. [1] reported the case of a 61-year-old man who
presented with an Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Poly-
neuropathy (AIDP) subtype of GBS, associated with SARS-
Cov-2 infection. Being the first reported case, the authors
questioned the cause-effect relationship between both
events, since respiratory symptoms appeared after GBS’s
onset. After this first case, we found three other reports
published to date. Camdessanche et al. [2] described a case of
AIDP GBS subtype in a 64-year-old man, while the case of
Sedaghat and Karim [3] resembled ours, an AMSAN form.
Toscano et al. [4] reported a series of five patients from three
Italian hospitals. Their findings were consistent with an
axonal variant in three patients and with demyelinating
process in two patients.
We add to the literature another case of GBS related to a
Covid-19 infection. All these cases argues that SARS-Cov-2
virus could be a triggering factor of GBS. Since mild
respiratory symptoms were noted in our patient, we suggest
that allnewly diagnosed Guillain-Barré cases should be tested
for a Covid-19 infection in the current pandemic, even if they
lack respiratory complaints. This would probably result in
larger series and would help clarify the spectrum of this
neurological condition.

Acute meningoencephalitis in a
patient with COVID-19
Check for
updates
A 69-year-old man with a 7-day history of fever and cough,
was admitted to the University Hospital of Guadeloupe
(French indies) for confusion and severe headache. He had
no medical history and reported having traveled to the Middle-
East (cruise ship) with his wife 15 days before hospitalization.
He did not report insect bites. A week after returning home, he
presented fever, myalgia, cough, anosmia, ageusia, cervical
pain, stiff neck, and diarrhea. At admission, he reported a
worsening of his condition for 24 hours with painful and stiff
neck and headache, confusion, walking disability with falls,
and dyspnea. Noteworthy, his wife had also had isolated
cough and ageusia for the past 10 days.
On examination, the patient was febrile (38.5°C) with
diffuse headache, neck stiffness, altered consciousness
(Glasgow Coma Scale 14), confusion, swallowing disorders,
and right-sided hemiparesis. Respiratory rate was increased
(36/min), pulse rate was 95/min, blood pressure 160/89 mmHg,
and oxygen saturation was 91% in ambient air.
Laboratory analyses showed increased C-reactive protein
at 95mg/L and creatine kinase level (655 U/L), raised
transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase= 85 U/L, ala-
nine aminotransferase = 94 U/L) and lactate dehydrogenase
(442 U/L). Arterial partial pressure of oxygen was decreased
at 64 mmHg with normal arterial partial pressure of carbon
dioxide and pH. Chest computed tomographic scan was
highly suggestive of COVID-19 (Fig. 1). Cerebrospinal fluid
was purely lymphocytic (37 x 10°/L) with no red blood cells,
an increased protein level at 84 mg/dL and normal glucose
level. Brain MRI with gadolinium was normal. Electro-
encephalogram showed a bilateral slowed activity without
seizures. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 by specific real-time
reverse PCR (RT-PCR) was negative in nasopharyngeal swab
and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on days 2 and 4 after admission
but was positive in bronchoalveolar lavage on day 5. Using a
similar biological tool, the search for Influenza virus was
negative. RT-PCR for varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex
virus (HSV), and enterovirus in CSF were all negative. Other
tests for endemic infections in our area were performed, but
all negative.
The patient received nasal oxygen therapy. Acyclovir
infusions were performed for 3 days and stopped when RT-
PCR for HSV was found negative. We started hydroxychloroquine
sulfate 200 mg, three times per day, and azithromycin 250 mg
daily for 7 days. On hospital day 4, his neurological condition
improved with normal consciousness and abatement of swal-
lowing disorders. At discharged on day 10, mild neuropsychiatric
features were still present with an alteration of executive
functions. Montreal Cognitive Assessment was decreased to
26/30.
We describe meningoencephalitis one week after the onset
of COVID-19 based on the combination of altered mental
consciousness, fever, focal neurological defects, and cerebros-
pinal fluid abnormalities. We suspect the meningoencephalitis
was related to COVID-19, possibly through a direct infectious
mechanism although the virus was not detected in CSF [1].
