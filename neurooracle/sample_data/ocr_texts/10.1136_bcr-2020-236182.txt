SUMMARY
A 57-­year-­old man presented with a progressive ﬂaccid 
symmetrical motor and sensory neuropathy following a 
1-­week history of cough and malaise. He was diagnosed 
with Guillain-­Barré syndrome secondary to COVID-19 
and started on intravenous immunoglobulin. He 
proceeded to have worsening respiratory function and 
needed intubation and mechanical ventilation. This is the 
ﬁrst reported case of this rare neurological complication 
of COVID-19 in the UK, but it adds to a small but 
growing body of international evidence to suggest a 
signiﬁcant association between these two conditions. 
Increasing appreciation of this by clinicians will ensure 
earlier diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of patients 
presenting with this.
Background
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-­CoV-2) is causing a worldwide pandemic of 
COVID-19. As case numbers increase, the body of 
research around SARS-­CoV-2 and the pathophysi-
ology of the disease process it causes (COVID-19), 
expands daily. Patients with COVID-19 typically 
present with fever and respiratory illness; however, 
a wide range of other symptoms have been 
described. While the neurological sequelae of the 
virus remain poorly understood, there are a growing 
number of reports of neurological manifestations of 
COVID-19.1 A recent study from Wuhan reported 
that 78 (36.4%) out of 214 patients admitted with 
COVID-19 had neurological symptoms ranging 
from anosmia and taste disturbances to cerebrovas-
cular to strokes and seizures.1
Additionally, there is increasing recognition 
of a link between COVID-19 and Guillain-­Barré 
syndrome (GBS), with three international case 
reports and one case series of five patients as the 
only published cases to date.2–5 To help add to this 
small but developing body of evidence, this is the 
first published case of GBS secondary to COVID-19 
in the UK.
Case presentation
On 13 April 2020, a 57-­year-­old, right-­handed man 
with a medical history of untreated hypertension 
and psoriasis presented to the emergency depart-
ment with a 1-­day history of progressive limb weak-
ness and foot dysaesthesia. On the evening prior to 
admission, he noted that he had some difficulty 
standing unaided and noticed some tingling sensa-
tions in his feet. The next morning, he was unable 
to stand, and his arms felt weak. Incidentally, he 
also reported a 1 week history of mild cough and 
headache, myalgia and malaise. He reported feeling 
feverish once in the morning prior to admission and 
reported one episode of diarrhoea on questioning. 
He had no back pain, bladder or autonomic symp-
toms of note. He was on no regular medications. 
He did not smoke, and drank alcohol occasionally.
On examination, he was afebrile, tachycardic 
(heart rate 110 bpm) and had bilateral crepitations 
to the mid-­zones on lung auscultation. His oxygen 
saturation was 98% on air and respiratory rate was 
18 breaths/min. Limb examination revealed reduced 
tone with symmetrical weakness of 4/5 on the 
Medical Research Council (MRC) Power Grading 
Scale in upper and lower limbs (table 1). He had 
diminished tricep reflexes and absent bicep, supi-
nator, knee and ankle reflexes bilaterally. Pinprick 
sensation was impaired to the right midfoot and 
left ankle, with impaired vibration sense to the 
hips bilaterally. Coordination was grossly normal. 
Cranial nerves were intact.
After 24 hours, his lower limb power had reduced 
to 3/5 proximally and 2/5 distally (table 1) and all 
limb reflexes were absent. The overall impression 
was of a progressive flaccid symmetrical sensory 
and motor neuropathy.

Investigations
On admission, blood tests were significant for lymphopenia 
(0.9×109/L), thrombocythaemia (490×109/L) and a raised C 
reactive protein (25 mg/L). Renal profile, electrolyte, serum 
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE), B12, folate, thyroid and 
clotting functions were all within the normal range. Antinuclear 
antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-­ganglioside 
antibodies, syphilis serology and blood-­borne virus screen (HIV, 
hepatitis B and hepatitis C) were negative. His chest X-­ray 
on admission (figure  1) showed no convincing consolidative 
change, infiltrates or ground-­glass shadowing. His SARS-­CoV-2 
(COVID-19) RNA nasopharyngeal swab was positive. He was 
admitted with suspected GBS secondary to COVID-19, with a 
Modified Erasmus GBS Outcome Score of 4.6
A lumbar puncture revealed high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
protein (0.51 g/L) with normal glucose and cell counts. No 
organisms were found on gram staining and viral PCR, including 
SARS-­CoV-2 RNA, was negative.
Nerve conduction studies were carried out on day 2 of admis-
sion with a Dantec Keypoint Focus portable system with single 
constant current stimulator. Stimulation was performed with a 
bipolar stimulator employing 0.1 ms duration squared pulses 
and variable intensity up to 100 mA. For the recording of motor 
conduction studies, surface electrodes (Ambu neuroline 70001-­
SC/12) were placed according with the muscle belly–tendon 
standard criteria. Ground surface electrodes (Ambu neuroline 
71415-­M1) were placed between the stimulating and recording 
point. Similarly, sensory nerve action potentials were obtained 
with surface electrodes after distal stimulation (orthodromic 
technique). Initial latency, duration and base to peak ampli-
tude were calculated for sensory nerve action potentials and 
compound muscle action potentials. F-­wave latencies, when 
present, were measured from the onset of the compound motor 
action potential to the onset of the F-­wave.
Nerve conduction studies revealed reduced conduction 
velocity and prolonged distal motor latencies in motor and 
sensory nerves in the upper and lower limbs with more marked 
slowing in the lower limbs (table  2). Motor action potentials 
showed marked dispersion in their morphology which was more 
pronounced in tibial and common peroneal nerves (figure  2). 
F-­waves were not obtained from the common peroneal, tibial 
and right median nerves, and had prolonged latency in the right 
ulnar nerve. Sensory nerve conduction studies showed reduced 
velocities in both superficial peroneal and right sural nerves, and 
were within normal limits for left sural, ulnar and radial super-
ficial nerves. Right median sensory nerve action potentials were 
absent. These results fulfil the electrodiagnostic criteria for acute 
inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy/GBS.
Treatment
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg divided over 5 days 
was started 24 hours after presentation to the hospital.

Learning points
►
►There is emerging evidence of the link between COVID-19 
and Guillain-­Barré syndrome (GBS); it is important that 
clinicians think of this to avoid delays in diagnosis and 
treatment.
►
►Clinicians are at risk of conﬁrmation bias when assessing 
patients with shortness of breath during the COVID-19 
pandemic. It is important that the neurological system 
is included in history taking and examination to ensure 
neuromuscular causes are not missed.
►
►Currently, the diagnosis and treatment of GBS secondary to 
COVID-19 are the same as the standard recognised guidelines 
for GBS.
►
►Careful monitoring of the respiratory function, using serial 
forced vital capacity measurements, is essential. As patients 
with COVID-19 pneumonitis are already at risk of respiratory 
failure, it is hypothesised that a higher number of GBS-­
associated patients with this condition will need invasive 
ventilation. Further research is needed in this area.
►
►Further research is needed to investigate whether the GBS 
phenotype associated with COVID-19 follows a parainfectious 
as opposed to the classically post-­infectious course.
Outcome and follow-up
On day 3 of admission, the limb weakness progressed, he devel-
oped swallowing difficulties and vital capacity measurements 
deteriorated from 4.86 L (52 mL/kg) to 2.07 L (22 mL/kg). His 
oxygen saturations dropped to 89% on air and he began to 
struggle to expectorate sputum. A decision was made to intubate 
and ventilate the patient at this point. After 1 day in the intensive 
care unit (ICU), he developed increasing inflammatory markers 
and left lower lobe consolidation on chest X-­ray (figure 1), and 
was, therefore, started on co-­amoxiclav for a potential aspira-
tion pneumonia. He completed a 5-­day course of IVIG and a 
percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on day 6 of his ICU 
admission. His oxygen requirements increased the following 
day, a Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) 
showed bi-­basilar consolidation and patchy peripheral ground-­
glass opacities in keeping with classic COVID-19 with no acute 
thromboembolic disease (figure 1). His oxygen requirements and 
inflammatory markers have now improved and he is currently 
being weaned off ventilation.
Discussion
GBS is an autoimmune condition characterised by rapidly 
progressive limb weakness, often with sensory and cranial nerve 
deficits, and can result in significant morbidity and mortality. 
The syndrome is typically post-­infectious, with two-­thirds of 
adult patients reporting respiratory or gastrointestinal infec-
tions in the 6 weeks prior to presentation, which are thought to 
trigger an immune response leading to a neuropathy.7 A number 
of well-­recognised antecedent infections have been identified in 
case–control studies, including bacteria such as Campylobacter 
jejuni and viruses such as Cytomegalovirus and Epstein-­Barr 
virus. In the case presented, the patient developed significant 
neurology only 1 week after the development of his cough and 
myalgia, and his chest deteriorated during his intensive care stay 
(at day 16 of his illness), with a characteristic CT appearance 
of COVID-19 viral pneumonia. This raises the possibility of a 
parainfectious course, similar to GBS cases described in associ-
ation with Zika virus.8 While parainfectious neuropathies may 
develop as an unusual hyperimmune response, they could also 
represent a direct toxic or neuropathic effect. Further research 
is needed to differentiate between these two possibilities in 
COVID-19 patients.
To date, there have been eight published cases of GBS associ-
ated with COVID–19 (a case series of five patients from Italy and 
a single case report from China, Iran and USA).2–5 The Italian 
series reported that 5 (0.42%) out of 1200 patients admitted 
to their hospitals with COVID-19 presented with GBS, which 
is disproportionately high for a rare disease that affects 1.6 per 
100,000 person-­years (matched for the average age of their 
cohort).4 9 This case report is adding evidence to the increasing 
recognition that COVID-19 could be an infectious trigger for 
GBS. The interval between the onset of symptoms of COVID-19 
and the first symptoms of GBS was approximately 7 days, and 
neurological symptoms evolved rapidly over 3 days. These time 
windows are in keeping with the Italian series.5
The clinical manifestations of GBS are varied, from mild 
limb weakness to respiratory muscle involvement requiring 
mechanical ventilation. Studies have found that the severity of 
GBS is associated with the causative organism, demonstrated 
by the higher rates of severe axonal forms following C. jejuni 
infection.10 As such, it is important to further research the 
link between COVID-19 and GBS to help with diagnosis and 
prognostication. Of importance, half of the currently reported 
cases (4/8) have needed mechanical ventilation, higher than the 
recognised 20%–30% in all GBS cases. Despite the small sample 
size, this could represent an interaction between the COVID-19 
pneumonitis and GBS increasing the likelihood of needing respi-
ratory support. Alternatively, this may suggest that COVID-19 is 
a trigger for a more severe and rapidly progressing neuropathy.
It is imperative that clinicians are aware of this association to 
avoid delays in diagnosis and to promote early initiation of treat-
ment and supportive care for a condition associated with signif-
icant morbidity and mortality. This will become more apparent 
as more cases are identified and longer term outcome data are 
available.
