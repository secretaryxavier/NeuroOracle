Abstract
Context—Progressive brain volume changes in schizophrenia are thought to be due principally to
the disease. However, recent animal studies indicate that antipsychotics, the mainstay of treatment
for schizophrenia patients, may also contribute to brain tissue volume decrement. Because
antipsychotics are prescribed for long periods for schizophrenia patients and have increasingly
widespread use in other psychiatric disorders, it is imperative to determine their long-term effects
on the human brain.
Objective—To evaluate relative contributions of 4 potential predictors (illness duration,
antipsychotic treatment, illness severity, and substance abuse) of brain volume change.
Design—Predictors of brain volume changes were assessed prospectively based on multiple
informants.
Setting—Data from the Iowa Longitudinal Study.
Patients—Two hundred eleven patients with schizophrenia who underwent repeated
neuroimaging beginning soon after illness onset, yielding a total of 674 high-resolution magnetic
resonance scans. On average, each patient had 3 scans (≥2 and as many as 5) over 7.2 years (up to
14 years).
Main Outcome Measure—Brain volumes.
Results—During longitudinal follow-up, antipsychotic treatment reflected national prescribing
practices in 1991 through 2009. Longer follow-up correlated with smaller brain tissue volumes
and larger cerebrospinal fluid volumes. Greater intensity of antipsychotic treatment was associated
with indicators of generalized and specific brain tissue reduction after controlling for effects of the
other 3 predictors. More antipsychotic treatment was associated with smaller gray matter volumes.
Progressive decrement in white matter volume was most evident among patients who received
more antipsychotic treatment. Illness severity had relatively modest correlations with tissue

volume reduction, and alcohol/illicit drug misuse had no significant associations when effects of
the other variables were adjusted.
Conclusions—Viewed together with data from animal studies, our study suggests that
antipsychotics have a subtle but measurable influence on brain tissue loss over time, suggesting
the importance of careful risk-benefit review of dosage and duration of treatment as well as their
off-label use.
Schizophrenia, a common mental illness affecting 1% of the worldwide population, remains
a leading cause of chronic disability among young adults.1 Antipsychotic medications are
the mainstay of treatment because there is strong empirical evidence that these drugs reduce
psychotic symptoms and relapse rates in schizophrenia patients.2 Even though the majority
of patients receive antipsychotics and benefit from reduction in psychotic symptoms, many
patients continue to have negative symptoms, cognitive impairments, and progressive brain
tissue loss.3–13 The causes underlying these brain abnormalities are unclear and have been a
focus of much debate14,15 and many literature reviews.16,17
In a previous study comprising 119 schizophrenia patients,18 we found that brain volume
reductions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were related to a common genetic variant
within the brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene and to antipsychotic treatment, such that
more antipsychotic treatment correlated with greater frontal gray matter (GM) volume
reductions. When viewed in conjunction with controlled antipsychotic treatment studies in
animals,19–21 our previous findings suggest that antipsychotic treatment may contribute to
brain tissue volume loss. More recent literature reviews have highlighted the potential role
of antipsychotics in influencing brain volume deficits in schizophrenia and its
implications.22–26
The goal of the current study was to comprehensively evaluate the contributions of 4
potential causative factors that may mediate progressive brain volume decrement in
schizophrenia: illness duration, long-term antipsychotic treatment, illness severity, and
substance abuse. Extending our previous work,18 the present study has the largest available
cohort of schizophrenia patients who have undergone longitudinal MRI assessments. We
examined 211 patients and collected 674 high-resolution MRI brain scans (averaging 3
scans per patient; at least 2 and up to 5 per patient) over an extended period (mean, 7 years;
up to 14 years). Furthermore, multiple within-patient MRI scans coupled with an extensive
clinical database provide for more robust estimates of brain volume trajectories.
Understanding the long-term effects of antipsychotics on the brain has wider clinical
ramifications beyond treatment of patients with schizophrenia. Given the sharp rise in
antipsychotic utilization,27 especially among pediatric and geriatric populations,27–30
examining the possibility of antipsychotic-associated brain tissue loss has important
implications for assessing the risk-benefit ratio in a large number of psychiatric patients.
METHODS
Study participants were obtained through the Iowa Longitudinal Study (ILS).31 To be
eligible, participants must have met DSM-III or DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia-spectrum
disorders and have been presenting for treatment of their first psychotic episode. At intake,
patients underwent an extensive evaluation, including standardized clinical rating scales
(Scale for Assessment of Negative Symptoms,32 Scale for Assessment of Positive
Symptoms,33 Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History,34 and Psychiatric
Symptoms You Currently Have [PSYCH]35) and MRI. After intake, patients were examined
at 6-month intervals by means of longitudinal follow-up versions of the Comprehensive
Assessment of Symptoms and History and PSYCH, which included illness severity

measures, alcohol and illicit drug use, and detailed information regarding antipsychotic
treatment. Follow-up assessments were completed by experienced research personnel who
have undergone interrater and test-retest reliability training.36 At follow-up assessments
after 2, 5, and 9 years and every 3 years thereafter, MRI was repeated. Participant retention
in the ILS is 63%. Sociodemographic and illness characteristics of patients who remained in
the study are comparable to those of patients who dropped out.37
PATIENTS
The 211 patients (152 men and 59 women) in this report were selected from the larger ILS
sample on the basis of having (1) a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia (n= 192) or
schizoaffective disorder (n= 19) (verified at follow-up by psychiatrists’ consensus), and (2)
undergone 2 or more MRI brain scans. There were 674 MRI scans (211 patients each had 2
scans, 139 had 3, 82 had 4, and 31 had 5) covering a mean follow-up period of 7.2 years
(SD, 3.9 years; range, 1.9–14.0 years), and inter-scan intervals were approximately 3 years.
At the initial MRI, mean (SD) age was 26.3 (7.6) years, and most patients had received
minimal antipsychotic treatment (as detailed later).
MRI ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS
High-resolution brain anatomic MRI data were collected by means of 1 of 2 imaging
protocols on two 1.5-T MR scanners (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee,
Wisconsin). The type of imaging protocol was dependent on when the patient first enrolled
in the ILS. For patients who entered the study before calendar year 2000, their initial and
follow-up MRI scans were collected with the first imaging protocol (termed MR5). In
patients who were enrolled in 2000 or later, all MRI scans were obtained with the second
imaging protocol (termed MR6; see the supplementary “Methods” section and eTable 1
[http://www.archgenpsychiatty.com] regarding imaging parameters, data processing, and
comparability). Of the 674 MRI brain scans, 570 were MR5 scans derived from 168
patients. Patients in the MR5 group had been followed up longer (mean, 8.05 years vs 4.06
years for the 43 patients in the MR6 group). Otherwise, there were no significant differences
between the MR5 and MR6 groups on socio-demographics or illness characteristics (t ≤
1.27, P ≥ .21).
In this study, we examined the following regions of interest: total cerebral tissue volume,
total GM and white matter (WM), and GM:WM subdivided by Talairach atlas–based
cerebral lobes (frontal, temporal, and parietal), lateral ventricles, sulcal cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF), caudate, putamen, thalamus, and cerebellum (see the supplementary “Methods”
section regarding region of interest measurements and the eFigure showing schematic
representation of regions of interest).
ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENT, ILLNESS SEVERITY, AND SUBSTANCE MISUSE
At each 6-month follow-up assessment, detailed information during the preceding 6 months
was obtained from all available informants (ie, patient, family members, significant others,
and medical records) and summarized in a timeline that records specific antipsychotic dose,
treatment duration and medication adherence, illness severity, and alcohol/illicit drug
misuse.
Antipsychotic treatment is naturalistic given that the long-term nature of the study precludes
a random assignment design. Patients received “treatment as usual” in the community.
Antipsychotic choice and dosages were left to the patient and his or her treating psychiatrist.
Although it can be difficult to make precise measurements of lifetime antipsychotic
exposure by using retrospective methods, our assessments every 6 months combining
multiple information sources provide the most accurate treatment data possible in a long-

term, large-sample naturalistic study. In this report, we use lifetime antipsychotic treatment
up until the time of each MRI scan (expressed as mean daily antipsychotic dose
[chlorpromazine (CPZ) milligram equivalents per day]) to assess relationships between
antipsychotic treatment and brain volumes. To derive mean daily (total) antipsychotic dose,
each antipsychotic was first converted to CPZ milligram equivalent units,38,39 and then all
antipsychotic doses were summed and divided by the number of treatment days (see eTable
2 for CPZ equivalencies of individual antipsychotics).
Because intensity of treatment may be closely related to symptom severity and because we
wished to examine its potential effect on brain change independently, we also examined the
impact of illness severity on brain change. Since there is no single measure that
comprehensively captures illness severity in schizophrenia, we explored multiple alternative
approaches (eTables 3 and 4): Global Assessment Scale (GAS),40 symptom severity (mean
of psychotic, negative, and disorganized symptoms [global ratings on the Scale for
Assessment of Negative Symptoms and Scale for Assessment of Positive Symptoms] or as 3
separate symptom domains), global psychosocial functioning (rating scale within PSYCH),
mean daily clozapine dose, and a composite score derived from the 4 preceding illness
severity measures (weighted sum based on principal component analysis eigenvalues). Only
results using GAS scores (mean score during follow-up period; lower score means greater
illness severity) are presented herein. The GAS score is widely used in clinical studies,
provides anchors to enhance interrater reliability, and has good psychometric properties.
Mean GAS scores, negative/positive symptom ratings, and global psychosocial functioning
scores were highly intercorrelated with one another (Pearson |r|≥0.82). Mean daily clozapine
dose was less strongly correlated with the other 3 measures of illness severity (Pearson |r|
≤0.14). Furthermore, regardless of which individual illness severity measure or the weighted
sum composite score was used, results (eg, eTable 4) were similar to those using mean GAS
score. Research personnel assessing GAS scores showed good agreement and reliability on
their ratings (interrater and test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients, 0.79 and 0.62,
respectively).
Substance abuse is another potential confounder for the study of change in brain measures.
At follow-up assessments every 6 months, severity of alcohol use and severity of illicit drug
use were each assessed by a 6-point ordinal scale: 0, no use; 1, occasional use (weekend
binges) without social or occupational impairment; 2, occasional heavy use without
impairment; 3, frequent use (≥3 times per week) with mild impairment; 4, daily use with
moderate impairment; and 5, daily use with severe impairment leading to inability to
function in social or occupational roles. Severity of alcohol/illicit drug misuse was derived
by averaging both scores.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Analyses were performed with SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute, Inc,
Cary, North Carolina). Random regression coefficient mixed models were used to evaluate
the relationships between MRI brain volume changes and the 4 predictor variables: follow-
up duration (time between MRI scan and initial scan), antipsychotic treatment (mean daily
antipsychotic dose), illness severity (mean GAS score), and alcohol/ illicit drug misuse
(mean severity score). For each region of interest, within-patient repeated measures of brain
volumes were the dependent variables in each mixed model. Follow-up duration and an
intercept term were specified as random effects to model within-patient correlations in brain
volumes across time. The 4 predictor variables were entered concurrently as fixed effects,
allowing us to examine the influence of one predictor variable on brain volume changes
independent of the other 3 predictors. An antipsychotic treatment × follow-up duration
interaction term was also included in the statistical models to further assess the effects of
antipsychotic treatment on within-patient changes in brain volumes over time. Mean daily

antipsychotic dose was mildly to moderately correlated with mean GAS score and with
follow-up duration (Spearman r=−0.21 and 0.42, respectively; P< .001), Otherwise, there
were weak intercorrelations between these predictor variables (Spearman r ≤ |0.12|).
Furthermore, there was no evidence that these 4 predictor variables were highly collinear in
the mixed models (tolerance values ≥0.74). Intracranial volume at initial MRI scan, sex,
imaging protocol (MR5 vs MR6), and age at initial MRI scan were included as covariates. A
2-sided P<.05 was used to determine statistical significance.
RESULTS
ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENT BEFORE AND DURING LONGITUDINAL FOLLOW-UP
The sample had minimal antipsychotic treatment before study enrollment (Table 1); there
were 31 anti-psychotic-naive patients, and median treatment duration was 0.43 year. The
types of antipsychotics patients received reflect prevailing medication prescribing patterns in
the United States at the time (initial MRI scan, 1991–2006; last scan, 1995–2009). Typical
antipsychotics were the predominant treatment before the initial MRI scan. Nonclozapine
atypical antipsychotics became the main choice (in approximately two-thirds of the sample)
during subsequent interscan intervals. About 25% of patients received clozapine treatment.
Patients received adequate antipsychotic dosages, and treatment adherence was good (mean
[SD] of 1.90 [0.82] on a 5-point clinical rating scale in which 1 is excellent; 2, good [ie,
patient takes all psychiatric medications as prescribed; rarely, if ever, forgets or chooses not
to take medications]; 3, fair; 4, poor; and 5, nonadherent).
INDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF FOLLOW-UP DURATION AND ANTIPSYCHOTIC TREATMENT
ON BRAIN VOLUMES
Follow-up duration provides an indication of whether progressive brain changes occur over
time. It had significant main effects on all brain volumes (Table 2; F ≥ 5.39, P ≤ .02) except
for total cerebral WM, frontal WM, temporal WM, and cerebellum (F ≤ 2.03, P ≥ .16).
Longer duration of follow-up was significantly associated with total cerebral tissue, GM,
and subcortical brain tissue volume reductions (Table 2; b ≤ −0.01 cm3/y), and with parietal
WM, lateral ventricles, and sulcal CSF volume enlargements (≥0.18 cm3/y).
Because they may be confounders, we adjusted our analysis of treatment effects by
statistically correcting for the effects of follow-up duration, illness severity, and substance
misuse. Antipsychotic treatment still had significant main effects on total cerebral and lobar
GM and putamen volumes (Table 2; F ≥ 4.33, P ≤.04). Higher antipsychotic dose was
associated with smaller GM volumes (b ≤ −0.03) and larger putamen (b=0.01).
Antipsychotic treatment effects on GM volumes were independent of follow-up duration
(Table 2; antipsychotic treatment × follow-up duration interaction term F ≤ 1.17, P≥ .28).
On the other hand, there were statistically significant treatment × time interaction effects on
total cerebral tissue volumes, total cerebral and lobar WM, lateral ventricles, and sulcal CSF,
caudate, putamen, and cerebellar volumes (Table 2; F ≥ 3.79, P ≤ .05). Higher doses of
antipsychotic treatment were associated with greater reductions in WM, caudate, and
cerebellar volumes over time (b ≤ −0.0003), and with greater CSF volume and putamen
enlargements (b ≥ 0.0008).
To further illustrate how brain volume trajectories may differ according to the amount of
antipsychotic treatment, patients were grouped into tertiles of mean daily antipsychotic dose:
most treatment (70 patients; mean dose, 929.4 CPZ mg equivalents/d), intermediate
treatment (70 patients; mean dose, 391.7 CPZ mg equivalents/d), and least treatment (71
patients; mean dose, 111.5 CPZ mg equivalents/d). The Figure shows individual subject
brain volume trajectories and treatment tertile group mean brain volume trajectories for total

cerebral WM, lateral ventricles, and frontal GM volumes. We then conducted an extreme
group comparison to contrast brain volume changes between the most and least treatment
groups. Random regression coefficient mixed model analyses were duplicated replacing
antipsychotic dose with tertile group membership (most vs least treatment) and included a
tertile group × follow-up duration interaction term.
For total cerebral WM and lateral ventricles, there were statistically significant main effects
of tertile group × time interaction (Figure, A and B; t ≥ 2.28, P ≤ .02), indicating that brain
volume trajectories differed significantly across tertile groups of antipsychotic treatment.
The least-treatment group showed increased total cerebral WM over time in contrast to WM
volume reductions among patients in the most-treatment group (mean regression slopes,
1.30 vs −0.64, respectively). Similarly, patients in the most-treatment group had greater
enlargement of lateral ventricles than those in the least-treatment group (Figure, B; mean
regression slopes, 0.39 and 0.16, respectively). Consistent with the previous random
coefficient regression mixed-model analyses where antipsychotic treatment was entered as a
continuous measure, extreme tertile group contrast found significant main effects of tertile
grouping on frontal GM volumes (t = 2.19, P = .03). Patients who received the most
antipsychotic treatment had smaller frontal GM volumes, and this difference was
independent of follow-up duration (group × time interaction, t = 1.32, P = .18).
Patients who received the most antipsychotic treatment had smaller baseline total cerebral
tissue and larger lateral ventricles than the other 2 tertile subgroups (F ≥ 5.30, P ≤ .006).
There were no statistically significant differences between the treatment tertile groups
regarding the other baseline brain volumes (F ≤ 2.95, P ≥ .06).
INDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF ILLNESS SEVERITY AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ON BRAIN
VOLUMES
After controlling for the other 3 predictors, mean GAS score had significant main effects on
total cerebral GM and frontal GM volumes (Table 2) (F ≥ 4.38, P ≤ .04). Less illness
severity was associated with increased brain tissue volumes (b ≥ 0.27). There were no
statistically significant main effects of mean GAS score on the other brain volumes (F ≤
3.65, P ≥ .06).
The majority of the sample (68.3%) did not meet criteria for alcohol abuse/dependence or
illicit drug abuse/dependence. Seven patients had alcohol abuse/dependence only, 13
marijuana abuse/dependence only, 8 alcohol and marijuana abuse/dependence only, 19
alcohol abuse/dependence and nonmarijuana illicit drug abuse/dependence, and 30
nonmarijuana illicit drug abuse/dependence only. Severity of alcohol/illicit substance misuse
had no significant main effects on brain volumes (Table 2) (F ≤ 1.69, P ≥ .20) except on
lateral ventricles (F = 5.60, P = .02; b = 2.44) and on cerebellar volumes (F = 5.48, P = .02;
b = −3.25).
INDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF ANTIPSYCHOTIC CLASS ON BRAIN VOLUMES
To explore whether typical antipsychotics, nonclozapine atypical antipsychotics, and
clozapine may have differential effects on brain volumes in schizophrenia, we repeated the
mixed-models analyses in Table 2 by replacing mean daily (total) antipsychotic dose with
lifetime mean daily doses of typical antipsychotics, nonclozapine atypical antipsychotics,
and clozapine up until the time of each MRI scan (covariates: initial intracranial volume,
sex, imaging protocol, and age at initial scan; other fixed effects: follow-up duration, mean
GAS score, and substance misuse severity; and random effects: follow-up duration and
intercept term).

There were significant main effects of typical antipsychotic dose, nonclozapine atypical
antipsychotic dose, and clozapine dose on GM brain volumes (Table 3). Higher typical
antipsychotic doses were associated with smaller total cerebral GM and frontal GM volumes
(F ≥ 4.82, P ≤ .03). Higher doses of nonclozapine atypical antipsychotics were associated
with lower frontal and parietal GM volumes (F ≥ 6.74, P = .01), and higher clozapine doses
were associated with smaller total cerebral and lobar GM volumes (F ≥ 10.90, P ≤.001). For
WM volumes, higher nonclozapine atypical antipsychotic doses were significantly
associated with larger parietal WM volumes (F = 4.34, P = .04). There were no statistically
significant main effects of typical antipsychotic class or nonclozapine atypical antipsychotic
class on the remaining WM brain volume measures or on lateral ventricles. Higher clozapine
doses were associated with larger sulcal CSF volumes and smaller caudate, putamen, and
thalamic volumes (F ≥ 4.70, P ≤.03). Enlarged putamen was associated with higher doses of
both typical and nonclozapine atypical antipsychotics. Treatment with higher doses of
nonclozapine atypical antipsychotics was also associated with caudate volume enlargement.
COMMENT
In this large longitudinal cohort of patients with schizophrenia (211 patients with 674 MRI
scans) who were in their first episode and had received minimal treatment at the time of
entry into the study, we examined the independent effects of 4 variables on progressive brain
change during an extended period: illness duration, antipsychotic treatment, illness severity,
and substance misuse. We found that longer follow-up was associated with a greater
decrease in brain tissue volumes. Antipsychotic treatment also had a significant influence on
brain volumes even after accounting for the potential confounds of the other 3 variables.
More antipsychotic treatment was associated both with generalized tissue volume reduction
involving multiple subregions and with a specific increase in putamen. The other 2
variables, severity of illness and substance abuse, had minimal or no effects. Progressive
brain volume changes during the lifelong course of schizophrenia, including GM and WM
volume reductions, CSF volume expansions, and basal ganglia volume enlargements,
appeared in part to be related to antipsychotics. These findings may potentially have clinical
implications for the use of long-term antipsychotic treatment.
The plausibility of long-term antipsychotic treatment leading to global brain volume
reductions is further supported by recent controlled studies in macaque monkeys.19–21
Animal studies provide an additional perspective on possible causative links because they
permit postmortem neuropathological examination of the brain. Dorph-Petersen et al19
administered haloperidol, olanzapine, or sham medication to macaque monkeys in doses that
produced plasma levels equivalent to those observed in treatment of schizophrenia patients.
After 17 to 27 months of treatment, both haloperidol- and olanzapine-treated monkeys had
an equivalent and highly significant 8% to 11% decrease in fresh brain weight and volume
when compared with the sham group. These decreases affected all major brain regions but
were most robust in frontal and parietal lobes. The neuropathological manifestations of
antipsychotic-related frontoparietal volume reductions in macaque monkeys involves
decreased astrocyte numbers, decreased dendritic arborization, decreased dendritic spine
density, and increased neuronal density with no neuronal loss.20,21 Although there have been
some conflicting findings in the nonhuman primate literature (eg, studies by Lidow et al41
and Sweet et al42), these neuropathological changes are strikingly similar to those described
in the schizophrenia postmortem literature (eg, studies by Pakkenberg43 and Selemon et
al44).
These findings are also consistent with previous MRI studies suggesting that antipsychotics
produce changes in the human brain that are measurable by in vivo neuroimaging
techniques. The earliest work with morphometric MRI found increased basal ganglia size in
Ho et al.

schizophrenia patients, typically in the putamen.45,46 Subsequent studies have shown that
this may be a medication effect and that typical antipsychotics in particular play a causal
role in basal ganglia enlargement.47–51 Positron emission tomography studies measure
cerebral blood flow and, by inference, cellular metabolism. Previous positron emission
tomography studies conducted by our group52–54 confirm that both typical and atypical
antipsychotics increase putamen cerebral blood flow. In addition, antipsychotics reduce
frontal cerebral blood flow, suggesting that chronic frontal hypoperfusion could be a
mechanism underlying smaller brain tissue volumes. However, the available studies that
have used morphometric MRI to examine the effects of antipsychotics on cortical GM have
yielded ambiguous results,10,55–57 possibly due to small sample sizes, differing duration of
treatment assessment, variation in brain regions measured, and discrepant measurement
techniques.
In the present study, WM but not GM volumes showed significant time × antipsychotic
treatment interaction effects. Although higher antipsychotic doses were associated with a
decrease in GM volumes, this relationship did not appear to change during the course of
longitudinal follow-up in our study. A change in WM volume trajectories, on the other hand,
was associated with antipsychotic treatment. As illustrated by the extreme tertile treatment
group comparisons, patients in the most-treatment group had longitudinal WM volume
reductions. As a group, patients with the least treatment showed WM volume increases over
time that would be expected of individuals during their third and fourth decades of life.58
Bartzokis and colleagues59 previously found that patients with schizophrenia do not show
the normal age-related WM volume expansion during early to mid-adulthood. Thus, the
treatment × time interaction effects in the present study suggest that WM volume deficits in
schizophrenia may, in part, be related to antipsychotic treatment. Our study found that all 3
classes of antipsychotics (ie, typical, nonclozapine atypical, and clozapine) were associated
with deceases in GM brain volumes. The only differential effects on brain volumes between
typical and nonclozapine atypical antipsychotics were in parietal WM and caudate measures.
These typical-atypical differential effects on brain volumes in our study differ somewhat
from a recent randomized treatment study.10 Lieberman and colleagues found that
haloperidol treatment was associated with progressive GM volume reductions during that 2-
year study. In contrast, olanzapine-treated patients did not show GM volume decrement.
This raises concerns regarding the possibility of typical antipsychotic-associated neurotoxic
effects. Our study suggests that atypical antipsychotic treatment may mitigate parietal WM
volume loss in patients with schizophrenia; this finding needs to be interpreted with caution
and will require support from additional well-designed clinical trials in first-episode
patients.
Our results must be interpreted in the context of additional limitations. Identifying an
association does not necessarily indicate a causal relationship. Furthermore, observational
studies involving long durations such as ours inevitably preclude use of the “gold standard”:
a random-assignment controlled trial. The current study could have been strengthened by
having control groups, eg, schizophrenia patients assigned to deferred or no antipsychotic
treatment or healthy volunteers treated with antipsychotics for comparable periods.
However, ethical standards in human subject research prohibit such comparison groups. The
small number of schizophrenia patients in our sample who received no antipsychotic
treatment did not allow for meaningful statistical analyses. Illness severity and antipsychotic
dosages were modestly correlated (Spearman r=−0.21), and patients who received the most
treatment had smaller baseline cerebral tissue volumes. Associations between smaller brain
tissue volumes and more antipsychotic treatment may still be moderated via illness severity
despite our inclusion of illness severity as a covariate and obtaining similar results from
different measures of illness severity. Even with the most sophisticated statistical methods,
we may not be able to fully distinguish the potential confounding influences that illness

severity or other sources of unmeasured variance could still have on the relationships
between progressive brain volume reductions and antipsychotic treatment. Last, although
our Talairach atlas–based lobar measures have well-established reliability and validity, these
cerebral brain volumes lack precision to delineate abnormalities within smaller subregions
implicated in schizophrenia (eg, superior temporal gyrus and prefrontal cortex).
Findings from the present study raise several clinical questions. Are antipsychotic-associated
GM and WM volume reductions “bad” for patients? The implicit assumption is that brain
volume reductions are probably undesirable because patients with schizophrenia already
have diffuse brain volume deficits at the time of illness onset. Schizophrenia patients with
poor outcomes are also more likely to have smaller brain volumes. However, the
neurobiological changes that underlie MRI measurements of antipsychotic-associated brain
volume decrement remain poorly understood. Some studies indicate that antipsychotic-
induced changes mimic the neuropathologycal changes of schizophrenia,20,21 while others
suggest otherwise.41,42 If antipsychotics do indeed result in deleterious brain tissue volume
reductions, how does this influence the risk-benefit ratio of antipsychotic treatment? Given
that these medications have substantially improved the long-term prognosis of schizophrenia
and that schizophrenia is a disease with significant morbidity, continued use of
antipsychotics is clearly still necessary. However, our findings point toward the importance
of prescribing the lowest doses necessary to control symptoms. They also imply the need for
rethinking the underlying pathological processes in schizophrenia,47,48 the target at which
treatment is aimed, and the possibility that antipsychotic treatment may improve psychotic
symptoms but also contribute to progressive brain tissue volume deficits. Antipsychotics
were designed for the purpose indicated by their name, ie, to arrest psychosis. Not only is it
probable that antipsychotics do not treat the fundamental pathophysiologic mechanism of
schizophrenia (ie, the brain disease), but we perhaps must also entertain the possibility that
they might have potentially undesirable effects of brain tissue volume reductions. In
conjunction with neuroscientists and clinical investigators, pharmaceutical companies must
continue the vigorous search for agents that are genuinely neuroprotective.
The second-generation antipsychotics are also now widely used for people who do not have
schizophrenia, including children, the elderly, and patients with bipolar disorder or
depressive disorders.27–30 They are also used in adolescents who have been identified to be
at high risk for schizophrenia. Our findings may lead to heightened concerns regarding
potential brain volume changes associated with the sharp rise in atypical antipsychotic use in
non-schizophrenia psychiatric disorders. Even though no studies have assessed the long-
term effects of antipsychotics on brain volumes in nonschizophrenia patients, our results
suggest that antipsychotics should still be used with caution in these patient groups after
careful risk-benefit assessment. Because typical antipsychotics are off patent and less
expensive than atypical ones, there is also a growing trend to prescribe them preferentially
for patients with schizophrenia. Given that these older medications carry a greater risk of
producing extrapyramidal adverse effects and tardive dyskinesia, such a shift in clinical
practice may produce deleterious effects on the primary diseased organ in schizophrenia: the
brain.
CONCLUSIONS
Antipsychotics are effective medications for reducing some of the target clinical symptoms
of schizophrenia: psychotic symptoms. In medicine we are aware of many instances in
which improving target symptoms worsens other symptoms. Hormone therapy relieves
menopausal symptoms but increases stroke risk. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
relieve pain but increase the likelihood of duodenal ulcers and gastrointestinal tract bleeding.
It is possible that, although antipsychotics relieve psychosis and its attendant suffering, these

drugs may not arrest the pathophysiologic processes underlying schizophrenia and may even
aggravate progressive brain tissue volume reductions.

Comparison of magnetic resonance imaging brain volume trajectories between tertiles of
antipsychotic treatment. Tertiles were categorized as those who received the most treatment
(70 patients; mean [SD] dose, 929.4 [47.7] chlorpromazine [CPZ] mg equivalents/d),
intermediate treatment (70 patients; mean [SD] dose, 391.7 [77.2] CPZ mg equivalents/d),
and the least treatment (71 patients; mean [SD] dose, 111.5 [87.7] CPZ mg equivalents/d).
Individual patient brain volume trajectories (thin lines) and treatment tertile group mean
brain volume trajectories (thick lines) are shown for total cerebral white matter (A), lateral
ventricles (B), and frontal gray matter volumes (C).

Abbreviations: APS, antipsychotic; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; GM, gray matter; MRI, magnetic resonance imaging; WM, white matter.
aCovariates: intracranial volume at intake scan, sex, imaging protocol, and age at intake scan; random effects: follow-up duration and an intercept term to model within-patient correlations in brain volumes
across time (unstructured covariance structure).
bInterscan interval since initial MRI brain scan (days).
cLifetime APS treatment up to the time of MRI scan acquisition (mean daily APS treatment; chlorpromazine milligram equivalents per day).
dMean Global Assessment Scale score during follow-up period.
eMean severity of alcohol and illicit substance misuse during follow-up period (6-point rating scale: 0, none; 1, occasional use; 2, occasional heavy use; 3, mild impairment; 4, moderate impairment; and 5,
severe impairment).
fAntipsychotic treatment × follow-up duration interaction term.
