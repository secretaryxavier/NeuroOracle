Abstract. The twin Moderate resolution Imaging Spectro-
radiometer (MODIS) sensors have been ﬂying on Terra
since 2000 and Aqua since 2002, creating an extensive data
set of global Earth observations. Here, we introduce the Col-
lection 6 (C6) algorithm to retrieve aerosol optical depth
(AOD) and aerosol size parameters from MODIS-observed
spectral reﬂectance. While not a major overhaul from the pre-
vious Collection 5 (C5) version, there are enough changes
that there are signiﬁcant impacts to the products and their
interpretation. The C6 aerosol data set will be created from
three separate retrieval algorithms that operate over differ-
ent surface types. These are the two “Dark Target” (DT) al-
gorithms for retrieving (1) over ocean (dark in visible and
longer wavelengths) and (2) over vegetated/dark-soiled land
(dark in the visible), plus the “Deep Blue” (DB) algorithm
developed originally for retrieving (3) over desert/arid land
(bright in the visible). Here, we focus on DT-ocean and DT-
land (#1 and #2). We have updated assumptions for cen-
tral wavelengths, Rayleigh optical depths and gas (H2O, O3,
CO2, etc.) absorption corrections, while relaxing the solar
zenith angle limit (up to ≤84◦) to increase poleward cov-
erage. For DT-land, we have updated the cloud mask to al-
low heavy smoke retrievals, ﬁne-tuned the assignments for
aerosol type as function of season/location, corrected bugs in
the Quality Assurance (QA) logic, and added diagnostic pa-
rameters such topographic altitude. For DT-ocean, improve-
ments include a revised cloud mask for thin-cirrus detec-
tion, inclusion of wind speed dependence on the surface re-
ﬂectance, updates to logic of QA Conﬁdence ﬂag (QAC) as-
signment, and additions of important diagnostic information.
At the same time, we quantiﬁed how “upstream” changes
to instrument calibration, land/sea masking and cloud mask-
ing will also impact the statistics of global AOD, and affect
Terra and Aqua differently. For Aqua, all changes will result
in reduced global AOD (by 0.02) over ocean and increased
AOD (by 0.02) over land, along with changes in spatial cov-
erage. We compared preliminary data to surface-based sun
photometer data, and show that C6 should improve upon C5.
C6 will include a merged DT/DB product over semi-arid land
surfaces for reduced-gap coverage and better visualization,
and new information about clouds in the aerosol ﬁeld. Re-
sponding to the needs of the air quality community, in addi-
tion to the standard 10 km product, C6 will include a global
(DT-land and DT-ocean) aerosol product at 3 km resolution.

Introduction
Aerosols, the small, suspended liquid and solid particles in
the atmosphere, are important components of Earth’s climate
system. Among their many roles, they force the global energy
budget (IPCC, 2007), perturb the hydrological cycle (Koren
and Feingold, 2011), and in large concentrations are detri-
mental to human health (Pope et al., 2002).
Characterizing aerosol global distribution and changes
over time are necessary for understanding present and pos-
sible future climate conditions (e.g., IPCC, 2007). Towards
these goals, NASA has deployed a suite of satellites known
as the Earth Observation System (EOS) to monitor a number
of important climate properties, including aerosols. Two of

R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean
these EOS-era satellite sensors are the twin MODerate res-
olution Imaging Spectroradiometers (MODIS, Salomonson,
1989), which have been ﬂying in polar orbit on Terra (MT)
since 2000 and Aqua (MA) since 2002 (Remer et al., 2008).
MODIS has a wide spectral range (0.41 µm to 14.5 µm in
36 channels or bands), broad swath (2330 km) and relatively
ﬁne spatial resolution (1 km or less depending on band).
MODIS’ combination of swath, spectral bands and spa-
tial resolution lead to many algorithms for retrieving aerosol
information from MODIS observations. While some algo-
rithms are mainly atmospheric correction algorithms for the
retrieval of ocean or land properties, others are for the ex-
plicit purpose of retrieving aerosol properties. Here, we fo-
cus on the methodology and products from a speciﬁc family
of algorithms, designed for retrieving aerosol properties over
dark (in visible wavelengths) surfaces over land (Kaufman
et al., 1997a) and ocean (Tanré et al., 1997). This so-called
dark target (DT) retrieval is performed operationally (within
1–2 days) of satellite overpass, which is in fact two sepa-
rate algorithms (DT-ocean and DT-land). Speciﬁc retrieved
products include aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 0.55 µm
over land and ocean, and ﬁne model fraction (FMF) of AOD
at 0.55 µm over ocean. The standard retrieval resolution is
10 km (at nadir).
In addition to providing useful information to the cli-
mate community, the instrument’s 2330 km swath enables
nearly global coverage every day, which makes the opera-
tional DT aerosol product attractive for near-real-time mon-
itoring of aerosol (Al Saadi et al., 2005; Koren and Kauf-
man, 2004). The spatial resolution and repeatability lends
to ample statistics for deriving gridded global products (e.g.
King et al., 2003; Levy et al., 2009a; Shi et al., 2011) for
a variety of other applications (Stier et al., 2005; Yu et al.,
2006; Kaufman et al., 2005).
Because the operational MODIS aerosol product is so im-
portant to so many applications, its continued usefulness re-
quires a continuing effort to upgrade (better products) while
maintaining its integrity (keeps working) and usability (user
relearning not required). The last “major” update of the dark-
target aerosol product was implemented in early 2006, mark-
ing the start of so-called Collection 5 (C5; Levy et al., 2007a,
b; Remer et al., 2008). At that point, the DT-land algo-
rithm was signiﬁcantly overhauled. Through validation ef-
forts (e.g., Remer et al., 2008; Levy et al., 2010), assim-
ilation studies (e.g., Hyer et al., 2011; Zhang and Reid et
al., 2010), and other work since 2006 (e.g., Bréon et al.,
2011), the C5 aerosol algorithm and products have been eval-
uated in detail. From these and other evaluations, we learned
about the conditions in which the retrieval and products per-
formed well, but also conditions in which the product fell
short of expectations. Using this information, we prepared
for a Collection 6 (C6).
For C6, instead of a “major” upgrade to the algorithm and
products, only “maintenance and modest improvement” was
proposed. “Maintenance” included streamlining the science
codes, updating the processing environment along with new
computer machinery, and improving the user experience
when accessing and analyzing the data. “Modest improve-
ment” meant such improvements that would increase the
global accuracy and coverage of the product, but without ma-
jor change to the science of the algorithm. However, there are
major changes to how data “conﬁdence” or Quality Assur-
ance (QA) is assigned (Hubanks, 2012). Obsolete parameters
have been deleted from the product ﬁles, whereas new diag-
nostic parameters have been added. The result is more in-
formation available to recreate the conditions of the retrieval
and for the user to determine what may have gone awry.
The C6 algorithm will be applied to all archived and future
data that will be collected from both MODIS instruments.
C6 will represent a continuous, consistent data record span-
ning more than a decade for each satellite. In addition, from
our experience when transitioning from Collection 4 (C4)
to C5, the effort necessitated an evaluation of how changes
in upstream activity (calibration, cloud masking, etc.) would
impact the aerosol products. Even if the aerosol algorithms
were to remain unchanged from C5 to C6, the global aerosol
product would be different because the inputs are different.
Finally, in response to the air quality community’s need for
high resolution aerosol retrieval (e.g., C. Li et al., 2005), the
C6 product will not only include the standard 10 km aerosol
retrieval product (Remer et al., 2005) but also global products
at 3 km (Remer et al., 2013; Munchak et al., 2013).
This paper therefore is intended to introduce the commu-
nity to the C6 dark-target aerosol algorithm and products.
We ﬁrst summarize the basic concepts of the DT retrieval
algorithm. Then we document the changes from C5 to C6,
describing why we made these changes, as well as their ex-
pected impacts to regional and global aerosol statistics. Note
that C6 not only represents an update to the aerosol algo-
rithm but also an update to all MODIS algorithms, including
the calibration and cloud masking algorithms that produce
the inputs to the aerosol algorithm. Also note that when we
report changes, they are not necessarily in chronological or-
der or order of largest impact.
In general, the C5 →C6 changes can be separated into
four categories: (a) changes to the algorithm that were ne-
cessitated by changes in upstream products (e.g. calibration,
cloud mask or land/sea ﬂags), (b) modiﬁcations to the re-
trieval that would produce different values for the same-
named parameters as in C5 (if there were no changes to up-
stream products), (c) additions and deletions to the list of
available parameters, and (d) completely new products that
will be available in separate data ﬁles. This paper addresses
all four categories of modiﬁcation. Some of the changes are
seemingly small details, but they must be documented. In
the interest of the more casual reader, these details can be
found in the Appendices. In combination with this paper in
the refereed literature, we plan to update the online Algo-
rithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD), last updated in
2009 (for C5). We recognize that there will be considerable

duplication, although the ATBD leaves more room for de-
scribing the history and theory of the algorithm, as well as a
more convenient avenue for updating information as needed.
In Sect. 2, we describe the MODIS Dark Target (DT)-
algorithm, its history through C5, and and why it needed im-
provement. In Sect. 3, we begin with upstream changes to
the algorithm, including calibration, geolocation and ancil-
lary data upgrades. In Sect. 4, we describe changes to the DT
algorithm and products for C6, divided into: changes to the
upstream products (Sect. 4.2), changes in radiative transfer
and look-up tables (Sect. 4.3), changes speciﬁcally for DT-
land (Sect. 4.4) and DT-ocean (Sect. 4.5), changes to com-
bined land and ocean (Sect. 4.6), new DT products (Sect. 4.7)
and the Deep Blue (DB)-DT merge products (Sect. 4.8). Sec-
tion 5 is devoted to the new L3 aggregation protocol. Sec-
tion 6 revisits L1B changes, speciﬁcally related to Terra, and
how we expect the two sensors to better track each other.
Section 7 introduces a new, parallel aerosol product at higher
(3 km) resolution. In Sect. 8, we discuss how we intend to
use the MODIS product to help transition to future satellite
data products.

MODIS aerosol retrieval
2.1
MODIS jargon and basic retrieval concepts
MODIS observes a swath approximately 2330 km wide, and
makes between 14 and 15 orbits per day. For ease of pro-
cessing and data storage, MODIS data are organized into
5 min swath segments called granules (288 per day), which
are composed of 1354 by 2030 pixels at nominal 1 km res-
olution (near nadir). The fundamental MODIS ﬁle is called
Level 0 (L0) and refers to raw counts from the sensor’s de-
tectors; when organized into scans, they are known as Level
1A (L1A). Level 1B (L1B) are calibrated data, providing ge-
olocated radiances or reﬂectances, and these L1B data are
the inputs to the MODIS geophysical retrieval algorithms, in-
cluding aerosol. The resulting geophysical products (in 5 min
granules) are designated as Level 2 (L2). Level 3 (L3) refers
to daily and monthly statistics of the geophysical products,
organized on to a 1◦× 1◦latitude/longitude grid (King et
al., 2003). Note that these products are processed in a lin-
ear fashion (L0 →L1A →L1B →L2 →L3), and that some
L2 products are used as inputs for other “downstream” L2
products. This is true for aerosol retrieval, which is a L2
product that requires the existence of other L2 products as
well as L1B. All MODIS data products (from L1 onward)
are provided in Hierarchal Data Format Files (HDF), and
are labeled MODXX for Terra and MYDXX for Aqua. Each
HDF ﬁle provides metadata and scientiﬁc data sets (SDSs).
SDSs may be multi-dimensional (e.g., across-track × along-
track × bands).
The L2 aerosol product ﬁles are known as MOD04
(Terra) and MYD04 (Aqua), or MxD04 (in general). The
MxD04 retrieval requires input L1B ﬁles, L2 ﬁles, and an-
cillary data provided by NOAA/NCEP. L1B ﬁles include
the nominal 1 km, 0.5 km, and 0.25 km reﬂectance products
(MxD021KM, MxD02HKM and MxD02QKM; http://mcst.
gsfc.nasa.gov/content/l1b-documents), and the 1 km geolo-
cation product (MxD03; Wolfe et al., 2002). The required
L2 products are the “cloud-mask” (MxD35_L2; Ackerman
et al., 2010) and “atmospheric proﬁle” (MxD07_L2). Ancil-
lary data are at 1◦× 1◦resolution, and include the closest 6-
hourly, meteorological analysis from the Global Data Assim-
ilation Model (GDAS; http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/gmb/
gdas/). The aerosol retrieval fails if any one of these input
ﬁles is missing.
MODIS pixel size increases towards swath edges, (http:
//eoweb.dlr.de:8080/short_guide/D-MODIS.html), such that
nominal pixel size is 1.0 × 1.0 km at nadir, but 4.8 × 2.0 km
at edge. Thus, the 1354 pixel-wide granule, in fact, repre-
sents a 2330 km-wide swath. Since MxD04 is not gridded,
the product spatial resolution also increases toward swath
edges. Standard MxD04 ﬁles (MxD04_L2) have a nomi-
nal spatial resolution of 10 × 10 km at nadir, but increase to
48 × 20 km near the swath edge. L3 products (Hubanks et al.,
2008), however, are aggregated to a constant 1◦× 1◦grid,
and are denoted as MxD08_D3 (daily), MxD08_E3 (8-day)
and MxD08_M3 (monthly). Note that aerosol products are
bundled with other atmospheric products (clouds and water
vapor) in these L3 ﬁles (King et al., 2003).
The MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithms are maintained
and updated by the MODIS aerosol science team. The op-
erational MODIS retrieval data are produced and archived
by the MODIS Adaptive Processing System (MODAPS;
http://modaps.nascom.nasa.gov/services/), and are available
online (http://ladsweb.gsfc.nasa.gov). MODIS calibration is
supported by the MODIS Characterization Support Team
(MCST; http://mcst.gsfc.nasa.gov). The quality and accuracy
of downstream retrieved products (including aerosol) is de-
pendent on the accuracy of the calibration of the algorithm’s
input radiances, which the MCST reports accuracy of ±2–
3 % for typical situations (Xiong et al., 2005, 2007).
2.2
Basic concepts of the MODIS aerosol retrieval
algorithms
The MODIS aerosol algorithms have been in development
for over 20 yr, well before the launch of Terra. These algo-
rithms were designed to capitalize on the wide spectral range
of the MODIS instrument. The primary assumption is that in
a clear-sky (non-cloudy) scene, the solar radiation backscat-
tered from aerosols have different spectral signatures than
either the Earth’s surface or atmospheric molecules. By us-
ing multiple bands in the visible (VIS), near-IR (NIR), and
shortwave-IR (SWIR) wavelength regions, one can perform a
retrieval to back out the aerosol signature, and infer the phys-
ical properties of the aerosols within the scene. Of course, the
devil is in the details, and since the Earth’s surface, molecular

2992
R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean
atmosphere and aerosols do not have entirely independent
spectral signatures, the MODIS retrieval must make obser-
vational and physically based assumptions.
To that end, the operational MODIS aerosol retrieval algo-
rithms are actually three separate algorithms; each requires
separate assumptions about the Earth’s surface and the ex-
pected aerosol types above these surfaces. Prior to launch, al-
gorithm concepts were developed for vegetated land surfaces
(Kaufman et al., 1997a) and remote ocean regions (Tanré et
al., 1997). Collectively, we denote these algorithms as the
dark-target (DT) algorithms because they operate best on re-
gions that are “dark” visually. The third algorithm, developed
well after launch, is known as the Deep-Blue (DB) algorithm
(Hsu et al., 2004, 2006), and was originally designed for
application over bright-desert regions. Although these sur-
faces appear “bright” visually, they are actually fairly dark in
the near-UV (Deep Blue band near 0.41 µm), improving the
signal for aerosol retrieval relative to longer, visible wave-
lengths. The DB algorithm is handled by a different science
team, and except for a ﬁnal merge to make a “best-of” prod-
uct (discussed in Sect. 4.8), this paper focuses on the C6 DT
aerosol product.
Prior to launch, the physical and numerical assumptions
that form the basis of the DT algorithms, as well as the proto-
algorithms themselves, were tested using mathematical tech-
niques and by using proxy data obtained from aircraft instru-
ments and ﬁeld experiments (Tanré et al., 1996; Kaufman
et al., 1997b; Chu et al., 1998; Remer and Kaufman, 1998;
Remer et al., 1998; Tanré et al., 1999). Although the de-
tails of the DT algorithms have evolved over time, the basic
concepts remain unchanged. There are complete descriptions
of the C5 DT algorithms in the literature (e.g., Levy et al.,
2007a, b; Remer et al., 2005, 2008) and within the online C5
Algorithm Theoretical Basis Documents (ATBD, Levy et al.,
2009b).
Tanré et al. (1996) suggested that to increase signal-to-
noise, one should perform the MODIS aerosol retrieval at a
lower resolution (e.g., 10 km at nadir) than the inputted spec-
tral reﬂectance data (e.g., 500 m). Pixels that are non-optimal
for aerosol retrieval, for whatever reason, can be screened
out yet leave enough “good” pixels to make a successful re-
trieval. Therefore, the pixel data are organized into N by N
boxes (e.g., 20 by 20), and the geo-location information (e.g.,
MxD03 or MxD35) are used to determine nominal surface
type (water, land or other) of the scene, and which fork of
the retrieval to follow. If all (100 %) pixels are considered
“water”, then the over-ocean algorithm is performed. If any
pixel (at least 1) is considered “land”, then the land retrieval
is attempted. If a scene has no land pixels, but has at least one
“other” pixel (e.g., coastal or lake shore), then no retrieval is
attempted at all. Regardless of which fork is chosen, it is not
likely that all pixels are suitable for aerosol retrieval. For ex-
ample, there is a test to determine if a “land” pixel is in fact
contaminated by water (e.g., small stream, ephemeral water
body). Likewise, there is a test (Li et al., 2003) to ﬁlter out
shallow water pixels contaminated by underwater sediment.
Other tests ﬁlter out ice/snow pixels (R. R. Li et al., 2005),
bright land scenes, glint over water, etc. Finally, Martins et
al. (2002) describe how to ﬁlter out cloudy pixels. Once all
truly unsuitable pixels are removed, the procedure discards
the brightest 25 % and darkest 25 % of remaining pixels over
ocean, and the brightest 50 % and darkest 20 % over land. Be-
cause the reﬂectance has been screened for clouds and non-
optimal surfaces, and the remaining pixels have been further
ﬁltered, residual contamination is minimized over most situa-
tions. Furthermore, the retrieval performs corrections for ab-
sorption by atmospheric gases (water vapor, ozone, etc.). The
pixels that remain, after all de-selection and gas corrections
are applied, are understood to represent the conditions that it
may be possible to retrieve aerosol properties (e.g., Remer et
al., 2012). These pixels are averaged, yielding a ﬁnal set of
mean spectral reﬂectance that is understood to be representa-
tive of conditions that DT aerosol retrieval can succeed, e.g.,
clear skies, no gases, and low surface variability. The algo-
rithm takes this set of “observed” top-of-atmosphere (TOA)
spectral reﬂectance, and tries to match to values within look
up tables (LUTs).
The LUTs, themselves, represent atmospheric optical
properties (TOA reﬂectance, atmospheric transmission, etc.)
for a set of likely aerosol conditions. We assume that a par-
ticular aerosol type X is characterized by a size distribution
(dV/dR, with V and R volume and radius), and index of
refraction that varies spectrally. Using a Mie code (for as-
sumed spherical particles) or analogous (for non-spherical
particles), one can compute the spectral scattering and ex-
tinction coefﬁcients that represent a single particle of type X.
Increasing the columnar loading of particle X is the same as
creating an integral of extinction coefﬁcient – the AOD, and
AOD varies spectrally. In other words, we can index aerosol
type X by AOD at 0.55 µm (to include values such as 0.0,
0.5, 1.0, 2.0, etc.), and thus have determined AOD at any
other wavelength. In addition, atmospheric properties vary
by sun/satellite geometry, so at discrete values of solar and
observation angles, there are determined properties of TOA
reﬂectance, atmospheric transmission and backscattering ra-
tio for a particular indexed AOD of aerosol type X. Note that
for AOD = 0.0, this is the molecular-only (Rayleigh) case,
so that for AOD > 0.0, the LUT represents the coupling of
aerosols plus molecular scattering.
There are differences between the details of creating LUTs
over ocean versus over land. Over ocean, the LUT repre-
sents the optical properties of ocean (glint, foam, water-
leaving radiance) coupled with the atmosphere (molecu-
lar plus aerosol). Over land, the LUT is calculated over
a black surface, so that the TOA is the atmosphere only.
Over ocean, there are nine such aerosol type X’s, where
each type is a single mode of log-normal size distribu-
tion. There are four “ﬁne” modes (having effective radius
re < 0.25 µm) and ﬁve “coarse” modes (re > 1.0 µm). Over
land, there are ﬁve aerosol types, each comprised of two

R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean

or more log-normal modes. These may be “ﬁne-dominated”,
or “coarse-dominated” depending on which mode dominates
the size distribution. For simplicity, we will use the term
ﬁne model, to represent both the ﬁne modes over ocean and
the ﬁne-dominated models over land. Likewise, the coarse
model refers to the coarse modes over ocean as well as the
coarse-dominated models over land. Details of the RT codes
and LUT assumptions are described more fully in literature
(e.g. Levy et al., 2007a; Remer et al., 2005).
When we say inversion to the LUT, we assume that the am-
bient aerosol scene consists of a mixture of ﬁne and coarse
models, such that each contributes to the spectral TOA re-
ﬂectance. Since everything is indexed to AOD at 0.55 µm,
the total AOD is the weighted combination of AOD from
each model, weighted by the ﬁne model fraction (η or FMF).
Although both DT algorithms perform inversions to ﬁnd
matches to the LUT, the required assumptions are different.
Over the ocean, except for where there is strong glint, sed-
iments or other surface contamination, surface reﬂection be-
comes negligible as the wavelength increases. This means
that a reﬂecting aerosol layer provides good contrast over
the ocean, and that at least two pieces of aerosol information
(loading, size) can be retrieved (Tanré et al., 1996). Spectral
reﬂectance (ρλ) observations in six wavelengths (0.55, 0.65,
0.86, 1.24, 1.63, and 2.11 µm) are compared with LUT re-
ﬂectance that represents various combinations of ﬁne model
(selected from 4 modes) and coarse model (selected from 5
modes). Thus, the retrieved products over ocean are the total
aerosol optical depth (AOD or τ) at 0.55 µm, the ﬁne mode
fraction of AOD at 0.55 µm (FMF or η) and which ﬁne/coarse
combination provided the best solution, along with the least
squares spectral ﬁtting error (ε).
On the other hand, over land, the surface is much more
variable, and is dark enough only under some conditions.
Therefore, many more assumptions need to be made about
the surface and aerosol type, in order to accurately determine
only one piece of information (aerosol loading). Kaufman et
al. (1997b) discovered that in many vegetated regions, there
is a consistent relationship between surface reﬂectance at
0.47, 0.65 and 2.11 µm (the “VISto2.1” relationship). There-
fore, observation/LUT comparison is done in only these three
wavelength bands. Since the LUT is calculated without sur-
face contributions, the algorithm is constrained by the sur-
face spectral relationships. Since the land algorithm tries to
deal with larger surface uncertainty with only three spectral
bands, both ﬁne and coarse model aerosol types must be pre-
scribed as a function of season and location. The retrieved
products over land include total AOD (0.55 µm), fraction of
ﬁne-model aerosol type (also known as FMF), constrained
surface reﬂectance, and ﬁtting error.
Thus both DT algorithms retrieve total AOD at 0.55 µm
(τ) and FMF (η: mode over ocean, model over land) with
a the spectral ﬁtting error (ε). Each algorithm reports addi-
tional derived and diagnostic parameters. Derived parame-
ters can be calculated from information contained within the
LUT and/or other retrieved products. For example, knowing
the resulting total AOD and FMF, and which aerosol types
were selected (or assumed), one can go back to the lookup
table, and recover additional information about the retrieved
aerosol. This includes AOD in other wavelengths, which can
be used to calculate Ångström Exponent (AE). The retrieval
solution also determines effective radius, asymmetry param-
eter, and other properties of the size distribution or radiation
ﬁeld. Diagnostic parameters include information used to per-
form the retrieval, as well as information about the retrieval
itself. Solar zenith angle is an example of information going
into the retrieval; the number of pixels used, is an example of
information about the retrieval.
Finally, there is the run-time Quality Assurance (QA)
(Hubanks, 2012). At selected stages during the retrieval pro-
cess, the algorithm will evaluate whether a task was or could
have been adequately performed. If, for some reason, a task
was not performed correctly, conditions for retrieval are
marginal, or something is not “behaving” as expected, the
quality of the retrieved product should be degraded. Among
other tests, the QA logic will examine how many pixels were
thrown out during cloud masking, how well the retrieval so-
lution ﬁts the observations, and whether or not the solution is
characteristic of realistic physical conditions. Each test trig-
gers its own QA ﬂag. If, during the retrieval, some aspect
is less than ideal, the overall accuracy of the retrieval is ex-
pected to degrade. Ideal performance is given the highest QA
“Conﬁdence” value (QAC = 3), with good, marginal and no
conﬁdence retrievals given QAC values of 2, 1 and 0, re-
spectively. The results of the many individual QA tests, plus
the ﬁnal determination of QAC are all coded into a ﬁve-byte
SDS. Different bits represent the results of individual tests.
For C5, the QA logic and bit values were discussed in the
ATBD (Levy et al., 2009b).

Evaluation of the C5 MODIS aerosol products
Immediately following Terra launch the ﬁrst aerosol prod-
ucts were evaluated in a variety of ways that included quali-
tative examinations and quantitative comparisons of data col-
lected from collocated sun photometer (SP) data including
those from Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) stations
(Holben et al., 1998; Ichoku et al., 2002; Chu et al., 2002;
Remer et al., 2002). Evaluation led to modiﬁcations of the al-
gorithm to avoid problematic situations and also to add capa-
bility, expand retrieval coverage, and provide new products.
Each major change to the algorithm is labeled a “Collection”,
although minor changes had made under the same Collection
number. The early Collections were frequently revised. The
ﬁrst set of validated products appeared in Collection 2 (C2),
although these were quickly replaced by C3 within the ﬁrst
two years of Terra launch. C4 was the ﬁrst stable, widely
used and well-documented set of MODIS aerosol products
(Remer et al., 2005). However, the C4 aerosol product over
land produced unacceptable levels of bias (Levy et al., 2005).

R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean
A second-generation land algorithm was developed and im-
plemented as C5 (Levy et al., 2007a, b) and other changes
were implemented at the same time. The MODIS Deep Blue
algorithm (Hsu et al., 2006) was added to the Collection 5
processing after the processing had already begun and was
thus labeled Collection 5.1 (C51). Since the dark-target algo-
rithms are identical for C5 and C51, we refer to them both as
“C5”. Details of the C5 DT algorithms are presented in the
literature (Remer et al., 2005, 2008 over ocean; Levy et al.,
2007a and b over land) as well as within the online ATBD
(Levy et al., 2009b).
Identical C5 DT aerosol retrieval algorithms have been
applied to the entire time series of both MODIS’ data
(2000/2002 through 2011). This has allowed time for an
exhaustive evaluation process, including numerous papers
on global, regional and local MODIS product “valida-
tion”. Global validation has been performed by comparing
MODIS-retrieved AOD and size parameters to similar pa-
rameters observed from AERONET, both over land (Levy et
al., 2010) and over ocean (Remer et al., 2008). In addition to
these global studies, MODIS has also been compared to ad-
ditional ground based (e.g., Levy et al., 2005), airborne (e.g.,
Redemann et al., 2009) and shipborne SPs (e.g., Kleidman et
al., 2012).
The major goal of the validation studies was to deﬁne an
expected error (EE) envelope, containing at least 67 % (ap-
proximately one standard deviation) of the matchups on a
scatter plot. From pre-launch sensitivity studies, the overall
EE for AOD should be a combination of absolute error (dom-
inating at low AOD) and relative error (dominating at high
AOD). For C005, the EE for total AOD (at 0.55 µm) was de-
ﬁned to be ± (0.03 + 5 %) over ocean (Remer et al., 2008)
where QAC ≥1, and ± (0.05 + 15 %) over land (Levy et al.,
2010) where QAC = 3. While the EE was deﬁned for the set
of all MODIS/sun photometer combinations, actual compa-
rability depended on conditions of the observation scene (lo-
cation, season, etc.) as well as the estimated QAC of the
retrieval (e.g. Breón et al., 2011). The MODIS/AERONET
agreements were about the same for Terra and Aqua, with
similar percentages falling within EE. The C5 algorithm was
the ﬁrst to allow retrievals of small negative AOD, down to
−0.05. While not physical, randomly retrieving a negative
AOD is a statistically realistic portrayal of small positive
AOD, and clearly helped in reducing the statistical bias as
compared to sun photometer.
In addition to AOD, EE deﬁnition was attempted for
retrieved aerosol size parameters over ocean and land.
Although Kleidman et al. (2005) pointed out that FMF
was not uniquely deﬁned, MODIS retrieved FMF com-
pared with AERONET-retrieved sky-radiance FMF within
approximately ±0.20. Anderson et al. (2005) worked with
Ångström exponent (AE) because it is less ambiguous. Levy
et al. (2010) found that the MODIS-retrieved FMF over land
had too little skill to derive meaningful EE envelope. Breón
et al. (2011) deﬁned EE for ﬁne-mode AOD over ocean, but
did not do so over land.
While a useful EE could be deﬁned for AOD over both
land and ocean, these and other validation studies clearly
showed that C5 aerosol products were not equally accurate
and stable every place and every time. MODIS/AERONET
“comparability” (regression slope, intercept, correlation and
number within EE envelope) varied as a function of loca-
tion and season, conditions of retrieval (scattering geome-
try, cloud fraction), and also due to subjective algorithm tests
during retrieval. In some cases, these evaluations indicated
that assumed conﬁdence (QAC levels) was assigned based
on the wrong criteria.
There are large tracts of Earth (over both land and ocean)
with few AERONET sites to compare with. Data assimila-
tion (e.g. Hyer et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2008) is a tool
that can be used to characterize the MODIS product away
from AERONET sites. Data are compared not only with
AERONET, but also with each other (neighboring pixels),
with pre-run model estimates, and with statistical measures
for estimating conﬁdence. These studies concluded that over
30–50 % of the globe, the C5 MODIS data were performing
acceptably (within EE) and could be inserted directly into a
weather or transport model. Another 30 % of the data could
be used if appropriate “bias correction” was applied. How-
ever, 20 % of the data were unusable and had to be discarded.
For example, Shi et al. (2011) concluded that MODIS data
over the southern oceans was unusable for data assimilation,
because of cloud contamination and unrealistic high values.
2.4
Terra versus Aqua
The global validation studies (such as Levy et al., 2010;
Remer et al., 2008) indicated that there was no signiﬁ-
cant difference between MODIS/AERONET comparability
(slope, offset, correlation, fraction within EE) for the two
MODIS instruments (MT and MA). There were slight dif-
ferences, however, that in hindsight can be explained. Remer
et al. (2008) noted that regression slope for MT (0.967) was
higher than for MA (0.900). At the same time, the monthly
global mean AOD for MT was consistently higher than MA
by about 0.015. Monthly regional means were also 0.015
higher. Finally, a curious thing had happened when going
from C4 to C5 (Remer et al., 2008). MT’s time series of
monthly mean over-ocean AOD jumped by 0.015, while
MA’s remained constant. In other words, something changed
between C4 and C5 that created the offset.
Over land, Remer et al. (2008) found no such offset be-
tween MT and MA; also no signiﬁcant difference between
overall MODIS/AERONET comparability. Yet a time series
plot (their Fig. 5) shows an apparent downward tendency
for MT, which is not visible for MA. Levy et al. (2010)
suggests (in their Fig. 15) that MT/AERONET compara-
bility also changes over time, such that MT > AERONET
prior to 2004 and MT < AERONET afterwards. This kind of

divergent behavior was not limited to the aerosol product.
Wang et al. (2012) showed that Normalized Difference Veg-
etation Index (NDVI) was also diverging.
What was causing the Terra/Aqua offset in AOD over
ocean, and the drifting AOD over land? The ocean color re-
trieval team had long been using vicarious calibration tech-
niques (e.g. Franz et al., 2007) to reduce drifts in their
tiny ocean color signal. This issue was especially problem-
atic in the deep blue MODIS wavelengths (e.g. 0.41 µm),
but was not considered to be major problem for the longer
wavelengths used for aerosol and NDVI retrieval. Yet Wang
et al. (2012) demonstrated that even small drifting of the
blue (0.47 µm) could be responsible for the NDVI prod-
uct divergence, in that this channel was used for estimat-
ing aerosol effects. Furthermore own sensitivity tests (unpub-
lished) demonstrated that a 1–2 % drift in blue channel (less
than the stated accuracy maintained by MCST) was sufﬁcient
to produce a trend or multi-sensor divergence in the MODIS
aerosol products.
Due to calibration updates, there was a signiﬁcant jump
in the aerosol product when going from C4 to C5. MCST
is updating the calibration as we go from C5 to C6. This is
not a trend paper, or a calibration paper, but as we discuss the
C5 →C6 aerosol retrieval and products, we must account for
updates to the upstream products that are used as input to the
aerosol retrieval.
3
Experimental setup
There are clearly problems with the MODIS C5 product.
Yet, there is overall agreement with AERONET data, and
the product has been shown to be usable within an assimila-
tion framework. There are many, many users of the MODIS
aerosol product, and they have come to expect relative con-
sistency in product output and format. Therefore, the aim
of “maintenance and modest reﬁnement” was to improve
the MODIS-DT aerosol product without a complete over-
haul. This means that the basic theory, science and logic of
the DT algorithms would remain similar to C5. However,
there were coding bugs to ﬁx, assumptions to reconsider,
and diagnostic information to add. Also, based on our ex-
perience when going from C4 →C5, and the extensive use
of MODIS AOD data for determining aerosol climatology
and trends (e.g., Remer et al., 2008; Zhang and Reid, 2010;
Mishchenko et al., 2007; Karneili et al., 2009; de Meij et al.,
2012; Kishcha et al., 2007; Koukouli et al., 2010, etc.), im-
pacts due to upstream calibration and must also be quantiﬁed.
Even if the aerosol algorithms were to remain unchanged
from C5 to C6, the global aerosol product would be differ-
ent because the inputs are different. C6 not only represents
an update to the aerosol algorithm but also an update to all
MODIS algorithms, including the calibration (MxD02) and
cloud masking algorithms (MxD35) that produce the inputs
to the aerosol algorithm. Since the ﬁnal C6 algorithm will be
applied to all archived and future data that will be collected
from both MODIS instruments, we need a test bed of data
that samples enough of the globe, across enough of the time
series.
In addition to calibration updates, MCST was also updat-
ing the geolocation information. As described in Sect. 2.2,
the MODIS aerosol retrieval requires geolocation informa-
tion as to whether “ocean” or “land” fork should be fol-
lowed. Yet, as Carroll et al. (2011) explains, there are some-
times signiﬁcant and rapid changes in land/water cover, es-
pecially in the Arctic. Also, there are coastal and lakeshore
regions with complicated, fractal-like structure. For C6,
the MCST is relying on a 250 m-resolution water mask
(Carroll et al., 2009), which provides signiﬁcant changes
to land/sea discrimination (http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/
QA_WWW/forPage/LWM_diff.html), especially for lakes
and river basins. This will lead to differences in water/land
ﬂagging for selecting which DT-retrieval fork.
As discussed in the introduction, there are four categories
of C5 →C6 changes. Two of these changes will lead to re-
vised values of AOD and aerosol size. These are (a) changes
to upstream products (e.g. calibration, cloud mask or land/sea
ﬂags) and (b) modiﬁcations to the retrieval that would pro-
duce different values for the same-named parameters as in
C5 (if there were no changes to upstream products). These
are not necessarily independent changes, because sometimes
a retrieval modiﬁcation was made to account for changed up-
stream product. Therefore, when we report changes and their
impacts, they are not necessarily in chronological order or
order of largest impact. In some cases, we may report on a
change that was later abandoned.
To incrementally test the impacts of any changes, we set
up an “operational-like” processing environment on our non-
MODAPS machines. We also tasked the MODAPS group
to set up a testing environment on their machines, in order
to repeatedly process different versions of the algorithm on
multiple granules, days or months of MODIS aerosol prod-
ucts. Depending on the test performed, MODIS data were
chosen from different periods of the combined Terra/Aqua
mission. Some tests only required small amounts of data on
Terra or Aqua separately, while others required full months
of data from both satellites. Large statistical evaluation re-
quired processing of multiple months of data across multiple
years, which included both January and July from 2003, 2008
and 2010, as well as April and October 2008. These months
were picked because they sample the time period of the
Terra/Aqua trend divergence, as well as a complete year. We
might be able to determine whether to expect the Terra/Aqua
divergence (discussed in Sect. 2.4) to remain when the entire
time series is reprocessed for C6.
To assess the impacts of different algorithm upgrades, our
metrics included basic statistics (global mean AOD, num-
ber of valid retrievals), histograms, and dual collocation with
AERONET or other SP data. However, while the statistical
tests are quantitative, the easiest way to assess individual

R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean
changes is to make pictures, speciﬁcally maps of gridded,
monthly mean AOD. These are in form of difference maps
(e.g., “new – baseline”). From these tests, we can determine
whether the change had a signiﬁcant global impact, where it
had signiﬁcant impact, and whether or not it pushed MODIS
data closer to or farther from SP values.

Changes that affect the DT aerosol product
(MxD04_L2)
In this section, we describe the major changes to the DT (land
and ocean) aerosol algorithms and products, as we move
from C5 to C6. Section 4.1 shows the “overall” changes for
the four months in 2008, and breaks them down incremen-
tally for one month (July 2008). Section 4.2 illustrates up-
stream (calibration, geolocation and cloud mask changes).
Section 4.3 concerns changes that are common to both DT
algorithms, including radiative transfer and gas absorption
corrections. Sections 4.4 and 4.5 are concerned with changes
to the speciﬁc algorithms over land and ocean, respectively,
where Sect. 4.6 discusses the combined products.
4.1
Overall change summary
Rather than begin by listing and describing each update,
we use Fig. 1 to show the overall change to the MODIS
DT AOD products. Here we use Aqua as the example, and
plot the four months (January, April, July and October) of
2008. Each panel represents gridded 1◦× 1◦mean, where
the mean is calculated by averaging all the L2 observa-
tions that occur within each grid box. This is not neces-
sarily the way one should create a monthly mean AOD
(see Sect. 6 and Levy et al., 2009a), but it is easy to com-
pute and adequate for our purpose. For each row (month
in 2008), there are four panels. The left panel is the grid-
ded AOD for C5, the left-center is the gridded AOD for ex-
pected C6, the right-center is the difference C6–C5 for grids
where both data sets have a value, and the right panel is
the change in coverage (usually increased) for C6 as com-
pared to C5. Here we plot aggregation of the QA-ﬁltered SDS
known as Optical_Depth_Land_And_Ocean. Only retrievals
that meet certain QAC requirements (e.g. QAC = 3 over land,
and QAC ≥1 over ocean, as recommended by Remer et al.,
2008) are stitched into this SDS.
From these global maps, we note the following major
changes to the aerosol product:
1. There are large differences between C5 and C6 over
both land and ocean.
2. Over most global ocean, AODs are reduced. The
largest negative changes (< −0.04) are in the mid-
latitudes (e.g., 40–50◦latitude in both hemispheres).
This includes the well-scrutinized “roaring 40s” in
the Southern Hemisphere (SH). AOD tends to be in-
creased over the tropics.
3. Over most global land, AOD is decreased. There are
larger decreases (< −0.04) over the more arid regions
(e.g. southwestern United States, middle Asia, Sahel
in Africa, southern Africa, savannas of Brazil), and
general increase over the more vegetated regions (e.g.
Canada and Eastern US; rainforests of South America,
Africa and Asia).
4. There is new “coverage” in C6. This includes the entire
latitude belt (over ocean) towards the pole of the winter
season. There is also new coverage over inland water
bodies of Asia.
5. The patterns are consistent from month to month, al-
though the locations of the largest changes varies.
There are many changes in both upstream processing and
aerosol retrieval that have led to these major changes. This
is illustrated in Fig. 2, where we trace the change in Aqua’s
July 2008 AOD from C5 (panel a) to C6 (panel k), with the
overall difference (C6–C5) plotted in panel f. Note that these
panels are the same as the three leftward panels of the third
row in Fig. 1. As we consider each major change to the up-
stream and processing we will refer to the appropriate panel
in Fig. 2.
4.2
Upstream changes including L1B reﬂectance,
geolocation and cloud mask
As described in Sect. 2.4, analysis of the C5 aerosol time se-
ries showed curious differences between AOD derived from
MT versus MA. We will discuss in more detail (in Sect. 8),
but the short story is that we believe the reason for the curi-
ous differences was due to issues in instrument calibration,
especially for MT. MCST is continually updating the cali-
bration coefﬁcients, and even for the same MODIS measure-
ments (e.g. L1A data), the C6 L1B data will be different than
C5. Although calibration changes to MT are much larger and
have larger impacts on aerosol retrieval (discussed in Sect.
8), calibration has interesting non-linear effects on Aqua’s
aerosol products.
In the same way we created maps of gridded (1◦× 1◦)
monthly mean AOD (e.g. Figs. 1 and 2), we can create maps
of monthly “mean” TOA reﬂectance in the seven bands.
While this quantity is not physically correct (angular depen-
dence is ignored), its calculation helps to provide intuition.
Maps of reﬂectance (C5) and differences (C6–C5) are shown
in Fig. 3, for Aqua during July 2008. Note that these are taken
from the along-orbit (swath) granules so that reﬂectance is
normalized by cosine of solar zenith angle.
Each row of Fig. 3 represents a MODIS wavelength band
that is used in aerosol retrieval (0.47, 0.55, 0.65, 0.86, 1.24,
1.63 and 2.11 µm). For each row, the two left panels are cal-
culated from the observed reﬂectance that is reported in the
1 km L1B ﬁles (MYD021KM). Missing or bad data are not
included. The 1st panel is that computed from the C5 ﬁles,

R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean
2997
Fig. 1. Gridded, monthly averaged 1◦× 1◦AOD (at 0.55 µm) over land and ocean retrieved from Aqua for four months (January, April, July
and October) in 2008. For each row (month), the 1st panel is an aggregated product produced from C5, the 2nd panel is from C6 and the 3rd
panel is the differences C6–C5. The 4th panel shows the additional AOD coverage (colors) versus deleted coverage (black).
whereas the 2nd panel is the difference if computed from the
C6 ﬁles. There is no screening for clouds, ice or anything
else, so we see our world, spectrally. Areas of mostly clear
sky (dark) and areas of persistent clouds (brighter) are appar-
ent. Frozen Greenland is highly reﬂective. Water is dark, es-
pecially for longer wavelengths. In general, after calibration
changes, observed TOA reﬂectance is reduced in 0.47, 0.55,
0.65 and 0.86 µm bands (by about 0.3 %), but is the same or
slightly increased in the 1.24, 1.63 and 2.11 µm bands (by
less than 0.1 %). These are small changes, and we would not
expect them to impact aerosol retrieval.
As explained in Sect. 2.2, the aerosol retrieval algorithm
aggregates and averages a subset of the L1B reﬂectance ob-
servations (pixels). During the retrieval process, gas absorp-
tion corrections are applied, along with cloud masking, snow
masking and other pixel deselection. Pixels that are too bright
for DT aerosol retrieval are removed, as well as pixels too
dark (too small of a signal to expect success). While the de-
tails are somewhat different between the two DT algorithms,
the result is one set set of clear-sky, non-desert, non-snow,
TOA spectral reﬂectance in seven bands (0.47, 0.55, 0.65,
0.86, 1.24, 1.63 and 2.11 µm), from which a subset may be
later used for over-land (5 bands) or over-ocean (6 bands) re-
trieval. Speciﬁcally, this quantity is reported as SDSs named
“Mean_Reﬂectance_Land” and “Mean_Reﬂectance_Ocean”
within the MxD04 ﬁle. The right-side panels of Fig. 3 show
gridded averages from these L2 SDSs.
Again, while this quantity is not physically meaningful
(angular dependence is ignored), the 3rd column of Fig. 3
illustrates the relative differences between land and ocean
and over different regions. Maps in this column are derived
from C5 aerosol algorithm using C5 reﬂectance (MYD02)
and C5 geolocation/cloud mask (MYD03/MYD35) inputs,
demonstrating the well-known spectral dependence of clear-
sky reﬂectance. For example, in the 0.86 µm band, although
the reﬂectance is not “atmospherically corrected”, one can
clearly see the regions of strong vegetation versus regions of
less vegetation, and no vegetation (water). Also, in this band,
one can see the patterns of heavy aerosol (such as East Asian
and Indian plumes). The maps in the 4th column of Fig. 3
show the change in spectral TOA “mean” reﬂectance if only
the MYD02 ﬁles were replaced by C6 versions (keeping the
C5 MYD03 and MYD35 inputs).
Comparing the 2nd and 4th columns, it is clear that there
is non-linear relationship between changed inputs (C6–C5
MYD02 ﬁles) and changed aerosol retrieval inputs (C6–
C5 MYD04 ﬁles). There are differences between land and
ocean, and there is something strange about the 1.63 µm

band. Except for the 1.63 µm band, the overall sign of the
change is consistent between land and ocean, but over ocean,
the relative change is much larger than might be expected
by the small changes to inputs. While puzzling at ﬁrst, the
non-linear response over ocean was traced back to the issue
of pixel decision. We discuss more thoroughly in Sect. 4.5,
but essentially there are pixels that are “too dark” to retrieve
successfully. The small decrease (−0.3 %) in 0.86 µm band
leads to 10 % fewer successful retrievals over ocean, shift-
ing the distribution of L2 reﬂectance values. Over land, there
is no reduction of successful retrievals, so the entire L2 re-
ﬂectance is reduced by 0.3 %. As this happens over mostly
dark regions (vegetation), where reﬂectance is on the order
of 0.1 in the visible, this leads to a trivial decrease of 0.0003
in the visible bands.
In addition to “calibration” changes that lead to dif-

there are anomalous, degraded, and or non-functional
detectors within the MODIS image. This is especially true
for Aqua and for bands #6 (1.63 µm) and #5 (1.24 µm). In C5
data, data for these bad detectors may have been averaged
from adjacent detectors. While indicated by lowered Quality
Assurance (QA), the aerosol (and other) algorithms tended
to ignore the distinction between valid and interpolated data.
For C6, MCST is not providing interpolated data, but instead
leaving missing data values (e.g., −9999). The insertion
of negative ﬁll values impacts any test that calculates
standard deviation of reﬂectance, such as cloud masking
(e.g., Martins et al., 2002). The issue of MCST protocol for

Fig. 3. Gridded “average” reﬂectance from Aqua for July 2008, demonstrating how small updates to L1B calibration can contribute to larger
impacts on L2 products. For each wavelength band (row), the two left panels are calculated from L1B reﬂectance at 1 km (MYD021KM), and
the right two panels are calculated from L2 reﬂectance at 10 km (MYD04_L2), which represents the reﬂectance used to derive the aerosol
parameters. For the left two panels (L1B), the 1st is derived from C5 data, and the 2nd is the change due to using C6 (C6–C5). For the right
panels (L2), the 1st is from the C5 aerosol algorithm if using C5 MOD02 inputs (the C5 aerosol product), whereas the 2nd shows the change
if using the same C5 aerosol algorithm, but replacing with C6 MOD02 inputs. Note differences in the color scales for the two sets of panels.
missing detectors is the cause for the odd response in 1.24
and 1.63 µm bands.
Interestingly, although new MYD02 has a big impact on
the mean L2 reﬂectance (used as input to aerosol retrieval)
over ocean, the effect on the over-ocean AOD is small.
When reducing the number of successful retrievals by 10 %,
fewer near-zero AOD retrievals are counted for calculation of
mean AOD. Thus, the over-all effect of new input MYD02
ﬁles, (but leaving all other inputs), is a trivial decrease in
mean AOD over ocean (0.001). Over land, the corresponding
change in global AOD is also decrease of 0.001. Again, we
note here that there are much bigger changes to Terra’s C6
L1B calibration than for Aqua, which does lead to compar-
atively bigger changes to the resulting MxD04 aerosol prod-
uct. We will discuss Terra’s calibration change more fully in
Sect. 8, but here we continue to focus on Aqua.
Calibration and MxD02 data processing are not the only
upstream changes that impact the MODIS aerosol retrieval.

R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean
Changes in geolocation data (MxD03; Wolfe et al., 2002)
and cloud mask protocols (MxD35; Ackerman et al., 2010)
also matter. As described in Sect. 2.2, the MODIS aerosol
retrieval requires information as to whether the land” or
“water” fork should be attempted. Coastlines, shorelines
and riverbanks have complicated, fractal-like structure, and
whether a particular pixel is land or water is uncertain. For
the C5 aerosol retrieval, this information was read from the
MxD35 ﬁle (at 1 km). For the MxD35 SDS, there are four
choices of water condition: land, water, coastal or desert.
Yet, the information in MxD35 is actually determined from a
choice of eight categories within the MxD03 (geolocation)
ﬁle: land, coastal, ephemeral water, shallow inland water,
deep inland water, shallow ocean, moderate ocean or deep
ocean. The MxD03 categories of coastal, ephemeral water
and shallow inland water all converged into “coastal” for
MxD35, although in overall sense, pixels ﬂagged as “coastal”
in C5 MxD35 were rare.
For C6, geolocation is now dependent on a new 250 m-
resolution water mask (Carroll et al., 2009), which espe-
cially in the boreal regions of the Northern Hemisphere, clas-
siﬁes more area as water (http://landweb.nascom.nasa.gov/
QA_WWW/forPage/LWM_diff.html). The new water mask
also identiﬁes subpixel water contamination. Much of this
subpixel area is then classiﬁed by MxD03 as “coastal” which
leads to more “coastal” in MxD35. This is illustrated in
Fig. 4. Without upgrades to the DT algorithm, there would
be signiﬁcantly more land area, especially in these boreal re-
gions, where no aerosol is retrieved at all.
The so-called “Wisconsin” cloud mask (MxD35; Acker-
man et al., 1998, 2010) has also been updated for C6 (http:
//modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov/products_C006update.html).
There are many changes (including the land/sea mask issue
just discussed); however, most do not impact the MxD04
product. However, as discussed in the C5 aerosol ATBD
(Levy et al., 2009b), the aerosol retrieval reads in results of
three infrared tests that are reported in MxD35. One of these
tests was changed, the tri-spectral IR temperature difference
test, stored in bit 18 of the cloud mask. The MxD35 found
that the “Bit 18” test was overzealously masking clear sky as
cloudy, and has replaced the test with a simpler 8.6–11 µm
brightness temperature threshold and difference test. The
result of the change did increase cloud-free area over the
ocean oceans; however, it also allowed more thin cirrus
cases to be considered clear. Over tropical oceans, this tends
to increase cloud contamination for the aerosol product.
Even for the exact same aerosol retrieval algorithm, the
combination of changes to upstream products (calibration,
L1B reporting protocol, land/sea mask, and cloud mask)
leads to signiﬁcant differences in the aerosol product. The
consequence to the AOD retrieval resulting from this to-
tal difference in L1B is displayed in Fig. 2b. Here, we see
the changes due to calibration (reduced AOD over ocean),
due to land/sea mask changes (changes over Canada), and
cloud mask changes (increases in tropical oceans). For global

AOD, both ocean and land are reduced by 0.003. In later sec-
tions we discuss some of the compensations made to the DT
algorithms in response to these upstream changes.
4.3
Updates to radiative transfer and LUTs
Accurate aerosol retrieval requires accurate radiative trans-
fer (RT) and accurate LUTs. Calculating an accurate LUT
requires accurate assumptions of wavelength to calculate
for. Since the MODIS LUTs include coupling of molecular
scattering (Rayleigh), we also need an accurate estimate of
the Rayleigh optical depth (ROD). Levy et al. (2007b) dis-
cussed the problem as applied to the 0.466 µm wavelength
Band 3. Speciﬁcally, since the C4 DT-land retrieval assumed
0.470 µm instead of 0.466 µm, the ROD was assumed as
0.186 rather than 0.194. This was corrected for C5, and re-
versed an automatic bias of at least 0.01 in retrieved AOD
over the entire globe.
For C6, we explored this issue again, and for both DT-
land and DT-ocean. Different radiative transfer (RT) codes
are used for computing the LUTs over land (Levy et al.,
2007a; Evans and Stephens, 1991), and over ocean (e.g.,
Remer et al., 2005; Ahmad and Fraser, 1982). Motivated
by studies such as Kotchenova et al. (2008), we explored
whether the two LUTs would agree to within 1 % criteria.
They did not. Even for common geometrical conditions and a
molecular-only (Rayleigh) atmosphere over a black surface,
results from the two RT codes could differ by 3 % or more.
Some of the causes included:
– Assumptions about MODIS-band wavelength and
Rayleigh optical depth (ROD) were still different over
land and ocean. Neither set matched values presented

R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean
3001
on web pages (e.g. http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/
DOCS/RSR_tables.html).
– The angular resolution was insufﬁcient (quadrature an-
gles too few).
– The subtle difference between “layers” and “levels”
was confused, so that up/down transmission values
over land were mistakenly computed for layer #1 (next
to the surface) rather than level #0 (the surface).
– The over-land LUT did not include the “depolariza-
tion factor” (King, 1923; Young, 1980) for molecular
dipole depolarization. It is approximately 0.0279 but
varies slightly with wavelength.
– Over ocean, the RT code included correction for CO2,
which was not included over land. In fact, since CO2
was already corrected for during the aerosol retrieval,
this meant a double correction over ocean.
From combined Terra/Aqua MODIS-band ﬁlter functions
(http://mcst.gsfc.nasa.gov/), we determined weighted center
wavelengths and used formulas from Bodhaine et al. (1999)
to recalculate sea level molecular ROD values (results in Ap-
pendix A). We considered unifying the land and ocean RT
codes, but concluded it would introduce other complications.
Instead, we corrected the issues listed. We also increased
the angular/stream resolution to the limit of our comput-
ing power. Through this effort, the two RT codes had con-
verged (to 0.1 %) in calculating TOA reﬂectance for a case
of Rayleigh only/black surface. The net effect of taking these
steps to homogenize the RT codes and aerosol LUTs resulted
in a global mean increase of 0.01 AOD over land, and a de-
crease of 0.005 AOD over ocean.
At the same time as deriving accurate aerosol LUTs,
aerosol retrieval requires correction for the absorption of at-
mospheric gases. While the aerosol retrieval is performed in
bands that are centered in atmospheric windows, the non-
trivial width of these bands (nominally 20 nm) contains ab-
sorption lines of water vapor (H2O), ozone (O3), and other
gases (CO2, CH4, O2, N2O, NO2, etc.). However, the gas
absorption corrections used for C5 included only H2O, O3
and CO2, and being derived well before Terra launch, were
not reproducible. Appendix A describes the use of the Line-
By-Line RT model (LBLRTM; Clough et al., 1992, 2005) for
deriving the new gas absorption coefﬁcients used for C6. Ap-
pendix A also discusses how air mass factor is calculated and
applied within the retrieval.
From Aqua, for July 2008, Fig. 5 plots gridded maps of
MxD04 TOA spectral reﬂectance, demonstrating how the
new gas corrections lead to changes to sometimes signiﬁcant
changes to the “observations” used to compare to LUTs and
retrieve aerosol. In percentage units, relative global changes
in each band (0.47, 0.55, 0.65, 0.86, 1.24, 1.64 and 2.11 µm),
are +0.5 %, −0.5 %, +3 %, +2 %, +5 %, +1 % and −1 %,

R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean
respectively. These changes are rather large, especially in the
0.65 and 1.24 µm bands.
The updates to gas absorption have interesting impacts
on retrieval of AOD. The net effect of the C6 gas correc-
tion (compared to the C5) is increase in the input reﬂectance
values in most wavelength bands. When applying these new
gas corrections, the overall, global mean AOD increased by
0.012 over both land and ocean. This result would be ex-
pected over ocean, where reﬂectance is systematically in-
creased, but surprising over land. The reason is the im-
pact of the 1.24 µm channel in pre-determining the expected
“VISto2.1” surface reﬂectance relationship. As discussed in
Levy et al. (2007b), the aerosol retrieval over land uses the
1.24 µm and 2.11 µm channels to calculate the aerosol resis-
tant NDVIswir, which is in turn used to estimate the VISto2.1
relationship. Figure 6 (left panel) shows a 1◦× 1◦computa-
tion of NDVIswir over land, calculated from the mean grid-
ded values displayed in Fig. 5 (left panels). Vegetated ar-
eas have larger NDVIswir than more arid regions. However,
with the changes in 1.24 µm reﬂectance, (right panel), there
is uniform increase over all land regions, especially semi-
arid regions. Based on the NDVIswir to VISto2.1 formulas in
Levy et al. (2007b), the effect would be to decrease the ex-
pected surface contribution to TOA reﬂectance and increase
the aerosols (i.e. AOD).
The other change affecting both land and ocean is the ex-
tension of retrievals to more oblique solar zenith angles that
increases coverage at high latitudes. The C5 algorithm did
not permit retrieval when the solar zenith angle (20) was
larger than 72◦. There were no aerosol retrievals made for rel-
atively high latitude regions during low-light seasons, even
though interesting aerosol events were seen in MODIS im-
agery (Crusius et al., 2011). Motivated to increase coverage
of these events, we added solar zenith angles of 20 = 78◦
and 20 = 84◦to both ocean and land LUTs, after conﬁrm-
ing with the authors of the RT codes (Z. Ahmad, personal
communication, 2011) that slant path errors should not be
too large at these angles. The Fig. S8 (Supplement) within
Crusius et al. (2011), demonstrates that relaxing the solar
zenith angle threshold (20 ≤84◦) enables retrievals of dust
in the Gulf of Alaska. It allows more granules to be processed
(to include granules from orbits in partial darkness), and in-
creases coverage for the pixels that are already processed.
Overall, when applied to the multiple months of data the new
threshold adds approximately 1 % and 8 % to the number
of valid aerosol retrievals over land and ocean, respectively.
Preliminary comparison to AERONET concluded that accu-
racy was not compromised.
To summarize, this section has introduced only the C6
changes that were intended to homogenize radiative transfer
assumptions (wavelength bands, Rayleigh optical depths and
gas absorption corrections) and increase satellite retrieval
coverage (larger solar zenith angles). Figure 2c shows the dif-
ferences in aggregated Level 2 data from Aqua for July 2008,
on 1◦× 1◦gridding, where the aerosol retrieval algorithm

(C5-like) and the inputs (C6 L1B and ancillary data) are held
constant. Only the gas coefﬁcients and LUTs have changed.
From “old” (C5 aerosol with C6 inputs) to “new” (C5 aerosol
with C6 inputs, but with new gas absorption and consistent
RT coding), the overall AOD increase over ocean (by 0.008)
is small, but the increase over land (by 0.022) is large.
4.4
Changes for DT-land
The C5 over land DT retrieval had been carefully validated
using collocated sun photometer measurements (Levy et al.,
2010; Bréon et al., 2011). These studies showed that, over-
all, the MODIS DT-land AOD is well correlated with the
SP and matches within a deﬁned expected error envelope.
However, these studies also show regional situations with
much poorer accuracy. Sometimes this degradation of accu-
racy occurs at high AOD, where model assumptions domi-
nate the error. Such locations include South America during
the biomass burning season where the slope between MODIS
and SP data is much higher than 1.0, suggesting there is too
much absorption in the assumed aerosol model (Ichoku et
al., 2003). Sometimes the degradation of accuracy occurs at
low AOD, where land surface reﬂectance assumptions dom-
inate the error. For example, urban surfaces (Jethva et al.,
2007; Oo et al., 2010) and dry, reddish soils are brighter
in the visible than expected, which introduces positive off-
sets that can be as high as 0.2. Very dark, dense vegetation
sometimes creates an underprediction of visible surface re-
ﬂectance, which introduces negative offsets and AOD. The
following sections investigate the possibilities of modifying
the C5 aerosol model and surface reﬂectance assumptions to
make these regional improvements while not compromising
the excellent global validation. Not all of the studied modiﬁ-
cations were eventually implemented into the C6 algorithm.

Assumed aerosol type and optical properties

types over land. When C5 was developed, the aerosol

climatology was based on cluster analysis of all AERONET
almucantar and size distribution retrievals archived through
2005 (Levy et al., 2007a). Since that time, there have been
thousands of size distribution retrievals at the same and
additional AERONET sites around the globe. In addition,
there have been many updates to the AERONET retrieval it-
self (http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov) including updates of non-
spherical dust assumptions and retrieval of non-spherical
fraction (Dubovik et al., 2006). Instead of using the same sur-
face reﬂectance assumptions for all almucantar inversions,
the newer Version 2 inversion products use surface spec-
tral albedo climatology as determined by MODIS (Holben et
al., 2006). According to studies of the version 2 AERONET
products, retrieved size distributions, refractive indices and
single scattering albedos, at least at some sites, have changed
signiﬁcantly from those reported for Version 1 (Giles et al.,
2012). Since there have been changes to AERONET clima-
tology, we investigated whether the MODIS aerosol model
assumptions, based on this climatology, would require an
update.
Using the same methodology as described by Levy et
al. (2007a), we performed a cluster analysis of the entire
AERONET climatology through 2010. Surprisingly, while a
few sites showed signiﬁcant differences from that observed
by the prior analysis, the overall pattern was unchanged. In
general, the global aerosol type could be separated into ﬁne-
mode dominated (ﬁne models) and coarse-mode dominated
(coarse models), with the ﬁne models further separated into
being strongly absorbing, moderately absorbing and weakly
absorbing. Although there were slight changes for each ﬁne
model’s optical properties, they were not signiﬁcant enough
to justify revision. Thus, for C6, the Table 1 from Levy et
al. (2007a) remains valid for the ﬁne-model aerosol optical
properties.
Like as discussed by Levy et al. (2007a) the clustering
procedure also determined the “dominant” aerosol type at
each site, as a function of season. While the overall spa-
tial distribution remained the same as deﬁned for C5, there
was much larger AERONET sampling, and more opportu-
nity to ﬁne-tune the model distribution borders. Figure 7
shows the global, seasonal distribution of aerosol type se-
lection that is applied for C6. The obvious change from C5 is
that the border contours are now drawn by hand, to account
for mountainous terrain that separate aerosol regimes. Dif-
ferences are seen over the Amazon (aerosol is now assumed
moderately absorbing, consistent with Schafer et al., 2008),
over southeastern Asia (now more absorbing), and over the
western United States (now clearly separated by the Rocky
mountains).
Clustering of the coarse model cases was also performed.
Unlike pre-C5, we saw signiﬁcant variety for absorption
properties of coarse-mode, non-spherical aerosol. Over re-
gions such as northern India, about 30 % of the cases sug-
gested the presence of an absorbing coarse-mode aerosol
having visible-band SSA < 0.90. However, there was no

obvious pattern that separated between “clean” dust days
with low absorption (SSA > 0.95) and “dirty” dust days
with higher absorption. Sensitivity tests showed that if we
could correctly assign the more absorbing coarse model,
the MODIS aerosol retrieval might have more sensitivity to
FMF. To test, we created an absorbing coarse dust model
LUT, and allowed the operational MODIS code to try and
retrieve it. However, in practice, the more absorbing dust
model did not give the MODIS operational algorithm any
new skill. The variability of the surface was still dominating,
so that a combination of absorbing dust and non-absorbing
ﬁne model was not sufﬁciently better than a combination of
non-absorbing dust and absorbing ﬁne model. Thus, with-
out a clear logic for choosing between absorbing and non-
absorbing dust in the MODIS aerosol retrieval, we chose to
keep only the single coarse model type (weakly absorbing,
non-spherical dust); the coarse model is unchanged from C5.
4.4.2
Land surface assumptions
The C5 MODIS land product did not compare as well to
AERONET in regions with brighter surfaces and/or moun-
tainous terrain (e.g., US southwest, Mongolia, etc.). As the
algorithm is tuned towards dark, vegetated targets, this re-
sult was not surprising. However, given that the MODIS data
set had doubled since 2005 and AERONET included many
new sites, we attempted to reformulate the assumed surface
spectral VISto2.1 relationship (Kaufman et al., 2005; Levy
et al., 2007b). Similar to the procedure described by Levy et
al. (2007b), atmospheric correction was performed over the
entire collection of MODIS/AERONET collocations. There
were differences between these results and those using the

2005 data base. However, any attempt to tune a new param-
eterization relating VIS surface reﬂectance to 2.11 µm re-
ﬂectance using these new results introduced no improvement
compared to C5.
However, even though theoretically the land surface pa-
rameterization will remain unchanged from that described in
Levy et al. (2007b), in practice a large change will be imple-
mented in C6. On more than one occasion, the MODIS data
users have inquired about the validity of the NDVIswir in esti-
mating the VISto2.1 relationships. Personal communications
(L. Yang, 2012; P. Gupta, 2011) had suggested that Fig. 3
and Eq. (10) from Levy et al. (2007b) were both counter-
intuitive. We determined that the plot legend had been re-
versed, as well as the equation, which had also been coded
into the software. Thus, for C6, we ﬁx this mistake, and the
expected impact to the global picture is shown in Fig. 2g.
The bug affected how the assumed surface reﬂectance is de-
pendent on NDVISWIR. Fixing the bug creates a large change
in the retrieved AOD and introduces a distinctive spatial pat-
tern in which AOD increases over vegetated surfaces and de-
creases over arid surfaces.
We also considered alternatives to surface reﬂectance pa-
rameterization. One idea was to abandon the on-the-ﬂy
VISvs2.1 assumptions and instead rely on climatology of
MODIS albedo (e.g., Moody et al., 2005, 2008; Schaaf et al.,
2011). While direct application of gridded MODIS-derived
albedo (instead of surface reﬂectance) introduced signiﬁcant
errors to the aerosol retrieval, we saw promise when us-
ing ratios of spectral surface albedo in place of assumed
VISvs2.1 parameterization. In general, improvements were
made (reducing bias compared to AERONET) in the rela-
tively brighter arid regions without harming the comparisons
over most vegetated surfaces. However, without discussing
details, successful application of the albedo data set required
a huge amount of processing and computer overhead, and we
found issues with latitude/longitude registration over highly
heterogeneous surfaces (e.g., urban areas). Therefore, while
the application of surface albedo climatology may be a good
step for the future, we decided to abandon this approach for
now. For C6, we use the VISvs2.1 surface reﬂectance param-
eterization but with reversed NDVISWIR dependence, origi-
nally introduced for C5 (Levy et al., 2007b).

Cloud mask and pixel selection over land
The success of the MODIS dark-target retrieval depends on
its ability to throw out unsuitable pixels. At a minimum,
the over-land DT algorithm throws out 70 % of the ob-
served 500 m resolution data, (darkest 20 % and 50 % bright-
est when sorted by 0.66 µm reﬂectance). However, in most

cases, some pixels are completely unsuitable for aerosol re-
trieval, including clouds, snow and inland water bodies.
The most critical step is accurate cloud masking. Failure
to fully remove clouds leads to cloud contamination, and too
strong a cloud mask leads to insufﬁcient aerosol coverage.
Because the standard MODIS cloud mask (MxD35_L2) is
designed to mask pixels that are unsuitable for land-surface
retrieval (clouds and heavy aerosol loadings) and at the same
time ﬁnd pixels suitable for cloud product retrieval (not
aerosol), it was viewed to be both overly cloud conserva-
tive and yet not clear-sky conservative enough for aerosol
retrieval (Remer et al., 2012). Therefore, based on unpub-
lished work analogous to Martins et al. (2002), the over-
land aerosol retrieval applies tests for visible-band (0.47 µm)
brightness and spatial variability at 500 m resolution, in con-
junction with tests for brightness and variability in 1.38 µm
(the “cirrus” channel) at 1 km. Values for C5 thresholds were
based on visual analyses of multiple granules and statistical
analyses of global data, and were documented in the online
C5-ATBD (Levy et al., 2009b).
However, both Witte et al. (2011) and van Donkelaar et
al. (2011) noted that operational MODIS aerosol retrieval
failed to capture the extreme Russian ﬁre events of 2010. Al-
though in some cases the retrieval failed because the ﬁnal
value of AOD (> 5.0) was extrapolated outside of the lookup
table, there were also many cases where failure occurred
because the aerosol cloud mask thresholds were exceeded.
Retrieval of the extremely heavy smoke (AOD ≫1.0) in
the middle of the plumes required either turning off the
cloud mask, or ﬁnding a suitable aerosol “call-back” test.
Since ﬁne-dominated smoke has weaker signal in 2.11 µm
than 0.47 µm, and the region around Moscow has relatively
small surface spatial variability at 2.11 µm, clouds and smoke
might be separated by the spectral dependence of their spatial
variability. Thus a 2.11 µm spatial variability test (σ2.11 was
implemented, such that areas that failed the 0.47 µm vari-
ability test could be recovered by passing the new 2.11 µm
test. Aerosol coverage for the Moscow ﬁres was increased
by 20 %.
While successful for the Moscow region, the 2.11 µm
aerosol recovery test did not work globally. Surface variabil-
ity at 2.11 µm is often so much larger than it is at 0.47 µm,
so that the combined surface/aerosol variability may be in-
distinguishable from clouds. While looking for alternatives,
we found that combining two 0.47 µm spatial variability tests
sometimes could help. There is the “absolute standard devia-
tion” of the reﬂectance within a 3×3 box (std_047 or σ0.47, as
well as the “mean weighted standard deviation” (mstd_047
or σ ∗
0.47),
σ ∗= σρ/√n
(1)
where ρ is the mean reﬂectance (mean_047) and n = 9 (3×3
pixel box). Since the possibility of being ﬂagged as “cloud”
increases with both the variability and the magnitude of the
reﬂectance, the σ ∗test might be mistaking brighter, less vari-
able smoke for darker, more variable clouds, which could
be called back with regular σ. Therefore, instead of using
a 2.11 µm test to recover heavy aerosol, C6 will use regular
standard deviation (σ0.47) as an aerosol call back test. This is
in addition to the mstd_047 test that is retained from C5.
Thus, the C6 over-land cloud mask is a combination
of tests using absolute magnitude and spatial variability at
0.47 µm (500 m resolution) and 1.38 µm (1 km resolution).
Based on analyses of many individual granules, plus statis-
tics of global, monthly data, the C6 cloud detection thresh-
olds are set as follows. A given 500 m pixel is ﬂagged as a
cloud if the 0.47 µm reﬂectance exceeds 0.4 (ρ0.47 > 0.4). For
each 3 × 3 box of 500 m pixels, the center pixel is ﬂagged
as cloud if both (σ ∗
0.47 > 0.0025 and σ0.47 > 0.0075). A given
1 km pixel is ﬂagged as cloud if ρ1.38 > 0.025. For each 3×3
box of 1 km pixels, the center pixel is ﬂagged if σ1.38 > 0.003.
Note there is no σ ∗
1.38 test. Finally, if any one 1 km pixel is
indicated as cloud then the entire 2 × 2 box of 500 m pix-
els are considered cloud. Note that except for addition of the
σ0.47 requirement, all other tests and thresholds are identical
to that used for C5. The ﬁnal result is a binary cloud mask
(yes or no) at 500 m resolution, which is saved in memory
and used to ﬁlter pixels for ﬁnal aerosol retrieval. Figure 8
is an example of a granule over northeastern South America,
where 533 new pixels (5 % increase from 10 108) have been
retrieved when including the σ0.47 requirement. Note that the
additional pixels retrieved for C6 are located in areas of low
optical depth (τ < 0.15) as well as areas of high optical depth
(τ > 0.75) within the smoke plume. The impact of the revised
cloud mask can be seen in Fig. 2e (land areas).
4.4.4
Quality assurance over land
The run-time Quality Assurance (QA) Plan (Hubanks, 2012)
over land is essentially unchanged from C5. There are mul-
tiple tests to assess the input data, the logical ﬂow of the al-
gorithm, and then the believability of the results. The results
of the many individual QA tests, lead to an estimate of the
overall quality conﬁdence (QAC) of the retrieved products.
All QA information is coded into a ﬁve-byte SDS, such that
different bits represent the results of individual tests, and are
described in more detail in the Appendix.
For example, one such QA test asks whether there are a
sufﬁcient number of non-screened pixels to make a robust
aerosol retrieval. If more than 50 pixels remain (out of a pos-
sible 120, which is in turn a 70 % exclusion of the original
400), then QAC = 3. More than 30, 20 and 12 (10 % of 120)
result in QAC = 2, 1 and 0, respectively. Fewer pixels suggest
increasingly marginal conditions in the retrieval box, and the
retrieved AOD is expected to be less accurate.
In addition to explicit cloud masking (determining which
pixels to exclude from the aerosol retrieval), the retrieval uses
other tests to determine if clouds might be present and pos-
sible source of aerosol contamination. One such test is the

thin-cirrus test. While pixels with ρ1.38 > 0.025 are consid-
ered to be “cloud” and masked, pixels with ρ1.38 > 0.01 are
used, but ﬂagged as “thin cirrus”. These pixels may have
residual contamination, but are included in the aerosol re-
trieval. If any “thin cirrus” pixels are present, the entire re-
trieval is tagged and the QAC reduced to 0.
Yet, while this “thin cirrus” test was included within the
C5 algorithm, the test was coded in error, such that if the
QAC = 0 tag could be overwritten. In some of these cases,
“thin cirrus” detection was mistakenly assigned QAC = 3
(high quality). This coding logic error led to biased AOD
statistics, especially over tropical land surfaces. Figure 9
shows a granule with clouds visible in the middle-right of the
true-color RGB image over Africa. Without the cirrus cod-
ing ﬁx, there were potentially cirrus-contaminated pixels that
would have been tagged with QAC = 3. With the ﬁx, high-
conﬁdence AOD data are not retrieved as close to this cloudy
area, resulting in a 10 % pixel reduction for this granule. The
overall impact of the cirrus ﬁx to the monthly AOD is shown
in Fig. 2d, where the bulk of the changes are in tropical land
regions where the AOD has decreased. When including both
the σ0.47 call-back test (Sect. 4.4.3) and this ρ1.38 thin-cirrus
correction, results in a near cancel of the positive and nega-
tive impacts. There is a modest increase (less than 0.1 %) in
the the number of global high-quality pixels.

Deleted and new over-land products
For the Level 2 product (MxD04_L2), the list of over-land
SDSs in C6 are compared to those from C5 (Table 1). The
most signiﬁcant change is that the ETA parameter (FMF:
Optical_Depth_Ratio_Small_Land) will be the only reported
aerosol size characteristic. On a global basis, we and oth-
ers have found little quantitative skill in MODIS-retrieved
aerosol size parameters over land (e.g., Levy et al., 2010;
Mielonen et al., 2011). We have decided to discontinue fur-
ther attempts at validating Ångström Exponent (AE) and
ﬁne-AOD. However, since the ETA parameter is part of the
retrieval solution, and a necessary diagnostic, it will continue
to be reported for C6. A user can still choose to derive AE
(from spectral AOD) or ﬁne-AOD (from product of τη) and
evaluate the results themselves.
For C6, there are new, deleted, and renamed prod-
ucts
(see

lengths (0.41, 0.44 and 0.76 µm). To reduce confusion re-
lated to an experimental product that was never prop-
erly validated, all SDSs related to calculation of criti-
cal reﬂectance and path radiance have been deleted. Fi-
nally, to reduce confusion between users of the MODIS
“Aerosol” cloud mask, and the “Wisconsin” cloud mask
(MxD35_L2), our internal cloud mask fraction has been
renamed to “Aerosol_Cloud_Fraction_Land”. Although the
“Corrected_” preﬁx of “Corrected_Optical_Depth_Land”
may be misleading to some users (there is only one retrieval
and nothing to correct), a sufﬁcient number of MODIS data
users requested the SDSs name be continued for C6, and thus
it remains unchanged.
4.4.6
Global AOD resulting from all changes over land
At this point, we have introduced the changes applied to
the DT-land aerosol retrieval algorithm, including changes
to Rayleigh assumptions, gas correction, aerosol retrieval
boundaries, cirrus ﬁx, cloud mask, and QAC revision. How
do all these changes affect the DT-land aerosol products on a
global scale?
As discussed in Sect. 3, we processed eight full months
of aerosol products from Aqua (January and July from 2003,
2008 and 2010, plus April and October from 2008). Table 2
reports global, Level 2 pixel statistics for the four months in
2008, illustrating the following changes:
– There are additional granules processed for C6 as com-
pared to C5, which also increases the potential aerosol
sampling (15 % increase for Total PixCount).
– The net result is approximately 2–3 % additional cov-
erage (Valid PixCount), depending on month.
– The QAC (overall Conﬁdence) is reduced. There is
near doubling of retrievals with QAC = 0, which better
illustrates the conﬁdence related to “coastal” retrievals
and retrievals near clouds. Cases of QAC = 3 (which is
the recommended QAC ﬁlter over land) are reduced on
the order of 10 %.
– For the ﬁltered, QAC = 3 data), global mean AOD de-
creased sharply in January (from 0.195 to 0.179) and
in April (from 0.203 to 0.183), increased during July
(from 0.130 to 0.149), and remained nearly constant in
October (0.165 to 0.164).
Plotted in Fig. 10 are histograms for the same four months
in 2008, showing ﬁltered AOD data for both C5 (red) and C6
(blue). In January and April, we see that, while the number
of near-zero AOD retrievals (e.g. less than 0.05) remain con-
stant, the number of moderate (less than 0.4) and high AOD
(greater than 0.4) retrievals are reduced. In July, the num-
ber of near-zero AOD retrievals is reduced while the higher
AOD number is constant. Finally, in October, only the num-
ber of moderate AOD cases is impacted (reduced). Because
of the negative value bins, a log-normal plot cannot be cre-
ated, however the selection of bins is suggestive of log scale
(adding a constant), and that regardless of season, the median
is near 0.05. The large number of negative AOD retrievals
will remain a problem for C6. On the other hand, with mean
global mean AOD being greater than 0.15 in all months, we
see that much of the globe is actually very clean (retrieved
AOD within ±0.05 of zero).
Returning to Figs. 1 and 2, one can see where the C6 al-
gorithm produces the largest absolute changes. In general,
changes in AOD are largely positive over the tropics, espe-
cially in the northern part of South America and southeast
Asia, while changes are largely negative over mid-latitude
continents. Some of these changes are large (0.1). While all
factors discussed above in Sects. 4.2 to 4.4, and illustrated
in the different panels of Fig. 2, contribute to the net effect
seen in Fig. 1, the global spatial pattern is very much linked
to the changes introduced into C6 from correcting the surface
reﬂectance ratio dependency on NDVISWIR (panel g) and to
changes in the cloud mask in East Asia and other places with
high AOD smoke (panel e). Only in the US Midwest, equa-
torial Africa and northern Australia, are there changes re-
sulting from the updated assumed aerosol model boundaries
(Sect. 4.1).
4.4.7
Comparison of AOD over land with AERONET
We see now how the global picture looks for C6, how well
does it compare with with AERONET? In Fig. 11, we com-
pare MODIS versus AERONET, for the entire eight months
of Aqua test data. Here, we use the revised protocol devel-
oped by Petrenko et al. (2012), where satellite and sun pho-
tometer are compared within a spatial radius of ±25 km and
a temporal interval of ±30 min. A valid collocation is one
where there are at least three MODIS pixels and two sun
photometer measurements within the spatial/temporal win-
dow. While there is a decrease in total ﬁltered pixel counts
between C5 and C6, there is a 6 % increase in the number
of valid MODIS/AERONET collocations. Although there
might be less MODIS sampling in the cloudy tropics (few
or no AERONET sites), there is increased MODIS coverage
where there are AERONET sites to match with (e.g. northern
Europe with low sun angles). Although the slope and offset
of the regression curve changes slightly between C5 and C6,
the high skill at retrieving AERONET-observed AOD is re-
tained. Overall, for C6, the correlation is R = 0.86, and that
69.4 % of MODIS AOD fall within expected uncertainty of
±(0.05 + 15 %). Like Levy et al. (2010), we plot MODIS-
AERONET (e.g. MODIS error) compared to equal frequency
bins of AERONET AOD. Overall, the pattern is unchanged
from C5 to C6, however, there is improvement for the lowest
AOD bins. Much of this improvement comes from reversing
the NDVISWIR dependence, and resulting retrieval of lower

Changes for DT-ocean
In several previous studies, good comparability was reported
between MODIS and SP data, such that AOD retrieved from
MODIS agreed to within ±(0.03 + 5 %) (e.g., Remer et al.,
2005, 2008). However, the same level of agreement was not

achieved at all sites under all conditions. Errors could be
traced to the presence of non-spherical dust (e.g., Levy et al.,
2003) or absorbing smoke (e.g., Ichoku et al., 2003), instead
of the spherical, weakly absorbing aerosol conditions that are
assumed in the retrieval. Errors can also result from wrong
assumptions of the oceanic surface contributions. Uncertain-
ties in water leaving radiance, glint, and white foam prop-
erties would introduce an error that is larger relative to low
AOD cases, but also may be non-negligible even when AOD
is high. Considering that optical depths are low over most
of the ocean, an error in the surface contribution can have
a signiﬁcant impact on the global AOD. Finally, unlike the
DT products over land, the comparability with AERONET
was not monotonic with QAC value. Bréon et al. (2011)
demonstrated that, statistically, the most accurate MODIS
over-ocean data set required QAC ≥1, not just QAC = 3.
Previously in Sects. 4.2 and 4.3 we described upstream
changes to the aerosol algorithms’ inputs and changes to the
algorithm’s gas correction module and LUTs. As described
above, these general modiﬁcations affect the ocean product,
as well as land. Here, in the following subsections, we de-
tail the particular changes made speciﬁcally to the DT-ocean
aerosol retrieval algorithm, including assumptions as to sur-
face dependence on wind speed, cloud masking logic, and
assignment of QAC.
4.5.1
LUT and wind speed dependence over ocean
Zhang and Reid (2010) noted there is uncertainty of the sur-
face boundary condition due to variability of the near-surface
wind ﬁeld. Near-surface wind patterns could signiﬁcantly in-
ﬂuence ocean wave and glint patterns, and wrong assump-
tions about these patterns would bias the subsequent aerosol
retrieval. Since the C5 DT-ocean retrieval assumed a con-
stant wind speed of 6 m s−1, there should be systematic bi-
ases all over the globe. Concurrently, Kleidman et al. (2012)
compared MODIS C5 DT-ocean data with SP data from
the Marine Aerosol Network (MAN) (Smirnov et al., 2009)
and found that there were residual MODIS errors related to
wind speed. Sensitivity studies suggested that the problem
would be enhanced closer to glint. Following other algorithm
teams (e.g., Sayer et al., 2012a; Herman et al., 2005; Kahn et
al., 2007), we now introduce wind speed dependence to the
MODIS DT-ocean aerosol retrieval. This takes on the form
as an additional step in interpolation of the MODIS LUT.
Like the C5 LUT (e.g., Remer et al., 2005), our C6 LUT
employs the MODRAD (Ahmad et al., 1982) radiative trans-
fer (RT) code to simulate TOA reﬂectance for a coupled
ocean/atmosphere. Embedded within MODRAD are wind
speed dependent models to account for the “roughness” of
the sea surface (waves and whitecaps, Cox and Munk, 1954)
and the foam fraction (Koepke, 1984). In addition to the stan-
dard 6 m s−1 wind speed having 0.16 % foam, the C6 LUT in-
cludes simulations for three additional wind speeds, 2 m s−1,
10 m s−1 and 14 m s−1, having foam fraction of 0.01 %, 1 %
and 3 %, respectively (e.g. Monahan and Muircheartaigh,
1980). Note that for the atmospheric contribution, we have
installed the slight changes to the MODIS band central wave-
lengths and assumed Rayleigh optical depths (Sect. 4.2).
We do not go into the details of the over-ocean aerosol in-
version process, as they are described previously (e.g., Remer
et al., 2005, 2008). As before, there are nine aerosol mod-
els (modes: four ﬁne, ﬁve coarse), and that a solution is the
weighted combination ﬁne and coarse modes that best ap-
proximates the observed spectral reﬂectance. The main dif-
ference is the addition of the extra interpolation step; that
is, the interpolation of the LUT with respect to actual wind
speed. Here, the wind speed comes from the 2 m-altitude
wind speed, reported within the NCEP 1◦× 1◦analysis that
is already used as inputs to the MODIS processing stream.
Wind speeds less than 2 m s−1 are assumed to be 2 m s−1,
and greater than 14 m s−1 are assumed to be 14 m s−1; oth-
erwise the LUT is linearly interpolated between the nearest
two indices.
Figure 12 shows an Aqua granule (18 January 2010,
14:40 UTC), where the multiple wind speed LUT was ap-
plied. The left panel is the retrieved AOD using a constant
wind speed of 6 m s−1 overlaid upon a true-color (RGB) im-
age, showing a strong glint pattern. Panel b shows the the
NCEP 2 m wind speed, and panel c shows the difference
between the AODs retrieved from the multiple wind speed
LUT and the 6 m s−1 LUT. Note that these wind speeds are
from the nearest six-hour interval for GDAS analysis, in this
case from 12:00 UTC. Clearly, the C6 algorithm will retrieve
lower (higher) values of AOD when wind speed is higher
(lower) than 6 m s−1. Also, the same wind speed difference
leads to large AOD difference when closer to the glint (40◦
from the specular direction).
Figure 2h shows the net effect of replacing the static wind
speed algorithm with a multiple wind speed LUT. The new
algorithm tends to reduce global AOD over the ocean, espe-
cially near glint, and in the “Roaring Forties” of the southern
oceans. Near to the specular direction, increasing wind speed
diffuses the glitter pattern (e.g. Cox and Munk, 1954). The
40◦glint mask was chosen so that under most conditions,
the sea surface remains nearly glitter free outside this enve-
lope. However, where wind speed is dramatically higher than
6 m s−1, the glitter pattern can spill outside of the glint mask,
causing a positive bias to retrieved AOD. On the other hand,
far from glint (e.g., in the Roaring Forties), the wind speed
is known to be consistently higher than 6 m s−1, so that the
main additional contribution from the ocean surface is wind-
induced foam.

Cloud masking, sediment masking, and pixel
selection over ocean
As in the over land algorithm, the success of the DT-ocean
algorithm is dependent on the ability to discard unsuitable
pixels. At a minimum, the over-ocean DT algorithm throws

out 50 % of the data (darkest and brightest 25 % when sorted
by 0.86 µm reﬂectance). However, there are many other un-
suitable pixels, including those that are cloudy, having visible
sediments, or too near the specular angle.
The main problem is to separate “clear” aerosol pixels
from “clouds”. We want maximal aerosol coverage with a
minimum of cloud contamination. There is no perfect cloud
mask. Unless an algorithm is willing to restrict itself to only
very speciﬁc meteorological conditions, there will always be
clouds in the scene (e.g., Koren et al., 2008). In general, the
methodology of the algorithms for deselecting over-ocean
pixels (including cloud masking) has been retained from
C5 (ATBD, Levy et al., 2009b). However, we have made
changes, so we brieﬂy describe here.
Internal cloud masking depends on spatial variability
(within a 3×3 box) and absolute reﬂectance of visible (VIS)
and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) channels (Martins et al.,
2002). The VIS tests make use of 500 m resolution data.
For each 500 pixel, we determine the reﬂectance in 0.47 µm
(ρ0.47), 3 × 3 standard deviation of reﬂectance at 0.55 µm
(σ0.55) and the ratio of 0.47 µm to 0.65 µm (ρ0.47/ρ0.65).
The logic is that a pixel is labeled “cloudy” if it is either
bright (ρ0.47 > 0.4), or highly variable (σ0.55 > 0.0025) but
not brown dust (ρ0.47/ρ0.65 < 0.75). The SWIR tests look for
high cirrus clouds using 1 km data (Gao et al., 2002), includ-
ing absolute reﬂectance at 1.38 µm (ρ1.38) and the ratio of
that to the reﬂectance in 1.24 µm (ρ1.38/ρ1.24). These tests
are performed concurrently with the visible tests. However,
since 1.38 µm is at 1 km resolution, results of the tests ap-
ply to all four 500 m pixels within. At the same time, due
to high amounts of water vapor over the tropical ocean, the
internal SWIR cirrus detection algorithm is not always suf-
ﬁcient to mask out high, thin cirrus. Therefore, three ther-
mal infrared (IR) test results are selected from the upstream
MODIS cloud mask ﬁle (MxD35_L2, Ackerman et al., 1998,
2010). Each IR test result is encoded into the MxD35 product
as one “Bit”, having the value of 0 (“not applied”) or 1 (“ap-
plied”) (Hubanks et al., 2012).
The three IR tests are the “Thin Cirrus (IR) Test” (Bit 11),
the “High Cloud (6.7 µm) Test” (Bit 15), and the “IR Tem-
perature Difference Test” (Bit 18). If any of these three tests
register as “applied”, then the 2×2 box of 500 m pixels (1 km
MxD35 pixel) is denoted as “cloudy”, and none of these pix-
els are retained for aerosol retrieval. However, during C6 de-
velopment, the MODIS cloud mask team also made changes
to the MxD35 algorithm (http://modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov/
products_C006update.html). Speciﬁcally, the Bit 18 test was
relaxed in order to reduce the number of falsely identiﬁed
tropical cirrus cases. The goal was to prevent ambiguous cir-
rus clouds from being targeted for cloud retrieval, but it also
resulted in additional cirrus contamination for the aerosol
retrieval.
To undo the extra cirrus contamination, we strengthened
the internal SWIR cirrus-masking test. As before, it is ap-
plied in a three-step process, but the logic is changed. Now,
if (ρ1.38 > 0.03) then the 1 km pixel (and the four 500 m pix-
els) is considered “cloudy”. If (0.005 < ρ1.38 ≤0.03) then
apply the ratio, which means that if (ρ1.38/ρ1.24 > 0.30),
then the pixel is cloudy. If the pixel survives as “not
cloudy”, then the algorithm checks if there still might be
residual cirrus, which means if (0.005 < ρ1.38 ≤0.03 AND
0.10 < ρ1.38/ρ1.24 ≤0.30 AND ρ0.65 > 1.5ρRayleigh
0.65
) then the
presence of cirrus is ambiguous and the pixel will be in-
cluded, but the entire MODIS retrieval box will have de-
graded QAC value. Note that the extra “AND” statement
makes sure that there is enough visible signal (in the 0.65 µm
channel compared to Rayleigh-only reﬂectance) to care
about residual cirrus contamination.
The overall effect of a weakened MxD35 test and strength-
ened internal NIR test tends is to slightly reduce aerosol cov-
erage (compared to C5) in the mid-latitude oceans. This is
demonstrated with the granule plotted in Fig. 13, observed
over the Paciﬁc, by Aqua on 1 January 2010. The effect on
Atmos. Meas. Tech., 6, 2989–3034, 2013

R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean

the magnitude of the AOD is to slightly reduce AOD over the
western tropical Paciﬁc, and slightly increase AOD in heavy
aerosol plumes such as dust off of the Sahara, off the coast of
Siberia and the volcanic plume from Hawaii, as seen in the
changes to the cloud mask in Fig. 2e.
To this point, a 500 m pixel will be deselected from aerosol
retrieval if any of the following tests are failed: (1) within
glint mask of 40◦, (2) any of the three MxD35 IR tests,
(3) any internal SWIR test, (4) any internal VIS test. Also,
an ocean pixel may fail the ocean sediment test. The ocean
sediment test is designed to identify ocean scenes that are
contaminated by river or other coastal sediments (Li et al.,
2002), by comparing observed VIS (0.55 µm) reﬂectance
with that expected from interpolating between measurements
at 0.47 µm and SWIR channels. While the sediment mask
threshold is unchanged from C5, the C6 protocol of using
ﬁll values for missing detector reﬂectance data in the L1B
(Sect. 4.2), means that fewer channels are used to compute
the expected 0.55 µm reﬂectance.
Finally after de-selection of individual 500 m pixels, and
1 km groups of 500 m pixels, the ocean algorithm makes ﬁnal
pixel selection. Here, as documented previously (e.g., Remer
et al., 2005, 2012) the data within a 10 km box are sorted
by 0.86 µm reﬂectance. The brightest 25 % and darkest 25 %
are removed, leaving at most 200 pixels (out of original 400)
to be averaged for ﬁnal retrieval. Nothing has speciﬁcally
changed in this process, except the reﬂectance values them-
selves may have changed, which will cause a different sorting
and selection result.
4.5.3
Quality assurance over ocean
During the retrieval process, there are a number of tests that
infer the “satisfaction” of the retrieval. This is known as the
Quality Assurance (QA) plan, and its ultimate product is the
assignment of the QA Conﬁdence (QAC), having values be-
tween “0” (no conﬁdence) and “3” (high conﬁdence). The
detailed tests of the DT-ocean QA plan are reported in the
Appendix. For the most part, the general methodology of QA
assignment is the same as for C5. However, there are some
changes that are described in this section.
Bréon et al. (2011) and Sayer et al. (2012b) noted that for
C5 over ocean, MODIS comparability with AERONET was
not monotonic with QAC value. It was shown that cases with
QAC = 3 were no better than cases where QAC = 1, and in
some statistics (fraction within EE), the higher QAC cases
compared worse. Looking closer at the data, we determined
that the cases with low conﬁdence tended to have lower re-
trieved AOD. In other words, lower QAC was assigned even
when it was obvious that the scene was clear (no aerosol).
We also noted that there were many cases where QAC = 0
(no conﬁdence) and the AOD was reported as exactly zero.
In retrieval operation, there are two places where the ob-
served reﬂectance in the 0.86 µm channel (ρ0.86) is compared
to that modeled for a Rayleigh-only atmosphere (ρRayleigh
0.86
).

color (RGB) showing scene taken from modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.gov.
(b and c) Retrieved high quality (QAC ≥1 over ocean) AOD at
0.55 µm, without/with the revised 1.38 µm cloud mask test. (d) Cir-
rus contaminated pixels that have been removed over ocean.
For the C5 algorithm, the logic was if ρ0.86 < 1.1ρRayleigh
0.86
,
then there was not enough aerosol signal (AOD ∼0.002 in
0.86 µm) to do a meaningful retrieval (both AOD and size).
Thus, the AOD (in 0.55 µm) was set to exactly 0.0 and the
QAC was also set to zero. While it is true that there is
no aerosol size information, these extremely clean ocean
retrievals were discarded when daily and monthly statis-
tics were computed, thus biasing results. Another test was
that if ρ0.86 > 1.5ρRayleigh
0.86
, then the retrieval would be at-
tempted, but the QAC value assigned to 1. This is equiva-
lent to AOD ∼0.01 in 0.86 µm, which (if we assumed molec-
ular and aerosol have similar spectral dependence) would
mean AOD ∼0.05 in 0.55 µm. These cases would be in-
cluded in global statistics, but would be weighted less heavily
(for QA weighting statistics) than higher AOD cases. In ei-
ther situation, the result forced the under-sampling of clean
cases (τ < 0.05) and produced a high bias to global AOD.
There should be more conﬁdence given to obviously “clean”
aerosol cases.
For C6, QA logic has been redesigned, so that the ex-
tremely clean cases do not automatically receive lower QAC
weighting. Cases where there is no retrieval (and AOD as-
signed to 0.0) are given QAC = 1, where cases where there
could be AOD retrieval (but not robust retrieval of size

parameter) are given QAC = 3. Size parameters are not re-
ported for either of these cases.
4.5.4
New and changed ocean products
Table 3 lists the over-ocean aerosol SDSs within the Level 2
(MxD04) product. There are no deleted SDSs over ocean,
however there is one new SDS, three SDSs with larger di-
mensions, one with smaller dimensions and two renamed
SDSs. The new SDS, “Wind_Speed_NCEP_Ocean”, rep-
resents the wind speed used in the retrieval (as reported
by the NCEP 1◦re-analysis). The SDSs representing re-
ﬂectance and the number of pixels used have been in-
creased to ten wavelengths (adding values for 0.41, 0.44
and 0.76 µm). The Ångström exponent SDS is reduced to
2-D from 3-D, where only the “average” value is retained.
The cloud fraction variable now has the preﬁx “Aerosol_”,
to reduce confusion between cloud fraction for the cloud
retrievals and cloud masking for aerosol. Finally, what
used to be “Cloud_Condensation_Nuclei” in C5, is now
“PSML003_Ocean” (Particles of the Small Mode Larger
than 0.03 µm), which better denotes the physical meaning of
the parameter.
4.5.5
Global AOD resulting from all changes over land
In the preceding, we have introduced the changes applied to
the DT-ocean aerosol retrieval algorithm and Level 2 product
listing. Updates include changes to Rayleigh assumptions,
gas correction, wind speed interpolation, cloud mask, and
QAC revision. What is the net effect to the DT-ocean aerosol
products on a global scale? As described in Sect. 4.4.6, eight
full months of aerosol products from Aqua (January and July,
from 2003, 2008, and 2010; and April and October 2008)
were processed with a near-ﬁnal version of the retrieval algo-
rithms. Analogous to our DT-land description in Sect. 4.4.6,
we evaluate C5 →C6 algorithm changes on these test data.
Table 4 reports global, Level 2 pixel AOD statistics for
the four months in 2008 over ocean, demonstrating major
changes:
– The net result is approximately 3–8 % additional cov-
erage (Valid PixCount), depending on month.
– The QAC (overall Conﬁdence) is increased. The num-
ber of QAC = 0 and QAC = 1 retrievals is decreased, so
that the number of QAC = 3 is more than doubled.
– For the ﬁltered, QAC ≥1 data), global mean AOD de-
creased in all months (by 0.016–0.019).
Plotted in Fig. 14 are global histograms of the four months
of retrieved AOD data in 2008 for both C5 (red) and C6
(blue), ﬁltered for QAC ≥1. We see that, overall, the number
of retrievals has increased (7 %) and that there is a signiﬁ-
cant increase in low AOD cases with a slight decrease in the
number of high AOD cases.
Fig. 14. Histograms for global retrieved Level 2 DT-ocean AOD (at
0.55 µm) from Aqua for four months. Plotted are data from C5 and
C6.
Focusing now on changes to size parameter over ocean,
namely the Ångström exponent (AE), Fig. 15 plots 1◦× 1◦
AE, calculated from 0.55 and 0.86 µm for each of the four
months of 2008, both collections and the difference between
collections. Each monthly mean value is the average of all
ﬁltered (QAC ≥1) L2 values, within the latitude/longitude
grid box, collected during the month., Although this is not
necessarily a preferred way of deriving a mean AE value,
the plots clearly show how mean AE is expected to increase
for C6, especially where AOD is expected to decrease when
accounting for wind speed. This indicates that C6 may derive
generally smaller-sized aerosol over the global ocean.
Returning to Figs. 1 and 2, and AOD, one can see where
the C6 algorithm produces the largest absolute changes over
ocean. In general, changes in AOD are largely negative over
the global oceans. As indicated in Table 4, the average de-
crease for the four months is about 0.018, although there
are regions of larger decrease and regions of little decrease
(or slight increase). For the most part, the large decreases
(∼0.04 or more) are in the mid-latitudes of both summer
hemispheres (e.g., the Roaring Forties), where there are sys-
tematically higher wind speeds. These decreases in AOD are
driven by the addition of variable wind speed in the retrieval
(Fig. 2h). The only places where AOD is expected to be
higher in C6 than in C5 over ocean are in speciﬁc tropical

MODIS versus AERONET, we also display comparisons for
MODIS versus the ship-based sun photometers of the Mar-
itime Aerosol Network (MAN; http://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/
new_web/maritime_aerosol_network.html, Smirnov et al.,
2009). For each panel, the square symbols (grey and colored)
represent frequency of MODIS/AERONET collocations at
each ordered pair (0.01 intervals), whereas the black circles
are collocations for MODIS versus MAN. Comparison statis-
tics in all panels are for MODIS versus AERONET only.
While there was a 6 % increase in total ﬁltered (QAC ≥1)
pixel counts between C5 and C6, there is a 30 % increase in
the number of valid MODIS/AERONET AOD collocations
(from 830 to 1141) and a similar increase for MODIS/MAN
(33 to 41). There is an improvement in regression slope
(from 0.88 to 0.97) and trivial improvement in correlation
(from 0.928 to 0.937). Visually, there is slightly less scat-
ter for MAN. The bottom panels of Fig. 16 show that the
improvement occurs throughout the range of AOD, with high
biases at low AOD decreasing and low.
Even after improvements, Fig. 16d clearly shows that there
remains a MODIS high bias at low AOD. Also, the scatter for
high AOD is signiﬁcantly larger than the EE of ±(0.03 + 5 %)
as determined by previous validation studies (e.g. Remer et
al., 2008). Therefore, we take this opportunity to reﬁne the
EE envelope for MODIS over ocean to better represent the
asymmetry of Fig. 16d. Here, we claim expected EE for C6
as (+(0.04 + 10 %), −(0.02 + 10 %)), where we also note the
asymmetry. These new EE lines are drawn in all panels of
Fig. 16.
Because deﬁnitions of ﬁne-mode fraction (FMF) can be
ambiguous (Kleidman et al., 2005), we focus on comparisons
of Ångström exponent (AE) as recommended by Anderson
et al. (2005). Due to the expected accuracy of the sun pho-
tometer data, they are interpolated to MODIS wavelengths,
rather than vice-versa. Figure 17 shows 22 % more collocated
points in C6 than in C5. Here, the EE is drawn as ±0.40,
which captures nearly 63 % of collocations for all values of
AE. Resetting at ±0.41 captures 68 %. While there is no sig-
niﬁcant overall improvement for AE comparability in C6,
there are fewer cases where MODIS is retrieving the limiting
values for AE. This suggests that improved pixel screening or

other corrections (Rayleigh, gas) may be providing the DT-

reasoning may be responsible for the decrease in the scat-

trieval to make better use of the information.
4.6
Combined DT-land and DT-ocean products
In Sects. 4.4 and 4.5, we described changes to the algorithm
and products related to the separate DT-land and DT-ocean
retrievals. At the completion of either algorithm, some pa-
rameters are merged into a joint dark-target aerosol product.
Some of the parameters are ﬁltered by QAC, meaning that
the joint named SDS will only report values with sufﬁciently
high conﬁdence. This enables a “best-of” product that we
consider to be useful for most quantitative purposes. These
joint products, along with changes from C5 to C6, are listed
in Table 5.
We expect that the primary product for most users is
the SDS named “Optical_Depth_Land_And_Ocean”. This
SDS contains only AOD values for the ﬁltered, quantita-
tively useful retrievals over dark targets. Speciﬁcally, this

2003, 2008 and 2010), computed with C5 algorithm (a) and C6 al-
gorithm (b). One-one lines and EE envelopes (±0.45) are plotted as
solid and dashed lines. Collocation statistics are presented in each
panel.
SDS includes any DT-ocean retrieval having QAC ≥1, and
any DT-land retrieval having QAC = 3. On the other hand,
the C6 product continues to offer the SDS named “Im-
age_Optical_Depth_Land_And_Ocean” which contains all
AOD values, regardless of QAC value. This SDS is intended
for more qualitative purposes, such as imagery and data con-
tinuity. Because Levy et al. (2010) demonstrated there is
not even signiﬁcant “qualitative” value for the ratio product
(FMF) over land, the joint ratio SDS has been deleted for C6.
At the same time, we have added two new “diagnostic”
SDSs to the product list. These are the “Land_Sea_Flag”, re-
ported directly from the MxD35_L2 ﬁle used for land/ocean
decision making, and the “Land_Ocean_Quality_Flag”,
which is simply reporting the QAC value contained within
the top bytes of the separate “Quality_Assurance_Land” and
“Quality_Assurance_Ocean” SDSs. Both of these ﬂags are
short integers, and are intended to make it easier for users
(and our own algorithm development team) to interpret re-
trieval results. However, if the user wants to delve into
more depth as to why a particular quality was assigned to
the retrieval, the separate (bit-packed) QA products are still
available.
4.7
New cloud-diagnostic products
For C6, there will be a new array of cloud diagnostics
reported in the MxD04 ﬁle, including two products of-
fered at 500 m resolution (Table 6). During the cloud mask-
ing operations (separate for land and ocean), the algo-
rithm keeps track of whether a given 500 m pixel is con-
sidered to be “cloudy” or “clear”. This information is car-
ried along in an array of bits (0 = cloudy, 1 = clear) and
reported as “Aerosol_Cldmsk_Land_Ocean”. As this cloud
mask is created, the algorithm also determines the dis-
tance from every pixel to the nearest “cloud” pixel. This is
“Cloud_Distance_Land_Ocean”. The intention is that users

4.8
Deep blue/dark target merged products
The dark target algorithm over land (e.g., Levy et al., 2007a
and b) is not designed to retrieve aerosol over bright sur-
faces, including desert. This leaves signiﬁcant holes in global
aerosol sampling. However, in recent years, Hsu et al. (2004,
2006) have developed an algorithm that retrieves aerosol
properties over brighter surfaces. This algorithm, known as
Deep Blue (DB), makes use of the observation that even vi-
sually bright desert scenes are relatively “dark” and relatively
stable in the deep-blue wavelengths (e.g., 0.41 and 0.47 µm).
The DB algorithms have also been revised for C6, and no-
tably will now also provide coverage over vegetated land sur-
faces, although not over oceans (Sayer et al., 2013; Hsu et al.,
2012).
Here, we do not discuss the DB-land algorithm and prod-
uct validation. We note, however, that the DB algorithm was
applied to MODIS data and included as part of Collection
5.1 (C51), Rather than create an entirely new MODIS prod-
uct, DB products were provided as appended SDSs onto the
existing (C5) MxD04_L2 product. For C6, DB products will
continue to be reported within MxD04_L2.
Unlike the clear separation between land and ocean within
the DT framework, there are land areas that may be retrieved
by both DB and DT algorithms. Essentially, all vegetated
terrain falls into this category, as DT excludes bright desert
surfaces (e.g., the Sahara desert) and both the DT and DB
algorithms exclude snow-covered surfaces. Both algorithms
report AOD at 0.55 µm, and both may report with high QA
conﬁdence. How should a user decide which one to use and
under what conditions?
As only DB data are available for bright arid regions, there
is no choice to be made in this case. Conversely, in the ar-
eas with densest vegetation, the DT algorithm is more ma-
ture and better characterized than the comparatively new ex-
panded DB algorithm, and performs well; thus, a sensible
choice is to use DT in these areas. This leaves a number of
transition regions which have comparatively low vegetation
cover but are sufﬁciently dark for the DT algorithm to be
applied; perhaps most notable are the African Sahel, which
is a transition region between desert and tropical forest, and
the arid southwest of the United States. Although there have
been multiple validation efforts, there are insufﬁcient num-
ber of AERONET sites in these transition zones to conclude
clear superiority of one retrieval or another. It is known that
the DT algorithm tends to be biased high in brighter regions
(e.g., Levy et al., 2010), but is expected to have lower bias for
C6 (Sect. 4.4.7). It has also had been shown that DB (C51)
was biased low in some of the same regions. The algorithms
are built for different assumptions, and it is not obvious how
to create an algorithm that leverages only the strengths of
both.
For C6, the solution is to simply merge the products from
the two algorithms in these transition regions, thus creating
a “best-of” AOD product that combines DB, DT-land
and DT-ocean. This will be reported by the SDS named
“Dark_Target_Deep_Blue_Optical_Depth_550_Combined”.

(0.2 ≤NDVI ≤0.3), the routine considers the conﬁdence as
indicated by QAC values (Q_DT and Q_DB), where high
conﬁdence means Q_DT = 3 or Q_DB ≥2. If both are high
conﬁdence, the AOD is the average of the two, in other
words,
τ = (τ_DT + τ_DB)/2.
(2)
If only one has high conﬁdence, then the AOD is assigned
to that one. However, if neither has high conﬁdence, then the
combined AOD remains undeﬁned. Table 7 reports the new
SDSs referring to the DT/DB merging. Figure 19 shows this
combined product (DBDT) for the four months of 2008, and
compares it with the original DT product. DBDT increases
coverage over both dark and bright surfaces (except snow and
clouds), and in certain geographical regions, such as Aus-
tralia and southwestern Asia, DBDT not only increases cov-
erage but also modiﬁes the AOD.
Although these new “Combined” products are offered for
C6, we note that they are not yet validated. At the initial
stage, the primary intended purpose of this merged SDS is
visualization or for applications where coverage is more im-
portant than quantitative accuracy. In an ideal case, users
could perform analyses using both DT and DB data where
available. It is expected that there may be future adjustments
in the NDVI thresholds and/or the exact protocol in which
the merging occurs between publication of this document
and actual implementation of the algorithm into operational
processing. Users should acquire updated documentation for
details.

Protocol for L3
Until this point, our discussion has focused on describing
changes to L2 (“swath”) algorithm and products. Since many
applications rely on gridded aerosol data (e.g., L3), here
we describe updates for the L3 product. As reported on the
MODIS-Atmosphere website (http://modis-atmos.gsfc.nasa.
gov), there are daily (MxD08_D3), eight-day (MxD08_E3)
and monthly (MxD08_M3) data products. The D3 ﬁles con-
tain roughly 600 statistical data sets that are derived from
approximately 80 scientiﬁc parameters from four different
L2 product ﬁles, including the MxD04_L2 aerosol product.
Statistics are sorted into 1◦× 1◦cells on an equal-angle grid
that spans a 24 h (00:00 to 23:59 UTC) interval. There is a
range of different statistical summaries that are computed,
depending on the parameter being considered. For example,
from any derived L2 aerosol parameter, the daily (D3) prod-
uct may include:
– Simple (mean, minimum, maximum, standard devia-
tion, pixel counts) statistics.
– Histograms of the quantity within each grid box.
– Histograms
of
the
conﬁdence
placed
in
each
measurement.
– Conﬁdence weighted statistics (QA mean, QA stan-
dard deviation).
– Joint histograms of one variable compared to another.

are: DT only (left), merged DT/DB (center), and differences between DBDT and DT, for grids where DT retrieves (right).
As explained by Levy et al. (2009a), “how” one derives the
gridded, global product is very important. Analogous to the
selection process when going from L1B to L2 (cloud mask-
ing, pixel selection, whether N pixels are sufﬁcient for re-
trieval, etc.), there is a selection process when going from L2
to L3 and then from D3 to M3. Here the questions involve re-
trieved pixel selection, QAC ﬁltering, and again, whether N
retrievals are sufﬁcient. We have considered many assump-
tions and the changes from C5 to C6 are reported here.
For the D3 product, there is no signiﬁcant change in how
most aerosol parameters are computed. For many of the in-
dividual, separately retrieved (DT-land, DT-ocean, DB-land)
aerosol SDSs, other than the addition of a median statis-
tic, the set of statistics will be the same as in C5. How-
ever, the preﬁx “Aerosol_” has been prepended to all D3
aerosol statistics to reduce confusion with such D3 prod-
ucts as cloud optical depth. Yet, many SDSs have been re-
moved from the product list. These include the deleted L2
size parameters over DT-land (Sect. 4.4.5) as well as any
other parameter describing intensive aerosol properties (e.g.
Ångström Exponent or aerosol size) that cannot be easily
“averaged”. To illustrate the problem, consider two aerosol
observations, one of AOD = 0.5 with AE = 0.5, the other of
AOD = 1.5 with AE = 1.5. Yes, the average AOD (loading)
may be 1.0, but the average AE is clearly not 1.0. These
intensive variables, such as AE and FMF, must be weighted
by the total AOD, but is becomes too complicated within
the standard L3 processing framework. Therefore, all SDSs
with “Ratio” or “Angstrom_Exponent” in the title have been
discontinued. On the other hand, since the statistics of spec-
tral AOD and ﬁne-model AOD (both are “extensive” aerosol
properties) are retained, a user can compute their own AE or
FMF statistics. In addition, while the new D3 product will
not include statistics of AE, it will include joint histograms
of AE compared to AOD.
At the same time as simple statistics, the D3 product
will continue to report so-called quality weighted statistics,
where each L2 retrieval is weighted by their QAC value.
We have improved the QA logic for both DT-land and
DT-ocean, so that the QAC value better represents the
expected quality of the retrieval. For the combined AOD
products
(e.g.,
“Optical_Depth_Land_And_Ocean”,
and
“Dark_Target_Deep_Blue_Optical_Depth_550_Combined”)
it is assumed that QAC ﬁltering has been done within the L2
algorithm, so no additional Conﬁdence weighted statistics
are produced.
As explained by Levy et al. (2009a), instead of going back
to L2 data, the M3 (and E3) products are computed from D3
products. There are two paths from L2 to D3 to M3 products,
one that includes conﬁdence weighting (“_QA_Mean” in D3

and “QA_Mean_Mean” in M3) and the other, which does not
(_“Mean” in D3 and “_Mean_Mean”in M3). For C5, both of
the M3 products were also “pixel weighted” where contribu-
tion from each day is weighted by the number of pixels for
the day.
Pixel weighting has the effect of biasing the global statis-
tics toward the sampling of the sensor. This means that pixel
weighting may be appropriate for describing statistics of
cloud properties (e.g., King et al., 2013). Clouds are re-
trieved whether or not aerosol is present, so that days with
more retrieved cloud pixels should have greater weight than
days with fewer cloud pixels. Aerosol properties, however,
are only retrieved by MODIS under clear (not cloudy) skies.
Statistics of aerosol are inherently clear-sky biased, so that
pixel weighting makes it even more so.
Therefore, for C6, the monthly (M3) and eight-day (E3)
aerosol SDSs computations have dropped the pixel weight-
ing step. Now, as long as a given day has sufﬁcient number
of clear pixels (N ≥6) in the grid box, its value is counted
equally as any other day. This reduces the clear-sky bias in
the multi-day aerosol products. As seen from Fig. 20, the
change to equal day weighting will tend to increase gridded,
mean AOD, especially in regions of the globe already domi-
nated by higher AOD.
As of this writing, although we have a fairly ﬁrm under-
standing of expected changes in L3 products, at least as re-
lated to aerosol, the full suite of L3 changes is still in de-
velopment. A detailed list of all L3-atmosphere SDSs (D3,
E3 and M3) will be available soon (http://modis-atmos.gsfc.
nasa.gov).
5.1
Calibration issues and expected impact on
Terra products
Because the upstream calibration changes for MA were
small, we have focused our discussion to impacts on MODIS
on Aqua. In fact all ﬁgures, (Figs. 1–20) illustrated changes
to Aqua’s products. However, as introduced in Sect. 2.4, there
were curious differences between time series of MA and MT,
and we suspected calibration issues.
When the MODIS algorithm was upgraded from C4 to
C5, all testing was performed based on C4 inputs. Remer
et al. (2008) showed that for C4, global monthly mean AOD
from MODIS on Terra (MT) and Aqua (MA) agreed along
the one-to-one line. However, in C5, MT suddenly “jumped”
so that MT > MA for all months. Simple analyses (e.g.
using the Giovanni visualization tool; http://giovanni.gsfc.
nasa.gov/giovanni/) of C5, show that over land, MT > MA
prior to 2004 and MT < MA after. These tendencies are
also noted by Levy et al. (2010) for MODIS/AERONET
“comparability”, where MT ≫AERONET prior to 2004 and
MT > < AERONET afterwards.
Because the band is used for atmospheric correction, Wang
et al. (2012) explained how systematic changes in Terra’s
blue-band (0.47 µm) calibration could be responsible for the
observed NDVI product divergence. Furthermore, our own
sensitivity tests demonstrated that a 1–2 % drift in only the
blue channel (less than the stated accuracy maintained by
MCST) was sufﬁcient to produce a trend in one sensor, or a
multi-sensor divergence in the MODIS aerosol products. At
the same time, a slight offset in observed red (0.65 µm) and
near-IR (0.86 µm) reﬂectance might be consistent with global
offsets over ocean. The ocean color team had previously

R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean
identiﬁed drifting calibration to be a source of error in their
data (e.g. Franz et al., 2007; Meister et al., 2012), which
could be corrected by vicarious calibration (comparing re-
ported radiances to some ground truth). However, until re-
cently, the problem was thought to be conﬁned to the short-
est blue wavelengths (0.41 and 0.44 µm), and was not be-
lieved to be a signiﬁcant problem in the land/aerosol blue
channel (0.47 µm) and longer wavelengths. Deep Blue, with
its reliance on 0.41 µm was using ocean color team correc-
tions (Jeong et al., 2011). Calibration differences were also
suspected to be causing divergences in derived cloud optical
properties (e.g. King et al., 2013) between Terra and Aqua.
The trends seen in our dark-target aerosol product, as well
as the NDVI and cloud products, clearly indicated that there
were also issues in longer wavelengths and they could not
be ignored. At that point, the collective MODIS algorithm
teams (aerosols, clouds, land surface, ocean, etc.) initiated a
bilateral relationship with the MCST. If calibration was going
to be updated for C6, then there should be ample opportunity
to test and understand why and how changes would be made
and how this change would impact the downstream science
products including aerosol.
The details of “how” MCST identiﬁed and later corrected
for the calibration drift, are explained in Sun et al. (2012) and
references therein. We provide a simple explanation here. In
addition to the radiometric calibration of each channel for
each sensor, MCST quantiﬁes the “response versus scan an-
gle” (RVS). The RVS characterizes the imperfections and ge-
ometrical issues that lead to a non-Lambertian response by
the MODIS instrument, meaning that each observation must
be corrected for the RVS corresponding to that particular
viewing angle. Prior to launch, RVS for each channel, and for
each MODIS sensor, was characterized in laboratory. Once in
orbit, the calibration would be continually updated by mak-
ing repeated observations of MODIS’ onboard reﬂectance
calibrator (known as the solar diffuser) as well as the moon’s
disc. It was assumed that the pre-launch RVS would remain
throughout the mission. However, it is now understood that
the angular characteristics of the solar diffuser (the reference
for calibration) are also changing during MODIS lifetime,
which would result in a time-dependent RVS. If unaccounted
for, there would be a residual RVS error, which would lead
to biases in L1B reﬂectance, leading to biases in aerosol or
other products. This residual RVS error was identiﬁed by tak-
ing long-term measurements of “pseudo-invariant” ground
sites such as remote deserts (Chander et al., 2010), and com-
paring instrument response at later dates with earlier mea-
surements. It was in this way that MCST could conﬁrm that
there was a drift in the blue (0.47 µm) channel that was con-

ual drifts were identiﬁed they could be corrected for. As a
result of these studies, the MCST introduced a new method
(Sun et al., 2012) that was later adopted for deriving time and
angular dependent calibration coefﬁcients. This method has

(which are now archived at http://ladsweb.gsfc.nasa.gov).
Like Fig. 3 (for Aqua), Fig. 21 summarizes the changes
to the Terra’s L1B TOA aerosol reﬂectance (MOD021KM),
also for July 2008. While all reﬂectance changes for MA
were on the order of ±0.3 % or less, the corresponding
changes for MT are signiﬁcantly larger. Speciﬁcally, in
0.47 µm Band #3, TOA reﬂectance increases by 1 %. While
changes to 0.55 µm Band #4 and 0.65 µm Band #1 are less
than 0.4 %, 0.86 µm Band #2 is increased by 0.8 %. The
1.24 µm Band #5 has huge changes, asymmetric over land
versus ocean. We do not plot the corresponding changes to
L2 TOA reﬂectance (e.g. Fig. 3), but we note that there are
also surprising non-linearities with respect to pixel selection
and successful aerosol retrieval.
Figure 22 presents the overall changes to MT that are anal-
ogous to the overall changes in MA (Fig. 2a, k and f). As
compared to the overall differences shown in Fig. 2f the cor-
responding overall change for MT over ocean looks like MA,
but is less negative in the semi-arid regions and more positive
over vegetation. Essentially, the extra difference over land is
driven by the increase in Terra’s blue band reﬂectance, as
compared to little or no change in the other bands used for
DT-land retrieval. The calibration change is in addition to the
other upstream (geolocation and cloud mask) and retrieval al-
gorithm changes.
We restate here (from Sect. 2.4) that this is not a calibration
or a trend paper. However, since we have already processed
eight months of “test data” for both Terra and Aqua, we ask
whether Terra/Aqua AOD inconsistencies might remain for
C6. Following Tables 2 (for land) and 4 (for ocean), we cal-
culate global, monthly mean AOD for each month, for Terra
and Aqua separately, and for both C5 and expected C6 data.
The results are plotted as Fig. 23, where C5 (C6) is plotted
in blue (red), and Terra and Aqua are plotted as “T” and “A”.
Over land (left panel), it is clear that MT and MA did not
well track each other for C5, and that MT > MA in 2003, but
reversed for 2008 and 2010. Even though the retrieval algo-
rithm was updated for C6, the identical DT-land algorithm
is still being used for both sensors’ data. For C6, we should
expect to see better tracking of MT with MA, although an
offset of ∼0.015 remains. Over the ocean (right panel), there
will be a signiﬁcant drop of 0.018 in all months, however the
∼0.01 offset (described by Remer et al., 2008) will remain
for C6. Reducing the Terra/Aqua offset is a topic of future
study, but a vicarious gain correction (e.g Franz et al., 2007)
may be an option.
At this point, we cannot determine fully how the revised
calibration efforts will impact global trends and divergence
of Terra and Aqua. However, the preliminary result is that, in
fact, the trending differences will most likely be mitigated by
the new calibration effort. Unlike the situation in 2007 when
the C5 aerosol algorithms were put into operation after test-
ing only on C4 inputs, for C6, we are accounting for expected
upstream changes.

New MODIS 3 km product (MxD04_3K)
Prior to Terra launch, the MODIS aerosol algorithms were
designed to retrieve at 10 km resolution (at nadir). This, in
part, was seen as a compromise between signal-to-noise of
the instrument, of surface variability, and expected aerosol
variability (e.g Anderson et al., 2003). The 10 km was rea-
sonable for deriving global aerosol climatology, while pro-
ducing a manageable volume of information.
One unexpected application of the MODIS aerosol prod-
uct was its use as a proxy for estimating surface-level par-
ticulate pollution (Chu et al., 2003; Wang and Christopher,
2003; Engel-Cox et al., 2004). However, some studies (e.g.,
R. R. Li et al., 2005) indicated that the 10 km resolution was
not ﬁne enough to resolve local variability, especially near
and within cities where most of the human population lives.
Therefore, in recent years, the air quality community in par-
ticular has been advocating for higher resolution aerosol re-
trieval data to monitor and model pollution threats to our
human population. Other research applications for a higher
resolution data product include, but are not limited to, ef-
forts in characterizing smoke plumes from ﬁres, resolving

aerosol loading in complex terrain and studying aerosol-
cloud processes.
Because the MODIS 10 km aerosol algorithms were de-
signed with climate applications in mind, they were con-
structed in such a way to suppress noise in the retrieval. The
danger in producing a higher-resolution data set is that there
is the possibility of introducing noise into the product. The
standard DT aerosol retrieval throws out at least 50 % (over
ocean) and 70 % (over land) of its available 500 m pixels.
This has been proven to reduce noise due to land surface
variability, cloud contamination and other non-aerosol sig-
nals. Blindly going to a 500 m (or 1 km) resolution global
retrieval will lead to retrieval errors.
However, because there is such a strong need for a global
ﬁne resolution aerosol product, we have developed a com-
promise algorithm that retains sufﬁcient pixel screening and
statistics. For C6, this will take the form of a separate Level 2
aerosol data product at 3 km resolution (Remer et al., 2012),
and will be archived as “MxD04_3K”. Compared to the
standard 10 km algorithm, the 3 km algorithm will have the
same methodology and structure, and use the same inversion
method, surface optical property assumptions, and lookup
tables. The differences arise only in the manner in which
pixels are selected and grouped for retrieval. Since global
3 km product ﬁle dimensions will be so much larger, the new
MxD04_3KM ﬁle will provide only a subset of the SDSs
offered by the standard MxD04_L2 ﬁle. The algorithms and
products are discussed further in two recent papers (Munchak
et al., 2013; Remer et al., 2013).
Plotted in Fig. 24, are two examples of granules retrieved
by both 10 km and 3 km retrieval algorithms. Both are lo-
cated over Maryland during July 2010. Cloud masking is the
same for both algorithms. However, the sorting and discard-
ing processes are slightly different, meaning that the input
reﬂectances (from L1B) are organized into groups of 6 × 6
pixels for the 3 km algorithm, versus 20 × 20 pixels for the
10 km algorithm. Therefore, pixels that might be discarded
during the sorting and discarding procedure at 10 km might
be kept at 3 km. This has the potential to make the 3 km prod-
uct noisier than at 10 km. On the other hand, if sufﬁcient pix-
els escape the masking and discarding procedure at 10 km,

product.
then an entire 10 km box might appear to have inaccurate
AOD, which is given substantial weight in an areal weight-
ing of a spatial average. In the 3 km product these outlying
AOD retrievals can be conﬁned to a smaller area and play a
lesser role in an areal weighting of a regional average. Fig-
ure 24 shows both situations.
The formal evaluation of the 3 km product is currently un-
derway, however, preliminary analyses have been performed
on global data (Remer et al., 2013) as well as local data
(Munchak et al., 2013; Livingston et al., 2013). These ref-
erences have detailed descriptions of the data, their QA plan,
and lists of included SDSs. While, initially (for C6) the 3 km
product includes only DT retrievals (over land and ocean),
DB retrievals may be added later. There is no operational
Level 3 product derived from this 3 km data set.

Discussion, including transition to NPP-VIIRS
To this point, we have described the many improvements and
updates to the MODIS along-orbit, dark-target aerosol al-
gorithms and products. Except for introducing wind speed
dependence over ocean, we have made only minor adjust-
ments to the science behind the DT retrieval procedures.
The theoretical basis of the DT-algorithms is solid, at least
over the intended DT-land and ocean surfaces. However, we
have made substantive adjustments to characterizing bound-
ary conditions (center wavelengths, gas absorption correc-
tion, instrument calibration) as well as pixel selection (e.g.,
cloud masking) and quality assurance (including assigning
conﬁdence). In Sects. 3, 4 and 5, we described many changes
to the MODIS DT aerosol retrieval. Many of the changes

involve ensuring that assumptions and diagnostics are “con-
sistent”, including such exercises as re-calculating center
wavelengths, ROD, and gas corrections, as well as making
sure that different RT codes converge for calculating path
radiance for common geometry and conditions. There are
new diagnostic SDSs reported within the aerosol product
ﬁle, including the wind speed information over ocean, the
topographic elevation over land, land-sea masks, cloud dis-
tances and other parameters over both land and ocean. At the
same time, the MCST and Wisconsin group updated calibra-
tion, geolocation and cloud mask products that are upstream
to the aerosol retrieval. This meant in addition to updat-
ing the aerosol retrieval itself, we also made changes (cloud
masking, sediment masking, etc.) to compensate for the up-
stream improvements. We have computed expected error
(EE) over both land and ocean for our test data, maintaining
±(0.05 + 15 %) over land, but changing to (+(0.04 + 10 %,
−(0.02 + 10 %)) over ocean to reﬂect consistent asymmetry.
We have revised the protocol for aggregation to Level 3, and
introduced a new high-resolution (3 km) global product for
air quality applications.
However, no matter how much energy is put into improv-
ing the DT assumptions (surface characterization, aerosol
model, pixel selection, quality assurance, etc.), there is lit-
tle or no additional information within the MODIS visible
through SWIR channels that can be used for on-orbit aerosol
retrieval. Because desert surfaces are relatively dark in the
UV (and Deep-Blue, near-UV) wavelengths, the DB-land al-
gorithm is a useful alternative, particularly for regions where
DT algorithms cannot work. To take advantage of this cov-
erage, we have created a new “best-of” combined aerosol
product that merges results from both algorithms. It is not yet
validated, but it is additional source of global aerosol infor-
mation. However, because of the inherent uncertainties of the
surface reﬂectance, as well as to all other assumptions, there
is a limit to the accuracy and precision of any single-view,
along-orbit aerosol retrieval algorithm. Based on the assump-
tions and uncertainties discussed in this paper, the uncer-
tainty of global AOD, from a single-look, multi-spectral data
set cannot be reduced below ±0.03, or 15–20 % of global
mean AOD. This is in comparison with the precision (±0.01–
0.02; e.g., McComiskey et al., 2008) needed to reduce un-
certainties in global aerosol forcing. While there are poten-
tial improvements, such as retrieval of aerosol optical depth
above clouds (Jethva et al., 2013) and corrections for three-
dimensional scattering effects (e.g. Wen et al., 2013), these
may not be enough to signiﬁcantly reduce the global AOD
uncertainty.
There are alternatives to along-orbit algorithms. One very
promising alternative is the temporal/spatial MAIAC algo-
rithm (Lyapustin et al., 2011). MAIAC adds the knowledge
that land surfaces change very little over a short timescale.
Using multi-day measurements from MODIS, coupled with
some constraints about surface spectral BRDF, one can re-
trieve land surface and aerosol properties simultaneously.
MAIAC has been proven to provide accurate AOD over many
surface types, including vegetated and desert surfaces. The
main problem with MAIAC is its practicality – multi-day in-
versions require more computer resources than the DT or DB
algorithms, and may be difﬁcult to perform in real time.
On 25 October 2011, the Visible Infrared Imaging Ra-
diometer Suite (VIIRS) was launched by the National Polar-
orbiting Partnership (NPP) aboard the Suomi-NPP satellite.
Suomi-NPP is a joint NASA/NOAA mission that is intended
to provide continuity between NASA’s EOS program, and the
future Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program. Specif-
ically, VIIRS was designed to have similar capabilities as
MODIS, and Suomi-NPP is ﬂying with a similar equator
crossing time as Aqua. In terms of aerosol retrieval, the
standard VIIRS algorithm is based on the joint heritage of
the MODIS DT-retrieval algorithms and the MODIS atmo-
spheric correction algorithms to derive land surface proper-
ties (Vermote and Kotchenova, 2008). Sensitivity tests and
radiative transfer studies indicate that the VIIRS algorithm
for VIIRS should provide an aerosol product with similar
quality to that produced by MODIS. However, there are
many small differences between VIIRS and MODIS (satel-
lite altitude, spatial resolution, exact wavelength bands, etc.)
as well as differences in retrieval algorithms (cloud masking,
pixel selection, ﬁtting algorithm, etc.) that suggest that the
VIIRS aerosol record will not exactly follow MODIS.
A climate data record is deﬁned by the National Re-
search Council (NRC, 2004) as “a time series of measure-
ments of sufﬁcient length, consistency, and continuity to
determine climate variability and change”. While we have
taken many steps with the MODIS instrument, calibration,
and retrieval algorithms to attain consistency, it is debatable
whether ten or twelve years is sufﬁcient length and conti-
nuity. While MODIS may orbit for another few years, it
will not have provided a multi-decade data record. Yet, the
MODIS DT-algorithm is a mature algorithm, and we expect
that the MODIS-derived DT products will continue to be use-
ful for research and applications. Speciﬁcally, after correc-
tions for Terra calibration, we believe that the MODIS re-
trievals can be a reliable “standard” for creating an aerosol
climate data record. Since similar wavelength bands are used
by the aerosol retrieval on VIIRS, and we better understood
how to calculate things such as center wavelength and gas
correction assumptions, we may be able to port exactly the
MODIS retrieval algorithm to VIIRS and future instruments.
This will lead to a smooth transition across multi-instrument
data records, and the possibility for creating an aerosol cli-
mate data record. However, even with consistent attention to
detail, a global uncertainty of ±0.03 may be too much to
constrain aerosol forcing. In this case the global AOD obser-
vations from MODIS will be used as an anchor for studies
that combine models, in situ observations, and other satellite
data sets for reducing the uncertainty (e.g. Kahn, 2011).
The DT-algorithm is a mature algorithm, with known un-
certainties and a continually improving track record. Even

though there are promising new algorithms for retrieving
aerosol from MODIS and other sensors, they are not yet ca-
pable of producing global information, quickly and reliably.
In addition to running as standard products in the MODAPS
environment, the MODIS DT-algorithm is operating in near-
real time (Rapid Response, http://earthdata.nasa.gov/data/
near-real-time-data/rapid-response). MODIS DT data are re-
liably being used in operational applications of data assimi-
lation (e.g., Zhang et al., 2008; Benedetti et al., 2009; Reid et
al., 2011), weather forecasting (e.g., Carmona et al., 2008),
ﬁre monitoring (Kaufman et al., 2003) and air quality appli-
cations (e.g., Hoff et al., 2009). Even with the known lim-
its of the DT products, we expect that Collection 6 of the
MODIS retrievals (both Terra and Aqua) will provide an an-
chor for developing a long-term aerosol climate data record.

Here, λi is wavelength in nm, and Eq. (A3) is from Bodhaine
et al. (1999) for sea level at 45◦N. Tabulated band-by-band
relative spectral response (RSR) and spectral TOA solar ir-
radiance (IRR) come from the MCST web site (http://mcst.
gsfc.nasa.gov/calibration/parameters). Note that the RSR and
IRR tables are resampled to common wavelengths, the in-
tegrations are only for “in-band” response (RSR > 1 %), and
that the RSR is furthermore an integration across all detectors
(10, 20 or 40 depending on band) and across both MODIS
mirrors.
Table A1 lists CWλ and RODλ, both for C5 (noting dif-
ferences between land and ocean), and for C6 (noting differ-
ences between MODIS on Terra and Aqua). The ﬁnal num-
bers used for C6 are based on the average of Terra and Aqua.

in the ﬁrst 7 MODIS bands (a) H2O Transmission Factor vs. H2O

As compared to that assumed for C5 (over ocean), RODλ has
changed by −0.0034, −0.0017, −0.0013 and −0.0003, for
Bands #3, 4, 1 and 2, respectively. For the other bands, dif-
ferences from C5 were in the ﬁfth digit or smaller.
Accurate aerosol retrieval also requires appropriate cor-
rection for the absorption of atmospheric gases. While the
aerosol retrieval is performed in bands that are centered in
atmospheric windows, the non-trivial width of these bands
(nominally 20 nm) contains absorption lines of water vapor
(H2O), ozone (O3), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4),
oxygen (O2), nitrous oxide (N2O), nitrogen dioxide (NO2),
and other trace gases. The aerosol retrieval wants a “gas-free”
spectral TOA reﬂectance, so that it can be compared with the
LUT. This means that the L1B values (ρL1B
λ
) are multiplied
by the total gas transmission correction factor ( ˙T gas
λ
) to de-
rive the corrected spectral reﬂectance (ρm

can lead to signiﬁcant errors in the TOA reﬂectance that is
in turn matched with the aerosol LUTs to retrieve aerosol
optical depth.
As documented in the online C5 ATBD (Levy et al.,

Note that the K coefﬁcients are used when NCEP data are valid, whereas the US1976 optical depths are used when NCEP data are missing. In case of “other” gases, global
average optical depth is assumed. Other gas includes CO2, CO, N2O, NO2, NO, CH4, O2, SO2 and other trace gases.
Fig. A2. Comparison of gas optical depths calculated for mid-
latitude summer atmosphere using C5 and C6 (LBL) gas cor-
rection coefﬁcients. Different colors represent constituent gases
(H2O = blue, O3 = green, “other” gases = red).
gas j (provided by ancillary NCEP data in appropriate units),
and the function is an empirical ﬁt to many RT simulations.
Unfortunately, these coefﬁcients, calculated prior to Terra
launch, were not reproducible. In the following, we explain
the derivation of new gas corrections for C6. Also, in C5,
only CO2 was assumed to be important (outside of H2O and
O3), whereas other gases may also contribute.
We used the Line-By-Line Radiative Transfer Model
(LBLRTM, Clough et al., 1992, 2005) and integrated with
our previously calculated RSR and IRR database. We started
with many different proﬁles (52 proﬁles from ECMWF, per-
sonal communication Pubu Ciren, NOAA) of water vapor
and ozone, varied the air mass factors (10 viewing zenith an-
gles ranging from 0–80◦), and computed the coefﬁcients of
regression. We were looking to ﬁt the following formulas for
calculating ˙T j

(O in units of DU).

Not surprisingly, results differed from the values documented
within the C5 ATBD. The revised C6 gas correction coefﬁ-
cients Kj
i,λ are reported in Table A2.
As compared to that used to model H2O for C5, there are
signiﬁcant changes to the quadratic coefﬁcients in bands 5
and 6, but only small changes in other bands. For O3, the
quadratic coefﬁcients changed in bands 1–4, where O3 has
absorption lines. Somewhat better linear ﬁts to ozone are

R. C. Levy et al.: The Collection 6 MODIS aerosol products over land and ocean
made when including a slope and offset (only slope used for
C5). The offset is small, however.
Also listed in Table A2 are values for τ j
λ “climatology”.
These values of gas optical depth can be used in the aerosol
retrieval when there is no ancillary data provided. They
have been computed for 1976 Standard atmosphere (http:
//modelweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/atmos/us_standard.html), and can
be used in Eq. (A6) to estimate ˙T j
λ . The linear ﬁts for both
H2O and O3 are shown in Fig. A1a and b. For “Other” gases,
we took climatology to be the sum of all major gases that are
not H2O and O3. Thus in addition to CO2, “other” gases in-
clude CO, N2O, NO2, NO, CH4, O2, SO2 and other trace
gases. For some bands, the C6 “other” gas optical depths
are an order of magnitude higher than the CO2-only optical
depth used in C5.
Figure A2 shows a comparison of the H2O, O3 and
“Other” gas optical depths calculated for a sample atmo-
sphere (w = 2.9 cm, O = 324 DU) using C5 and C6 gas cor-
rection coefﬁcients. Like shown in Table A2, we see that ex-
cept in Band 7, the “Other” gas correction is increased, pri-
marily due to including more gases than just CO2. The sig-
niﬁcant difference in Band 5 stems from now modeled O2
absorption at ∼1.27 µm. H2O correction is also increased,
due primarily to the increased spectral resolution.
In C5, the air mass (G) factor was assumed to represent a
ﬂat earth geometry, so that G = 1/cos(Z) where Z is zenith
angle. However, as Z →90◦, G should not go to inﬁnity. At
maximum allowed solar zenith angle of 84◦, the ﬂat earth
assumption would overestimate G by 10 % or more, depend-
ing on gas vertical proﬁle. While spherical shell assumption
(with scale height = 8 km) is better, we use the general for-
mula of Kasten and Young (1989), but with appropriate co-
efﬁcients to account for climatological differences of vertical
proﬁles of each gas constituent (Gueymard, 1995), i.e.
Gj =

cosZ + aj,1Zaj,2  aj,3 −Z
aj,4−1
(A9)
with coefﬁcients listed in Table A3. At Z = 60◦, the differ-
ences between ﬂat earth and Eq. (9) are negligible, however
the Gj values for 84◦are also shown in Table A3. These
values range from 7.49 (ozone) to 9.34 (water vapor) and
can be compared to ﬂat earth (9.57) and spherical earth shell
(9.02) approximations. What is actually computed during the
aerosol retrieval is the “two way” transmission correction, to
account for the sum of downward (function of solar zenith
angle, Z = θ0) and upward (function of view zenith angle,
Z = θ) gas absorptions. Therefore, Gj ≈Gj(θ0) + Gj(θ).
For the widest valid MODIS geometry (θ0 = 84◦; θ = 64◦),
a ﬂat earth assumption would overestimate ozone absorption
by > 20 % (i.e., 9.57 · 2.28 · τ 03
λ versus 7.49 · 2.25 · τ 03
λ ).

Run-time QA ﬂags for MxD04 (_L2)
The Aerosol (dark target) run-time Quality Assurance (QA)
ﬂags are stored as Scientiﬁc Data Sets (SDSs), Qual-
ity_Assurance_Land, and Quality_Assurance_Ocean. The
Deep Blue retrieval has its own QA ﬂag but is not discussed
here. Each of the two dark-target QA ﬂags are ﬁve bytes that
provide information on the processing (logic) path taken dur-
ing the aerosol retrieval. The aerosol QA includes product
quality ﬂags, retrieval processing ﬂags, and input data re-
source ﬂags which are designed separately for land and ocean
because of the differences of retrieval algorithms. Particu-
lar ﬂags may indicate: (a) conditions why retrieval was not
attempted at all (e.g. input data outside of boundary condi-
tions), (b) cases where input data quality may be poor (e.g.
large cloud fraction), so that the retrieval is performed with
lower conﬁdence, or (c) cases where retrieval may have been
performed but the results were poor (e.g. results outside of re-
alistic conditions). Aerosol QA arrays are produced at prod-
uct resolution and for daytime only.
The Quality Assurance Conﬁdence (QAC) ﬂags summa-
rize the QA logic, and are referred to in the main text
of this paper. The QAC ﬂags are the “Estimated quality
ﬂag of aerosol optical thickness” for land and the “Es-
timated quality of aerosol parameter of average solution”
for ocean retrievals. These ﬂags appear embedded in the
bits of the 5-byte “Quality_Assurance_Land” and “Qual-
ity_Assurance_Ocean”, but they also appear as straightfor-
ward integers in “Land_Ocean_Quality_Flag”.

The following tables describe the byte decoding of
the
MxD04
“Quality_Assurance_Land”,
and
“Qual-
ity_Assurance_Ocean” SDSs. Each ﬂag corresponds to a
certain number of bits, and bit values corresponding to
results of certain tests. Note that the ﬂags representing
the case of valid retrieval but lower conﬁdence is known
as “Part I” over land, but “Part II” over ocean. Similarly
the ﬂags representing the case of no valid retrieval are
known as Part II over land, but Part I over ocean. Under the
column “Comments”, we describe possible ﬂag cascades.
For example, if Part I over land receives value = 8 (less than
optimal clear sky pixels) then the QAC would be set to 2
(good quality).
