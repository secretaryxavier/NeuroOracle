Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis has succeeded in infecting one third of the human race though 
inhibition or evasion of innate and adaptive immunity. The pathogen is a facultative intracellular 
parasite that uses the niche provided by mononuclear phagocytes for its advantage. Complex 
interactions determine whether the bacillus will or will not be delivered to acidified lysosomes, 
whether the host phagocyte will survive infection or die, and whether the timing and mode of cell 
death works to the advantage of the host or the pathogen. Here we discuss cell death and 
autophagy in TB. These fundamental processes of cell biology feature in all aspects of TB 
pathogenesis and may be exploited to the treatment or prevention of TB disease.

1. Introduction
Programmed cell death and autophagy are fundamental processes of cell biology intimately 
involved in the interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and the phagocytes it 
infects, including macrophages, dendritic cells (DC) and neutrophils. The remarkable 
success of Mtb as a human pathogen results from its capacity to evade the innate 
antimicrobial effector mechanisms of mononuclear phagocytes (MPs) and leverage the 
intracellular environment as a replication niche. Infected MPs are faced with a pathogen 
surviving in phagosomes that fail to incorporate the molecular machinery needed to reduce 
vacuolar pH and generate free radicals of oxygen or nitrogen, and that fail to fuse with 
lysosomes to expose bacilli to damaging hydrolases [1]. Plan B for the infected MP is to 
undergo programmed cell death, which eliminates the intracellular sanctuary and exerts 
other potentially host-protective effects described in section 3.1.2. Alternatively, a variety of 
extracellular signals may activate the autophagic machinery of infected MP to drive Mtb into 
lethal autolysosomes as described in section 5. These responses set the stage for what are 
now recognized as a very complex series of measures and countermeasures culminating in

the survival or death of the infecting pathogen or its host cell, the progression or resolution 
of immune pathology, and outcome of tuberculosis (TB) disease.
2. Overview of programmed cell death
A requirement for regulated cell death to support tissue development and homeostasis was 
conceived by Karl Vogt in 1842 but the term apoptosis to describe a morphologically 
distinct form of non-traumatic cell death and the understanding of its biochemical 
mechanisms did not emerge until the late 20th century [2]. Apoptosis is a tightly regulated 
process of cellular deconstruction. It minimizes inflammation and bystander injury by 
containing the dismembered nuclear and cytoplasmic contents of dying cells within 
membrane-bound vesicles called apoptotic bodies that are engulfed by other phagocytes in a 
process called efferocytosis (section 3.1.2). Binding of apoptotic bodies to specific receptors 
on MPs responding to “find me” and “eat me” signals induces the expression of anti-
inflammatory cytokines including transforming growth factor-β and interleukin (IL)-10 to 
further insure the silent elimination of cellular corpses [3, 4]. The ultrastructural morphology 
of apoptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage and chromatin condensation (pyknosis), 
nuclear fragmentation (karyorrhexis), and blebbing of the outer cell membrane that 
culminates in apoptotic body formation. Chromosomal DNA is cleaved at inter-nucleosomal 
boundaries, demonstrated by laddering of DNA bands on gel electrophoresis. 
Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), a membrane component that in viable cells is held facing the 
cytosolic side of the plasma membrane by the enzyme flippase, translocates to the outward-
facing surface in apoptotic cells. Exposure of PtdSer on the cell surface plays an important 
role in membrane stability and clearance of apoptotic bodies (section 3.1.2).
Necrosis is a much different death, defined by the loss of outer cell membrane integrity with 
release of cytoplasmic and nuclear contents to the extracellular space. Necrosis was 
originally thought to result only from accidental events (e.g. freezing or crushing) but 
regulated mechanisms of necrosis were later identified (section 2.2) [5]. The ultrastructural 
morphology of necrosis is characterized by cytoplasmic swelling (onicosis), cytoplasmic 
vacuolization and swelling of organelles including mitochondria and cell nuclei [6]. These 
changes result from ATP depletion and the failure of plasma membrane ion pumps to 
maintain a stable osmotic gradient. Necrosis can also result from direct plasma membrane 
damage, which disrupts the cells without onicosis. Rupture of the plasma membrane 
provokes inflammation by releasing damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) such 
as heat shock proteins, high-mobility group box 1, S100 proteins, extracellular genomic and 
mitochondrial DNA, ATP, monosodium urate, and heparin sulfate [7, 8, 8-12]. Binding of 
DAMPs to their cognate receptors activates an innate inflammatory response and sends 
“endogenous adjuvant” signals that can stimulate DC to promote T cell activation [9]. The 
diversity of protein and non-protein DAMPs ensures redundancy in immune stimulation but 
most converge on common pathways involving inflammasomes, IL-1 and leukotriene 
(LT)B4 [9, 13].

nuclear and cytoskeletal proteins. Both steps in this process involve caspases; a family of 
cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases constitutively expressed as zymogens. 
Caspases operate in a cascade for the rapid induction of apoptosis, which is energy-
dependent but independent of transcription [14]. Initiator caspases-8, -9, and -10 are 
activated by dimerization following recruitment to signaling complexes (sections 2.1.1 and 
2.1.2) [15]. Activated initiator caspases then cleave and activate the pre-formed dimeric 
zymogens of the executioner caspases-3 and -7. Activation of executioner caspases is 
necessarily a tightly regulated event but can in some circumstances be mediated by proteases 
other than initiator caspases.
2.1.1 Extrinsic apoptosis—The extrinsic pathway begins with ligand binding to tumor 
necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family proteins containing a death domain in their 
cytoplasmic tail which serves as the site for signal complex formation [16]. The receptor/
ligand pairs most relevant to TB are TNF-α/TNFR1 and Fas ligand/Fas [17, 18]. TNF-α 
binding trimerizes TNFR1 allowing recruitment of TNFR1-associated death domain 
(TRADD), receptor interacting protein kinase (RIPK)1, TNFR-associated factor (TRAF)2, 
TRAF5, cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP) 1, and cIAP2 to form membrane-
associated complex I. Signals from complex I activate NFκB that upregulates pro-survival 
genes [19]. Apoptosis is initiated from TNFR1 following dissociation of complex I 
constituents to form cytoplasmic complexes. Complex IIA contains TRADD, Fas-associated 
death domain (FADD) and caspase-8. Its formation is opposed by cellular FLICE-like 
inhibitory protein (cFLIP) that is induced by NFκB [20]. The TRADD-independent complex 
IIB (also called the ripoptosome) forms when TNFR1 is activated but cIAP1 is inhibited by 
mimetics of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac). Formation of 
complex IIB also requires deubiquitination of RIPK1 by cylindromatosis. FasL binding to 
Fas recruits FADD which in turn recruits procaspase-8 and/or cFLIP via death-effector 
domain interactions. This forms a membrane-associated death inducing signal complex but a 
secondary cytosolic complex of FADD, cFLIP, and caspase-8 can be released to further 
amplify apoptosis initiation [19].
2.1.2 Intrinsic apoptosis—The intrinsic apoptosis pathway is induced by diverse 
intracellular stresses such as DNA damage, starvation, and oxidative stress that lead to outer 
mitochondrial membrane (OMM) permeabilization. Cytochrome c released from the 
mitochondrial inter-membrane space binds the cytosolic protein apoptotic protease 
activating factor (Apaf-1) to form a multimeric signaling complex called the apoptosome. 
The apoptosome recruits and activates procaspase-9, which in turn activates executioner 
caspases [21]. Smac and the serine protease HtrA2/OMI are also released from the inter-
membrane space; they amplify intrinsic apoptosis by relieving the constitutive caspase 
repression mediated by cIAP family members. Mitochondrial permeability is controlled by 
Bcl-2 family proteins that either promote or inhibit apoptosis [22, 23]. Pro-apoptotic Bax 
and Bak form pores in the OMM to release cytochrome c. This is opposed by anti-apoptotic 
family members (e.g. Bcl-2, Bclx-L, Mcl-1) but further promoted by other pro-apoptotic 
Bcl-2 proteins. Cell fate is determined by the integrated activities of pro- and anti-apoptotic 
Bcl-2 family proteins. Activated caspase-9 cleaves pro-apoptotic Bid into an enzymatically 
active truncated form (tBid), which orchestrates the activities of Bax to accelerate

cytochrome c release. Caspase-8 can also cleave Bid, providing a means for crosstalk 
between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways [24].
2.1.3 Perforin/granzyme mediated apoptosis—A third apoptosis induction pathway 
is mediated by serine proteases of the granzyme family contained, along with perforin, in 
granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells [25]. Perforin 
creates pores in the plasma membrane of target cells through which the granzymes are 
introduced. Granzyme B cleaves the initiator caspases -8 and -10 and the executioner 
caspases -3 and -7, and it has other substrates relevant to apoptosis induction including 
inhibitor of caspase-activated DNase and Bid [26, 27]. The former mediates DNA 
fragmentation while the latter links perforin/granzyme to the mitochondrial pathway. 
Granzymes A and C are also implicated in apoptosis although their roles are less well 
characterized [28]. While perforin/granzymes is the primary mechanism for killing, CTL can 
also cause apoptosis by engaging Fas on target cells with FasL to trigger the extrinsic 
pathway [29].
2.2 Regulated necrosis
The field of programmed cell death has become increasingly complex since the discovery of 
apoptosis. Much recent interest has focused on pathways of regulated necrosis, which 
currently comprise necroptosis, pyroptosis, pyronecrosis, ETosis, cyclophilin D (CYPD)-
dependent necrosis, parthanatos, and autophagic cell death [5]. Necroptosis is the best 
characterized pathway while pyroptosis, pyronecrosis and ETosis have been most closely 
identified in the context of infection. Necroptosis occurs when TNFR1 signaling is activated 
but caspase-8 is inhibited by drugs or virus-encoded anti-apoptotic proteins. This results in 
formation of a complex called the necrosome, comprising RIPK1, RIPK3, FADD, and 
caspase-8 [30, 31]. The necrosome recruits and activates mixed lineage kinase domain like 
which then translocates to the plasma membrane where it mediates TNF- and Ca2+-
dependent necrotic cell death (necroptosis) through several terminal mechanisms including 
energy depletion, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, lysosomal membrane 
permeabilization (LMP), and lipid peroxidation [5].
2.2.1 Pyroptosis and pyronecrosis—Pyroptosis and pyronecrosis were discovered in 
the context of intracellular bacterial infection (e.g. Francisella tularensis, Listeria 
monocytogenes, and Shigella flexneri [32-34]) although non-infectious triggers have also 
been identified [35]. These death subroutines share dependence on inflammasome 
constituents and terminal plasma membrane pore formation resulting onicosis. A common 
trigger for pyroptosis and pyronecrosis is NOD-like receptor (NLR) activation by pathogen-
associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from intracellular microbes. Distinguishing 
characteristics are the dependence of pyroptosis on caspase-1 or caspase-11 (human 
caspase-4) while pyronecrosis is caspase-independent and requires the inflammasome 
component apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC) and the 
lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Pyroptosis and pyronecrosis share rapid kinetics of lethality 
and considerable overlap in triggers. As an example, S. flexneri at low multiplicity of 
infection (MOI) induces macrophage pyroptosis dependent on the inflammasome constituent 
NLRC4 but higher MOI triggers pyronecrosis via NLRP3 [36]. These death modes are

highly inflammatory, with abundant production of IL-1β and IL-18 that is perpetuated by the 
release of aggregated ASC multimers (ASC specks) which continue processing pro-IL-1β in 
the extracellular space and even following phagocytosis by naïve macrophages [37, 38].
2.2.2 CYPD-dependent necrosis—Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) occurs 
when the inner membrane (IMM) becomes permeable to solutes <1500 Da [39]. This is a 
sudden event caused by opening of a channel in IMM called the permeability transition pore 
(PTP) [40]. The mitochondrial matrix protein CYPD is a key regulator of PTP formation 
although not an essential component of the pore. Binding of cyclosporin A to CYPD inhibits 
MPT [23]. Transient MPT is survivable but sustained PTP opening results in Ca2+ efflux, 
depletion of pyridine nucleotides from the mitochondrial matrix, and matrix swelling that 
culminates in OMM rupture with release of inter-membrane space components including 
cytochrome c, Smac, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). The intrinsic apoptosis pathway 
is activated by cytochrome c and Smac, (another example of crosstalk between death 
pathways), while AIF mediates caspase-independent DNA fragmentation and chromatin 
condensation [41]. AIF also plays a role in parthanatos, a regulated necrosis pathway 
mediated by poly ADP ribose polymerase hyper activation that is reviewed elsewhere [42]. 
The CYPD pathway is tied to necrosis as result of catastrophic mitochondrial dysfunction. 
The inducers of CYPD-dependent necrosis are not fully understood but Ca2+, ROS, adenine 
nucleotides, and ubiquinones have been implicated [5].
2.2.3 ETosis—This mode of programmed necrosis was first identified in neutrophils and 
features chromatin disgorgement to the extracellular space, forming extracellular traps 
(NETs) [43]. In contrast to apoptosis, chromatin decondensation is an early step in ETosis 
and PtdSer does not flip to the outer cell surface. Unfolded genomic DNA presents a web-
like anionic polymer that binds bacteria and fungi by electrostatic interactions. NETs also 
bind proteins including neutrophil elastase, histones, and antimicrobial peptides that kill 
bound pathogens [44]. Release of extracellular traps has been identified in eosinophils, mast 
cells, and macrophages, hence the term ETosis [45, 46].
Triggers for ETosis include lipopolysaccharide, interferon (IFN)-γ, bacteria, fungi, and 
phorbol myristate acetate [47]. NET release in most instances requires NADPH oxidase 
(NOX) although a NOX-independent pathway stimulated by CXCL2 was reported [48]. The 
ETosis pathway, including the requirement NOX, is incompletely understood. Upstream 
signaling via Raf-MEK-ERK activates NOX and ETosis, as does activation of the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Inhibitors of ETosis include serine 
protease inhibitor B1 and the eicosanoid 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, a product of 5-
lipoxygenase [48, 49]. ETosis is fundamentally a mode of necrotic cell death but there is 
remarkable evidence for the persistence of post-ETotic, anuclear neutrophil zombies capable 
of directed migration and phagocytosis [50].
2.3 Detection of apoptosis and necrosis
Many assays are available to discern whether dead and dying cells are undergoing apoptosis 
or necrosis. The most common of these test the integrity of the outer cell membrane (e.g. 
propidium iodide [PI] or 7-aminoactinomycin D), presentation of PtdSer on the outer surface

of the plasma membrane (e.g annexin V binding), nuclear pyknosis and fragmentation (e.g. 
4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining), DNA fragmentation (e.g. terminal 
deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling [TUNEL] assay), caspase activation, 
and the state of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm). Transmission electron 
microscopy (TEM) is perhaps the most accurate method to distinguish between apoptotic 
and necrotic cell death based on distinct ultrastructural features. Each method has strengths 
and weaknesses depending on cells and experimental conditions being investigated. TUNEL 
is highly sensitive but has poor specificity while TEM is highly specific but lacks sensitivity 
since it is difficult to interrogate large numbers of cells, particularly in vivo.
To critically evaluate the literature on cell death in TB it is important to understand the 
limitations of these assays and the fundamental problem that none can unambiguously 
define cell fate. The Cell Death Nomenclature Committee has published guidelines for the 
use and interpretation of cell death assays [51]. The heterogeneity of cell death and unique 
characteristics of linked to specific cell types and conditions means that only general 
guidelines can be suggested. These include determining whether the cells in question are 
truly dead and then interrogating the responsible cell death subroutine using at least two 
methodologically unrelated assays. The challenge of defining the specific nature and 
subroutine of cell death is made greater by the extensive crosstalk between pathways so that 
different death subroutines may be simultaneously activated in a single cell with one or 
another appearing predominant based on experimental conditions [5, 51, 52]. Common 
examples of such ambiguities include: caspase activation in viable cells; caspase activation 
as a secondary effect of proteolysis in necrotic cells; crosstalk between extrinsic and 
intrinsic apoptosis pathways; secondary necrosis of apoptotic bodies; and the convergent 
triggers and execution mechanisms of the different programmed necrosis subroutines.
3. Cell death in TB
Apoptosis can serve as a defense mechanism for cells confronted with intracellular 
pathogens that consume host resources for survival and replication. This paradigm was 
discovered the context of virus infection (reviewed in [53]) but has been extended to a wide 
spectrum of pathogenic microbes. Apoptosis offers several potential benefits for the host 
including elimination of a replication niche, exposure of pathogens to humoral immunity, 
and forcing intracellular pathogens to reestablish residence in naïve host cells. Efferocytosis 
provides a means to defeat the virulence mechanisms of intracellular pathogens that inhibit 
vesicular trafficking and maturation. It also delivers pathogens or their antigenic 
components to DC for efficient priming and cross presentation (section 3.1.2) [54]. The 
rapid, immunostimulatory demise of cells by programmed necrosis might benefit the host by 
accelerating neutrophil recruitment to control fast-replicating bacteria [55]. Conversely, 
apoptosis could be disease-promoting if it eliminates key host defense cells, facilitates 
penetration of epithelial barriers, or spreads infection through efferocytosis [56, 57].
Macrophage-pathogen interactions play a central role in TB pathogenesis. The bacillus is a 
facultative intracellular parasite that cannot gain a foothold in new hosts without this 
replication sanctuary. Once Mtb has established infection in the lung, transmission to new 
hosts by infectious aerosols requires its transition to the extracellular space. It is therefore

unsurprising that cell death in its many forms has been identified in the context of Mtb 
infection in vitro and in vivo. A recent review on this topic cited 48 manuscripts reporting a 
spectrum of death modes and subroutines linked to TB including extrinsic, intrinsic and 
perforin/granzyme-mediated apoptosis, and several type of necrosis [58]. In this review we 
focus primarily on macrophage cell death resulting directly from Mtb infection but the fates 
of infected DC and neutrophils will also be discussed (section 3.3). While beyond the scope 
of this review, CTL-mediated death, activation-induced cell death, bystander death of T 
cells, and Mtb-induced death of epithelial cells all participate in TB pathogenesis.
3.1 Apoptosis of Mtb-infected macrophages
Before the discovery of an intrinsic apoptosis response to Mtb infection, Molloy et al. [59] 
reported that treating BCG-infected monocytes with exogenous ATP induced apoptosis and 
killed bacilli while BCG viability was preserved after H2O2-induced monocyte necrosis. In 
retrospect, the antimicrobial activity of ATP might have been mediated by autophagy 
(section 5.2) [60] but this publication introduced the concept of apoptosis has host-protective 
in TB. Keane et al. [18] were the first to describe apoptosis as an autonomous response of 
primary human alveolar macrophages infected with live but not heat-killed Mtb. Apoptosis 
was verified by TEM, internucleosomal laddering of genomic DNA, and TUNEL assay (the 
latter including human TB lung sections). The extrinsic pathway was triggered TNF-α in an 
autocrine/paracrine manner and required infection-induced priming for TNFR death signals 
since uninfected cells were resistant to exogenous TNF-α. The attenuated Mtb strain H37Ra 
was a much stronger apoptosis inducer than virulent H37Rv. Oddo et al. [17] subsequently 
reported that exogenous FasL or TNF-α induced apoptosis of Mtb-infected macrophages 
(defined by annexin V/PI staining and by TUNEL) was accompanied by reduced bacillary 
viability. No antimicrobial effect occurred with complement-induced necrosis of infected 
macrophages.
A simple model of apoptosis as a host-protective response in TB emerged from those early 
reports. Subsequent in vitro studies confirmed the association of apoptotic cell death with 
reduced Mtb viability [61-65]. The concept of apoptosis evasion as a virulence-associated 
trait of Mtb was substantiated and several mechanisms of apoptosis evasion were described 
including downregulation of Fas on infected macrophages, interference with death signals 
downstream of TNFR1, and shedding of soluble TNFR2 that neutralized TNF-α [17, 66, 
67].
Recent findings have underscored the complexity of macrophage apoptosis in TB and its 
role in host defense. Data from the zebrafish/M. marinum model show that apoptosis can 
facilitate spread of infection to naïve macrophages in vivo [57]. Accelerated dissemination 
was also demonstrated in mice infected with a pro-apoptotic mutant of virulent Mtb (section 
3.1.1) in experiments that also failed to support a direct antimicrobial effect of macrophage 
apoptosis in vivo [68].
3.1.1 Mtb genes linked to apoptosis evasion and induction—A major advance in 
this field was provided by the discovery in 2007 of two Mtb genes (secA2 and nuoG) linked 
to the suppression macrophage apoptosis, both acting reduce levels of ROS in the

mycobacterial vacuole [69, 70]. This jibes with the models of extrinsic apoptosis in Mtb-
infected macrophages where ROS play an intermediary role in TNF-α signaling for 
apoptosis (and necrosis), and intrinsic apoptosis that can also be triggered by ROS [71, 72]. 
Mutation of secA2 in impairs secretion of bacterial superoxide dismutase (SodA) and 
confers an apoptosis-inducing phenotype on H37Rv demonstrated by TUNEL and caspase 
activation in THP-1 cells and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM] [70]. This 
result was anticipated by an earlier study of H37Rv mutants where SodA expression was 
knocked down with anti-sense RNA, resulting in vivo attenuation with less inflammation 
and more MP apoptosis after high dose intravenous infection in C57BL/6 mice [73]. The 
ΔsecA2 mutant strongly induced antigen-specific CD8+ T cell priming in vivo, which was 
attributed to its pro-apoptotic phenotype (section 3.1.2).
The anti-apoptotic activity of nuoG was revealed in a gain-of-function screen in M. 
smegmatis. Deletion of nuoG in Mtb H37Rv conferred a pro-apoptotic phenotype on 
infection of THP-1 cells and BMM in vitro [69]. The nuoG gene encodes a subunit of a type 
I NADH dehydrogenase that neutralizes ROS generated by host NOX2, thereby inhibiting 
TNF-α-stimulated apoptosis as well as TNF-α secretion [74]. The mutant RvΔnuoG strain 
grows normally in broth but it is attenuated in SCID and wild-type BALB/c mice after high 
dose intravenous challenge [69]. Growth of RvΔnuoG in the lung during the first 3 weeks 
post-infection matched that of wild-type H37Rv and a complemented mutant strain; its 
attenuation in terms of bacterial burden was only evident at later times points with a 0.8 log 
reduction compared to wild-type H37Rv at 20 weeks. Bacterial loads in liver and spleen did 
not differ at any time point. These data suggest that the host-protective role of macrophage 
apoptosis in TB may be restricted in time and tissue compartment, following the induction 
of adaptive immunity and in the period when bacterial burden in the lung is normally held at 
a plateau level in wild-type mice infected with wild-type Mtb. That notion is supported by 
data from aerosol infection of protein kinase R (PKR)−/− mice [75]. These mice exhibit 
increased macrophage apoptosis during TB and have lower lung CFU than wild-type mice at 
70 days post-infection but not at 21 days.
The enhanced intracellular survival (eis) gene of Mtb is a more recently described pro-
survival factor that acts through an ROS-dependent pathway reminiscent of secA2 and nuoG 
[76]. The phenotype of RvΔeis differs, however, by increasing a caspase-independent cell 
death that is not clearly apoptotic in nature. This death is not accompanied by a strong 
TUNEL signature or caspase activation and it is only partially blocked by the pan-caspase 
inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. The Eis protein also modulates autophagy, and the autophagy 
inhibitor 3-methyladeneine enhances the survival of macrophages infected with RvΔeis. 
Following low dose aerosol challenge of wild-type C57BL/6 mice, lung and spleen bacterial 
burden was no different between RvΔeis, wild-type H37Rv or a complemented mutant strain 
but PI-positive cells and inflammation (IL-6 and TNF-α levels) were higher in mice infected 
with RvΔeis. Despite the common theme of ROS reduction, the data suggest that the Eis 
protein inhibits a predominantly necrotic rather than apoptotic macrophage death mode. This 
may be explained by its mechanism of action, based on acetylation of DUSP/MKP-7 and 
inhibition of JNK-dependent autophagy and ROS generation (section 5.4)[77].

An anti-apoptotic function was proposed for the Mtb protein MPT64 acting in a pathway 
involving NF-κB, miR21, and Bcl-2 [78]. The Mtb Rv3654c and Rv3655c genes were 
shown to participate in suppressing extrinsic apoptosis by reducing the availability of 
caspase-8 which has the effect of promoting regulated necrosis (section 2.2) [79]. Finally, 
protein kinase E of Mtb was reported to suppress macrophage apoptosis, specifically in the 
context of nitric oxide stress [80].
Far less is known about Mtb genes required for apoptosis induction. The Mtb 6 kDa early 
secretory antigenic target (ESAT6) is a pore-forming, virulence-associated gene product 
exported by the Esx-1 secretion system in a complex with 10-kDa culture filtrate protein 
[81]. The pore-forming function of ESAT6 is a leading candidate for Mtb-mediated LMP 
that precedes several forms of infection-induced cell death. There is considerable data 
linking ESAT6 and the Esx-1 secretion system to regulated necrosis of Mtb-infected 
macrophages (section 3.2) but ESAT6-mediated caspase upregulation and induction of 
THP-1 apoptosis (defined by annexin-V binding and sensitivity to pan-caspase inhibition) 
has been described [82]. It is uncertain whether these data obtained with immortalized 
monocytic cells reflect death mechanisms in primary macrophages infected Mtb. Others 
found that M. bovis BCG, which lacks ESAT6/CFP10 and the Esx-1 secretion system, is a 
potent inducer of apoptosis [61, 83, 84].
3.1.2 Efferocytosis in TB defense—Cells undergoing apoptosis release “find me” 
signals (e.g. CXC3CL1, lysophosphatidylcholine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, ATP, and UTP) 
that attract phagocytic cells for the clearance of apoptotic bodies [85]. Which of these or 
other possible signals operate in TB is presently conjectural but available data hint at a role 
for CX3CL1 and its receptor CX3CR1 [86]. While ATP/P2X7R interactions are implicated 
in TB defense [87], P2Y2 is the sensor for the small amounts of nucleotides released from 
apoptotic cells and so far this receptor has not been linked to TB. Neutrophils could respond 
to “find me” signals but the non-inflammatory clearance of apoptotic corpses is maintained 
by lactoferrin released from apoptotic cells. Lactoferrin serves as a “stay away” signal 
specifically inhibiting neutrophil but not MP migration to the vicinity of apoptotic cells [88].
Caspase-dependent exposure of PtdSer on the outer leaflet of plasma membranes is the best 
studied “eat me” signal although multiple signals may be required to promote efferocytosis 
[85]. Apoptotic corpses are recognized by a variety of tethering, signaling and/or phagocytic 
receptors on responding MPs (e.g. CD36, integrins, scavenger receptors, TAM receptors, 
TIM4, lectins, and RAGE), some of which require bridging molecules (e.g MFG-E8 and 
thrombospondin). These interactions initiate efferocytosis primarily by activating the Rho 
family GTPase Rac via CrkII-Dock180-ELMO or LPR1/MEGF10-GULP-ABCA1/ABCA7 
pathways. The internalization process of efferocytosis resembles macropinocytosis more 
than receptor-mediated phagocytosis and delivers apoptotic bodies to acidified 
phagolysosomes [89]. Specificity is further ensured by the expression of “don't eat-me” 
signals on viable sells (e.g. CD47 which binds to SIRPα to inhibit efferocytosis) [90].
The potential for efferocytosis to enhance the innate antimycobacterial properties of MPs 
was first proposed by Fratazzi et al. [91] in experiments using an apoptosis-inducing strain 
of M. avium. Adding naïve macrophages to cultures of infected, apoptotic macrophages

reduced mycobacterial viability in a contact-dependent manner that was not seen if the 
infected macrophages were made necrotic. Definitive evidence for efferocytosis-dependent 
killing of Mtb was provided by Martin et al. [92]. Primary mouse macrophages infected with 
mCherry-expressing H37Rv in vitro were shown to undergo apoptosis via the intrinsic 
pathway with subsequent delivery of apoptotic bodies to naïve macrophages. Transfer of 
Mtb from necrotic macrophages was observed in parallel and both phenomena were 
demonstrated in vivo after transfer of Rv/mCherry-infected DiO-labeled CD45.2+ 
macrophages into CD45.1+ recipients. Efferocytosis-dependent killing of H37Rv was 
demonstrated in vitro by blocking this pathway with anti-TIM4 mAb or by pre-treating 
naïve macrophages with forskolin or prostaglandin (PG)E2 that inhibit efferocytosis through 
a mechanism involving increased intracellular cAMP. Bacilli ingested by efferocytosis were 
delivered to capacious, acidified phagolysosomes that co-localized with LAMP1 and 
vacuolar H+-ATPase. An antimicrobial effect of efferocytosis in vivo was demonstrated by 
intraperitoneal transfer of H37Rv-infected arachidonate 5-lipoxyengase (Alox5)−/− 
macrophages into Rag−/− recipients. Alox5−/− macrophages are more prone to apoptosis 
following Mtb infection (section 3.2). In this infection/transfer model, recipients treated with 
anti-TIM4 had roughly 2-fold higher bacterial load in spleen and lung than recipients treated 
with isotype control mAb. The data clearly demonstrate the potential for efferocytosis-
dependent killing of Mtb in TB although results from in vivo challenge with RvΔnuoG [68] 
suggest that this operates mainly at later stages of TB disease (section 3.1.1).
The potential for efferocytosis to promote cross-presentation of mycobacterial antigens for 
MHC class-I- and CD1-dependent T cell activation was initially reported by Schaible et al. 
[54]. Restimulation of CD8+ T cells from donors with latent TB infection co-cultured with 
Mtb-infected macrophages required the intermediary function of naïve DCs that acquired 
antigen through efferocytosis. Similar results were achieved when naïve DCs were pulsed 
with sterile, purified vesicles derived from Mtb-infected MPs. These investigators 
subsequently demonstrated that immunization with Mtb antigen-containing vesicles can 
cross-prime naïve CD8+ T cells in vivo, which requires DC homing to lymph nodes [93]. 
They further showed that apoptotic bodies possess adjuvant activity mediated by Toll-like 
receptor (TLR)-2, and that CD4+ T cells are also stimulated in vivo. Evidence of 
efferocytotic antigen transfer to DC and cross-priming occur during TB disease was reported 
by Divangahi et al. [94] in experiments using intratracheal transfer of Mtb-infected Alox5−/− 
macrophages. Transfer of these apoptosis-prone macrophages accelerated the activation of 
TB10.4-specific CD8+ T cells and depended on apoptosis (suppressed by inhibition of 
caspase-8 and caspase-9) as well as DC. Altogether, the data suggest that the capacity of 
virulent Mtb to suppress the apoptotic death of infected macrophages could contribute to the 
delayed priming of adaptive immunity that characterizes the early host response in TB.
3.2 Necrosis of Mtb-infected macrophages
The capacity of virulent Mtb to suppress apoptosis implies an alternative exit strategy for the 
bacillus to reach the extracellular environment. The first evidence of programmed necrosis 
in Mtb was described by Duan et al. [95] using in vitro infection of human monocyte-
derived macrophages with attenuated H37Ra. They found that some infected macrophages 
died by apoptosis while others died by necrosis, which correlated with MPT. The induction

of MPT and CYPD-dependent necrosis by Mtb was subsequently shown to be inhibited by 
cyclosporin A [96] and to be more potently induced by H37Rv than H37Ra [97]. It was later 
shown that PGE2 induced by H37Ra protects against mitochondrial PTP formation and 
necrosis while lipoxin (LX)A4 induced by H37Rv and Erdman suppresses PGE2 production 
and promotes necrosis [98]. The direct antimicrobial effect of apoptosis against Mtb 
observed under in vitro culture conditions was not seen when infected cells died by necrosis. 
These data supported the concept of programmed necrosis as means for replication-
competent bacilli to exit host macrophages for spreading infection.
The apoptotic death of infected macrophages confines Mtb in membrane-bound vesicles but 
this potentially host-protective outcome is lost if the apoptotic bodies decompose before 
they are cleared by efferocytosis. Plasma membrane stability is another determinant of the 
fate of Mtb-infected macrophages. This was first revealed by experiments showing that 
virulent Mtb H37Rv inhibits the cross-linking of annexin-I bound to PtdSer, which serves to 
stabilize apoptotic membranes [99]. In a series of carefully conducted, mechanistic studies 
the capacity of Mtb-infected macrophages to repair membrane damage was shown to be a 
major determinant of an apoptotic versus necrotic demise [94, 100]. Cell fate in this model 
hinges on eicosanoid regulation of the lysosome-mediated membrane repair machinery, 
which is induced by PGE2 via the E2 receptor. Virulent H37Rv promotes elevated LXA4 
levels in macrophages, which in turn downregulates cyclooxygenase (COX)2 mRNA 
thereby reducing PGE2 and its protective effects. Infection of Alox5−/− macrophages that 
cannot synthesize LXA4 results in increased apoptosis even with H37Rv. Conversely, 
prostaglandin E synthase (Pges)−/− macrophages cannot produce PGE2 and die by necrosis 
even with H37Ra infection. These data suggest that virulent and attenuated Mtb strains 
trigger a common pathway that can terminate in apoptosis if mitochondrial and plasma 
membrane integrity is protected by PGE2, or progresses to necrosis if LXA4 predominates. 
How virulent Mtb strains induce LXA4 production and what causes the membrane injury 
counteracted by repair remains to be determined. The pore forming activity of ESAT6 is one 
suggested mechanism for LMP as well as plasma membrane microdisruptions [101]. 
Another candidate is the product of the Mtb Rv3903c gene (CpnT) whose C-terminal 
fragment induces necrotic cell death with plasma membrane disruption that is not blocked 
by a pan-caspase inhibitor (therefore not caspase-3 mediated apoptosis or caspase-1 
dependent pyroptosis) and not blocked by the RIPK1 inhibitor necrostatin-1 (therefore not 
necroptosis) [5;102].
The in vivo relevance of excess lipoxins as detrimental to TB defense is supported by 
genetic data from the mouse and zebrafish models, and in human TB patients. Alox5−/− mice 
are more resistant to aerosol TB than wild-type controls and make a more robust Th1 biased 
adaptive immune response [103]. Reminiscent of kinetics of RvΔnuoG growth in vivo, lung 
bacterial load in Alox5−/− mice is only lower than wild-type ≥21 days post-infection, 
suggesting that its protective effect is not manifest during the primarily innate phase of TB 
defense. A zebrafish mutant hypersusceptible to M. marinum mapped to the lta4h locus 
encoding leukotriene A4 hydrolase, which catalyzes the last step in LTB4 synthesis [104]. 
Zebrafish with this mutation are deficient in pro-inflammatory LTB4 and over-produce anti-
inflammatory lipoxins. Human resistance to TB and multibacillary leprosy is associated with

heterozygosity of LTA4H polymorphisms that correlate with differential production of LTB4 
[104, 105]. These data suggest that an optimal balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory 
eicosanoids protects against the adverse effects of poorly controlled bacillary replication on 
one hand and against damaging immune pathology on the other. Whether these in vivo 
phenotypes reflect differential regulation of MP apoptosis and necrosis, or some other 
effects on immunity of these pleiotropic eicosanoids remains to be determined
Inflammasome activation and the induction of pyroptosis is postulated as a defense 
mechanism that deprives rapidly growing intracellular bacterial pathogens of a growth 
niche. Many pathogenic bacteria have mechanisms to subvert this response [55]. Slow 
growing Mtb requires the intracellular niche of MPs, so its replication would be restricted 
the rapid induction of programmed necrosis of its host cells. In this regard, the Mtb Rv3364c 
gene product was reported to suppress caspase-1 and pyroptosis in macrophages [106].
Lytic viruses induce host cell necrosis after an optimal period of replication to a “burst size” 
intracellular load. Similar dynamics were suggested for Mtb, which triggers an atypical 
necrosis subroutine in macrophages at intracellular loads in the range of 20-40 bacilli 
[106,108]. Dying cells exhibit early apoptotic features of PtdSer externalization and nuclear 
pyknosis, but progress within hours to necrosis without nuclear fragmentation or apoptotic 
vesicle formation. This death is caspase-independent and does not require pro-apoptotic 
Bcl2 family proteins. This death differs from the necrosis of bioenergetic collapse by the 
absence of osmotic swelling, and it differs from pyroptosis and pyronecrosis, being 
independent of caspase-1 and cathepsin B [108]. It is not inhibited by cyclosporin A and is 
therefore distinct from CYDP-dependent necrosis [107]. Death is initiated upon LMP, 
followed by lipolytic attack on mitochondrial, nuclear and outer cell membranes. It could 
therefore be classified as a form of lysosomal cell death but is atypical in its dependence on 
lipase more than protease activities. The bacterial determinants of this death mechanism 
remain undefined, but it requires one or more genes of the PhoPR regulon since a ΔphoPR 
mutant of H37Rv fails to cause LMP or kill macrophages at MOI 25 [108]. In contrast, BCG 
and a defined RvΔRD1ΔespA mutant lacking the ESX-1 secretion system are fully capable 
of provoking necrosis if introduced at high MOI. Both of those strains are capable of only 
limited intracellular replication, so this pro-necrotic phenotype is not evident when they are 
introduced at low MOI. The dynamics of Mtb burden per cell in MPs after aerosol challenge 
of mice fits a burst size model of necrosis [109]. Neutrophils are the predominant 
phagocytes harboring Mtb cell during periods of unrestricted bacillary replication [109, 
110]. This is consistent with the inflammatory nature of necrotic cell death which recruits 
neutrophils and absence of the “stay away” signal lactoferrin that is associated with 
apoptosis [13, 88].
3.3 Programmed death of other myeloid cells in TB
Macrophages have been the focus of research on cell death in TB but data from the mouse 
model and human TB indicate that DC and neutrophils are important and in some 
circumstances the predominant phagocytes harboring Mtb in vivo [109-111]. Neutrophils are 
readily identified by common laboratory methods but distinguishing between tissue-resident 
macrophages, recruited macrophages, monocytes, and DC is more challenging and some

have questioned whether these cell types represent distinct lineages or simply alternative and 
plastic phenotypes a common monocytic progenitor [112-114]. Recognizing this 
controversy, we will refer to DC as defined by the authors of cited publications who used 
generally accepted methods to isolate and phenotype these cells.
The limited literature on the fate of Mtb-infected DC reflects many of the same challenges to 
interpreting the often contradictory literature on macrophage cell death. An early study 
compared the activation and survival of C56BL/6 mouse bone marrow derived DC 
challenged with Erdman at MOI 10 [115]. Immature DC matured in response to infection 
and survived >48 hours but (unlike macrophages) were unable to kill intracellular bacilli 
even with IFN-γ activation. The authors noted that high rates of cell death (trypan staining) 
in DC and macrophages at later time points. More recently, Ryan et al. [116] reported that 
human peripheral blood monocyte-derived DC undergo necrosis (PI staining) that was 
caspase-independent (not rescued by Q-VD-Oph) and lacked nuclear fragmentation but did 
feature DNA cleavage (nucleosomal particle ELISA) despite no activation of the 
executioner caspases 3 and 7. The induction of DC death required live bacilli and was 
triggered by H37Rv and H37a. In contrast, a study using bone marrow-derived DC from 
C57BL/6 mice and H37Rv (MOI 10) described activation of inflammasome and executioner 
caspases 3/7 with along with apoptosis (defined by TUNEL) but no necrosis (defined by 
adenylate kinase release) [117]. Based on these and other data the authors concluded that 
Mtb induces DC apoptosis dependent on Esx-1 but does not cause pyroptosis or 
pyronecrosis. We are left to conclude that Mtb can infect and activate DC and that apoptotic 
or necrotic death might ensue depending on variables likely to include the origin, subtype 
and activation state of the DCs prior to infection. Necrotic death of DC could plausibly 
delay immune priming while an apoptotic death might facilitate priming. These are 
important considerations since there is substantial evidence that DC are the major 
phagocytes that convey viable bacilli to lung-draining lymph nodes for adaptive immune 
priming [110, 118]. The kinetics of these events has a major impact on the subsequent 
outcome of disease at least in mice [119].
3.3.1 Neutrophil cell death in TB—Much recent interest has focused on the roles that 
neutrophils play in TB [120]. A fascinating dynamic has been proposed for the early events 
following inhalation of Mtb, where neutrophils accelerate immune priming by undergoing 
infection-induced apoptosis and passing bacilli to migratory DC in a manner that facilitates 
DC trafficking to the lymph node [68, 121]. Evidence that virulent Mtb strains inhibit 
neutrophil apoptosis and thereby delay immune priming was obtained using the pro-
apoptotic Rv/ΔnuoG mutant [68]. In contrast, Mtb H37Rv was reported to trigger apoptosis 
of human peripheral blood neutrophils that was dependent on TLR2 and independent of 
TNF-α [122]. Adding complexity to this interaction, comparison of two different clinical 
Mtb isolates identified one strain that strongly induced human neutrophil apoptosis while the 
other strain did not induce apoptosis [123].
While neutrophils may exert a host protective function as an early event in TB, they also 
appear to be important mediators of tissue injury at later stages of disease if they are present 
in excess as occurs with poorly controlled Mtb infection in susceptible hosts [65, 124, 125]. 
Neutrophil lifespan is prolonged in I/St mice with TB, which may be a factor in the

increased neutrophil accumulation and lung damage seen in that highly susceptible mouse 
strain [126]. NETs may contribute to lung tissue damage [47] and ETosis is another fate that 
has been described for human neutrophils and macrophages infected with Mtb in vitro [46, 
127], in the mice with poorly controlled TB in vivo [109]. While NETs exert antimicrobial 
activity against a range of bacteria, this activity does not extend to Mtb [127]. Release of 
traps by human macrophages is accelerated by IFN-γ [46] but NETs were identified in lung 
lavage of IFN-γ−/− mice with TB [109]. The diverse fates of Mtb-infected neutrophils in TB 
feature in the host-protective and damage-inducing roles that these cells play in TB 
pathogenesis.
3.4 Translation opportunities
Manipulation of apoptosis in the context of vaccination holds the most promise compared 
other therapeutic goals for early translation of knowledge about cell death in TB. The pro-
apoptotic recombinant strain BCGΔureC::hly+ expresses the pore-forming listeriolysin of L. 
monocytogenes and lacks urease C to ensure an optimal intraphagosomal pH for listeriolysin 
activity. This strain is more immunogenic than the parental BCG for type 1 responses and 
uniquely induces type 17 as well [128, 129]. These results are attributable to exploitation of 
the the efferocytotic pathway discussed in section 3.1.2. The human vaccine candidate based 
on this technology, VPM1002, demonstrated safety in a phase I clinical trial [130] and a 
phase II trial is currently underway.
Opportunities for adjunctive TB therapies that directly enhance apoptosis are less obvious 
and could risk killing necessary cells (e.g T cells) and/or generating an excess of apoptotic 
bodies at risk for secondary necrosis. Nonetheless, a more comprehensive understanding of 
how different fates for MPs and neutrophils influence the effectiveness of host defense and 
the quantity and quality of immune pathology in TB is vital to understanding TB 
pathogenesis and new targets for treatment and diagnosis.
3.5 Summary of cell death in TB
The diverse outcomes and conclusions of published studies on cell death in TB (Table 1) 
reflect differences in host species and strains, mycobacterial species and strains, cell types 
and their activation state, conditions of infection, and the likelihood that multiple cell death 
programs can be simultaneously activated in cells stressed by Mtb infection. These variables 
determine which fate predominates in particular experimental systems. Results from many 
studies support the concept that apoptosis of macrophages and neutrophils contributes 
mainly host-protective effects, while macrophage necrosis is mainly linked to adverse 
outcomes. However, these are clearly not absolute paradigms since apoptosis can promote 
disseminated infection and accelerated necrosis might limit intracellular bacillary 
replication.
Given the complex interplay of multiple host and bacterial mechanisms to promote or 
prevent cell death, more research with in vivo approaches is needed to identify what truly 
matters in TB disease. A comprehensive model must also integrate a multitude of common 
factors that are often excluded in reductionist experimental systems. Examples include the 
effects of metabolic disorders like diabetes and hyperlipidemia where methylglyoxal,

oxidized LDL cholesterol, or an excess of intracellular free cholesterol that promote 
apoptosis or necrosis [131, 132]; cytokines, such IFN-γ that promotes survival of 
macrophages at low MOI but accelerates necrosis with high bacillary loads [133, 134]; and 
apoptosis induced by CTL. The best studies will confirm unequivocally that cells thought be 
to dying are indeed dying and ideally use multiple unrelated assays if making a case for one 
particular fate.
4. Overview of Autophagy
Autophagy (“self-eating”) is an evolutionarily conserved pathway in cell biology that serves 
to control cytoplasmic content including organelles, to recycle chemical resources in bulk, 
and to regulate cellular functions under basal conditions and in response to variety of 
stresses. Macroautophagy refers to the isolation of cytoplasmic content by the formation of 
lipid bilayer vacuoles called autophagosomes which fuse with lysosomes to degrade their 
cargoes. Macroautophagy is the autophagic process most relevant to TB and will be simply 
called “autophagy” in this review. Other autophagic processes such as microautophagy 
(direct sequestration of cytoplasm within lysosomes) and chaperone-mediated autophagy 
that targets proteins with a specific signal sequence for degradation are reviewed elsewhere 
[135].
Autophagy is controlled primarily by Atg proteins, a family with more than 30 members that 
were revealed in screens for yeast mutants defective for autophagy [136]. The Atg family 
and other proteins operate in a complex conjugation cascade; many of the interactions and 
multiple functions of these players are incompletely understood, particularly in mammalian 
cell systems. A simplified scheme for autophagy includes four subgroups of core proteins 
involved in three major steps of vesicle formation. Autophagy is initiated by the Atg1/ULK1 
complex comprising Unc-51 like autophagy activating kinases 1 and 2 (ULK1/2), Atg13, 
FIP2000, and Atg101 [137]. Initiation is under negative and positive regulation by mTOR 
and AMP kinase (AMPK), respectively, as well as mTOR-independent pathways. The 
Vps34 complex comprised of the class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase Vps34, Beclin 1 
(homolog of yeast Atg6), p150 (Vps15 in yeast) and Atg14, also participates in autophagy 
induction. Together, these two complexes promote vesicle nucleation with formation of the 
“omegasome”, a cup-shaped protrusion from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although 
other vesicle nucleation sources have been described, ER is the best understood. An ensuing 
conjugation cascade directs formation of a “phagophore” from repurposed ER, building a 
double-layered “isolation membrane” on the ring-like base of omegasome. Elongation of 
this membrane requires two ubiquitination-like reactions and two protein complexes. The 
first involves conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein Atg12 to Atg5, which then form a 
complex with Atg16L. The second reaction follows cleavage of microtubule associated 
protein-1 light chain-3 (LC3), yielding cytosolic LC3-I (Atg8) that is converted to LC3-II 
through conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine, tethering LC3-II to the isolation 
membrane. Through mechanisms not yet fully defined, these complexes facilitate expansion 
and bending of the isolation membrane. Autophagosome formation is completed upon 
closure of the isolation membrane, sequestering the targeted cytosolic constituents. In the 
final step, mediated by SNARE proteins, the autophagosome fuses with a lysosome to form 
an “autolysosome” where digestion of the sequestered vacuolar contents proceeds [138].

The ratio of LC3-II to LC3-I on immunoblots and a punctate as opposed to cytosolic 
distribution of LC3 identified by fluorescence microscopy are commonly used as assays to 
quantify autophagy. They are useful but can be misleading; alternative measures of 
autophagic flux may be required to distinguish between accelerated autophagosome 
biogenesis versus reduced turnover [139]. In the related but distinct pathway called LC3-
associated phagocytosis (LAP), LC3-II is recruited to conventional, single-membrane 
phagosomes and promotes their fusion with lysosomes. LAP has been implicated in the 
clearance of apoptotic and necrotic corpses among other settings [140].
Autophagy proceeds at basal levels to maintain the homeostasis of unstressed cells and is 
further activated by a variety of factors including starvation, hypoxia, extremes of pH or 
temperature, growth factor withdrawal, oxidative stress, ER stress, and infection [141-143]. 
Targeting signals (e.g. externalization of cardiolipin to the limiting membrane of damaged 
mitochondria [144]) initiate autophagosome formation, which is subject to a wide range of 
regulatory influences, some dependent and some independent of mTOR and AMPK [145]. 
Among its many functions, autophagy provides a mechanism to counteract the various 
strategies employed by intracellular pathogens to use host cells to their advantage. The 
detection and autophagic destruction of intracellular pathogens, also called xenophagy, has 
been linked to host defense against certain viruses (e.g. HIV and influenza A virus), bacteria 
(e.g. Shigella, Salmonella, Group A Streptococcus, and Listeria), fungi (e.g. Candida and 
Cryptococcus), and protozoa (e.g. Toxoplasma) [146-148]. Conversely, certain intracellular 
pathogens subvert autophagy to promote infection [149]. Xenophagy plays an integral role 
in innate and adaptive immunity to infection with Mtb that is the focus of this review.
5. Autophagy in TB
As noted in section 1, the capacity of Mtb to inhibit phagosome biogenesis and survive 
inside macrophages that eliminate most other phagocytosed bacteria is an essential virulence 
mechanism. Despite this countermeasure, a proportion of internalized bacilli are directed to 
acidified compartments and this is accelerated by macrophage activating factors such as 
IFN-γ. The role of autophagy in this successful outcome was first identified by Gutierrez et 
al. in 2004 [150]. They reported that induction of autophagy in Mtb-infected macrophages 
by starvation or by treatment with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin delivered bacilli to 
phagolysosomes and increased co-localization of Mtb with LC3 and Beclin 1. They also 
found that autophagy was induced by treatment with IFN-γ or transfection with the IFN-γ 
effector LRG-47. Since that initial report, a substantial body of evidence has established the 
major role that autophagy plays in TB defense.
5.1 Targeting Mtb for autophagic elimination
Following receptor-mediated phagocytosis, most Mtb bacilli reside in early endosome-like 
vacuoles that resist acidification or fusion with lysosomes. This niche is permissive for some 
movement of macromolecules to and from the cytoplasm, to other vesicular compartments, 
and even the extracellular environment [151-153]. Such bidirectional transfer is required for 
Mtb to acquire nutrients and manipulate host cell functions but also confers vulnerability to 
host defense [154, 155]. The LMP generated at least in part by ESAT6 (section 3.1.1) 
enables detection of PAMPs by innate cytosolic sensors. Genomic DNA of Mtb activates the

STING-dependent cytosolic pathway, leading to ubiquitination of bacilli and their delivery 
to autophagosomes in a process dependent on the ubiquitin-autophagy receptors p62 and 
NDP52, and the serine/threonine protein kinase TBK1 [154]. Data from the zebrafish model 
of M. marinum infection corroborated the involvement of RD1 and STING in autophagic 
defense against mycobacteria, and further identified the participation of the autophagy 
modulator DRAM1 in this response [156]. The contribution of autophagy to TB defense in 
mammals was demonstrated by the increased susceptibility of Lyz-Cre-Atg5fl/fl mice with 
targeted deletion of Atg5 in myeloid cells [154, 157].
Redundant pathways for innate recognition and autophagic targeting of intracellular Mtb 
have been identified. The ubiquitin ligase Parkin, which mediates the autophagic elimination 
of dysfunctional mitochondria (mitophagy), was shown to play a critical role in the 
colocalization of ubiquitin and Mtb in macrophages [158]. The dual role of Parkin in 
mitophagy and xenophagy for intracellular bacteria is unsurprising since mitochondria 
evolved from intracellular prokaryotes. Once tagged with ubiquitin, bacteria may be targeted 
by cytoplasmic sequestasome (p62/SQSTM1)-like receptors (SLRs). By virtue of its 
ubiquitin-associated domain and LC3 interaction region, p62 serves as an adaptor bridging 
ubiquitinated bacilli and LC3 on the preautophagosome [146]. A role of p62 in recruiting an 
E3 ligase to ubiquitinate Mtb has also been proposed but the precise targets for 
ubiquitination on bacterial cells and the full spectrum of mediators for this conjugation 
reactions are incompletely defined [159].
Innate cytosolic receptors bind PAMPS, providING surveillance for intracellular infection. 
The NLR subfamily receptor NOD2 binds bacterial peptidoglycans like muramyl dipeptide 
and is activated in macrophages infected with Mtb [160]. Signaling downstream of NOD2 in 
Mtb-infected macrophages induces nuclear translocation of NF-κβ, resulting in increased 
expression of the autophagy-related genes IRGM, LC3, and ATG16L1, the antimicrobial 
peptide human cathelicidin (hCAP-18/LL-37), and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, 
IL-6, and TNF-α [161].
The capture of Mtb in autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with lysosomes delivers 
bacilli to a hostile, acidified compartment replete with hydrolytic enzymes and free radicals 
of oxygen and nitrogen. Microbicidal activity against Mtb in autolysomes was recently 
shown involve another role for p62, namely the delivery of ribosomal precursor and other 
ubiquitinated proteins from the cytosol to autolysosomes where they are cleaved to generate 
“neo-antimicrobial peptides” [162]. Whether the cytosolic precursor proteins are delivered 
directly to autolysosomes containing Mtb or if killing depends on subsequent fusion of 
peptide-containing vesicles with Mtb-containing phagosomes remains to be determined.
5.2 Regulation of autophagy in TB
Following inhalation of Mtb by naïve mice, lung bacterial burden rises in a log linear 
manner for ~3 weeks until bacterial replication is curtailed by adaptive immunity and 
particularly IFN-γ produced mainly by Th1 cells [163]. Inducible nitric oxide synthase was 
considered the major host-protective macrophage response to IFN-γ activation but it is now 
clear that accelerated autophagic flux is another important effect of IFN-γ [150]. Host-
protective effects of IFN-γ are mediated in part by members of the immunity-related GTPase

family (IRG proteins, also called p47 GTPases). Two pathways for autophagy induction by 
IFN-γ have been reported. One involves Irgm1, a STAT1-dependent IRG previously called 
Lrg47 (IRGM in humans) [164]. The alternative IFN-γ autophagy pathway is independent of 
STAT1 but requires JAK 1/2, PI3K, and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 
[165]. The Th1 cytokine TNF-α also induces autophagy and there is at least indirect 
evidence for this effect in Mtb-infected macrophages [166]. In contrast, the Th2 cytokines 
IL-4 and IL-13 inhibit autophagy at least in in mice [167]. There is evidence for and against 
autophagy induction by Mtb in the absence of exogenous activators like IFN-γ, and different 
mycobacterial strains may be high or low inducers [168]. Indeed, the suppression of 
autophagy may be a virulence mechanism of the bacillus (section 5.4). Infection is 
associated with increased mTOR activity, indicating that innate activation autophagy by 
mycobacteria is independent of mTOR [168].
Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling complements IFN-γ for Mtb clearance by a pathway 
that may be highly significant in humans but is absent in mice. Shin et al. [169] reported that 
stimulation of TLR2/1 by the Mtb lipoprotein LpqH induces autophagy in human monocyte 
cultures supplemented with the pro-vitamin D hormone calcifediol (25-dihydroxyvitamin 
D3) [169]. Their data support a model where signaling by TLR2/1 and CD14 induces Ca2+ 
influx through PLC-γ activation. Calcium flux results in AMPK phosphorylation and 
activation of p38 MAPK that in turn upregulates VD3 1A hydroxylase, which catalyzes the 
hydroxylation of calcifediol to biologically active calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3). 
Calcitriol binding to VDR induces expression of cathelicidin that increases the expression 
Beclin-1 and Atg5 and promotes autophagic flux [170,171]. The antimicrobial activity of 
IFN-γ activated human macrophages requires a sufficient level of calcifediol, linking the 
VDR-stimulated autophagic pathway the protective effect of IFN-γ in human TB [172]. The 
VDR pathway is not required for autophagy induction by rapamycin or starvation [172]. 
Discovery of the VDR pathway and its role in TB defense stimulated renewed interest in the 
therapeutic potential of vitamin D in human TB (section 5.6).
A number of other mediators and pathways have been linked to autophagy induction in Mtb-
infected macrophages. Given the links between intracellular and cell surface innate receptors 
and autophagy, it is unsurprising that the TLR4 ligand LPS and IL-1β (via Myd88 and 
TBK1) have been linked to the autophagic elimination of Mtb [173,174]. The growing list 
autophagy activators in Mtb-infected MPs includes the scavenger protein Apoptosis 
Inhibitor of Macrophages (a target of liver X receptor activation) that was also shown to 
inhibit apoptosis of THP1 cells challenged with Mtb at low MOI [175]. Extracellular ATP (a 
DAMP discussed in section 2) promotes autophagy via P2X7 receptor, linking autophagy 
induction and the host response to necrosis [60]. MicroRNA-155 has been linked to TB 
defense in several reports including evidence that its induction is dependent on ESAT6, that 
it regulates apoptosis of M. bovis BCG-infected macrophages, and that it accelerates 
autophagy and the killing of intracellular Mtb by suppressing the Ras homolog Rheb 
[176-178]. It is likely that a wider array of pathways and mediators regulating xenophagy in 
Mtb-infected MPs will be identified in the future. Prioritizing these pathways in terms of 
their protective effects against TB disease in vivo will help direct translational research on 
harnessing autophagy for TB treatment (section 5.6).

5.3 Autophagy-mediated regulation of immunity in TB
Autophagy participates in TB defense beyond its effector function to kill intracellular bacilli. 
Since Mtb inhibits conventional phagosome biogenesis, its capture and degradation in 
autolysosomes provides an opportunity to generate peptides for loading onto MHC class II 
molecules. This outcome was demonstrated by Seto et al. [159] in murine bone marrow 
derived DC and DC2.4 cells infected with Mtb Erdman. The recruitment of MHC II 
followed the capture of ubiquitinated bacilli in autophagosomes and fusion with lysosomes. 
In contrast to Erdman, BCG was not ubiquitinated in DC. This is consistent with a 
requirement for ESAT6 (which is deleted from BCG) to cause LMP. Treating BCG-infected 
DC with rapamycin, however, increases colocalization of bacilli with autophagosomes and 
enhances the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of BCG [179].
Autophagy also functions to modulate inflammation through targeted degradation of 
cytokines such and TNF-α and IL-1β, and by preventing the accumulation of damaged 
mitochondria that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome via ROS and mtDNA [180-184]. The 
effect of this regulation to limit inflammation in TB was reported by the Castillo et al. [157]. 
Pulmonary TB in autophagy-deficient Atg5fl/fl LysM-Cre+ mice challenged with a low 
aerosol dose of Mtb H37Rv featured increased bacterial burden compared to wild-type 
controls but also increased neutrophilic inflammation with tissue necrosis, Th17 skewing, 
and elevated levels of IL-1α, IL-12, IL-17, and CXCL1. The authors concluded that the 
host-protective effects of autophagy in TB include modulation of the inflammatory response 
to infection. Bonilla et al. [185] similarly reported increased inflammation and bacillary load 
in autophagy-deficient Atg7−/− LysM-Cre+ mice challenged with a high intranasal dose of 
BCG. Cytokine levels were not reported and the authors attributed susceptibility to 
accelerated phagocytosis of mycobacteria due to increased surface expression of the 
scavenger (and Mtb) receptors MARCO and MSR1. An excess of p62 in the Atg7−/− 
macrophages bound KEAP1, a suppressor of the transcription factor Nrf2, resulting in 
increased expression of Nrf2 regulated genes including scavenger receptors. Parenthetically, 
these authors observed no difference in autophagy induction between BCG (lacking ESAT6 
and the Esx-1 secretion system) and Mtb H37Rv.
5.4 Evasion of autophagy by Mtb
Evasion of the vesicular trafficking systems that deliver most phagocytosed bacilli to 
acidified phagolysosomes is a key to Mtb virulence and is mediated through inhibition of 
Ca2+ flux and Rab family GTPases [1]. Similarly, the bacillus has evolved countermeasures 
to evade xenophagy. Zhang et al. [186] reported that ectopic expression of ESAT6/CFP10 
inhibited autophagosome formation in with H37Rv-infected RAW264.7 cells, along with 
reduced expression of Atg8 and other autophagy-related genes. Romangoli et al. [187] 
compared autophagic flux in human monocyte-derived DC infected with H37Rv, H37Ra or 
BGG, finding inhibition of autophagosome-lysosome fusion only in DC infected with 
H37Rv. The capacity to inhibit autophagic flux was restored by complementation of BCG 
with the Esx-1 region from Mtb and by complementation of H37Ra with the PhoP gene. 
They also showed that the Esx-1 dependent autophagic block exerted by H37Rv could be 
overcome with rapamycin.

The Mtb Eis protein, which inhibits infection-induced macrophage cell death through 
acetylation of DUSP16/MKP-7 and downregulation of JNK-induced ROS generation 
(section 3.1.1) inhibits autophagy as well [76]. Macrophage cytolysis triggered by RvΔeis 
was attributed to autophagic cell death but the relationship between autophagy and 
cytotoxicity is controversial since autophagy is commonly activated as a prosurvival 
response in stressed cells that may succumb to one or another subroutine of programmed 
death [51]. The Mtb cell wall component lipoarabinomannan is another virulence factor 
associated with autophagy inhibition. Phagocytosis of lipoarabinomannan-coated latex 
meads by RAW264.7 cells inhibited the accumulation of autophagosomes while beads 
coated with E. coli LPS or phophatidyl-myo-inositol of M. smegmatis had no suppressive 
effect [188]. Further research will likely reveal more host and pathogen countermeasures 
regulating the predominantly host-protective effects of autophagy in TB.
5.5 Genetic associations of autophagy and TB
A body of genetic evidence supports the relevance of autophagy as a biologically significant 
host defense mechanism in TB. Mice with targeted mutations in the autophagy-related genes 
Atg5, Atg7, and Irgm1 all demonstrate increased susceptibility to Mtb [154,157,185,189]. In 
a genome-wide siRNA screen in human (THP-1) cells infected with Mtb H37Rv or a several 
clinical isolates of different clades, Kumar et al. [190] identified 275 genes functionally 
involved in control of infection. Seventy-four of these genes defined essential components 
active against the spectrum of different Mtb isolates and within that subset, more than half 
were associated with the regulation of autophagy.
Several studies identified association of polymorphic alleles in autophagy-related genes with 
TB susceptibility or resistance. The complexity of these interactions is highlighted by 
several studies investigating polymorphisms in IRGM. The -261TT allele of IRGM was 
negatively associated with TB in a cohort from the west African country of Ghana but this 
applied only to disease caused by Mtb strains of the Euro-American lineage [191]. The 
-261TT allele (rs9637876) is predicted to eliminate binding sites for inhibitory transcription 
factors and therefore increase IGRM expression. In the same Ghanaian population, this 
allele was not associated with protection from TB caused by M. africanum or M. bovis. 
Several other studies variously identified associations of polymorphic IRGM alleles with 
protection or susceptibility to TB in African-American, Iranian, Chinese and Korean 
populations [191-194]. In some cases opposing effects on TB susceptibility were associated 
with the same allele in different populations. Analysis of 22 polymorphisms in 14 autophagy 
genes in an Indonesian population found an association of TB disease with polymorphisms 
in LAMP1 and MTOR but statistical significance was lost after correction for multiple 
comparisons [195]. These divergent associations may reflect differences in host genetic 
background, locally prevalent Mtb strains and/or environmental influences but regardless of 
the effect the data clearly link the IRGM gene to TB defense.
5.6 Therapeutic opportunities
The goal of TB elimination is hampered by challenges of compliance with prolonged multi-
drug antibiotic regimens and the emergence of drug-resistant Mtb strains. This has 
stimulated interest in the potential for host-directed therapies (HDTs) to amplify endogenous

effector mechanisms and accelerate the response to antituberculous chemotherapy [196]. 
Among the pathways that may be amenable to this approach, autophagy is an attractive 
candidate based on its anti-mycobacterial and anti-inflammatory effects in TB. Interestingly, 
the first line anti-TB drugs isoniazid and pyrazinamide were reported to induce autophagy 
selectively in Mtb-infected but not uninfected macrophages [196]. Activation of autophagy 
was dependent on ROS and attributed to bacteria-derived hydroxyl radicals produced in 
response to these drugs. In the fly model of M. marinum infection, these authors showed that 
that the anti-mycobacterial activity of the antibiotics depended at least in part on autophagy. 
The anti-protozoal drug nitazoxanide and its metabolite tizoxanide inhibit mammalian target 
of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and stimulate autophagy by a mechanism 
attributed to suppression of the quinone oxidoreductase NQO1 [197]. This drug also kills 
replicating and non-replicating Mtb in broth culture but its antimicrobial activity was 
greatest in Mtb-infected macrophages and it was more potent than rapamycin. Drugs with 
dual antibiotic and autophagy-stimulating effects may particularly attractive candidates for 
TB treatment.
The best studied non-antibiotic effector of autophagy in the context of TB is vitamin D 
(section 5.2). Low serum levels of calcifediol are associated with increased TB susceptibility 
and adverse treatment outcomes in different geographic locations [198-203]. None of these 
studies established causation, and a cautionary note comes from a case-control study in 
Greenland where serum calcifediol levels below and above 75-140 nmol/l was associated 
with increased odds for TB [202]. Two trials have tested vitamin D supplementation in TB. 
The first of these was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 
Guinea-Bissau [204]. Adult patients starting TB treatment received 100,000 IU of 
cholecalciferol on enrollment and after 5 and 8 months of inclusion. Vitamin D treatment 
did not reduce the clinical TB severity score (primary outcome) or 12-month mortality. The 
second study enrolled, new smear-positive adult pulmonary TB patients in the United 
Kingdom who had corrected serum calcium concentration >2.65 mmol/l for randomization 
to receive four oral doses of 2.5 mg cholecalciferol or placebo given at baseline and then 14, 
28 and 42 days after starting TB treatment. Supplementation was shown to increase serum 
calcifediol concentrations in the patients receiving intensive-phase TB treatment but did not 
significantly influence the time to sputum culture conversion (primary endpoint) across the 
whole cohort. Sputum culture conversion was, however, accelerated by vitamin D 
supplementation in the subgroup of participants having the tt genotype of the TaqI VDR 
polymorphism. Data from that trial were re-analyzed a separate publication that included 
only patients who fulfilled per-protocol analysis criteria [205]. In this patient group, vitamin 
D supplementation accelerated sputum smear conversion and resolution of lymphopenia and 
monocytosis, and it suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines in the circulation and in cultures 
of Mtb antigen-stimulated whole blood.
Some drugs already in clinical use for other indications can stimulate autophagy and 
therefore might be considered for adjunctive therapy in TB. Rapamycin is used for 
immunosuppression in organ transplantation and to inhibit endothelial proliferation on 
coronary stents [206,207]. It potently suppresses mTOR via inhibition of mTORC1 [208]. 
Systemic immunosuppression is clearly an unacceptable effect for TB patients but this might 
Moraco and Kornfeld

be mitigated by delivery of rapamycin in inhalable particles [209]. Alternative drugs with 
less troubling side effects include statins that where shown to have activity against Mtb in 
vitro and in vivo [201,211]. A high-throughput screen for small molecules that restrict Mtb 
growth in macrophages identified activity for gefitinib and fluoxetine, both of which also 
stimulate autophagy [166]. Of these, gefitinib was tested in mice and restricted Mtb growth 
following aerosol infection of BALB/c mice.
Many other approved drugs are known to induce autophagy although their application to TB 
has not yet been reported. Among these, the oral anti-diabetic biguanide metformin is an 
attractive candidate. Metformin activates AMPK and stimulates autophagy as well as cell 
death in malignant cells and has attracted considerable interest in for cancer treatment [212]. 
Metformin also appears to stimulate autophagy by an AMPK-independent mechanism 
linked to increased expression of REDD1, which is a negative regulator of mTOR [213]. 
Zhang et al. [214] identified eight small molecule regulators of autophagy using an image-
based high-throughput screen. Three of the compounds are U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration-approved anti-psychotic drugs, three are Ca2+ current inhibitors approved 
for cardiovascular indications (niguldipine, nicardipine, amiodarone), and one (loperamide) 
is approved for treatment of diarrhea. None of these compounds modulated mTOR 
phosphorylation, indicating that they induce autophagy through pathways distinct from 
rapamycin. Minoxidil and clonidine were identified in another screen for autophagy 
enhancers restricted to drugs previously used in humans without major side effects [215]. As 
more autophagy-promoting drugs are evaluated against Mtb it will be interesting to learn if 
particular pathways offer better efficacy advantages as HDTs for TB. At the same time it 
will be necessary and informative to test whether candidate HDTs adversely influence the 
balance of protective versus damaging immunity through mechanisms like mTOR 
inhibition. A cautionary, if unrelated, note is provided by the experience with glyburide in 
patients infected with Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis). Koh et al. [216] reported 
that glyburide improved survival in diabetic melioidosis patients independent of glycemic 
control; an effect attributed to inhibition of inflammasome assembly. A contrasting effect of 
glyburide was later reported by Liu et al. [217] who found higher rates of septic 
complications in melioidosis patients treated with (unspecified) sulfonylureas and 
suppressive effects of glyburide on inflammatory cytokine production by peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells treated with B. pseudomallei antigen.
5.6 Conclusions
Autophagy provides a means for infected MPs to overcome the key virulence mechanism of 
Mtb; inhibition of phagosome biogenesis. Its contributions to TB defense include killing of 
intracellular bacilli, promoting MHC class II restricted antigen presentation, and modulating 
the inflammatory responses that cause tissue damage and the clinical manifestations of TB 
disease. Phagocytes use several cytosolic sensors recognize intracellular bacilli and tag them 
for destruction. Further research will likely identify additional cytosolic and cell surface 
receptors involved in the detection of Mtb and stimulation of autophagic flux. Autophagy is 
managed by a complex regulatory network with evidence of mTOR-dependent and 
independent pathways linked to TB defense. The relative contribution of these different 
pathways to positive outcomes in TB remains to be determined. Such knowledge might be

leveraged for the optimal design of host-directed therapies that stimulate autophagy. The 
exciting translational opportunities for autophagy in TB will also be advanced by better 
understanding of the countermeasures that have evolved in the bacillus to escape detection 
and inhibit autolysosome biogenesis.

HIGHLIGHTS
Cell Death and Autophagy in TB (Moraco and Kornfeld)
•
Phagocytes infected with M. tuberculosis may undergo apoptosis or necrosis
•
Apoptosis promotes immune priming and kills bacilli but can spread infection
•
Apoptosis can also facilitate spread of M. tuberculosis infection
•
Autophagy sends M. tuberculosis to acidified lysosomes and regulates 
inflammation
•
Apoptosis and autophagy may be leveraged for TB prevention and treatment
