Abstract
This study examined the efficacy of a multimodule parenting intervention, “My Baby & Me,” that 
began prenatally and continued until children reached 2.5 years of age. The intervention targeted 
specific parenting skills designed to alter trajectories of maternal and child development. Of 361 
high-risk mothers (193 adolescents, 168 adults) enrolled across 4 states, half were randomly 
assigned to the high-intensity (HI) home visitation coaching program (55 sessions), and half to a 
low-intensity (LI) condition that included monthly phone calls from a coach, printed informational 
materials, and community resource referrals. Videotaped observations of mother–child play were 
coded at 5 time points for multiple maternal and child behaviors and skills. Compared to mothers 
in the LI group, mothers in the HI group showed higher levels of contingent responsiveness, higher 
quality verbal stimulation, and more verbal scaffolding by 30 months, with higher levels of 
warmth and greater decreases in physical intrusiveness and negativity when their children were 24 
months. By 30 months, children in the HI group showed more rapid increases and higher levels of 
engagement with the environment, expressive language skills, and social engagement, as well as 
more complex toy play and fewer problem behaviors than those in the LI group. Gains in maternal 
responsive behaviors mediated the effects of the intervention on child outcomes. Results were 
comparable for adolescent and adult mothers. A strong theoretical framework, consistent focus on 
maternal responsiveness, high dosage, and trusting relationships with coaches are thought to 
explain the positive outcomes.

Young children living in poverty are at substantially increased risk for poor developmental 
and adverse behavioral outcomes (e.g., Shonkoff & Phillips, 2000) as well as increased risk 
for abuse and neglect (e.g., Slack et al., 2011). However, the quality of the parent–child 
relationship, including attentiveness to the infant’s needs and responsive support for the 
toddler’s emerging desire to explore and gain independence, can moderate this risk and 
improve children’s developmental outcomes (Landry, Smith, Swank, Assel, & Vellet, 2001). 
A number of home visiting interventions have been developed over the past 2 decades to try 
to improve outcomes for these vulnerable children. Examples of such programs include: 
Parents as Teachers (Wagner, Cameto, & Gerlach-Downie, 1996), Healthy Families America 
(Caldera et al., 2007), Nurse–Family Partnership (Olds, 2006), and the Infant Health and 
Development Program (Ramey et al., 1992). The content of these programs has typically 
included provision of information about parenting, assistance with accessing community 
services and a medical home for the child, providing emotional support for the family, 
and/or teaching parents educational activities to do with their children. Such broad-based 
programs have yielded mixed results (e.g., Howard & Brooks-Gunn, 2009; Silovsky et al., 
Guttentag et al.

2011). Those that have included a focus on enhancing the parent–child relationship show 
more promising results than those that focus primarily on providing child health care, basic 
developmental information, or other community resource support (Kearney, York, & 
Deatrick, 2000). Results have included changes in parent attitudes and behaviors (Fergusson, 
Grant, Horwood, & Ridder, 2005) and, for some, improvement in children’s developmental 
outcomes (e.g., Olds, 2006). There is usually an assumption that changes in parent behaviors 
were the mechanism responsible for any child changes. However, there is often limited 
information reported about changes in specific aspects of responsive parenting in relation to 
specific changes in children’s skills.
There is also growing evidence of positive results from short-term interventions specifically 
targeting parents’ responsive interaction skills with their young children. Such studies with 
middle-class families have documented positive effects on parents’ responsiveness skills and 
young children’s social–emotional outcomes (e.g., Van Zeijl et al., 2006). Another group of 
experimental studies has found improvements in responsive parenting for parents and/or 
children with a variety of risk factors for poorer outcomes (e.g., maternal depression, 
poverty, child prematurity, risk for maltreatment, adoption). In these studies, when 
responsiveness was increased, children showed at least short-term increases in cognitive and 
social skills (e.g., Linares, Montalto, Li, & Oza, 2006; Toth, Rogosch, Manly, & Cicchetti, 
2006). A meta-analysis (Dunst & Kassow, 2008) reported that best outcomes were achieved 
when programs included frequent visits and focused explicitly on teaching parents to attend 
to children’s signals and respond sensitively. Video modeling and parent self-reflection also 
produced positive behavioral changes (e.g., van den Boom, 1995).
Thus, evidence across both comprehensive and more targeted, short-term studies suggests 
that a focus on building responsive parent–child interactions should be a critical component 
of home-based interventions when attempting to alter the trajectory of at-risk children’s 
development. Responsive parenting has been described as an affective–emotional style of 
interaction between caregivers and their children that includes acceptance of a child as a 
unique individual with his or her own needs and interests of their own (Darling & Steinberg, 
1993). Grounded in attachment theory, the caregiver’s responses are contingently linked to 
the child’s signals in a prompt and sensitive way. These contingent responses, if used 
consistently, provide the child with feedback that his or her needs are important and that the 
child is valued and loved. The child, in turn, develops trust and a secure bond with his or her 
caregiver that occurs through a process of internalization (Ainsworth, Blehar, Waters, & 
Wall, 1978; Bornstein & Tamis-Lemonda, 1989). As a result, the child learns to self-
regulate, as responsive interactions facilitate the development of mechanisms for coping 
with stress and novelty. Studies examining parents’ contingent responsiveness to children’s 
behaviors often show relations with children’s emotional and social outcomes.
The Intervention
With this literature in mind, the core of the present intervention, known as “My Baby & 
Me,” focused on changing specific aspects of mothers’ responsive behaviors with their 
children across the infant and toddler developmental periods. To do so, we used the Play and 
Learning Strategies (PALS) curriculum, which in previous random assignment studies has 
Guttentag et al.

been shown to increase mothers’ use of a range of responsive behaviors and in turn increase 
children’s emotional, behavioral, and language skills (Landry, Smith, & Swank, 2006; 
Landry, Smith, Swank, & Guttentag, 2008). PALS has also been shown to help mothers 
generalize their use of the target skills in new contexts that were not explicitly practiced 
during intervention (Landry et al., 2012). This structured, developmentally sequenced 
curriculum comprised 22 of the 55 total intervention sessions. PALS was originally designed 
for parents of particularly vulnerable children (infants and toddlers from low-
socioeconomic-status backgrounds) and includes both Infant and Toddler modules that 
taught mothers a set of interactional skills that collectively represent a responsive parenting 
style, informed by attachment and social learning theories (Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bornstein 
& Tamis-Lemonda, 1989). Four key constructs comprise this interactive style: (a) contingent 
responsiveness; (b) warm sensitivity, including positive behavior management skills; (c) 
maintaining children’s focus of attention and interest; and (d) rich verbal input. The 
curriculum (available in both English and Spanish) includes educational videotapes featuring 
mothers with similar backgrounds to the study participants demonstrating specific target 
skills, guided discussion and questions to ensure parents’ understanding of the concepts, 
direct coaching of parents’ use of the key behaviors during videotaped interactions with their 
children, supporting mothers to critique their videotaped behaviors, and planning for 
integration of target behaviors into daily ongoing interactions with their children.
Similar to other comprehensive interventions, the My Baby & Me program included a 
number of other sessions that targeted goals such as establishing consistent daily routines, 
learning about infant health and safety, developmental milestones, and problem solving and 
decision making. However, this program was unique in several aspects. First, its core focus 
was on building responsive parenting in a structured, step-by-step approach via a 
combination of video modeling, interactive discussion, live coached practice, and video self-
reflection. Many of the specific principles of intervention effectiveness proposed by Small, 
Cooney, and O’Connor (2009) were included, such as sufficient dosage and intensity, active 
engagement of parents in learning and practicing new skills, developmental appropriateness 
(i.e., tailored to the ages/stages of children), and delivery by well-qualified and trained staff.
Mechanism of Expected Impact
The intervention explicitly targeted mothers’ skills in attending to and responding warmly 
and contingently to their children’s communicative signals and needs, with the expectation 
that this fundamental set of skills, once mastered, would result in more positive, enriching, 
and effective interactions between mother and child. Such successful interaction patterns 
were expected, in turn, to lead to positive outcomes in children’s learning and social–
emotional development, as children were assisted by the responsive parent to remain 
regulated and positively engaged in meaningful play and learning interactions to build their 
emerging skills. In addition, as mothers learned to tune in to their children’s signals and 
needs, while simultaneously learning about relevant topics such as health, safety, 
developmental milestones, and age-appropriate play activities, they were expected to be 
better able to apply this information to their children in ways that were individualized and 
that could adapt to their children’s changing capabilities and needs as they grew from 
infancy through toddlerhood.

Hypotheses
The present study was designed to assess the impact of the My Baby & Me intervention on 
changes in parent responsiveness behaviors and in children’s social–emotional, cognitive, 
and language skills, as well as examine whether changes in mothers’ responsiveness 
behaviors explained the effects of the intervention on increases in children’s cognitive and 
social skills over time. To control for the potential effects of having a supportive relationship 
over time with a family coach and individualized referrals to community resources, we 
created a low-intensity intervention as a control condition. Mothers in the low-intensity 
condition were matched with a coach who provided monthly check-in phone calls and 
individualized referrals to community resources as requested by the mothers. This condition 
is described in more detail later in this article. During pregnancy and prior to receiving any 
intervention, mothers were randomly assigned to either the high- or low-intensity 
intervention condition. Using this randomized control design, we hypothesized the following 
study outcomes:
1.
We expected that mothers in high intensity intervention would show greater 
increases in all responsive parenting behaviors at each time point after 4 months 
than mothers in the low-intensity intervention.
2.
We expected that children of mothers who received the high-intensity 
intervention would show higher levels and greater increases in social, cognitive, 
and language skills than children whose mothers received the low-intensity 
intervention.
3.
We expected that increases in mothers’ responsiveness would mediate the effects 
of the intervention on gains in children’s skills, as the mechanism of impact of 
the intervention on children was expected to be primarily indirect, through 
changing mothers’ parenting behaviors.
We did not have a specific hypothesis with regard to anticipated differences between teen 
mothers’ and adult mothers’ response to the intervention, given mixed findings in the 
literature, but examined these comparisons as well.
Method
Participants
Pregnant women and adolescents with less than a high school education were recruited from 
community health and education agencies serving low-income clients in four geographical 
regions: South Bend, Indiana; Kansas City, Kansas and Missouri; Washington, D.C.; and 
Houston, Texas. Through telephone or home visit prescreenings, women were deemed 
eligible for enrollment if they were pregnant, 15 years of age or older, did not have high 
school degree, and did not have any of the following exclusion criteria: preexisting diagnosis 
of major mental illness such as schizophrenia, currently receiving substance abuse treatment 
in a residential facility, or planning not to keep the baby after birth. From the 396 women 
judged eligible, 361 (91%) were enrolled during their third trimester of pregnancy. See Table 
1 for maternal characteristics.

The initial sample consisted of 193 adolescents (age ≤ 18 years) and 168 adults. The average 
age of teen mothers at enrollment was 17.18 years (SD = 1.14), and 24.29 years (SD = 4.97) 
for adult mothers. Self-identified race and ethnicity were 56.23% African American, 35.45% 
Hispanic, and 11.91% White non-Hispanic; the majority of mothers (88%) were unmarried. 
During pregnancy, 40% scored at least 1 standard deviation below the national mean on the 
Word Attack subscale of the Woodcock–Johnson III/Woodcock–Muñoz III tests, and 37% 
had elevated scores on the Child Abuse Potential Inventory (Milner, 1986). There were no 
significant group differences on any risk or demographic characteristics (see Table 1).
At the final assessment, 247 mother–child dyads remained (68.42% of the original sample, 
32% attrition rate), which compares favorably to attrition in other home visiting studies (e.g., 
57% in McGuigan, Katzev, & Pratt, 2003; 36% in Fernandez & Eyberg, 2009; 57% in 
Wagner et al., 1996). Primary reasons for attrition in our sample, from most to least frequent, 
were inability to locate family, family moved out of area, mother’s increased commitment to 
work or school interfered with ability to continue in the program, child removed from 
mother’s care by Child Protection Services or permanently placed in the care of another 
family member, maternal incarceration, and maternal inpatient substance abuse treatment.
When looking at attrition rates, an additional concern is that dropout is often not random 
(e.g., McGuigan et al., 2003). This is a significant problem if participants who have more 
risk factors and are thus most in need of services are more likely to drop out. However, our 
analyses detected no significant differences in the demographic and maternal characteristics 
of those who completed the intervention compared with those who did not. Furthermore, at 
three of the four sites, rates of attrition were comparable across high-versus low-intensity 
intervention groups. At only one site was there differential attrition, and at that site, although 
there were more high-intensity group families lost to attrition, observed parent and child 
behaviors at the 4-month time point were very similar between those who later dropped out 
of the program and those who remained enrolled. Only two variables at 4 months showed 
any difference: Mothers who dropped out showed lower levels of demonstrating/physical 
teaching, t(304) = − 2.06, p = .041, and higher levels of negativity, t(304) = 2.03, p = .043, 
compared to mothers who remained in the study at 30 months. No other maternal variables 
and none of the child variables indicated any difference between those attrited and those 
who did not, t(304) = 0.00–1.69, ns.
Design and Procedures
Participants agreed to be randomly assigned to one of two groups through a matched 
blocking procedure for teen and adult mothers: a low-intensity intervention condition in 
which mothers received monthly check-in phone calls from a family coach, informational 
print materials, and needs-based referrals to existing community resources or a high-
intensity intervention condition in which participants received referrals to community 
resources as well as the comprehensive My Baby & Me intervention designed to enhance 
parenting skills.
High-intensity treatment—The high-intensity intervention began during the third 
trimester of pregnancy and continued until each child reached 30 months of age. Coaches

worked individually with each mother–child dyad at home or in a location of their choice 
(e.g., relative’s home, local library). The intervention was designed to provide a cohesive, 
developmentally sequenced curriculum across 55 sessions. As noted above, the core of the 
My Baby & Me curriculum (comprising 22 of the 55 sessions) was the PALS program 
developed by Landry et al. (2006). Parents begin with basic skills of observing their child’s 
communicative signals and progress to using a variety of responsiveness behaviors (e.g., 
smiling, using a warm tone of voice, encouraging children’s efforts, avoiding intrusiveness 
and unnecessary restrictions, attending to and following the child’s interests) in a contingent 
manner related to what the child signaled, along with using rich language input and 
scaffolding to support the child’s language and cognitive development. This program has 
been shown to be one of the more effective intervention programs targeting at-risk parents 
and is currently listed in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services HomVEE 
Evidence of Effectiveness programs, the Promise Neighborhoods Research Consortium 
What Works programs, and the Sociometrics Corporation Effective Programs Archive. In a 
randomized controlled trial, mothers who had received the 10- to 12-week PALS 
intervention showed significantly more warmth and sensitivity toward their children, 
increased contingent responsiveness, greater skills in maintaining the duration of their 
children’s attention and interest, richer vocabulary use and verbal explanations when 
interacting with their children, and more praise than mothers in the control condition 
(Landry et al., 2006; Landry et al., 2008); these significant effects occurred irrespective of 
maternal anger or depressive symptoms (Smith, Landry, & Swank, 2005). In turn, children 
of mothers who received the PALS intervention showed more positive affect during 
interaction with their mothers, initiated conversation with their mothers more often, used 
more words during interactions with their mothers, and developed larger receptive 
vocabularies than children of mothers in the control condition (Landry et al., 2006).
Additional modules in eight major topic areas covered other important areas of early 
parenting knowledge and skills, including establishing early routines; infant and toddler 
health and safety (using materials from Lutzker & Bigelow, 2002); personal problem solving 
and decision making (adapted from the Infant Health and Development Program by Gross, 
Spiker, & Hayes, 1997); infant touch and massage using material from McClure, 2000; 
developmental milestones and age-appropriate play activities (using the “Healthy Start, 
Grow Smart” series of booklets (U.S. Department of Education, 2002); reading with babies 
and promoting early literacy (following the Reading Is Fundamental parent guidelines); 
promoting positive behavior; and enhancing community connections. For a complete list of 
the modules and numbers of sessions, see supplemental materials (Appendix A). We 
designed the home-based format to maximize parental engagement by beginning each 
session with a review of homework and material from the previous session, then introducing 
new material using video modeling whenever possible, coaching and videotaping the parent 
as she actively practiced the new target skills with her child, engaging the mother in self-
reflection while reviewing the video footage of her interaction with her child, and planning 
for the coming week’s homework. Sessions followed a schedule of weekly or biweekly 
visits, with some breaks built in to allow for rescheduled visits, holidays, etc. Each visit 
lasted approximately 1.5 hr. When children were 24–30 months of age, the last six sessions 
occurred at monthly intervals as part of the program completion and graduation process.

The following guidelines framed our approach: (a) target improving specific maternal 
interaction skills that predict positive child outcomes; (b) use a variety of formats (video and 
in-person demonstration and feedback, discussion, pictures, print materials) to engage each 
mother actively in the learning process; (c) build in recurring opportunities for parents to 
master and integrate new skills over time; (d) foster a trusting, caring relationship between 
coach and mother to promote active and sustained engagement; (e) make session sequence 
and contents developmentally appropriate for children and interesting for mothers; (f) 
provide explicit coaching, practice, and guided self-reflection activities for each target skill 
within the context of naturalistic mother–child interactions; (g) provide mothers with 
resource and referral information to address broader, individualized needs such as housing, 
adult education, health care, and insurance, while maintaining the primary focus on the 
explicit teaching of parenting skills.
Low-intensity treatment—To control for some of the attentive and supportive aspects of 
the intervention and to provide important basic child development information, we assigned 
a family coach to each participant in the low-intensity condition, providing printed 
informational materials and appropriate referrals to community agencies. These supports to 
mothers were provided at the same developmentally appropriate time points as families in 
the high-intensity condition received materials on these same topics. Families were offered 
additional community resource information based on the mother’s responses to the Eco-Map 
assessment (see measures below), administered during each assessment time point. In 
addition, the coaches contacted their assigned low-intensity mothers by phone once a month. 
To maximize fidelity, coaches followed a systematic format for each call, asking a standard 
set of questions about the parent’s current status and her child’s developmental progress. 
Coaches were trained to provide supportive, nondirective responses during these calls and to 
refrain from giving specific parenting advice. They were instructed in how to handle 
questions from parents within the guidelines of the intervention. For example, coaches 
would send mothers preapproved, printed handouts on a specific topic if the mother 
requested help in that area (e.g., toilet training, child nutrition) and were otherwise referred 
to contact their child’s pediatrician about any child-related concerns. In this way, we enabled 
mothers in the low-intensity group to establish a supportive relationship with their coaches, 
provided regular opportunities for mothers to talk about and reflect on their children’s health 
and development, and provided individualized resource and referral information upon 
request, but without providing instruction or coaching on specific parenting skills.
Family coaches—Family coaches had a minimum of a bachelor’s degree in psychology, 
education, or a related field. Several had master’s degrees and/or were graduate students at 
the time of their involvement in the project. To the extent possible, we recruited coaches 
whose ethnicities were reflective of the diverse population of families with whom they 
worked. This varied somewhat by site, but out of 30 coaches, 16 were Caucasian, seven were 
Hispanic/Latina, and seven were African American. Due to logistical constraints, coaches 
were not systematically matched with families by ethnicity, but families completing the 
intervention in Spanish were matched with a fluent Spanish-speaking coach. Families 
completed satisfaction surveys at regular intervals (results were not seen by their coach), and 
these included questions about their satisfaction with their relationship with their coach. The

co-investigator at each site reviewed these surveys and addressed any concerns with the 
coach if needed. However, this was an exceedingly rare occurrence, as the vast majority of 
satisfaction surveys indicated a high level of satisfaction with the program and with the 
coaches.
Fidelity—To promote consistency and fidelity across the four intervention sites, the 
following strategies were incorporated: (a) cross-site trainings; (b) formal certification 
processes for administering each module; (c) detailed, scripted program manuals; (d) weekly 
group supervision meetings; (e) monthly field supervision; and (f) regular principal and 
coprincipal investigator conference calls to ensure consistency across sites. For more 
information, see supplemental materials (Appendix B).
Assessment approach and measures—All mothers completed an assessment during 
pregnancy prior to randomization to the two conditions. Subsequent assessments of mothers 
and children occurred when the child was 1, 4, 10, 16, 24, and 30 months of age. Research 
assistants who were blind to conditions conducted assessments in the families’ homes, 
including maternal interviews; self-report and parent report measures of maternal and child 
functioning; standardized measures of children’s language, cognitive, and socioemotional 
development; and direct observations of mother–infant interaction that were videotaped and 
later coded (see below). Mothers in both conditions received $425 for participation in 
assessments throughout the project, beginning with $35 for the pregnancy assessment, with 
amounts increasing incrementally at each subsequent assessment. All measures were 
administered in English or Spanish, depending upon the mother’s preference.
Demographic and risk characteristics: Maternal demographic and risk characteristics 
were assessed at the prenatal and 1-month assessments to describe the sample characteristics 
and analyze equivalence of the two groups at the time of enrollment. Measures included the 
Child Abuse Potential Inventory (Milner, 1986), which assessed child abuse risk; the 
Symptom Checklist–90 (Derogatis, 1994), which assessed maternal depression and 
psychiatric symptoms; the Adult–Adolescent Parenting Inventory–2 (Bavolek & Keene, 
2001), which examined parenting beliefs and attitudes; the Postpartum Depression 
Screening Scale (Beck & Gable, 2001), which identified women at risk for postpartum 
depression; the Knowledge of Infant Development Inventory (MacPhee, 1981), which 
obtained information on parents’ factual knowledge of parental practices and typical infant 
behavior; a background history interview, which obtained demographic information and self-
report of substance use; and the Letter–Word Identification and Word Attack subtests of the 
Woodcock–Johnson, Third Edition (Woodcock, McGrew, & Mather, 2003), and parallel 
subtests of the Batería III Woodcock–Muñoz (Woodcock, Muñoz-Sandoval, McGrew, & 
Mather, 2005), which assessed literacy related skills. See supplemental materials (Appendix 
C) for more information on these measures.
Parenting outcome measures: Parenting outcomes were based on direct observations of 
parenting practices by means of the Landry Parent–Child Interaction Scales (Landry et al., 
2006) to code observed behaviors during mother–infant interactions at home at the 4-month 
assessment time point and each time point thereafter. See supplemental materials (Appendix 
Guttentag et al.

D) for mother and child coded variables. Each mother and her child were videotaped at 
home during a 20-min free-play period.
Coding procedures and interrater reliability: The coding staff was trained by an expert 
senior coder under the direction of Susan H. Landry. Coders were blind to intervention 
group participant status. Initial training involved each member achieving interrater 
agreements equal to or greater than 80% per variable. To guard against observer drift, 
monthly meetings were conducted where videotapes were coded as a team and interrater 
agreements were checked to ensure that they continued to meet the criterion of equal to or 
greater than 80% per variable. A second rater coded 15% of the videotapes, and 
generalizability coefficients were calculated with repeated-measures analyses of variance. 
This method is recommended for studies using continuous, observational data and has the 
advantage of evaluating both consistency across participants for each rater and rater variance 
within participants for those variables used in subsequent analyses (Frick & Semmel, 1978). 
Generalizability coefficients for the maternal and child behaviors ranged from .63 to .75.
Child outcome measures: The following measures assessed children’s outcomes related to 
the intervention: The Landry Parent–Child Interaction Scales were used to code children’s 
behavior during videotaped mother–child play and mother–child book-reading sessions. The 
Brief Infant–Toddler Social and Emotional Assessment (BITSEA) assessed children’s 
social–emotional functioning (Briggs-Gowan, Carter, Irwin, Wachtel, & Cicchetti, 2004) at 
16, 24, and 30 months. The Preschool Language Scale, Fourth Edition (PLS–4; English and 
Spanish versions; Zimmerman, Steiner, & Pond, 2002) assessed children’s expressive and 
receptive language at ages 10, 16, 24 (Expressive scale only), and 30 months. The Cognitive 
Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition, assessed 
children’s cognitive functioning at 24 months (Bayley, 2006). See supplemental materials 
(Appendix E) for more information on these measures.
Results
We first focus on group differences over time in observed parenting practices and child 
development. We then examine maternal reports of children’s behaviors, followed by 
mediational analyses in which observed parenting behaviors are treated as mediators 
between treatment groups and children’s outcomes. Finally, group differences in children’s 
standardized cognitive and language test scores are reported. Because analyses indicated that 
the high- and low-intensity intervention groups did not reliably differ by site, maternal age, 
or race/ethnicity, we did not include these variables as moderators or covariates in further 
analyses.
To model repeated outcome measures over time, we adopted a mixed model analysis. There 
are two major advantages to this approach: A mixed model uses all available cases rather 
than making listwise deletions; in addition, a mixed model provides greater flexibility in 
specification of the variance–covariance matrix among repeated observations. Missing data 
were handled with full information maximum likelihood, which is robust when missing data 
are ignorable (Little & Rubin, 1987).

To examine parenting behaviors, the model included intervention condition, time of 
assessment, and the condition by time interaction. Examination of these variables revealed 
that the changes over time were not linear. Therefore, time was entered as a categorical 
variable and a repeated-measures analysis was conducted. The test of time allowed us to 
examine differences in means across the groups because the groups did not start off the 
same. When group effects were significant, we compared group means and standard 
deviations (simple main effects). Effect size (ES) was estimated in terms of least square 
mean differences between groups at each time point divided by the model-estimated 
standard deviation from the model, which is approximately equivalent to the pooled standard 
deviation of the raw variable. Table 2 provides the means and standard deviations for the 
observed and parent-rated variables, and Figures 1 and 2 present means for conditions across 
time.
Intervention Effects on Parenting Outcomes: Maternal Behaviors
Warmth—For maternal warmth, there were significant differences by group, F(1, 334) = 
16.41, p < .0001, and time, F(4, 921) = 6.44, p < .0001, with a significant interaction of 
group by time, F(4, 921) = 4.20, p = .0022. Analysis of the simple main effects indicated 
that mothers in the high-intensity group were significantly higher on warmth at 16 months, 
F(1, 921) = 17.76, p < .0001, ES = .53, and 24 months, F(1, 921) = 23.19, p < .0001, ES = .
61. Differences in favor of the high-intensity mothers at 4 months (p = .078, ES = .20) and 
10 months (p = .055, ES = .23) approached significance.
Contingent responsiveness—Results for contingent responsiveness also demonstrated 
significant differences between groups, F(1, 334) = 23.93, p < .0001, and time, F(4, 921) = 
17.90, p < .0001, as well as a significant Group × Time interaction, F(4, 921) = 2.72, p = .03. 
Analyses of simple main effects revealed that mothers in the high-intensity group showed 
more contingent responsiveness at 10 months, F(1, 921) = 9.88, p = .002, ES = .38; 16 
months, F(1, 921) = 12.17, p = .0005, ES = .45; 24 months, F(1, 921) = 26.09, p < .0001, ES 
= .66; and 30 months, F(1, 921) = 8.10, p = .005, ES = .37. The difference at 4 months 
approached significance, F(1, 921) = 2.96, p = .0854, ES = .20.
Physical intrusiveness—There were significant group differences on maternal physical 
intrusiveness, F(1, 334) = 7.02, p = .008, as well as significant differences over time, F(4, 
921) = 31.25, < .0001. The Group × Time interaction was also significant, F(4, 921) = 3.07, 
p = .016, indicating that group differences were not the same at all time points. Simple main 
effects revealed that mothers in the high-intensity condition were significantly less intrusive 
at 16 months, F(1, 921) = 6.09, p = .014, ES = .15, and 24 months, F(1, 921) = 11.04, p = .
0009, ES = .22, but not at the other time points.
Quality of verbal stimulation—There were significant group differences on quality of 
verbal stimulation, F(1, 334) = 16.25, p < .0001, as well as significant differences over time, 
F(4, 921) = 74.16, p < .0001; in addition, the group differences varied significantly by time, 
F(4, 921) = 2.45, p = .045. Analyses of simple main effects indicated that mothers in the 
high-intensity condition engaged in higher quality of verbal stimulation (e.g., rich 
vocabulary words) at 10 months, F(1, 921) = 12.04, p = .0005, ES = .42; 16 months, F(1,

921) = 13.36, p = .0003, ES = .47; 24 months, F(1, 921) = 9.86, p = .002, ES = .40; and 30 
months, F(1, 921) = 5.16, p = .0233, ES = .30; but not at 4 months (p = .45, ES = .085).
Frequency of verbal scaffolding—There were significant group differences in mothers’ 
frequency of verbal scaffolding, F(1, 333) = 9.00, p = .003, as well as significant differences 
over time, F(4, 906) = 77.56, p < .0001. Analyses of simple main effects indicated that 
mothers in the high-intensity condition engaged in more frequent use of verbal scaffolding at 
16 months, F(1, 906) = 4.40, p = .036, ES = .28; 24 months, F(1, 906) = 8.29, p = .004, ES 
= .38; and 30 months, F(1, 906) = 4.58, p = .033, ES = .28; though not at 4 months (p = .94, 
ES = .009) or at 10 months (p = .13, ES = .19).
Demonstrating/physical teaching—There was a significant group difference, F(1, 334) 
= 7.86, p = .0053, and significant changes over time, F(4, 921) = 39.25, p < .0001, with 
group differences being consistently maintained over time (average ES = .19). Specifically, 
mothers in the high-intensity group were significantly higher on demonstrating/physical 
teaching by the time their infants were 4 months old and continued to improve thereafter by 
about the same amount as the low-intensity group over time. This suggests that the high-
intensity intervention was related to early and sustained increases due to the intervention 
sessions mothers had received during their children’s first few months of life.
Positive affect—Although there were significant differences over time in maternal 
positive affect during observed mother–child interactions, F(4, 921) = 39.51, p < .0001, there 
were no overall group differences nor a significant Group × Time interaction. Main effects 
analyses indicated a significant difference between groups at 16 months in favor of the high-
intensity condition, F(1, 921) = 4.42, p = .04, ES = .27.
Negativity—There was a significant change over time in maternal negativity, F(4, 921) = 
4.05, p =.0003, but no overall group difference nor a significant Group × Time interaction. 
Analyses of simple main effects indicated that mothers in the high-intensity group were 
significantly less negative at 24 months, F(1, 921) = 4.63, p =.03, ES =.16.
Intervention Effects on Adolescent Versus Adult Mothers
Although we did not have an a priori hypothesis with regard to potential differences in 
response to the intervention by teenage (defined as equal to or less than 18 years of age) 
versus adult mothers, we examined the three-way interaction between time, intervention 
group, and maternal age. There was little evidence of differences between teenage and adult 
mothers, with only one significant difference between the maternal age groups at the 4-
month time point, when adolescent mothers in the low-intensity intervention group showed 
more verbal scaffolding than adult mothers.
Intervention Effects on Developmental Outcomes: Observed Children’s Behaviors
Children’s developmental outcomes were analyzed with growth curve models. In this type of 
model, the outcome is modeled as a function of age. The function can be linear with a 
random intercept and slope and may include a curvilinear term (quadratic). If the quadratic 
term was not significant, it was dropped and the model assuming linearity was reported

(Maxwell & Delaney, 1990; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Time was centered at 16 months to 
reduce the chances of multicolinearity. Effect sizes for the growth curve models were 
calculated as the difference between groups in the change from the first to the last time 
point, divided by the model-estimated standard deviation.
Engagement with environment—The model assuming curvilinearity indicated a 
significant quadratic trend, F(1, 289) = 268.00, p < .0001; since the quadratic term did not 
depend on group membership, the Group × Quadratic Term interaction was dropped. In 
other words, there was no evidence that the curvature of the model differed for the high- and 
low-intensity conditions. The resulting model revealed a significant Group × Slope 
interaction, F(1, 637) = 4.11, p = .04. Both groups showed positive changes, but the slope for 
the high-intensity group was significantly steeper. Thus, children in the high-intensity 
condition displayed more engagement with their environment at a more rapid rate than 
children in the low-intensity condition. Changes from 4 to 30 months compared across 
conditions had an effect size of .33.
Expressive language—Children’s expressive language showed a similar quadratic trend, 
F(1, 289) = 32.86, p < .0001, but no differences in the quadratic term by group. Dropping 
this interaction, the resulting model revealed a significant group by slope interaction, F(1, 
637) = 4.61, p = .032. In other words, children in the high-intensity condition showed 
improvements in their expressive language at a faster rate than children in the low-intensity 
group. Comparison of the change in group means from 4 to 30 months resulted in an effect 
size of .34.
Receptive language—There were no significant group effect or Group × Slope 
interactions for receptive language. Thus, children in the high- and low-intensity conditions 
both improved by equivalent amounts.
Social engagement—There was no indication of curvilinearity for the social engagement 
data. The resulting model assuming linearity indicated a significant Group × Slope 
interaction, F(1, 408) = 5.02, p = .03. Children in the high-intensity group increased their 
level of social engagement over time at a more rapid rate than children in the low-intensity 
group. The interaction between 4 months and 30 months and group had an effect size of .38. 
Examination of the least squares estimates at each time point indicated that the children in 
the high-intensity condition were higher on social engagement at 30 months than children in 
the low-intensity condition, t(408) = 2.46, p = .01, ES = .31.
Negative affect—There was no curvilinearity evident in ratings of children’s negative 
affect. The model assuming linearity showed that although children displayed less negative 
affect over time during observed mother–child interactions, F(1, 408) = 97.68, p < .0001, 
there was no significant group or Group × Time effects. Main effects analyses indicated that 
group differences approached significance at 10 months, F(1, 921) = 3.72, p = .054, ES = .
25, and at 30 months, F(1, 921) = 3.07, p = .08, ES = .25, such that children in the high-
intensity condition showed less negative affect than those in the low-intensity condition at 
these time points.

Cooperation—Since cooperation was assessed only at 16, 24, and 30 months, and 
individual growth curves indicated no linearity over time, we used a repeated-measures 
analysis rather than growth curve modeling. However, no group or Group × Time effects 
were observed.
Complexity of toy play—Children in the high-intensity group demonstrated significantly 
higher levels of toy play at 30 months, after controlling for their level of toy play at 24 
months. Across a hierarchical play scale with functional and pretend play as the highest 
levels, children in the high-intensity group showed significantly more complex play than did 
children in the low-intensity group, F(1, 193) = 4.73, p < .05, d = .31.
Intervention Effects on Developmental Outcomes: Maternal Ratings of Child Behavior
A growth curve modeling approach was used to analyze maternal reports of children’s 
behaviors on the two scales of the BIT-SEA at three time points: 16, 24, and 30 months. The 
model results were compared to a repeated-measures model and had very similar results. 
Effect sizes for the growth curve models were calculated as the difference between groups in 
the change from the first to the last time point, divided by the model-estimated standard 
deviation.
Competence—There was no indication of curvature for the child Competence scale. The 
model assuming linearity had no significant results for group or group by time. It should be 
noted that the means for children in the high-intensity group were higher than for those in 
the low-intensity group, but the results were not statistically significant (.05 < p < .20, ES = .
15).
Problems—On the Problems scale, there was evidence of curvature, F(1, 248) = 7.85, p = .
006, but it did not depend on group membership. There was a trend for a group effect on the 
intercepts, F(1, 210) = 3.79, p = .05, ES = .21. To explore the group effect on the intercepts, 
we calculated simple main effects at each time point. Groups did not differ at 16 months (p 
= .213, ES = .16), but did at 24 months, t(210) = 1.95, p = .05, ES = .21, and at 30 months, 
t(210) = 2.10, p = .04, ES = .25. At both these time points, children in the high-intensity 
condition were reported to have fewer problems overall than children in the low-intensity 
condition.
Intervention Effects on Developmental Outcomes: Children’s Cognitive and Language Test 
Scores
Analysis of variance was used to test for group differences on the Bayley–III Cognitive 
scaled score that was obtained at 24 months. There were no significant differences between 
groups, F(1, 242) = .57, ns. A mixed model analysis of the PLS–4 Expressive 
Communication Scale, which was administered at the 10-, 16-, 24-, and 30-month time 
points, revealed no group differences in standardized scores at any time point, F(1, 588) = 
0.00–2.24, ns. Likewise, there were no group differences on the PLS–4 Auditory 
Comprehension standard scores, which were obtained at the 10-, 16-, and 30-month time 
points, F(1, 384) = 0.03–2.26, ns.

Parenting as a Mediator of Children’s Development
To test our third hypothesis, that increases in mothers’ responsiveness would mediate the 
effects of the intervention on gains in children’s skills, we had to define our mediator and 
outcome variables from the repeated-measures and growth curve analyses. Given that 
increases in parenting levels due to the intervention were most notable at 16 and 24 months, 
an average of the means at these time points was created for each variable to use as a 
mediator. Similarly, the same procedure was used to create averages of the significant child 
variables at the 24- and 30-month time points. See supplemental materials (Appendix D) for 
correlations between these maternal and child variables. The effect of grouping on the 
maternal variables was the “a” parameter for the mediation effect. All of the group effects on 
the originally significant maternal variables (warmth, contingent responsiveness, physical 
intrusiveness, negativity, demonstrating/physical teaching, quality of verbal stimulation, and 
frequency of verbal scaffolding) were statistically significant as expected.
The second model included all of the original variables in the same model and added the 
mediators simultaneously in a multiple mediation model. The relation of the mediators to the 
outcome represented the “b” parameters. The product of these parameters (a*b) was the 
estimate of the indirect effect. In addition to the individual indirect effects, in a multiple 
mediator model, a total indirect effect is estimated that represents the average of all the 
individual indirect effects. We tested the significance of the indirect effects using a bias-
corrected bootstrapping procedure as described and evaluated by MacKinnon, Lockwood, 
and Williams (2004) and implemented by the SAS macro PROCESS (Preacher & Hayes, 
2008). Random draws from the “a” and “b” distributions are simulated and the product a*b 
computed. On the basis of 20,000 bootstrapping samples, a 95% confidence interval for the 
product was determined. If this confidence interval did not contain 0, evidence for mediation 
would be documented.
Results indicated that the indirect effect of all of the maternal behaviors together, as well as 
the individual indirect effect of physical intrusiveness, showed evidence of mediation for the 
children’s engagement with the environment. The indirect effect of all of the maternal 
behaviors together, as well as quality of verbal stimulation, mediated children’s complexity 
of toy play. For children’s negative affect, maternal physical intrusiveness, quality of verbal 
stimulation, and the indirect effect of all the maternal behaviors together showed evidence of 
mediation. For children’s social engagement, the total maternal indirect effect showed 
evidence of mediation. Finally, for children’s expressive language the indirect effect of 
maternal negativity showed evidence of mediation, and for BITSEA Problems the indirect 
effect of all the maternal behaviors together and the individual indirect effect of physical 
intrusiveness showed evidence of mediation. Table 3 shows the confidence intervals for 
these mediation effects.
Discussion
As hypothesized, mothers receiving the high-intensity My Baby & Me intervention showed 
greater increases in a range of parenting behaviors, such as contingent responsiveness and 
quality of verbal stimulation, when compared to mothers in the low-intensity condition 
(primarily an information and referral treatment). At enrollment, mothers in these two

groups were comparable in terms of major risk factors (e.g., depression, psychological 
distress, substance abuse, age, and education), as well as most of their responsive behaviors 
at 4 months (i.e., before the full responsive parenting curriculum was delivered and could 
reasonably have a strong effect on maternal behaviors). Thus, the sizable gains seen over 
time for mothers in the high-intensity treatment were likely due to the intervention itself.
Mothers in our high-intensity condition showed significantly greater contingent 
responsiveness by 10 months and sustained this increased responsiveness through 30 months 
(the endpoint of the study). Typically, mothers from high-risk backgrounds experience 
difficulty in interacting contingently with their children during toddlerhood (Landry et al., 
2008). The results demonstrate that the mothers in our high-intensity group were adjusting 
to their toddlers’ changing needs and signals by displaying behaviors associated with 
acceptance of the children as having unique individual needs and interests (Landry et al., 
2001).
Verbal scaffolding, mothers’ support for children’s immature communication skills, and 
their use of rich vocabulary showed significantly greater gains for the high-versus low-
intensity mothers between 10 and 30 months of age. High-intensity group mothers used 
richer language beginning during the infancy period, helping their children to learn the 
names of objects and actions and/or links between objects and experiences. They used 
gestures and language in ways that provided support to help their children understand and 
engage in cognitive and social interactions. Higher frequencies of verbal scaffolding and rich 
verbal input combined with contingent responsiveness likely enhanced the mother–child 
relationship over time and facilitated positive cognitive and social developmental outcomes.
Although many of the maternal behaviors in the high-intensity group sustained higher levels 
through 30 months, the end of the intervention, several other behaviors showed significant 
effects in the expected direction only through 24 months for high-compared to low-intensity 
mothers, including warmth, intrusiveness, and negativity. Although for all of these behaviors 
the high-intensity mothers continued to have more optimal scores through 30 months, the 
absence of significance at 30 months may have negative implications for the intervention to 
have long-term sustained effects. The absence of significant differences though 30 months 
may reflect changes in intervention intensity and focus that began at 24 months, when the 
intervention sessions tapered off dramatically from almost-weekly to monthly visits, and 
sessions focused on topics such as preschool readiness and strengthening family support 
through community connections. Our sample of high-risk mothers may have benefited from 
additional and more intensive intervention sessions between 24 and 30 months to support 
their acquisition of skills to respond appropriately to toddler behaviors (e.g., poor frustration 
tolerance, tantrums, and negativity), as this is a vulnerable time for mothers with limited 
parenting skills and knowledge.
In their review of a number of major home visiting interventions, Howard and Brooks-Gunn 
(2009) reported mixed results for the effectiveness of these interventions for adult versus 
teen mothers. Additionally, only a few studies have specifically compared differential 
benefits for teen and adult high-risk mothers living in poverty (e.g., DuMont et al., 2008; 
Olds, 2006). Teen and adult mothers in our study, who both had high and very similar levels 
Guttentag et al.

of risk, showed comparable benefits, which is important, as teen mothers have been shown 
to be at exceptionally high risk for child neglect, given their low levels of education, social 
and cognitive immaturity, and less stable social supports (e.g., Whitman, Borkowski, Keogh, 
& Weed, 2001).
Children’s cognitive and social behaviors also showed positive benefits from the 
intervention, including faster rates of development in their engagement with the environment 
and with others (social engagement), better regulation of negative emotions, greater gains in 
expressive language in interactions with their mothers, and increases in complexity of play. 
Rates of growth over time demonstrated group differences through the 30-month assessment, 
with meaningful effect sizes ranging from .25 to .34, although in some cases simple mean 
differences were small between the groups because the groups began the study at different 
levels. More complex levels of play for children can be attributed, in part, to higher cognitive 
and executive skills. Complex play, an early indicator of cognitive development, is described 
as the child demonstrating age-appropriate concept development rather than just increased 
fine motor skills (Nicolopoulou, 1999), as they use objects in functionally and symbolically 
appropriate ways (Welsh & Pennington, 1988). Relatedly, gains in expressive language skills 
for children in the high-intensity group demonstrate increased knowledge about words and 
using language to express interests and needs in more complex ways. These early language 
skills are highly predictive of children’s later academic success (e.g., Duncan et al., 2007). 
Just as importantly, children whose mothers received the high-intensity intervention showed 
better abilities than those in the low-intensity group to modulate their social and emotional 
behaviors, as reflected in fewer general behavior problems.
Although direct observational measures of children’s language and cognitive skills (e.g., 
complexity of play) showed positive intervention effects, similar results were not found on 
standardized assessments of cognitive (Bayley–III Cognitive scale) and language (PLS–4) 
skills. Children across the two groups also did not differ on the BITSEA Competence 
subscale or the observation measure of cooperation, where both groups scored high. The 
absence of differences on these latter two measures may be due, in part, to the criteria of the 
measure. For example, the criteria of the cooperation measure placed an emphasis on simple 
compliance with mothers’ requests and did not take into account children’s ability to be 
involved more actively in a give-and-take process with their mothers. As children in the 
high-intensity group showed higher levels of language use and social engagement on other 
measures compared to those in the low-intensity group, a broader definition of cooperation 
may have better captured differences across the two groups of children related to an active 
rather than a passive form of cooperation. The lack of group differences on the Bayley–III 
Cognitive scale and the PLS–4 was disappointing. In the recent report describing findings 
from the Early Head Start national evaluation (Love, Chazan-Cohen, Raikes, & Brooks-
Gunn, 2013), an intervention with families and very young children of similar high-risk 
status to those in our intervention and who received the program for a similar length of time, 
differences between the program and control children on the Bayley–III Cognitive scale 
reflected very small effect sizes (ES = .11), although described as showing a modest impact. 
Effect sizes seen for children in the present study on the Bayley (ES = .09) were also very 
small, and differences were not significant, given a much smaller sample compared with the 
sample in the Early Head Start study (n = 1,781). It has been noted that previous evaluations

of home visiting programs found either small or no effects on standardized measures of 
cognitive and language development (e.g., Howard & Brooks-Gunn, 2009; Sweet & 
Appelbaum, 2004). Thus, it is possible that the sensitivity of these types of cognitive 
measures for very young children is such that significant and meaningful effect sizes are 
difficult to find, especially when the sample size is not very large. Another explanation for 
the absence of differences on the Bayley–III and PLS–4 may be related to the emphasis in 
our intervention on maternal responsiveness. Given this emphasis, the intervention may not 
have targeted, with enough specificity and intensity, mothers incorporating the types of 
cognitive activities into their interactions with their infants and toddlers that are measured on 
the Bayley–III or the PLS–4.
We included mediational analyses to further confirm that higher levels of maternal behaviors 
for the high-intensity group explain the effect of the intervention on higher levels of the 
children’s developmental skills. For example, higher levels of total maternal responsiveness 
behaviors and decreased maternal physical intrusiveness helped explain the intervention 
effects on children’s increased engagement with the environment. Total maternal 
responsiveness also accounted for the intervention’s effect on children’s increased social 
engagement. Total maternal responsiveness as well as quality of verbal stimulation were 
important in understanding the effect of the intervention on complexity of toy play, and 
quality of maternal verbal stimulation, decreased physical intrusiveness, and total maternal 
responsiveness explained decreases in children’s negative affect. Collectively, the 
mediational analyses provide strong evidence that the composite of maternal behaviors 
(increases in positive parenting behaviors and avoidance of negativity and intrusiveness) 
were the likely mechanisms for changes in children’s development.
Strengths of the approach taken in the My Baby & Me intervention that may be important 
for understanding its effectiveness include beginning during the prenatal period with a range 
of supports for mothers (e.g., problem-solving skills, establishing daily routines, home 
safety, identification of a medical home) prior to the introduction of training in parent 
responsiveness. For teens and young adults with limited education, often single, and with 
elevated levels of mental health problems, especially depression, this focus may have helped 
to establish a trusting relationship between mothers and their coaches. It is noteworthy that 
the intervention was conducted on a relatively large scale in cities and towns across four 
states with mothers who varied in their cultural, ethnic, and racial backgrounds, suggesting 
broad cultural and psychosocial appropriateness of the program. One factor that may have 
limited a full evaluation of the impact of the My Baby & Me intervention was that the 
attrition rate approached 32%. Also, the mothers who attrited had lower scores on 
demonstrating objects and negative affect at 4 months compared to scores for the mothers 
who remained in the study. For various reasons, including families’ unstable lifestyles, 
multiple life stressors, time constraints, and variable motivation for change, it can be 
extremely challenging to keep families engaged in intervention and assessment protocols 
throughout such a lengthy intervention. As noted earlier, our attrition rate was comparable to 
or lower than that reported for similar long-term studies. Nonetheless, we recognize that for 
home-based interventions to succeed in altering parenting practices and improving child 
outcomes for a large segment of the at-risk population in our nation, the factors leading to 
Guttentag et al.

program dropout must be better understood and new approaches developed to sustain the 
engagement of a greater percentage of at-risk mothers.
Another limitation is that our intervention included a large number of sessions and diverse 
modules presented over a relatively long period. Multimodule interventions limit the ability 
to assess the independent contribution of each component to parent and child outcomes, and 
lengthy interventions are labor-intensive and costly. Although we were able to carry out this 
moderately large-scale study across four diverse sites, it may be challenging to scale up a 
program with such a large number of intervention modules and sessions.
It will be important to continue to evaluate the benefits of shorter, highly targeted 
interventions versus those that attempt to provide families with a broad range of support over 
a longer period. Shorter term interventions are likely to have lower levels of attrition and be 
more economically feasible. However, they may only be able to address the challenges of 
one developmental stage or one domain of family support, and may not be strong enough to 
provide longer term impact on parents and children. A study directly contrasting these two 
approaches, which has not occurred to our knowledge, could be highly informative to the 
field. It may also be fruitful to examine the value of a more strategically spaced intervention 
approach in which several focused modules, each comprising several sessions, could be 
scheduled along a timeline that targets specific developmental periods of challenge through 
the child’s early years (e.g., bonding and establishing responsive caregiving routines in early 
infancy, encouraging toddlers’ autonomy-seeking while setting appropriate limits, 
supporting pre-schoolers’ school readiness skills). A randomized control study to test the 
efficacy of such an approach may be informative in determining how to best balance 
participant retention, adequate dosage and timing of intervention sessions, and cost-
effectiveness. In this study, we judged that the balance achieved by adopting a more holistic 
(multimodular) approach to supporting mothers starting in pregnancy and lasting for the first 
2.5 years of their child’s life was justified, given the wide range of needs. Our approach 
seems to have helped to engage mothers in establishing strong relationships with their family 
coaches and contributed to improving key outcomes for both parents and children. As one of 
our participants stated: “If another mom was considering participating in this program, I 
would tell her that she should definitely do it, because it not only teaches her about her child, 
it helps her put into perspective goals that she needs to achieve to help her better herself for 
her and her child’s future.”
