mycomembrane

The mycobacterial envelope is unique, containing the so-called mycomembrane (MM) composed 
of very-long chain fatty acids, mycolic acids (MA). Presently, the molecular composition of the MM 
remains unproven, due to the diversity of methods used for determining its composition. The plasma 
membranes (PM) and the native MM-containing cell walls (MMCW) of two rapid-growing mycobacterial 
species, Mycobacterium aurum and M. smegmatis, were isolated from their cell lysates by diơerential 
ultracentrifugation. Transmission electron microscopy and biochemical analyses demonstrated 
that the two membranes were virtually pure. Bottom-up quantitative proteomics study indicated a 
diơerent distribution of more than 2,100 proteins between the PM and MMCW. Among these, the 
mannosyltransferase PimB, galactofuranosyltransferase GlfT2, Cytochrome p450 and ABC transporter 
YjfF, were most abundant in the PM, which also contain lipoglycans, phospholipids, including 
phosphatidylinositol mannosides, and only a tiny amount of other glycolipids. Antigen85 complex 
proteins, porins and the putative transporters MCE protein family were mostly found in MMCW fraction 
that contains MA esterifying arabinogalactan, constituting the inner leaƪet of MM. Glycolipids, 
phospholipids and lipoglycans, together with proteins, presumably composed the outer leaƪet of the 
MM, a lipid composition that diơers from that deduced from the widely used extraction method of 
mycobacterial cells with dioctylsulfosuccinate sodium.
Mycobacteria are probably the most successful microorganisms to parasite animals and humans. Among the 
187 valid species described to date in the genus Mycobacterium, only three are strict pathogens for human: 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtu), M. leprae and M. lepromatosis1. Tuberculosis still represents a major public 
health problem worldwide, remaining one of the world leading causes of death from an infectious agent, about 
one third of the world population being infected by the Koch bacillus and susceptible to develop the disease. In 
addition, two-thirds of mycobacteria species are opportunistic pathogens for human, and with large enough 
inoculum, all mycobacteria produce granulomatous lesions in experimental animals2.
Te cell envelope is critical for the mycobacterial physiology, primarily because many crucial processes 
are located in this compartment. Tese include the protection of the bacterial cell from hostile environments, 
mechanical resistance of the cells, transport of solutes and proteins, adhesion to receptors. Te hallmark of myco-
bacteria is their unique abundance in lipid, constituting up to 40% of the dry weight of the tubercle bacillus3,4. 
Te mycobacterial cell wall contains up to 60% of lipids, as compared with some 20% for the lipid-rich cell walls 
of Gram-negative microorganisms4. Tese lipids include the exceptionally-long chain fatty acids (mycolic acids, 
MA) covalently linked to the cell wall polysaccharide arabinogalacatan (AG) and whose esterifying trehalose, as 
well as the numerous classes of exotic compounds typifying the Mycobacterium genus. To these lipids have been 
attributed many of the biological properties of mycobacteria3,4. Tese include the very high resistance of the 
majority of mycobacterial species to most of the broad-spectrum antibiotics, except for instance streptomycin 
and rifamycins2and their recognized impermeability to nutrients, up to 100- to 1,000-fold less permeable than the 
most resistant Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa5.

Despite its clearly established importance, little is known on the composition and arrangement of mycobac-
terial cell envelope constituents, especially when compared to the vast knowledge acquired on the cell envelope 
of Gram-negative bacteria. For instance, it is only recently that the presence of an outer membrane, also called 
mycomembrane (MM), has been demonstrated6–8 by cryo-electron microscopy of vitreous sections (CEMOVIS), 
a very unusual feature for bacteria that belong to the Actinobacteria phylum of Gram-positive (monoderm) bac-
teria. Diﬀerent models have been proposed for the mycobacterial cell envelope3,6–10, which are greatly dependent 
on the determination of its exact composition. Te most recent model11 schematically divides the mycobacterial 
cell envelope in three entities (Fig. 1): an outermost layer (OL), also called capsule in the case of pathogenic spe-
cies3,12, a cell wall (CW) and a conventional plasma membrane (PM). Te capsule of mycobacterial pathogens 
such as Mtu is mainly composed of glucan and proteins, with only a tiny amount of lipids whereas the OL of 
non-pathogens is primarily constituted of proteins13–15. Te CW is a giant tripartite complex composed of the 
MM, AG and peptidoglycan (PG), also known as the mAGP complex3. Te MM exhibits a non-conventional 
bilayer organization in which the inner leaﬂet is made of very long-chain MA linked to AG, which in turn is cova-
lently attached to PG. Te outer leaﬂet of the MM is presumably composed of free - i.e. non-covalently bound to 
the cell – lipids3,9,11. A periplasmic space separates the CW from the conventional lipid bilayer PM6. Importantly, 
others and we have demonstrated that the MM thickness is around 7–8 nm6,8 despite the presence of the very 
long chain of MA (up to C90), which raises important questions about the exact native conformation of MA. 
Tis outer membrane is also supposed to contain porins for the uptake of small hydrophilic molecules – porins 
characterized only in the case of M. smegmatis (Msm)16 and membrane machineries involved in the secretion of 
virulence factors such as the well described ESAT-6 and Cfp10 proteins17–19, whose mechanism of translocation 
across the MM remains largely unknown. In contrast to the OL and MM, the PM has been well studied and 
proved to be similar of those to other microorganisms3. Terefore, determining the composition, localization and

outermost layer (OL) is primarily constituted of proteins, with small amounts of carbohydrate and only a tiny 
amount of lipids. Te cell wall is a giant tripartite complex composed of the outer membrane, the so-called 
mycomembrane (MM), arabinogalactan (AG) and peptidoglycan (PG). Te inner leaﬂet of the MM is made 
of very long-chain fatty acids (mycolic acids) esterifying AG, which in turn is covalently attached to PG. Te 
outer leaﬂet of the MM is presumably composed of lipids extractable with organic solvents, which include 
phospholipids, trehalose mycolates, glycopeptidolipids, and lipoglycans. A periplasmic space separates the 
cell wall from the conventional lipid bilayer PM of phospholipids and proteins whose thickness is surprisingly 
similar to that of MM, around 7–8 nm, despite the presence of the very long chain mycolic acids. Te scales of 
the various cell envelope compartments are based on the data from CEMOVIS6, except that of the OL, which is 
adapted from cryo-microscopy. For clarity, molecules are not drawn on scale. TMM : trehalose monomycolates;

supramolecular organization of outermost layer and MM constituents would represent an important and highly 
signiﬁcant advance in our knowledge of the mycobacteria physiology and pathogenicity.
In a previous work, we have compared diﬀerent methods for lysis and fractionating mycobacteria cells20, 
determining the purity of subcellular fractions by using speciﬁc PM and CW markers. However, it remained 
necessary to obtain more puriﬁed CW and PM fractions to gain insight into the molecular composition of the cell 
envelope, which in turn determines the ﬁnal arrangement of the constituents and its architecture. Te only pure 
MM-containing CW (MMCW), i.e. the envelope devoid of the PM, isolated and characterized so far is that from 
a species belonging to the early branching Corynebacterium genus in the phylogenetic tree of Corynebacteriales, 
using separation of membrane fractions by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation21. As a proof of the princi-
ple, we combined various methods to isolate, for the ﬁrst time, the MMCW of two mycobacterial model species, 
namely M. aurum (Mau) and Msm, virtually free from signiﬁcant contamination by the PM and identify the lipids 
constitutive of the mycomembrane.
Results
Fractionation of mycobacterial cell envelopes on a sucrose gradient and identiƤcation of the 
fractions. 
Te MMCW of C. glutamicum (Cgl) have been separated from the PM by isopycnic sucrose gradi-
ent centrifugation of the lysate obtained afer breaking the cells21. We adapted this technique to the fractionation 
of the cell envelopes of Mau and Msm. Preliminary experiments showed that the growth phase had little eﬀect, if 
any, on the quality of the membrane fractions. Accordingly, the puriﬁcation process was performed with myco-
bacterial cells harvested in the logarithmic phase of growth, ensuring a homogeneous physiological state of the 
cells.
Disruption of the mycobacterial cells in a French press remains the best lysis method for obtaining signiﬁcant 
amounts of cell envelope fractions from these bacteria20. Te membrane fractions of Mau were recovered from 
the cell lysate by diﬀerential ultracentrifugation (Fig. 2). Te 10,000 g pellet (P10) presumably contained the crude 
MMCW whereas the PM was expected into the 100,000 g pellet (P100). Both fractions were then puriﬁed twice by 
identical sucrose step gradients. More than forty diﬀerent gradients were tested to ﬁnally achieve the best separa-
tion of the membrane fractions of Mau using a 10% (w/w) to 60% (w/w) sucrose gradient. Te gradient consisted 
of 10% [1 Vol] – 36% [3 Vol] – 40% [3 Vol] – 42% [2 Vol] – 50% [1 Vol] – 60% [1 Vol]. Following centrifugation 
at 100,000 g, two major homogeneous fractions were recovered: a brownish low-density fraction Mau F1 (density 
[d] between 1.081 and 1.127 g.cm−3), isolated from the P100 pellet, and a light-yellow high-density fraction Mau 
F2 (d between 1.167 and 1.176 g.cm−3), isolated from P10 (Fig. 3A). In both cases, a white band was observed at 
the top of the sucrose gradient. Electron microscopy pictures obtained afer negative staining with uranyl ace-
tate indicated that F1 and F2 fractions correspond to distinct membrane components of the cell envelope. Tey 
contained almost exclusively small liposomes-like particles for Mau F1 and very large unclosed fragments for 
Mau F2 (Fig. 3B). Consistently, the activity of NADH oxidase, a respiratory chain enzyme that speciﬁcally marks 
the PM20,22, was almost absent from the Mau F2, representing less than 3% of the activity measured in fraction 
Mau F1 (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results suggested that the Mau F2 fraction corresponded to the MMCW 
whereas the Mau F1 fraction was assignable to the PM, and that the former fraction was virtually free from sig-
niﬁcant contamination by the latter one.
Based on their surface-exposed lipid composition13, the cell envelope of Msm was expected to be more com-
plex than that of Mau. Not surprisingly, the sucrose step gradient optimized for Mau (10% [1 Vol] – 36% [3 Vol] 
– 40% [3 Vol] – 42% [2 Vol] – 50% [1 Vol] – 60% [1 Vol]) was poorly eﬀective to separate the two membrane 
fractions of Msm. Several attempts were made to optimize the fractionation protocol, with little success. Tese 
included i) the use of degradative enzymes such as α-amylase, lysozyme, β-galactosidase, or α-mannosidase 
to degrade various cell wall constituents, ii) the treatment of grown mycobacteria with Tween 80 prior to their 
lysis to remove the outermost layer, or the treatment of the crude CW pellet with either urea or NaCl to remove

and the PM. Afer mechanical breaking, the bacterial lysate was centrifuged to yield crude cell wall fraction 
(pellet P10), which was then layered on a sucrose step gradient and centrifuged to recover the cell walls. Te S10 
supernatant was centrifuged and the S27 supernatant was used to collect the crude PM fraction (pellet P100), 
which was then layered on a sucrose step gradient.

non-speciﬁc interacting compounds. Finally, it is the use of an amended 10% (w/w) to 60% (w/w) sucrose gra-
dient, consisting of 10% [1 Vol] – 20% [1 Vol] – 30% [3 Vol] – 36% [3 Vol] – 40% [1 Vol] – 50% [1 Vol] – 60% [1 
Vol], that gave, upon centrifugation at 100,000 g, two homogeneous fractions of Msm: a brownish low-density 
fraction Msm F1 (d between 1.081 and 1.127 g.cm−3), isolated from the pellet P100, and a white high-density frac-
tion Msm F2 isolated from P10 (d between 1.127 and 1.167 g.cm−3) (Fig. 3D). Again, a white band was observed at 
the top of the sucrose gradients. Msm low- and high-density fractions exhibited appearances in electron micros-
copy similar to their Mau counterparts: small liposomes-like particles for Msm F1 and very large unclosed frag-
ments for Msm F2 (Fig. 3E). Similarly, Msm F2 fractions contained very little NADH oxidase activity (3.6% of 
that measured in Msm F1, Fig. 3F). Terefore, as for Mau, the above results suggested that the Msm F2 and F1 
fractions corresponded, respectively, to the MMCW and PM, and that fraction Msm F2 was virtually free from 
signiﬁcant contamination by PM.
Biochemical characterization of membrane fractions. 
Although determination of the NADH oxidase 
activity suggested that the high-density fractions F2 and low-density fractions F1 corresponded to the MMCW 
and the PM, respectively, the nature of the isolated bands was established by biochemical analyses, i.e. determi-
nation of the amounts of arabinose and galactose, as AG markers, and glucosamine, muramic acid and diami-
nopimelic acid (DAP), as PG markers. Firstly, the F1 and F2 dry pellets were subjected to triﬂuoroacetic acid 
hydrolysis, then reduced and acetylated. Te resulting alditol acetates were analyzed by gas chromatography cou-
pled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Galactose, muramic acid and glucosamine were found almost exclusively 
in F2 fractions, only traces being detected in the F1 fractions (Fig. 4). Although most of the arabinose was also 
found in F2, signiﬁcant amounts of this sugar were also observed in F1 fractions, consistent with the presence 
of lipoarabinomannan in these fractions (see below). DAP, another PG marker, was detected by GC-MS analysis 
afer strong acid hydrolysis of the fractions, and followed by derivatisation of the products. DAP was abundant in 
the F2 fractions and, expectedly, only traces were detected in F1 fractions (Fig. 4). Tese data demonstrated that 
F2 fractions corresponded to the MMCW and that the fractions F1 were not contaminated by F2. For clarity, the 
two membranes F1 and F2 fractions were called thereafer PM and MMCW, respectively.
Te protein proﬁle of each gradient fraction was determined by SDS-PAGE. Te PM and MMCW fractions 
clearly showed distinctive patterns, suggesting a diﬀerential distribution of proteins within both types of mem-
branes (Fig. 5A,B), and a few of them were identiﬁed by Western blot analysis. As no straightforward enzymatic 
test exists to speciﬁcally characterize the MM-bound proteins, we checked the fractions by immunodetection 
methods for the presence of very well characterized antigenic proteins known to be localized in the CW, namely, 
the mycoloyl transferases (the so-called antigen 85, Ag85)23. Tese enzymes catalyze the transfer of a mycoloyl 
residue from the trehalose monomycolate (TMM) to another TMM molecule to form trehalose dimycolate 
(TDM)24, or to arabinosyl residues of AG to form mycoloylated arabinosyl extremities25–27. Using anti-Ag85

polyclonal antibodies28, we speciﬁcally identiﬁed the Ag85 protein family in the MMCW, without residual signal 
in the PM, of both Mau and Msm (Fig. 5C). In Msm, the MspA protein has been characterized as the major porin 
for hydrophilic solutes uptake16,29,30, and is thus one of the very few speciﬁc proteins whose location in the MM is 
ensured. Anti-MspA antibodies revealed two bands in the Msm MMCW, one of low mass, around 20 kDa, and the 
second one at about 100 kDa, likely corresponding to the monomeric and octameric forms of MspA, respectively 
(Fig. 5E); expectedly, MspA was not detected in the PM of Msm. Finally, we checked for the presence of canonical 
PM proteins in both membrane fractions. Antibodies directed against the β-subunit of the membrane ATP syn-
thase, AtpD (at around 52 kDa), indicated the presence of the enzyme in the PM fractions of both bacteria, while 
it was not detected in the MMCW fractions (Fig. 5D).
Bottom-up quantitative proteomics study was performed on the PM and MMCW of the sequenced M. smeg-
matis mc² 155, in order to determine their protein contents and to evaluate the distribution of proteins within 
the two fractions. Accordingly, trypsin digestion was performed on each fraction concentrated in one band in a 
SDS-PAGE, and the resulting peptides mixtures were analyzed by nanoliquid chromatography coupled to tandem 
mass spectrometry (nanoLC-MS/MS) using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Ten, database search and label free 
quantiﬁcation allowed us to observe a diﬀerent distribution of more than 2,100 proteins based on their intensity 
fold change between the PM and MMCW, as shown in the volcano plot (Fig. 6). Te distribution proﬁle of pro-
teins between the two fractions unambiguously showed that they correspond to two diﬀerent well-separated enti-
ties. Te proteomics study not only conﬁrmed the presence of proteins known to be located in the PM or MMCW 
but also allowed the identiﬁcation and localization of other proteins. As expected, Ag85 complex proteins and 
porins, e.g. MspB, were present in MMCW (Fig. 6). Of note, the putative transporters MCE protein family were 
mostly found in MMCW fraction. On the other hand, mannosyltransferase PimB31, galactofuranosyltransferase 
GlfT232, cytochrome p450 and ABC transporter YjfF, were found to be most abundant in the PM fraction (Fig. 6). 
Te lists of other identiﬁed proteins among outliers (with a <1/3 or >3 fold ratio and a p < 0.01) and their dis-
tribution between the PM and MMCW are given in Tables 1 and 2 (Supplementary information). As previously 
noted21, proteins known to be primarily located in the cytosol and trapped in the liposomes may still contaminate 
the puriﬁed membrane fractions.
Lipid content of the membranes. 
Lipids from each collected fraction were extracted with organic sol-
vents and analyzed by using an automatized High-Performance-Tin-Layer Chromatography (HPTLC) quanti-
tative system. Lipids were loaded on the silica gel plate, then separated in one dimension in an adapted solvent 
and the plates were sprayed with specific reagents that react with amino-compounds, glycoconjugates and 
phospholipids. Using puriﬁed standards, Rf values and reactivity to speciﬁc reagents, we identiﬁed each TLC 
spot corresponding to major lipids composing the MMCW and PM fractions. In both Mau and Msm, the PM 
showed the presence of glycerophospholipids, namely cardiolopin / phosphatidyl glycerol (CL/PG), phosphatidyl

their contents (nmoles per mg of dried membranes) in galactose (Gal), arabinose (Ara), mannose (Man), 
glucosamine (Gln), muramic acid (Mur. Ac.) and diaminopimelic acid (DAP) were determined. F1 (grey

ethanolamine (PE), phosphatidyl inositol (PI) and phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIM). In addition, 
small amounts of TMM, a compound known to be a precursor of TDM, were also observed in these fractions 
(Fig. 7A,B). However, TDM was completely absent from PM, consistent with and reinforcing the fact that there is 
no signiﬁcant contamination of PM by MMCW constituents.
Te MMCW fractions contained important amounts of trehalose mycolates, i.e. TDM and TMM, plus glu-
cose monomycolates (GMM) in the case of Mau F2 (Fig. 7A), due to the presence of glucose as carbon source. In 
addition to TMM and TDM, signiﬁcant amounts of phospholipids (CL/PG, PE and PI, plus some PIM) were also 
detected in the F2 fractions, notably that of Mau, in contrast to Cgl21. To ascertain the presence of phospholipids 
in the MMCW fractions, as opposed to a contamination origin, we reasoned that the amount of lipids attached to 
the AG-PG and forming the inner leaﬂet of the MM (exclusively MA), would be equal to that present in the outer 
leaﬂet if the phospholipids observed derived from contamination. Accordingly, we quantiﬁed the MA attached to

AG-PG and those esterifying trehalose (TMM and TDM), which are extractable with organic solvents. In Mau, in 
which large amounts of phospholipids were present in the MMCW, the amount of MA released by saponiﬁcation 
of the fraction (2.95% of dry cell weight +/− 0.16%) was 4-times higher than that found in the extractable lipids 
(derived from TMM and TDM). Tis data indicated that other lipids, in addition to TDM and TMM, participate 
to the outer leaﬂet of MM of Mau. Consistently, the ratio of MA linked to AG-PG versus MA linked to trehalose 
was 1.6 for Msm, in which less phospholipids were present in the MMCW fraction. Besides, the MA composition 
of both membrane fractions were identical. Te three expected types of mycolates (derived from the saponi-
ﬁcation of PM and MMCW followed by methylation) were identiﬁed by TLC for both species: α-, keto- and 
dicarboxy-MA, for Mau, and α-, α’- and epoxy-MA for Msm, in both PM and MMCW.
Te type-species speciﬁc glycopeptidolipids (GPL) were expectedly found most exclusively in the MMCW 
of Msm (Fig. 7C). Tese lipids have been previously shown to be located on the bacterial surface and in deeper 
compartment of the cell envelope15,33. Te less polar lipids, which represent minor components of the two mem-
brane fractions from the two mycobacterial species (Fig. 7A,B), were composed, as least partly, of triacylglycerols 
(TAG, Fig. 7D). However, examination of the lipid content of a fraction exhibiting the lowest density, at the top of 
all sucrose gradients from the mycobacterial lysates examined, showed that it consists of TAG, probably derived 
from the cytosolic lipid droplets. Consequently, although TAG has been identiﬁed in the lipids extracted from the 
outermost compartments of mycobacterial cell envelope15, the TAG found in the PM and MMCW of both Mau 
and Msm may originate from the cytosol.
Lipoglycan localization. 
PIM, lipomannans (LM) and lipoarabinomannans (LAM) are glycoconjugates 
of the cell envelope but their exact localization still is a matter of debate3. A dramatic reduction of the LAM 
content on stationary phase in Msm has been reported, suggesting that its synthesis is selectively modulated by 
the growth phase34. We checked for the presence of lipoglycans in the two membrane fractions of both Mau and 
Msm using SDS-PAGE afer trypsin digestion of each fraction. PIM, LM and LAM were observed in both the 
MMCW and PM fractions of the two mycobacteria examined (Fig. 8). In both species, the amount of LAM was 
considerably lower in the MMCW than in the PM. Interestingly, in the stationary growth phase, the LAM content 
of Mau decreased dramatically in both PM (3.4-fold) and MMCW (2.4-fold) (Fig. S1). Tis may be due either 
to a response of cells to growth change, to adapt their membrane composition or, alternatively, to the action of 
putative endomannanase to generate arabinomannans, known to be present in the outermost compartment of 
mycobacterial cells13.
Discussion
Te central role of the mycobacterial cell envelope in essential physiological processes makes the determination 
of its composition and arrangement of its constituents an important ﬁeld of research. Presently, these remain 
unproven and deduced either from its global lipid content or from the analysis of detergent-extracted materials. 
Accordingly, we addressed these questions by isolating the native MM-containing CW (MMCW) and PM from 
two mycobacterial model species, Mau and Msm. Both species are non-pathogenic rapid-growing mycobacteria,

and present an outermost layer35. Our choice was based on the fact that Mau is the only mycobacterial species that 
exposes TDM at its cell surface15, suggesting that no polymeric (capsular) substances cover its cell wall. Moreover, 
this strain was largely used in laboratories for studies concerning isoniazid and ethionamide, two antituberculous 
agents36–38. Msm is commonly used and validated as a surrogate study model for slow growing pathogenic myco-
bacteria and its genome sequence is available, facilitating comparison with sequenced mycobacterial pathogens.
We have previously compared diﬀerent methods for lysis and fractionating mycobacteria cells20 and subse-
quently have succeeded in isolating and characterizing the pure MMCW from a bacterium of the phylogenetically 
related Corynebacterium genus, namely Cgl, using separation of membrane fractions by isopycnic sucrose gra-
dient centrifugation21. We thus combined various methods for isolating, for the ﬁrst time, the MMCW of Mau. 
Te purity of subcellular fractions was monitored by using speciﬁc PM and MMCW markers that showed that 
they were virtually free from signiﬁcant contamination by other cell fractions. Te isolation of equivalent frac-
tions from Msm was, however, more diﬃcult to achieve. Te sucrose step gradient optimized for Mau was poorly 
eﬀective to separate the two fractions of Msm and the use of several degradative enzymes to hydrolyze AG and 
PG and detergents to extract and/or remove non-speciﬁc interacting surface-exposed compounds were unsuc-
cessful. Nevertheless, the use of an amended sucrose gradient yielded two homogeneous fractions from Msm. 
PM fractions from both mycobacterial species devoid of speciﬁc CW markers, namely DAP, muramic acid and 
glucosamine, were obtained by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation of lysates. Similarly, MMCW fractions 
were isolated from both Mau and Msm, in which PM enzymatic markers, i.e. NADH oxidase and ATP synthase 
(subunit beta) were not detected by enzymatic assay and western blotting respectively. Immuno-detection by 
Western blotting identiﬁed the well characterized antigenic proteins, the so-called antigen 8523in the MMCW 
fractions but not in the PM. Similarly, the major porin for hydrophilic solutes uptake of Msm, MspA16,29,30, was 
speciﬁcally localized in the MMCW fraction, but not detected in Msm PM. Te fractions were further character-
ized by bottom-up quantitative proteomics study to assess the protein content and its distribution between the 
two membrane fractions. Tese analyses conﬁrmed the occurrence of proteins known to be located in the PM or 
MMCW. Moreover, other proteins were identiﬁed such as the putative transporters MCE protein family mostly 
located in the MMCW fraction and PimB, GlfT2, cytochrome P450 and the inner membrane ABC transporter 
YjfF, mostly present in PM fraction, as expected.
Te inner leaﬂet of the MM is very likely formed by a parallel arrangement of MA (Fig. 1) whereas its outer leaf-
let is presumably composed of various lipids whose composition is a matter of debate. Tis is due to the diversity of 
methods used for determining the MM composition. We thus took the opportunity of having native MMCW and 
PM to address the question of their lipid compositions. Lipids from the puriﬁed PM and MMCW fractions from 
the two mycobacterial species were analyzed by HPTLC. Expectedly, phospholipids represented the major lipids 
of the PM. Tey were also present in signiﬁcant amounts in the MMCW fractions, notably that of Mau, composed 
primarily of trehalose mycolates, namely TDM and TMM, and GMM. Te real occurrence of phospholipids in 
the MMCW fractions was demonstrated by quantifying the MA. Te amounts of MA covalently-linked to the AG 
was 2- to 4-times higher than those found in the extractable lipids of the two mycobacteria, indicating that other 
lipids, in addition to trehalose mycolates, participate to the outer leaﬂet of MM. Interestingly, no phospholipid was 
detected in the MMCW fraction of Cgl21, reinforcing the concept that this class of lipids is really constitutive of 
mycobacterial MM. With the native PM and MMCW in hands, we looked for the presence of lipoglycans in the 
two membrane fractions. Teir localization, notably that of LAM, is still a matter of debate. Again, the methods 
used are crucial for a proper localization of compounds. Although their abundance may vary, according to the 
growth phases, PIM, LM and LAM were all observed in both the MMCW and PM fractions of the two mycobacte-
ria examined, Mau and Msm, the PM being, in both species, the main location of LAM.

Our data on the composition of the native outer membrane, the MM, of Msm differ from that of 
Bansal-Mutalik and Nikaido using detergent-extraction, namely dioctylsulfosuccinate sodium10, in several 
points. Firstly, we showed that the non-covalently bound lipids, presumably constituting the outer leaﬂet of the 
MM-containing CW of the two species examined, are composed mainly of TDM and TMM, lipoglycans and 
phospholipids, and the PM is conventionally composed of phospholipids and proteins. TMM was located by 
Bansal-Mutalik and Nikaido in the PM using the detergent-extraction method10. Although TMM was found in 
the present study in the PM, this is interpreted as molecules transported across the PM to its ﬁnal destination, i.e. 
MMCW (Fig. 1). Importantly, the occurrence of TMM has never been reported in isolated mycobacterial PM3. 
Rather, TMM have been isolated from the cell surface of several mycobacterial species by mechanical treatment15. 
Secondly, we have previously localized glycopeptidolipids (GPL) at the mycobacterial cell surface, represent-
ing half of the bacterial GPL. Te remaining GPL were present in deeper compartments of the cell envelope33. 
Consistently, GPL were found in the MMCW fraction of Msm (Fig. 1). Bansal-Mutalik and Nikaido have pro-
posed that GPL locate in the MM, which is crucial for the mycobacterial life, as demonstrated by the non-viability 
of strains in which the production of MA is abolished39,40. As strains devoid of GPL were found viable, displaying 
no signiﬁcant physiological changes, notably in terms of growth rate, with an apparent intact MM33, GPL, and 
by extension other lipids of the outer leaﬂet of the MM, are likely dispensable, unlike MA for the existence of 
the MM. Finally, Bansal-Mutalik and Nikaido proposed TAG as constituents of the MM. Although consistent 
with our ﬁnding, the isolation of a TAG-containing fraction on the top of all sucrose gradients of mycobacterial 
lysates, suggests that these molecules probably derived from the cytosolic lipid droplets. Furthermore, inserting 
these apolar lipids in a biological membrane is hard to conceive. Based on the identiﬁcation of TAG in the lipid 
extracted from the outermost compartments of mycobacterial cell envelope15, we propose that TAG are part of 
surface lipids that form, with carbohydrates and proteins in a yet unknown manner, the OL above the MM.
Several questions remain to be solved regarding the MM. Among these, the isolation of the MM, instead of the 
more complex and less practicable MMCW. Tis would need the use of degradative enzymes to extract as much 
as possible the AG-PG complex and the loosely bound polysaccharides and proteins, combined with mechanical 
treatments and/or extraction with very low concentrations of Tween-8013,15 these experiments are in progress. 
Another important issue is the occurrence and nature of proteins other than porins, and the arrangement of 
MM constituents. Nevertheless, with the progress in the knowledge of the MMCW composition, it will now be 
possible to study the spatial organization and structure of the MM, which will very likely mark a major evolution 
for the cell envelope structure and the biology of mycobacteria. Te discovery of how mycobacteria select and 
organize their membrane constituents to resist killing should help deciphering the mechanisms involved in the 
mycobacterial pathogenicity and provide new potential targets for tuberculosis chemotherapy.
Methods
Bacterial strains and growth conditions. 
Mycobacterium aurum (Mau) A + (CIP104482) was grown 
in 7H9 Middlebrook broth (BD Difco) supplemented with casitone (0.5%; BD Difco) and glucose (0.2%) at 
37 °C under shaking (180 rpm). M. smegmatis (Msm) mc²155 was grown in 7H9 Middlebrook broth (BD Difco) 
medium supplemented with glycerol (0.2%; Sigma) at 37 °C under shaking (180 rpm).
Bacteria lysis and fractionation on sucrose density gradient. 
Cells were harvested by centrifugation 
at 3,000 g for 15 min at 4 °C and the cell pellet was washed with 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4. Te pellet was frozen 
and cells were suspended in the lysis buﬀer (20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4 containing benzonase (5 µL > 250 units/
mL, Sigma-Aldrich), dithiothreitol (1 mM), AEBSF (0.2 mM; Euromedex) and EDTA (1 mM)). Afer 20 min, 
bacteria were broken by two passages through a French press cell (1,500 bars). Unbroken bacteria were removed 
by centrifugation (3,000 g for 10 min, twice). Te bacterial lysate was then submitted to centrifugation at 10,000 g 
for 40 min to yield crude cell wall fraction (pellet P10). P10 was suspended in 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4 containing 
EDTA (1 mM) and layered on a sucrose step gradient (from 10% w/w to 60% w/w) in SW41 tubes (Beckman 
Coulter). Te discontinuous gradient consisted of 10% [1 Vol] – 36% [3 Vol] – 40% [3 Vol] – 42% [2 Vol] – 50% 
[1 Vol] – 60% [1 Vol], in the case of Mau. It was amended (10% [1 Vol] – 20% [1 Vol] – 30% [3 Vol] – 36% [3 Vol] 
– 40% [1 Vol] – 50% [1 Vol] – 60% [1 Vol]) to achieve a well separation of the two membrane fractions of Msm. 
Te gradients were centrifuged for at least 2 h at 100,000 g. Fractions of 1 mL were collected from the bottom to 
the top, washed and the pellets were resuspended in the same buﬀer, layered on sucrose gradient and centrifuged 
again in the same conditions. Fractions of 1 mL were collected from the bottom to the top, washed and recentri-
fuged (15,000 g, 45 min) to recover the cell walls, which were submitted to biochemical analyses. Te supernatant 
(S10) was then centrifuged at 27,000 g for 30 min and the pellet (P27) was discarded. Te S27 supernatant was 
then centrifuged at 100,000 g for 40 min to collect the crude plasma membrane (pellet P100) (Fig. 2). P100 was 
suspended in 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4 containing EDTA (1 mM) before being layered on a sucrose step gradient 
(from 10% w/w to 60% w/w) in SW41 tubes (Beckman Coulter). Te gradients were centrifuged for at least 2 h at 
100,000 g. Fractions of 1 mL were collected from the bottom to the top, washed and membrane pellets were recov-
ered afer centrifugation (100,000 g, 1 h) and submitted to biochemical analyses. All these steps were done at 4 °C.
Protein analysis. 
Proteins were quantified using the DC Protein assay Kit (Biorad) and separated on 
SDS-PAGE (stacking 5%, resolving 12% acrylamide). For Western blotting, proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE 
minigel (stacking 5%, resolving 12% acrylamide) and transferred on nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 µm) using 
trans-blot turbo blotting system (Biorad). Membranes were blocked with TBS containing milk (5%), then blot-
ted with primary antibodies αMsp A (rabbit), αATP synthase beta (chicken) from Abcam, αHyt 27 (mouse) 
diluted in TBS containing BSA (5%). Afer washes with TBS containing Tween 20 (0.02%), secondary antibodies 
(αrabbit-HRP (goat) from Santa Cruz Biotech, αchicken-HRP (goat) from Abcam and α-mouse-HRP (goat)

from Biorad) were incubated for 1 h. Afer washes, chemiluminescence was detected using the Chemidoc Touch 
Images (Biorad).
Quantitative proteomics analysis. 
Proteomics analyses were performed on biological duplicates of Msm 
PM and MMCW fractions. Preparation of the protein samples for MS analysis is described in the Supplemental 
Information. Brieﬂy, afer a concentration step on SDS-PAGE, proteins from each fraction were in-gel digested 
using trypsin. Ten, the resulting peptides were extracted from the gel and analyzed in triplicate injections by 
nanoLC-MS/MS using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. MS data were searched against the Uniprot M. smegmatis 
mc² 155 database for protein identiﬁcation and label-free quantiﬁcation was performed to compare protein abun-
dances. See the Supplemental information section for further details.
Enzymatic activity detection. 
NADH oxidase activity was measured via the DCPIP reduction at 608 nm. 
Enzymatic reactions were performed at room temperature for at least 1 min in 96-wells plate. 50 µL of membrane 
samples containing the same amount of proteins were incubated in 200 µL of 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), MgCl2 
(5 mM), CaCl2 (10 mM), NaN3 (45 mM), NADH (0.25 mM) and DCPIP (12.5 µM). Te kinetic measurements 
were made with Clariostar spectrophotometer (BMG Labtech) and data were obtained with the Clariostar Mars 
sofware (BMG Labtech). Te values of the slopes were directly correlated to the reaction velocities.
Lipid analysis. 
Portions (400 µL) of the harvested fractions were submitted to a Bligh and Dyer extraction at 
room temperature41. Brieﬂy, 0.8 V of each gradient fraction was incubated in one phase solvent system CHCl3/
CH3OH (1:2, v/v) for 16 h at room temperature. Ten, CHCl3 and H2O (1:1, v/v) were added to obtain two phases 
and organic lower phases were dried under nitrogen. Ten, 100 µg of each lipid fraction (10 mg.mL−1 in CHCl3) 
were analyzed by HPTLC. Merck HPTLC silica gel 60 was developed in CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (65:25:4, v/v/v) 
(CAMAG). Lipids were revealed with primuline (0.01% in acetone/water (8:2)) and the plate scanned at 370 nm. 
Data were treated with Wincats sofware and lipids were relatively quantiﬁed.
Mycolic acid analysis. 
Gradient fractions were saponiﬁed with 2 mL of KOH (40%)/2-methoxyethanol (1:7; 
v/v) for 3 h at 110 °C in a screw capped tube42. Te solutions were acidiﬁed by adding sulfuric acid (20%) to reach 
a pH 1~2. Mycolic acids were extracted 3 times with diethyl ether and the organic phases were combined. Afer 
drying, the resulting fatty acids were methylated using diazomethane and analyzed by HPTLC with CH2Cl2 as 
developing solvent. Visualization was realized by immersion of the plate in a 10% CuSO4 (w/v) solution in H3PO4/
CH3OH/H2O (8:5:87, v/v/v) followed by heating at 150 °C, 20 min.
For quantifying MA, lipids were extracted from wet cells for 16 h with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:2, v/v) at room tem-
perature (60 mL of solvent/g of wet cells), then with CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1, v/v) and ﬁnally with CHCl3/CH3OH 
(2:1, v/v). Te organic phases were pooled, concentrated and washed with water, resulting in the total extractable 
lipids. MA, from total extractable lipids or from delipidated residues (containing AG-bound MA) were saponiﬁed 
and treated as previously described42. MA were separated from fatty acids by column chromatography on Florisil 
using a petroleum ether/diethylether step gradient (0, 5, 10, 20% and 100%, v/v). Each fraction was analyzed by 
TLC developed with CH2Cl2. MA were detected by spraying plates with phosphomolybdic acid (10% w/v diluted 
in ethanol), followed by heating. Fractions containing MA were pooled and weighed.
Lipopolysaccharide analysis. 
Lipoglycans (LAM, LM and PIM) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (stacking 
5% and resolving 15% acrylamide). Samples, containing the same amount of proteins, were digested by trypsin 
(Promega) at 37 °C overnight before the addition of the loading buﬀer. Gels were stained with silver staining43,44. 
Gels were scanned with Chemidoc Touch Images (Biorad) and analysed with Image Lab.
Analysis of diaminopimelic acid content. 
Washed and dried gradient fractions were hydrolyzed with 
6 M HCl (500 µL) at 110 °C overnight. Afer cooling, the hydrolysates were centrifuged at 1,600 g for 20 min. 
Supernatants were dried under nitrogen and esteriﬁed with 2.5 M HCl in 2-propanol (500 µL) for 1 h at 110 °C. 
Afer drying under nitrogen, a treatment with triﬂuoroacetic anhydride (50 µL in 300 µL CH2Cl2) was done 1 h 
at 110 °C45. Afer drying under nitrogen, petroleum ether (1 mL) was added and 10 µL of samples were analyzed 
by GC-MS.
Sugar analysis. 
Washed and dried gradient fractions were hydrolyzed with 2 N CF3COOH at 110 °C for 
2 h, dried under nitrogen and reduced with NaBH4 (10 mg/mL in 1 N NH4OH/CH3CH2OH 1:1, v/v) at room 
temperature for 2 h. Te reaction was stopped with few drops of acetic acid, dried under nitrogen, and acetylated 
with pyridine anhydrous/acetic anhydride (1:1, v/v) at room temperature overnight. Afer drying under nitrogen, 
petroleum ether (1 mL) was added and 1 µL of samples were analyzed by GC-MS. GC-MS analyses were per-
formed using a Termo TraceGCultra chromatograph equipped with an Inferno ZB5HT column (30 m × 0.25 
mm) and connected to an ISQ single quadrupole mass <220 °C with split ratio of 20:1. Helium circulates at a 
constant ﬂow rate of 1.2 mL.min−1 as carrier gas. Te temperature separation program was: initial temperature at 
100 °C and then increased until 300 °C at a rate of 20 °C min−1, followed by 3 min at 300 °C.
Transmission electron microscopy. 
Specimens were prepared for electron microscopy using the conven-
tional negative staining procedure. 20 μL of solution was absorbed on Formvar-carbon-coated grids for 2 min, 
blotted, and negatively stained with uranyl acetate (1%) for 1 min. Grids were examined with a TEM (Jeol JEM-
1400, JEOL Inc, Peabody, MA, USA) at 80 kV. Images were acquired using a digital camera (Gatan US1000, 
Gatan Inc, Pleasanton, CA, USA) at diﬀerent magniﬁcations: × 3,000 for MMCW fractions, × 12,000 for PM Msm 
and × 25,000 for PM Mau.
