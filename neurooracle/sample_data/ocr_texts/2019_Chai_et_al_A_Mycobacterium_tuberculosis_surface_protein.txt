Ubiquitin-mediated xenophagy, a type of selective autophagy, plays crucial roles in host
defense against intracellular pathogens including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However,
the exact mechanism by which host ubiquitin targets invaded microbes to trigger xenophagy
remains obscure. Here we show that ubiquitin could recognize Mtb surface protein Rv1468c,
a previously unidentiﬁed ubiquitin-binding protein containing a eukaryotic-like ubiquitin-
associated (UBA) domain. The UBA-mediated direct binding of ubiquitin to, but not E3
ubiquitin ligases-mediated ubiquitination of, Rv1468c recruits autophagy receptor p62 to
deliver mycobacteria into LC3-associated autophagosomes. Disruption of Rv1468c-ubiquitin
interaction attenuates xenophagic clearance of Mtb in macrophages, and increases bacterial
loads in mice with elevated inﬂammatory responses. Together, our ﬁndings reveal a unique
mechanism of host xenophagy triggered by direct binding of ubiquitin to the pathogen sur-
face protein, and indicate a diplomatic strategy adopted by Mtb to beneﬁt its persistent
intracellular infection through controlling intracellular bacterial loads and restricting host
inﬂammatory responses.

U
biquitin (Ub) targeting to intracellular bacteria plays a
fundamental role in selective autophagy called xenophagy,
a crucial innate immune mechanism in mammalian cells
against intracellular pathogens1. During the infection, various
types of Ub chains, such as K63 and K48 Ub chains, have been
demonstrated to form Ub coat surrounding the pathogens for
recognition by a range of autophagy receptors, including p62
(SQSTM1), NBR1, and NDP52, which couple the Ub-decorated
substrates and LC3, an autophagosomal membrane-associated
protein, to trap bacteria into autophagosomes2–5. But how the
host Ub attaches to the pathogens for triggering xenophagy is still
a mysterious process. Previous studies showed that several
ubiquitin-ligating (E3) enzymes such as RNF166, LRSAM1,
Parkin, and Smurf1 play important roles in directing Ub-coated
intracellular
bacterial
pathogens
or
the
bacteria-containing
vacuoles to autophagosomes3,4,6,7. However, the speciﬁc sub-
strate proteins targeted by those E3 Ub ligases for ubiquitination
remain unclear1,8,9. Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an
ancient successful intracellular pathogen for causing tuberculosis
(TB). Data from previous studies showed that the colocalization
of Ub with Mtb was not completely absent in macrophages
deﬁcient in Parkin and/or Smurf13,4, hinting that additional
mechanisms involved in mediating the targeting of Ub to
mycobacteria.
Apart from being covalently attached to the lysine residues on
protein substrates through E3 Ub ligases-mediated ubiquitina-
tion, Ub could also hydrophobically interact with Ub-binding
proteins (UBPs, known as Ub receptors) that contain the Ub-
binding domains (UBDs), which process is independent of E3 Ub
ligases10. We previously found that the mycobacterial effector
protein PtpA contains an Ub-interacting motif-like (UIML)
region for host Ub binding and innate immune suppression11,
which discovery prompted us to wonder whether there are certain
Mtb surface proteins that could be directly targeted by host Ub
for triggering xenophagy-mediated bacterial clearance. Such
information could be important for developing novel Mtb-host
interface-based anti-TB treatments that are effective for both
drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB, which continues to pose
a serious challenge to the public health worldwide12. Interestingly,
in our efforts to search for novel potential UBPs from Mtb, we
identiﬁed
a
eukaryotic-like
Ub-associated
(UBA)
domain-
containing Mtb surface protein Rv1468c (PE_PGRS29), which
belongs to the mycobacteria-speciﬁc PE_PGRS protein family.
Rather than being ubiquitinated by E3 Ub ligases, Mtb Rv1468c
was directly targeted by host Ub chains through UBA-dependent
interaction, which led to the engulfment of mycobacteria into
LC3-associated autophagosomes for Atg5-dependent autophagic
clearance. Disruption of Rv1468c UBA domain to abolish its
interaction with Ub impaired host xenophagic clearance of Mtb
in macrophages, and elevated bacterial loads in mice with
enhanced inﬂammatory responses. Our ﬁndings reveal a pre-
viously unrecognized role of Ub as an innate immune trigger
that binds to the pathogen surface protein to initiate host
antimicrobial autophagy, which process is independent of the
conventional xenophagy pathway initiated by E3 Ub ligases-
mediated ubiquitination of substrates from pathogenic bacteria or
bacteria-containing vacuoles1,9. Our results also indicate a
potentially important strategy adopted by Mtb to beneﬁt its
persistent intracellular infection through maintaining optimized
intracellular bacterial loads to avoid excessive host inﬂammatory
responses.
Results
Ub directly binds to mycobacterial surface. Mtb was shown to
cause disruption of phagosomal membranes for cytosolic access
at a very early time of infection13,14. By using electron micro-
scope, we did observe that some of Mtb were free in the cytosol of
macrophages as early as 4 h post-infection (Supplementary
Fig. 1a), characterized by being surrounded by none of the host
membranes15. Host Ub was indicated to be associated with either
the membranes of Mtb-containing phagosomes or the surface of
mycobacteria accessing the cytosol for initiating antibacterial
autophagy3,5,16. To determine the direct binding of Ub on Mtb
surface, we used digitonin to selectively permeabilize the plasma
membranes3,17, and found that ~20% Mtb were colocalized with
Ub in bone marrow-derived murine macrophages (BMDMs)
(Supplementary Fig. 1b, c). When using digitonin plus Triton X-
100 to permeabilize both plasma membranes and phagosomal
membranes, the majority of Mtb (~80%) were detected by anti-
Mtb antibody, and ~35% were colocalized with Ub (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1b, c). These data indicate that during Mtb infection
in macrophages, a considerable proportion of Ub directly adhered
to bacterial surface. To further conﬁrm that Ub could directly
bind to mycobacterial surface, we next incubated Mtb cells with
K63 or K48-linked poly-Ub chains (Ub2–7) in vitro, and then
washed and lysed bacterial cells for immunoblot analysis. Intri-
guingly, we found that both K63 and K48 Ub chains could
directly bind to Mtb in vitro, while little Ub chains bound to Mtb
pretreated with proteinase K for degradation of bacterial surface-
exposed proteins18 (Fig. 1a, b). These results indicate that the
mycobacterial surface protein plays a central role in mediating
direct binding of Ub to Mtb. Consistently, confocal microscopy
analysis further showed that a large proportion of Mtb was
colocalized with either K63 or K48 Ub chains after incubation
in vitro, which phenomenon was largely abolished by pretreating
Mtb with proteinase K (Fig. 1c). Collectively, these experiments
indicate that Ub could target to Mtb via direct interaction with
unknown mycobacterial surface proteins in an E3 ligases-
independent manner.
Mtb Rv1468c binds to polyubiquitin via a UBA domain. In our
efforts to search for potential novel Ub-binding surface proteins
in Mtb, we identiﬁed a UBA domain (32–66 amino acids, a
typical UBD in eukaryotic cells) in Mtb Rv1468c using SMART
(http://smart.embl.de)19. The eukaryotic UBAs contain a hydro-
phobic surface patch composed of a cluster of hydrophobic amino
acids, which is indispensable for noncovalent interaction with
Ub20,21 (Supplementary Fig. 2a). To determine the direct binding
of Rv1468c UBA with the speciﬁc Ub chains, we puriﬁed the
GST-tagged wild-type (WT) Mtb Rv1468c and the truncated
ΔUBA (67–370) and UBA (1–72) (Fig. 1d). In vitro precipitation
analysis indicated that Rv1468c directly bound to K63 and K48
poly-Ub, but not mono-Ub, via the UBA domain (Fig. 1e). This
tendency of Rv1468c UBA domain favoring poly-Ub chains is
similar to many eukaryotic UBA domains20,21. We further found
that Rv1468c could bind to all seven types of homotypic Ub
chains (Supplementary Fig. 2b). Notably, there is no lysine in the
sequence of Mtb Rv1468c that could be targeted for conventional
ubiquitination by the E3 ligases10. We thus disrupted potentially
key hydrophobic residues in Rv1468c UBA to examine the
noncovalent interaction between Rv1468c and Ub (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2a, c). Either mutation of V64 or L65 to hydrophilic
glycine markedly reduced the strength of interaction between
Rv1468c and Ub (Fig. 1f and Supplementary Fig. 2c). In HeLa
cells, GFP-tagged V64G or L65G mutant had little colocalization
with HA-tagged Ub compared to WT Rv1468c (Fig. 1g). Thus,
the “VL” motif in Rv1468c UBA is critical for the binding to Ub.
BLAST search in UniProtKB_Bacteria database followed by
phylogenetic analysis indicated that Rv1468c homologs were only
present in mycobacterial species and highly conserved among the

pathogenic mycobacteria (Supplementary Fig. 2d). We further
explored the diversity of Mtb gene Rv1468c in clinical isolates by
using GMTV database (http://mtb.dobzhanskycenter.org)22, and
found only 1 strain with nonsynonymous mutation (A53T) in the
UBA region among a total of 687 Mtb strains (Supplementary
Fig. 2e and Supplementary Data 1), suggesting that Rv1468c UBA
was relatively conserved. Taken together, these results indicate
that Mtb Rv1468c could directly bind to poly-Ub chains via a
unique UBA domain that harbored a conserved VL motif.
Ub targets to Rv1468c on mycobacterial cell surface. Mtb
Rv1468c belongs to mycobacterial PE_PGRS family, which family
proteins are predominantly surface-exposed in bacterial cell
wall23. Therefore, we suspected that Mtb Rv1468c was also a
bacterial surface protein which might be recognized by host Ub
during infection. To test this idea, we deleted Rv1468c in Mtb
H37Rv (Mtb ΔRv1468c), and complemented Mtb ΔRv1468c
strain with WT Rv1468c (Mtb ΔRv1468c:Rv1468c) or Rv1468c
L65G (Mtb ΔRv1468c:Rv1468c L65G) (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b).
We ﬁrst carried out cell fractionation assay of Mtb to characterize
the subcellular localization of Rv1468c, and found that both WT
Rv1468c and the L65G mutant were detected mostly in the cell
wall fraction (Fig. 2a). As controls, Ag85 and GroEL1 were largely
present in the cell wall fraction and cytoplasmic fraction,
respectively24 (Fig. 2a). We also deleted Rv1468c in M. bovis BCG
(BCG ΔRv1468c), or overexpressed Mtb Rv1468c in M. smegmatis
(Rv1468c-M. smegmatis), a nontuberculous species that does not
encode Rv1468c (Supplementary Data 2) for electron microscopy
analysis to further conﬁrm that Rv1468c was indeed expressed on
the mycobacterial cell surface (Fig. 2b). We then investigated if
Rv1468c could mediate the direct targeting of Ub to myco-
bacterial surface in vitro. After incubation of each mycobacterial
strain with K63 or K48-linked Ub chains (Ub2–7), we found that
deletion of Rv1468c, or substitution of Rv1468c by L65G mutant
in Mtb reduced the direct binding of Ub to mycobacteria (Fig. 2c,
d). When Mtb cells were subjected to a short exposure to pro-
teinase K before incubation, Rv1468c as well as the control pro-
tein Ag85, but not GroEL1, were markedly degraded, and the
binding of Ub to Mtb was decreased (Fig. 2c, d). Confocal
microscopy analysis also showed that deletion or L65G mutation
of Rv1468c in Mtb markedly reduced the colocalizations of bac-
teria with K63 and K48 Ub chains in vitro (Supplementary
Fig. 3c–f). These results indicate that Rv1468c UBA domain is
exposed on the Mtb surface to mediate direct binding of Ub to
Mtb. Consistently, when we incubated different M. smegmatis
strains with K63 or K48-linked Ub chains (Ub2–7) in vitro, we
found that Rv1468c-M. smegmatis was able to bind more K63 and
K48 Ub chains as compared to WT M. smegmatis or M. smeg-
matis expressing Rv1468c L65G (Rv1468c L65G-M. smegmatis)
(Supplementary Fig. 4). These results further conﬁrmed that Ub
could indeed bind to Rv1468c UBA domain, rather than non-
speciﬁcally to the mycobacterial outer membrane.
Rv1468c mRNA was upregulated in WT Mtb after infection to
macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 5a), indicating that Rv1468c
was likely to be involved in Mtb-host interactions. Thus, we next
investigated if Rv1468c participates in host Ub targeting to
mycobacterial surface in vivo. To this end, BMDMs were infected
with WT Mtb or Mtb ΔRv1468c and then analyzed by electron
microscope with immunogold labeling to trace host Ub and Mtb
Rv1468c. Mtb cells displayed a triple layered cell envelope25
(Fig. 3a, b), and Mtb Rv1468c was associated with host Ub on the
surface of mycobacterial envelope in macrophages (Fig. 3a).
Besides, we also found a marked reduction of Ub directly bound
to the surface of Mtb ΔRv1468c as compared to that of WT Mtb
(Fig. 3b, c). Consistently, confocal microscopy analysis showed
that Mtb ΔRv1468c and Mtb ΔRv1468c:Rv1468c L65G had a
decreased colocalization with Ub as compared to WT Mtb and
Mtb ΔRv1468c:Rv1468c in macrophages, which became more
obvious overtime during infection (Fig. 3d, e). Furthermore, by
using Ub linkage-speciﬁc antibodies, we found that deletion of
Rv1468c or substitution of Rv1468c by L65G mutation in Mtb
reduced ~2-fold of the colocalization of bacteria with either K63-
or K48-linked Ub chains at 24 h post-infection (Supplementary
Fig. 5b–e). Together, these results demonstrate that Rv1468c
could mediate the direct targeting of host Ub to mycobacterial cell
surface during the infection.
Autophagic clearance of mycobacteria requires Rv1468c. The
Ub system could either participate in host immune defense
against mycobacteria, or be exploited by mycobacteria to facilitate
their intracellular survival11. Thus, we next determined the exact
role of Rv1468c-Ub interaction at the interface of Mtb-host
interactions. Mtb ΔRv1468c and Mtb ΔRv1468c:Rv1468c L65G
had an enhanced viability than WT Mtb and Mtb ΔRv1468c:
Rv1468c in BMDMs (Fig. 4a), suggesting that Ub binding to
Rv1468c was in favor of host immunity. Since Ub attachment to
bacterial surface is a prime step for enhancing “eat-me” signals to
recruit the host autophagy machinery1,26, and Rv1468c was
crucial for Ub binding to Mtb, we next investigated whether
Rv1468c was involved in antimycobacterial autophagy. In mac-
rophages that were activated by rapamycin, a widely used inhi-
bitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to induce
autophagy27,28, Mtb ΔRv1468c exhibited more distinct advantage
of intracellular survival than WT strain as compared to that in
control group (Fig. 4b). On the contrary, when macrophages were
treated by rapamycin along with 3-methyladenine, a phosphati-
dylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor that blocked the initiation of
autophagy27,
the
enhanced
intracellular
viability
of
Mtb
ΔRv1468c was largely abolished (Fig. 4b). Consistently, Mtb
ΔRv1468c had a signiﬁcantly lower proportion of colocalization
with endogenous LC3 and the lysosomal marker LAMP1 as
compared to that of WT strain in BMDMs, and these differences
became more obvious when macrophages were subjected to
autophagic induction by rapamycin, interferon-γ (IFNγ), or
amino acid and serum starvation27,28 (Supplementary Fig. 6).
However, when macrophages were treated with 3-methyladenine,
the targeting of LC3 and LAMP1 to WT Mtb or Mtb ΔRv1468c
was
similarly
suppressed
(Supplementary
Fig.
6).
Further
experiments demonstrated that substitution of Rv1468c by the
L65G mutant in Mtb had same effects as deletion of Rv1468c in
Mtb on reducing the colocalization of bacteria with LC3 and
LAMP1 in BMDMs (Fig. 4c–f). Thus, these results indicate that
Ub targeting to the UBA domain of Rv1468c is crucial for host
autophagic clearance of mycobacteria.
Since subversion of host xenophagy could also result from
impaired ability of mycobacteria to cause phagosomal damage2,
which might be affected by deletion or mutation of Rv1468c in
Mtb. Thus, to rule out the possibility that different degrees of Ub
targeting for the WT and mutant Mtb strains could be due to
differences in their ability to permeabilize the phagosomal
membrane to gain access to the cytosol in macrophages, we
performed confocal microscopy analysis of macrophages infected
different Mtb strains for 4 h followed by selective permeabiliza-
tion of the plasma membranes, and found that all strains
exhibited similar accessibility to anti-Mtb antibody, indicating
that they had comparable accessibility to the cytosol (Supple-
mentary Fig. 7a, b). Consistently, by using electron microscope,
we observed that all Mtb strains showed similar proportions of
bacteria in the cytosol and in the phagosomes at 4 h post-
infection in macrophages (Supplementary Fig. 7c, d). In addition,

we also performed confocal microscopy analysis of infected
macrophages to detect the colocalization of Mtb with galectin-3,
an established indicator of damaged phagosomes caused by
intracellular bacteria29, and found that all Mtb strains had similar
percentages of colocalization with galectin-3 (Supplementary
Fig. 8), further conﬁrming that Mtb-caused phagosomal disrup-
tion in macrophages was not affected by deletion or mutation of
Rv1468c.
Next, we performed electron microscopy assay to further
conﬁrm the machinery of Rv1468c-dependent antimycobacterial

a
considerable number of LC3 particles directly bound to the
surface of WT Mtb, but not Mtb ΔRv1468c (Fig. 5a, b), indicating
that Rv1468c was required for host LC3 coating on the bacterial
surface. Moreover, we also conﬁrmed that Mtb could be targeted
through macroautophagy pathway for degradation, as substan-
tiated by the observation that ~30% bacilli were sequestered in
double or multiple-membraned vesicles in macrophages at 24 h
post-infection15,26,27,30 (Fig. 5c, d). The onion-like multilamellar
structures that typically occurred during macroautophagy against
intercellular pathogens were also frequently observed in WT Mtb-
infected macrophages27,30 (Fig. 5c). By comparison, deletion of
Rv1468c in Mtb markedly reduced the proportion of bacteria
present in autophagosomal vesicles but increased that in host

cytosol (Fig. 5c, d), implying that Rv1468c was probably of
importance for autophagic clearance of cytosolic bacilli whose
surface was exposed for recognition by host Ub. Together, these
data further conﬁrmed that Rv1468c is indispensable for host
clearance of mycobacteria via autophagy pathway.
p62 is involved in Ub-Rv1468c interaction-mediated xeno-
phagy. Autophagy receptors including p62, NBR1, NDP52, and
optineurin (OPTN) have been demonstrated to interact with both
Ub on the protein substrates and LC3 on the phagophore during
the xenophagy of intracellular pathogens1,8,26. Thus, we next
determined whether these autophagy receptors mediated the
interconnection of Ub-bound Rv1468c with LC3 to trigger the
selective autophagy of mycobacteria. In HeLa cells, DsRed2-
tagged Rv1468c were colocalized with both HA-tagged Ub and
GFP-tagged p62, NBR1, NDP52 or OPTN, but Rv1468c (L65G)
did not (Supplementary Fig. 9a). When Flag-tagged Rv1468c was
coexpressing with GFP-tagged p62, NBR1, NDP52 or OPTN in
HEK293T cells, it was able to coimmunoprecipitate with each of
autophagy receptors in a UBA-dependent manner (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 9b, c). Since p62 exhibits the strongest afﬁnity to
Rv1468c and plays an indispensable role in multiple selective
autophagy process by cooperation with other adaptors31–33, we
further performed confocal microscopy analysis to monitor p62
in macrophages during Mtb infection. As expected, deletion of
Rv1468c or substitution of Rv1468c by L65G mutation in Mtb
reduced the aggregation of p62 to the bacteria in BMDMs as
compared to that of WT and Mtb ΔRv1468c:Rv1468c strains
(Fig. 6). Therefore, p62 participates in mediating the Rv1468c-Ub
interaction-triggered xenophagy.
Deletion of p62 or Atg5 impairs Rv1468c-dependent xeno-
phagy. Atg5 was required for cytosolic LC3 (LC3-I) converting to
lipidated LC3 (LC3-II) on the phagophores that initiated the
formation of autophagosomes, and subsequently LC3-II and p62
underwent degradation along with cargoes when autophagy ﬂux
was unblocked1,8,26. Since Rv1468c-Ub interaction-triggered
xenophagy was associated with the recruitment of p62 and LC3 to
Mtb, we thus deleted p62 and Atg5 in RAW264.7 macrophages by
using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene targeting to conﬁrm that this
antimycobacterial process was contributed by host selective
autophagy, and we found that after infection for 24 h, Mtb
ΔRv1468c and Mtb ΔRv1468c:Rv1468c L65G exhibited enhanced
intracellular viability as compared to WT Mtb or Mtb ΔRv1468c:
Rv1468c in WT RAW264.7 cells, but showed little survival
advantage in p62-/- and Atg5-/- RAW264.7 cells (Supplementary
Fig. 10a–c). Furthermore, deletion of p62 or Atg5 in RAW264.7
macrophages reduced the LC3 aggregation to mycobacteria as
well as the colocalization of LAMP1 with all strains (Supple-
mentary Fig. 10d–g). Encouraged by the results from Atg5-/-
RAW264.7 macrophages indicating that deletion of Atg5 could
impair Rv1468c-dependent autophagic clearance of Mtb, we
further generated Atg5ﬂox/ﬂox-Lyz-Cre (Atg5LyzM) mice that
lacked Atg5 in myeloid cells2,34,35 (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b),
and obtained Atg5-deﬁcient BMDMs derived from Atg5LyzM
mice to further conﬁrm the critical role of Atg5 in Rv1468c-Ub
binding-dependent
autophagy.
Consistently,

Atg5LyzM BMDMs, Mtb ΔRv1468c and Mtb ΔRv1468c:Rv1468c
L65G exhibited increased intracellular survival percentage, and
exhibited more distinct advantage of viability when macrophages
were stimulated by rapamycin (Fig. 7a). Deletion of Rv1468c or
substitution of Rv1468c by using L65G mutant in Mtb also
reduced the colocalization of bacteria with LC3 and LAMP1 in
Atg5ﬂ/ﬂBMDMs, but not in Atg5LyzM BMDMs (Fig. 7b–e). Fur-
thermore, the colocalizations of WT Mtb and Mtb ΔRv1468c:
Rv1468c, but not Mtb ΔRv1468c or Mtb ΔRv1468c:Rv1468c L65G,
with Ub increased in Atg5LyzM BMDMs, as compared to Atg5ﬂ/ﬂ
BMDMs, which might be explained by the possibility that host
autophagy ﬂux for degradation of Ub-bound bacteria was blocked
by Atg5 deﬁciency (Supplementary Fig. 11c, d). Taken together,
these data indicate that disturbance of host autophagy pathway by
deletion of p62 or Atg5 impairs Rv1468c-Ub interaction-triggered
clearance of mycobacteria.
Rv1468c-dependent clearance of mycobacteria requires Atg5.
To further explore the role of Atg5 in Rv1468c-Ub interaction-
triggered host immune defense against mycobacteria, we chal-
lenged Atg5ﬂ/ﬂand Atg5LyzM mice with WT and various mutant
Mtb H37Rv strains. Notably, deletion of Rv1468c or substitution
of Rv1468c with L65G mutant in Mtb increased bacterial loads in
the lungs of the control mice, but not the Atg5-deﬁcient mice, at 2
and 3 weeks post-infection (Fig. 8a). Histopathological assay of
lungs also showed that Atg5ﬂ/ﬂmice, but not Atg5LyzM mice,
infected with Mtb ΔRv1468c or Mtb ΔRv1468c:Rv1468c L65G had
larger lesions with increased total cellular and neutrophilic inﬁl-
tration, as well as more abundance of acid-fast bacilli in lung
sections than those infected with WT Mtb and Mtb ΔRv1468c:
Rv1468c at 3 weeks post-infection (Fig. 8b, c). Moreover, by
3 weeks post-infection, Atg5ﬂ/ﬂmice infected with Mtb ΔRv1468c
or Mtb ΔRv1468c:Rv1468c L65G exhibited increased cellular
inﬁltration in livers as compared to WT Mtb and Mtb ΔRv1468c:
Rv1468c; while Atg5LyzM mice infected with each of Mtb strains
had a similar histopathological change in the livers (Fig. 8d).
Consistently, quantitative PCR analysis further detected increased
mRNA levels of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines including Tnf, Il1b

Mtb was probably due to increased bacterial loads that triggered

mycobacterial infection with excessive inﬂammatory responses in
Atg5LyzM mice infected with all Mtb strains, which results were

data indicate that Atg5 is required for Ub-Rv1468c interaction-
mediated host immune clearance of mycobacteria. Collectively,
this study reveals a novel host xenophagy mechanism that initi-
ated by direct binding of Ub to mycobacterial surface protein
Rv1468c (Supplementary Fig. 13).
Discussion

a
host immune defense against intracellular pathogens including
Mtb2–4,26,35. Disruption of host xenophagy pathway by deletion
of core autophagy genes such as Atg5 and Atg7 (refs. 2,35,36), E3
ligases genes Park2 and Smurf1 (refs. 3,4), autophagy receptor
genes p62 and NDP52 (refs. 2,5), or other selective autophagy-
associated genes such as cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)37,38,
Sting2, Tbk12 and IRGM39, could facilitate mycobacterial survival
in macrophages and in mice. In this study, we found that various
autophagy receptors including p62, NBR1, NDP52, and OPTN
were all able to interact with Rv1468c, a UBA domain-containing
Mtb surface protein. Interestingly, deletion of p62 in macrophages
effectively blocked Rv1468c-Ub interaction-mediated autophagy
of Mtb, which ﬁnding is consistent with the previous notion
that those autophagy receptors likely perform non-redundant
functions and probably cooperate to mediate autophagy during

mycobacterial infection8. We also found that deletion of Atg5 in
macrophages almost completely subverted the Rv1468c-triggered
autophagic clearance of mycobacteria, and mice lacking Atg5 in
myeloid cells also failed to exert Rv1468c-elicited host immune
defense against mycobacteria. These ﬁndings are consistent with
previous observations supporting an essential role of Atg5 in
protecting host against mycobacterial infection via its autophagy-
related functions2,26,35. There was also a study showing that Atg5
could modulate neutrophil-mediated pathologic inﬂammation to
control Mtb infection40. In the meantime, it was shown that host
deﬁcient in other autophagy-related genes (such as Atg3, Atg5,
Atg7, Atg14, Atg16l1, and Beclin 1) generally results in hyperin-
ﬂammatory syndromes during the infection35,40–43. Thus, there
exist complicated mutual effects between autophagy and inﬂam-
mation during host-pathogen interactions.
In eukaryotic cells, Ub signaling could be decoded by various
Ub receptors that contain different UBDs for hydrophobic
interaction with Ub, which contributes to the multifaceted reg-
ulatory roles of the Ub system in diverse biological processes
including pathogen-host interactions1,10. In this study, we found
that Mtb surface protein Rv1468c harbors a eukaryotic-type UBA
domain, a typical UBD in eukaryotic cells that have not been
previously identiﬁed in bacterial pathogens. The UBA domain of
Rv1468c could be targeted by host Ub independent of E3 Ub
ligases, thus mediating the aggregation of Ub to the bacteria for
eliciting antibacterial autophagy. Based on our data from in vitro
binding assays, Mtb Rv1468c is able to bind to free-ﬂoating poly-
Ub chains, which Ub chains in eukaryotic cells are emerging as
key factors at the interface of the host-pathogen interactions44–46.
Nevertheless, since both free-ﬂoating and substrate-attached
poly-Ub chains exist within host cells, we do not exclude the
possibility that a portion of Rv1468c may also interact with cer-
tain substrate-attached poly-Ub chains during Mtb infection in
macrophages. Previous studies have demonstrated that E3 ligases
Parkin and Smurf1 speciﬁcally mediate K63 and K48 ubiquiti-
nation of Mtb-associated structures, respectively3,4. While in this
study, we found that Rv1468c could interact with all seven types
of homotypic Ub chains. Moreover, given the fact that no lysine
site is present in Rv1468c for conventional ubiquitination by the
E3 ligases, together with our ﬁnding that it could bind to the Ub
chains in absence of the E3 ligases in vitro, our data indicate
that Rv1468c is not likely to be as a substrate of Parkin or Smurf1,
but rather an ubiquitination-independent Ub-binding target on
mycobacterial surface. In macrophages, the E3 ligases-dependent
ubiquitination of Mtb-containing phagosomes could occur as
early as 4 h post-infection3. As the infection continues, increasing
number of Mtb starts to damage the phagosomes and escape
into the cytosol13,14,16, where the host Ub might target the
unsheltered mycobacteria by direct binding to Rv1468c on their
surface. Therefore, we propose that both Rv1468c UBA-mediated
direct binding of Ub to the mycobacterial surface and E3 ligases-
mediated ubiquitination of Mtb-associated structures are involved
in
Ub-mediated
antimycobacterial
autophagy
during
the
infection.
Initially, it seems counterintuitive that Mtb would retain such a
conserved UBA domain-containing protein like Rv1468c that
functions to mark bacteria for host clearance and thus avoiding
excessive host inﬂammation. In fact, the long-term intimate
interplays between Mtb and the host are quite nuanced, rather
than irreconcilably in conﬂict until one is defeated47. In about
90% of the infected individuals, Mtb could persist in the host by
establishing a latent state instead of causing host severe inﬂam-
matory responses and tissue damage, as many severe and acute
infection-causing pathogens normally do48. Consistently, current
evidence indicates that Mtb strains with relatively attenuated
virulence may be better tolerated by patients for long-term, which
may ultimately lead to an extended duration of illness and
increased Mtb transmission potential49,50. There is also evidence
suggesting that the slowly-replicating phenotypes of Mtb could
help maintain the bacterial population in the host by con-
tinuously adapting to dynamic microenvironments in granulomas
for prolonged infection51. Furthermore, another study suggests
that lower induction of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in infected
individuals might be a contributing factor to the evolutionary
success of modern Beijing strains of Mtb, as compared to the
ancient strains52. Thus, Rv1468c UBA domain-triggered autop-
hagy could be a viable evolutionary strategy adopted by Mtb to
maintain long-term intracellular survival through self-controlling
its intracellular bacterial loads to avoid excessive host inﬂam-
matory immune responses, which might favor prolonged infec-
tion and greater transmission. Interestingly, proteomic proﬁling
of Mtb revealed that Rv1468c is expressed both at the early and
chronic stages of infection53, and the expression of Rv1468c could
be regulated by IS6110 in Mtb54, further suggesting that the
expression and retention of this protein might somehow exert
certain beneﬁcial advantages to the pathogen. Probably, Rv1468c-
triggered autophagy might help preserve indolent growth of Mtb
in vacuolar compartments, since the establishment of a sheltered
niche within vacuoles mimicking normal cellular compartments
could effectively elude host immune surveillance and pathogen
clearance55. This notion could be supported by a variety of stu-
dies demonstrating that the ability to create and maintain a
specialized vacuolar organelle that supports bacterial replication
is an important survival strategy for many intracellular pathogens
such as Mtb, Legionella pneumophila and Brucella abortus56–58.
On the other side, the timely removal of cytosolic bacteria via
Rv1468c-triggered
autophagy could probably minimize the
cytosolic exposure of microbial patterns and balance the intra-
cellular bacterial burden to avoid host excessive inﬂammatory
responses59,60. Nevertheless, the overall effect of the Rv1468c-
triggered autophagy on the ultimate fate of intracellular Mtb may
depend upon multiple factors, including whether the xenophagy
ﬂux, the complete process of xenophagy in which pathogens
contained within autophagosomes are digested by lysosomes, is
compromised or not in Mtb-infected macrophages61. Thus, the
identiﬁcation of a eukaryotic-type domain such as UBA in a Mtb
surface protein for host immune recognition strengthened the
notion that the intimate host-pathogen interactions drive their

dynamic coevolution and antagonism, which regulate the diverse
outcomes of pathogen persistence and host resistance50.
Mtb encodes ﬁve ESAT6 secretion complexes (ESX-1 to ESX-5)
known as type VII secretion systems62. ESX-1 is the most studied
secretion system that shown to be involved in various host-
pathogen interactions2,62. Notably, Rv1468c belongs to myco-
bacterial PE_PGRS family, which family proteins has been
demonstrated to be secreted by ESX-5, another secretion system
of importance for Mtb pathogenicity without fully understanding
of the molecular mechanisms23,63–65. Intriguingly, blocking
PE_PGRS secretion in Mtb or M. marinum, a natural pathogen of
ectotherms with close genetic relative of the Mycobacterium
tuberculosis complex (MTBC), also leads to increased bacterial
loads and inﬂammation in the host64,65, suggesting that the ESX-
5 system and its substrates of PE_PGRS proteins, may play
important roles in triggering host immune defense and mod-
ulating
mycobacterial
virulence
for
persistent
intracellular
survival62,64,65. PE_PGRS family proteins are mostly restricted to
MTBC and are predominately expressed on the mycobacterial cell
surface for direct interactions with the host23. It is indicated that
PE_PGRS proteins might serve as a major source of myco-
bacterial antigens23,66, and the large majority of human T cell
epitopes are conﬁned to the relatively conserved PE domains,
rather than the highly variable PGRS domains, of the PE_PGRS
proteins66, which is consistent with our ﬁnding that the Ub-
targeting UBA domain, which is located in the PE domain of
Rv1468c, is relatively conserved. The sequence conservation of
the Ub-targeting and xenophagy-triggering UBA domain in
Rv1468c, together with evidences indicating that autophagic
induction could enhance the efﬁcacy of TB vaccines by promoting
mycobacterial antigen presentation28,67, suggest that Rv1468c
may serve as a potentially ideal molecular target for developing
novel anti-TB therapies, especially when combined with xeno-
phagy ﬂux-modulating agents. Nonetheless, as noted earlier, there
is a possibility that Rv1468c might be manipulated by the
pathogen under certain circumstances to its own advantage, thus
caution need be taken and both beneﬁts and potential unfavor-
able effects should be considered while choosing to target
Rv1468c for TB treatment.
In summary, our ﬁndings reveal a novel host antimicrobial
xenophagy pathway triggered by direct binding of Ub to a
mycobacterial surface protein, indicating a previously unrecog-
nized role of Ub in host innate immune defense against invading
pathogens. Our ﬁndings also help expand our understanding of
the intricate and dynamic interactions between the host and the
invading pathogens.
Methods
Bacterial strains and plasmids. E. coli DH5α and BL21 were grown in ﬂasks using
LB medium for genetic manipulations or protein overexpression. M. smegmatis, M.
bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis (Mtb) H37Rv strains were grown in Middlebrook
7H9 broth (7H9) supplemented with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase
(OADC) and 0.05% Tween-80 (Sigma), or on Middlebrook 7H10 agar (BD) sup-
plemented with 10% OADC. The BCG and Mtb H37Rv strain with deletion of the
gene encoding Rv1468c (BCG ΔRv1468c and Mtb ΔRv1468c) was created by use of
pJV53 system68. pMV306 plasmid (provided by W.R. Jacobs, Albert Einstein
College of Medicine, Yeshiva University) was used to complement the strain Mtb
ΔRv1468c with WT Rv1468c or create variant strain Mtb ΔRv1468c L65G. The
recombinant M. smegmatis strains overexpressing Mtb Rv1468c or its mutant
Rv1468c (L65G) were created by using mycobacterium shuttle vector pMV261
(provided by W.R. Jacobs, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva Uni-
versity). The recombinant Mtb H37Rv strains stably expressing GFP (pSC301-Mtb)
was created by using vector pSC301 (Addgene; Cat# 31851). The mammalian
expression plasmid for HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) was provided by F. Shao
(National Institute of Biological Sciences, Beijing), and HA-K6 only, HA-K11 only,
HA-K27 only, HA-K29 only, HA-K33 only, HA-K48 only and HA-K63 only
ubiquitin were provided by H. Wang (Xiamen University, Xiamen). The full-length
cDNA of human p62, NBR1, NDP52 or OPTN were ampliﬁed from HEK293T
cDNA. For expression in mammalian cells, genes were cloned into the vector
pEGFP-N1, pDsRed2-N1 or p3 × Flag-CMV14. Prokaryotic expression plasmids
were constructed by inserting the genes into the vector pGEX-6p-1 or pET30a.
Point mutations were generated by using Fast Mutagenesis Kit V2 (Vazyme Bio-
tech). All of the strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study were detailed in
Supplementary Data 2.
Antibodies and reagents. Rabbit anti-Rv1468c antibody was produced and pur-
iﬁed by GenScript Biotechnology11. Brieﬂy, a total of 5 mg of His6-tagged Rv1468c
protein was puriﬁed and solubilized in Freund’s complete adjuvant for injection
into rabbits. The antibody speciﬁc to Rv1468c was isolated by passaging the
immunized rabbit serum on protein A agarose (#sc-2001; Santa Cruz). The fol-
lowing antibodies were used in this study: anti-GFP (#ab1218, Abcam, 1:3000 for
immunoblot analysis), anti-Flag (#F3165, Sigma-Aldrich, 1:4000 for immunoblot
analysis), anti-HA (#3724, CST, 1000 for immunoblot analysis and 1:200 for
immunoﬂuorescence microscopy), mouse IgG1 (#ab18443, Abcam, 1:100 for
immunoﬂuorescence microscopy and 1:10 for immunoelectron microscopy), anti-
ubiquitin (#13-1600, Invitrogen, 1:1000 for immunoblot analysis, 1:100 for
immunoﬂuorescence microscopy, and 1:10 for immunoelectron microscopy), anti-
ubiquitin speciﬁc for K63 (#ab179434, Abcam, 1:400 for immunoﬂuorescence

analysis), anti-Ag85 (#ab36731, Abcam, 1:1000 for immunoblot analysis) and anti-
Mtb (#ab905, Abacm, 1:400 for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy). Murine IFNγ
(#11276905001) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Rapamycin (#S1039) and 3-
methyladenine (#ab120841) were purchased from Selleck and Abcam, respectively.
K63-linked Poly-Ub chains (Ub2–7) (#UC-330) and K48-linked Poly-Ub chains
(Ub2–7) (#UC-230) were purchased from Boston Biochem.
Cell culture and transfection. HEK293T cells (ATCC CRL-3216), HeLa cells
(ATCC CCL-2) and RAW264.7 cells (ATCC TIB-71) were obtained from the
American type culture collection (ATCC). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS;
Hyclone). The transfection of HEK293T or HeLa cells was carried out with the
polyethylenimine method or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturers’ instructions.
Mice. Lyz-Cre mice were from the Jackson Laboratory; Atg5ﬂox/ﬂox mice were a
kind gift of N. Mizushima (The University of Tokyo). Both Lyz-Cre mice and
Atg5ﬂox/ﬂox mice were on C57BL/6 genetic background. Atg5ﬂox/ﬂox mice were ﬁrst
crossed with Lyz-Cre mice. The F1 Atg5 ﬂox/+-Lyz-Cre mice then crossed with
Atg5ﬂox/ﬂox mice to generate Atg5ﬂox/ﬂox-Lyz-Cre mice as macrophage-speciﬁc Atg5
−/−mice and Atg5ﬂox/ﬂox mice as controls. All mice were housed in a speciﬁc
pathogen-free (SPF) facility on the basis of standard humane animal husbandry
protocols, which were approved by the animal care and use committee of the
Institute of Microbiology (Chinese Academy of Sciences).
Preparation of bone marrow-derived macrophages. Bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDMs) were collected from tibiae and femurs of 8–12-weeks old
mice. After lysis of red blood cells, BMDMs were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS, 1% Penicillin-Streptomycin Solution (Caisson) and Murine M-CSF
(Pepro Tech) for 4–6 days.
Generation of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout cell lines. The 20-bp Atg5 or p62-tar-
geting sequences (see Supplementary Data 2) were predicted by the CRISPR design
tool (http://crispr.mit.edu/) and recombined into pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP
(Addgene). The recombinant pSpCas9(BB)-2A-GFP plasmid was transfected into
4 × 106 RAW264.7 cells for 24 h. GFP-positive cells were sorted into single clones
in 96-well plates by ﬂow cytometry using the BD FACSAria III cell sorter (BD
Biosciences). Single clones were identiﬁed by immunoblot analysis and PCR
sequencing after 2 weeks of culture.
Mouse infection. All experiments were performed with age- and sex-matched
groups of 8–12-weeks old mice. Atg5ﬂox/ﬂox-Lyz-Cre mice or Atg5ﬂox/ﬂox mice were
infected with 1.0 × 105 CFU of Mtb H37Rv strains by intratracheal injection as
previously described11. Lung tissues were used for quantitative PCR (qPCR), or
homogenized and plated on 7H10 agar plates for CFU counting, or subjected to
section and stain with hematoxylin and eosin, or Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain. All
animal studies were approved by the Biomedical Research Ethics Committee of
Institute of Microbiology (Chinese Academy of Sciences).

Macrophage infection and colony-forming unit counting. RAW264.7 cells or
BMDMs were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5.0 × 105 cells/well and pre-
cultured for 12 h before infection. Frozen mycobacterial strains were thawed at
37 °C and centrifuged. The bacterial pellet was then thoroughly resuspended in
DMEM medium with 0.05% Tween-80 by vortexing. Thereafter, cells were infected
with Mtb strains at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 or 5 as indicated in the
legends. The media were discarded after incubation with Mtb for 1 h. The cells
were washed with PBS buffer for three times and were then incubated again with
the fresh DMEM medium. For bacterial colony-forming unit (CFU) counting, cells
were washed thrice with PBS buffer and lysed in 7H9 broth with 0.05% SDS at each
time point. Several sets of serially gradient dilution of the lysates were prepared in
7H9 broth and then cultivated on 7H10 agar plates. The colonies were counted
after 3–4 weeks.
Protein puriﬁcation. E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain was used for bacterial expression of
GST-tagged and His6-tagged WT or truncated Mtb Rv1468c and Ub (which was
cloned into pGEX-6P-1 or pET30a vector). The bacterial strains were grown in LB
medium at 37 °C until the OD600 = 0.6. Isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) was subsequently added to a ﬁnal concentration of 250 μM and cultures
were shaking for further growing at 16 °C for 16 h. Cells were then harvested by
centrifugation at 6500×g for 10 min and suspended in a buffer containing 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl for cell-breaking with using Low-
temperature Ultra-high Pressure Continuous Flow Cell Disrupters (JNBIO) or
Ultrasonic Homogenizer (Scientz Biotechnology). Glutathione Sepharose 4B (GE
Healthcare) and Ni-NTA Agarose (Qiagen) were respectively used for puriﬁcation
of GST-tagged proteins or His6-tagged proteins by means of afﬁnity chromato-
graphy, followed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superose 6 Increase 10/
300 GL column (GE Healthcare). A total of 5 mg His6-tagged Rv1468c were then
used for preparation and puriﬁcation of anti-Rv1468c antibody by GenScript
Biotechnology.
qPCR analysis. Lung tissues of mice were used for total RNA extraction with
RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen). For Mtb-infected macrophages, approximately 5 ×
106 cells were harvested and lysed. The total RNA from mycobacteria was then
extracted with a Bacterial RNA Extraction Kit (Dongsheng Biotech). The reverse-
transcription of RNA was accomplished by using a 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis
SuperMix (Yeasen) and performed to qPCR analysis with KAPA SYBR FAST
qPCR Kit (KAPA Biosystems) on ABI 7300 system (Applied Biosystems) as pre-
viously described11. Quantitative expression of targeted gene was normalized to
Gapdh for mouse genes or 16S ribosomal RNA for mycobacterial genes. All qPCR
primers were listed in Supplementary Data 2.
Cell staining and immunoﬂuorescence microscopy. Alexa Fluor 488 succinimi-
dyl ester (Invitrogen) was used for bacteria staining. Brieﬂy, the bacterial strains
were washed thrice with Hanks’ Balanced Salt Solution (Beyotime) containing
0.05% Tween-80 by vortexing and resuspended in the buffer with adequate dye for
30 min at 37 °C. Then the bacterial was again extensively washed and prepared in
DMEM medium with 0.05% Tween-80 for infection. HeLa cells or macrophage
cells were seeded on poly-lysine-coated coverslips and transfected or infected as
described above. At designated time points, cells were gently washed with PBS
buffer and ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at RT. The cells were
washed again and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min. After
three washes, the cells were blocked with 2% BSA for 30 min, subsequently incu-
bated in indicated primary antibodies diluted in 2% BSA for 1 h. The cells then
washed again, and incubated in Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibodies (Molecular
Probes) for another hour. After successively washed with PBS buffer and deionized
water, the coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using DAPI Staining Solution
(Leagene Biotechnology). Confocal images were taken with Olympus FV1000
confocal microscope and analyzed by FV10-ASW 3.0 software.
Immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation. Cells were lysed in the Cell Lysis
Buffer for Western and IP (Beyotime) or RIPA Lysis Buffer (Beyotime) supple-
mented with 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF). Proteins were sepa-
rated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes
(Millipore). The membranes were blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder in Tris-
buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature (RT) and
subsequently incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The membranes
were then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated
to HRP for 1 h at RT after three washes of 10 min each with TBST. Finally, the
membranes were developed by Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP
Substrate (Millipore) after three washes with TBST again and exposed to X-ray
ﬁlm. For immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and 1% protease
inhibitor cocktail (Bimake). Cell lysates were incubated with anti-Flag M2 Afﬁnity
Gel (Sigma-Aldrich) for immunoprecipitation of Flag-tagged in a vertical rotator
(Scientz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 5 h. After ﬁve washes with lysis buffer, the
immunocomplexes bound in afﬁnity beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
blotted with indicated antibodies.
Cell fractionation and proteinase K sensitivity assay. Mycobacterial strains
were grown in 50 ml of 7H9 medium until mid-log phase and harvested by cen-
trifugation at 3000×g for 15 min at 4 °C. Each sample of the subcellular fraction was
isolated by ultracentrifugation18. The bacterial pellets were washed twice with PBS
buffer and resuspended in 10 ml of PBS buffer added with 1% protease inhibitor
cocktail. Cells were then sonicated by Ultrasonic Homogenizer with an operating
cycle of 3 s on and 7 s off at 200 W for 15 min on ice. Fragmentized cells were
centrifuged at 3000×g, 4 °C for 15 min to precipitate cell debris. The supernatants
were transferred into fresh tubes and centrifuged at 27,000×g at 4 °C for 30 min in
an Optima XE-100 ultracentrifuge (SW41Ti rotor) to precipitate cell wall. The
supernatants were collected and precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA)
and washed with 80% acetone for preparation of bacterial cytosolic proteins. For
proteinase K sensitivity assay, 20 ml logarithmic phase bacterial cultures were
harvested, subsequently washed and resuspended in PBS buffer. Cells were then
equally divided into two aliquots, one of which was incubated with 100 μg/ml
proteinase K (Merck) in a vertical rotator at 4 °C for 15 min. Protease inhibitor
cocktail was added into samples to terminate the reaction followed by two washes
with PBS buffer.
In vitro Mtb-Ub binding assay. A total of 8 ml logarithmic phase bacterial cul-
tures were harvested, subsequently washed and resuspended in PBS buffer. Cells
were then equally divided into two aliquots, one of which was subjected to short
exposure with proteinase K as described before. After extensive wash with PBST
buffer, bacteria were resuspended and incubated with 10 µg of K63-linked poly-Ub
(Ub2–7) or K48-linked poly-Ub (Ub2–7) in 500 μl PBST buffer supplemented with
0.1 mg/ml BSA. After incubation at 4 °C for 4 h, bacteria were extensively washed
with PBST buffer and were precipitated by centrifugation at 3600×g at 4 °C for 5
min. For immunoblot analysis, bacteria were resuspended in an appropriate
volume of 1 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer followed by boil for 10 min to obtain the
samples of bacterial lysates. For immunoﬂuorescence assay, bacteria were resus-
pended in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 15 min at RT for ﬁxation followed by
blocking in PBST containing 2% BSA for 30 min at RT, and immunostained by
using anti-Ub antibody as described before to prepare the samples for detection.
In vitro precipitation assay. For the precipitation assay, 10 μg of GST and GST-
protein fusions GST-Rv1468c and indicated truncated proteins were immobilized
onto 20 μl of Glutathione Sepharose 4B resins in 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mM
Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT and 0.1% NP-40) supplemented with 1%
protease inhibitor cocktail for 1 h at 4 °C. The resins were then washed three times
with binding buffer and incubated with 10 µg of puriﬁed His-tagged mono-Ub,
K63-linked poly-Ub (Ub2–7) or K48-linked poly-Ub (Ub2–7) in 500 μl binding
buffer supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml BSA. After 4 h of incubation at 4 °C, beads
were extensively washed and the bound protein complexes were subjected to SDS-
PAGE and blotted with indicated antibodies.
Selective permeabilization with digitonin. Macrophage cells seeded on coverslips
were infected with dyed Mtb strains as described before. Cells were washed thrice
with KHM buffer (110 mM KOAc, 20 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.2) and
treated by 50 μg/ml digitonin (Abcam) diluted in KHM buffer at RT for 1 min to
selectively permeabilize the plasma membranes17. After immediately washed with
KHM buffer, coverslips were submerged in blocking buffer (PBS buffer containing
1% BSA) for 10 min and then incubated with indicated primary antibodies at 30 °C
for 20 min. After washed thrice with PBS buffer, coverslips were incubated in Alexa
Fluor 594 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes). For complete permeabilization
of cell membrane as control, cells were further treated with 0.2% Triton X-100 after
digitonin permeabilization, followed by blocking and incubation with antibodies as
described above. Stained cells were washed extensively and subjected to immu-
noﬂuorescence analysis.
Transmission electron microscopy. BMDMs infected with mycobacteria were
collected by centrifugation and washed by PBS buffer for three times and ﬁxed with
2.5% glutaraldehyde overnight. Cells were post-ﬁxed with 1% osmium tetroxide for
2 h, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and embedded in SPI-PON 812 resin
and polymerized for 24 h at 60 °C. Ultrathin sections (~70 nm) were cut by
microtome (Leica EM UC7), mounted on copper grids, and stained with uranyl
acetate and lead citrate. For immunoelectron microscopy, ultrathin cryosections of
mycobacterial cells or BMDMs were prepared69. Brieﬂy, the cells were ﬁxed with
4% PFA and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS at 4 °C for 2 h, and were subsequently
embedded with 12% gelatin and inﬁltrated with 2.3 M sucrose in PBS overnight at
4 °C, and were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and cryosectioned (Tokuyasu
method). Ultrathin cryosections were obtained by Leica EM FC7 microtome, which
were then collected on grids using sucrose and methylcellulose. The rabbit anti-
Rv1468c antibody (1:200 diluted), mouse anti-Ub (1:10 diluted), or rabbit anti-
LC3B (1:50 diluted) were used for detection of designated proteins on the grids
containing mycobacterial cells or BMDMs infected with mycobacteria. The goat
anti-rabbit 10-nm or 6-nm gold conjugates (1:200 diluted; Aurion), or the goat
anti-mouse 10-nm gold conjugates (1:200 diluted; Aurion) were used for immu-
nolabelling. The grids were incubated for 1 h with primer antibodies and subse-
quently with second antibodies at room temperature. Finally, samples were stained

Statistical analysis. Unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-tests, one-way ANOVA, or
two-way ANOVA analysis followed by multiple comparisons was used for statis-
tical analysis as indicated in the corresponding ﬁgure legends. The quantiﬁed data
with statistical analysis were performed using GraphPad Prism 8.0. P < 0.05 was
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.
