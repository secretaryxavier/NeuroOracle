Abstract
Background: To measure the serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in deficit schizophrenia (DS), in order to examine the association between these two
neurotrophic factors (NFs) and cognitive performance.
Methods: A total of 109 male patients [51 DS and 58 non-deficit schizophrenia (NDS)] with schizophrenia and 40
sex and age matched healthy controls (HC) participated in this study. Processing speed, attention, executive function,
and working memory of all subjects were assessed by means of a battery of classical neuropsychological tests. Serum
BDNF and GDNF levels were measured simultaneously using a double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
Results: There were significant differences in the overall cognitive test scores between three groups (all p < 0.001).
Serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in patients (DS and NDS) than in HC (p < 0.001). Furthermore, BDNF levels
were lower in the DS compared to the NDS group, although not significantly. However, there was no difference in the
GDNF levels between patients (DS and NDS) and HC. GDNF levels were positively correlated with scores of Stroop
words only (r = 0.311, p = 0.033), Stroop colors only (r = 0.356, p = 0.014) and Stroop interference (r = 0.348, p = 0.016) in
DS group.
Conclusion: Serum BDNF may be an unsuitable biomarker for DS, despite a significant decrease in schizophrenia
patients. The different neurocognitive performance between the DS and NDS patients indicates that DS may be a
separate clinical entity of schizophrenia. Finally, higher serum GDNF levels are associated with better cognitive
performance in DS patients, indicating a possible neuroprotective function in DS.

Background
Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder result-
ing from abnormal brain development. Previous studies
suggest that the etiology of schizophrenia is a combination
of genetics and environmental factors, which lead to mal-
development of the central nervous system (CNS) and
impaired neurotransmission [1, 2]. Neurodevelopmental
aberrations influenced by neurotrophic factors (NFs) are
important
paradigms
in understanding schizophrenia
pathogenesis.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as one of
NFs, is thought to be the key in the development and
maintenance of cortical neurons and synapses. BDNF is
widely distributed in the CNS and plays an important
role in the survival, differentiation and growth of
neurons during the developmental stages in neonatal in-
dividuals, synaptic plasticity and behavior in adulthood
[3, 4]. Many evidences suggest that BDNF is involved in
the pathophysiological process of schizophrenia [5]. Pre-
vious studies have shown that peripheral BDNF in
patients with chronic or first-episode schizophrenia are
decreased, while BDNF mRNA was reduced in the post-
mortem brain of patients [6–8]. However, other reports
have shown inconsistent results [9]. BDNF is also associ-
ated with learning and memory, as demonstrated in gene
knockout animal model [10]. Schizophrenics have a wide
range of cognitive deficits, such as learning, memory,
executive function and attention. Animal models and
clinical trials have also shown that BDNF levels are posi-
tively correlated with cognitive impairment [8, 11–13].
Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is
one of the most potent trophic factors for dopaminergic
neurons of the mammalian CNS. The most prominent
feature of GDNF is its ability to support the survival of
dopaminergic and motorneurons. GDNF heterozygous
mutant mice showed the impaired water-maze learning
performance, indicating its role in cognitive abilities
[14]. Therefore, GDNF may be potentially relevant to
the dopaminergic and neurodevelopmental hypothesis of
schizophrenia. Four studies published so far on GDNF
serum levels in schizophrenia [8, 15–17] have shown
inconsistent results, two of which suggested that serum
GDNF levels were associated with cognitive function
[8, 15]. Considering these conflicting results, the rela-
tionship between NFs and schizophrenia needs to be
studied further. The inconsistency of previous studies
on the association of BDNF and GDNF with schizo-
phrenia may be related to the confounding effects of
the severity of symptoms, age, gender, sample popula-
tion, different stages of illness and medication history.
However, since schizophrenia is a complex and het-
erogeneous disorder, studying specific clinical pheno-
types rather than the whole spectrum would be more
beneficial to better understand the disease.
Since Carpenter described deficit schizophrenia (DS)
in a homogeneous subclass of schizophrenia patients
characterized by primary and continuous negative symp-
toms, a large number of studies have shown that the
deficit and non-deficit forms of schizophrenia (DS and
NDS) differ in several parameters, such as biological cor-
relates, risk factors, etiological factors and treatment
response [18]. There is mounting evidences that DS may
be a distinct subtype of schizophrenia, which may help
to reduce the heterogeneity of this disease. Akyol et al.
reported that the serum BDNF levels in DS were signifi-
cantly lower than those in the healthy individuals, while
those in NDS patients were similar to normal levels [19].
In contrast, Valiente-Gómez et al. did not find any
significant differences across the three groups [20]. To
our best knowledge, there is no report on serum levels
of GDNF in DS patients, neither literatures on the asso-
ciation between serum BDNF or GDNF concentrations
and cognitive dysfunction in DS patients.
Although there have been inconsistencies in the stud-
ies that investigated the BDNF and GDNF levels in
patients with schizophrenia; the majority of the studies
revealed that these two NFs are closely related to the
pathological process of this disease [7–9, 15–17]. At
present, the research on BDNF levels in DS patients is
also inconsistent. Therefore, the present study aimed to
probe whether there is a discrepancy between patients
with DS, NDS, and healthy controls (HC) in terms of
serum BDNF and GDNF levels. Meanwhile, we would
like to evaluate the relationship between BDNF or
GDNF levels and cognitive impairment in DS.
Methods
Participants
A total of 109 consecutive male patients with clinically
stable schizophrenia from the Wutaishan Hospital of
Yangzhou,
Jiangsu
Province,
and
40
sex
and
age
matched HC were recruited for this study. All patients
met the Diagnostic Interview and the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual-IV (DSM-IV) criteria for schizophre-
nia, which was confirmed by two independent senior
psychiatrists on the basis of the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV (SCID). In addition, the patients
had the chronic course of disease at least 5 years, and
had received stable doses of oral antipsychotic drugs for
at least 12 months before recruitment. As the patients
were prescribed different antipsychotic drugs, all drugs
were converted into chlorpromazine equivalents in order
to compare the medium dose of antipsychotics between
DS and NDS groups. DS diagnosis was confirmed based
on the Chinese version of the Schedule for Deficit
Syndrome (SDS-C) [21]. The enrolled patients were
divided into 51 DS and 58 NDS based on the SDS-C.
Exclusion criteria included a history of head injury,

neurological disorders, dementia, mental retardation or
significantly impaired vision and red-green colorblindness,
comorbidities involving major organs, alcohol/substance
abuse or dependence, and electroconvulsive therapy.
Healthy controls with no personal or family history of
psychiatric disorders were recruited through advertise-
ments in the local community. None of them had any
history of drug and alcohol abuse/dependence, nor sig-
nificantly impaired vision and red-green colorblindness.
All subjects were Han Chinese aged between 30 and 60
years, and were assessed in terms of weight and height
in order to calculate their body mass index (BMI). The
study protocol was approved by the ethical review com-
mittee of the local hospital, and all subjects participated
after giving written informed consent.
Assessment of clinical symptoms
Two psychiatrists with minimum 5 years’ experience in
clinical practice assessed the psychopathology of the pa-
tients using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS),
the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms
(SANS), and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive
Symptoms (SAPS). To ensure consistency and reliability
of ratings across the participants, the two psychiatrists
attended a training session on these clinical scales prior
to the study. The 18-item BPRS was classified into
positive, negative, disorganized, and affect symptom sub-
scores based on the findings of the most comprehensive
factor analysis [22].
Neurocognitive assessments
Processing speed, attention, executive function, and
working memory were assessed by classical neuropsycho-
logical tests like Digit Vigilance test (DVT), Verbal
Fluency tests (VFT-animals and VFT-actions), Stroop
Color-Word test (SCWT), Block Design (Wechsler adult
intelligence scale-Chinese Revision WAIS-RC), and Paced
Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT). The cognitive
functions of all subjects were examined by two experi-
enced psychiatrics in a fixed test laboratory.
Measurement of serum BDNF and GDNF levels
Serum samples from all participants were collected
between 7 and 9 a.m. at the same time following an
overnight fast, and stored at −80 °C till analysis. Serum
BDNF and GDNF levels were measured by ELISA
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA). Each sample was tested twice for
BDNF and GDNF levels and the mean of two mea-
surements were used for statistical analysis. Inter- and
intra-assay variation coefficients of each NF were less
than 5%.
Statistical analysis
All data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for
Social Sciences (SPSS) version 13.0. Test scores are pre-
sented as means with standard deviations. Categorical
variables were analyzed by the chi-square test. Probabil-
ity values were based on two-samples t-tests or one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables.
Bonferroni test was used as the post hoc test of
ANOVA. There were significant differences of education
duration among three groups, therefore education dur-
ation was performed as a covariate in the comparison of
neuropsychological performances and NFs levels by the
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with post hoc Bonfer-
roni correction as appropriate. When comparing the
cognitive performance and NFs levels between the DS
and NDS group, the BPRS negative symptoms and SANS
scores were performed as a covariate because they were
higher in the DS group than in the NDS group. Correl-
ation analysis was performed by partial correlation test.
For all analyses, the significance level (p value) was set at
0.05.
Results
Sample characteristics
As shown in Table 1, no significant differences were
present between the patients and HC in terms of age
and BMI, except for education (p = 0.023). There were
also no significant differences in the age of onset, dur-
ation of illness, and smoking ratio between the two
patient groups. In addition, their antipsychotic medica-
tion doses were similar when converted to equivalent
doses of chlorpromazine [23]. As expected, the DS
patients showed more severe total and negative psycho-
pathological symptoms (all p < 0.001) than the NDS
patients, but both groups had similar positive, affect or
disorganized
symptoms
(all
p > 0.05).
None
of
the
patients were receiving antidepressant or mood-stabiliz-
ing drugs.
Cognitive performance in schizophrenia and HC
The performance of cognitive tests is summarized in
Table 2. The inter-group differences were analyzed by
ANOVA, which indicated significant differences in the
overall scores (all p < 0.001). Post hoc analysis revealed
that the DS group performed significantly worse than
the HC as well as the NDS group in terms of overall
cognitive test scores. The NDS group also performed
significantly worse than the HC group in all cognitive
tests (all p < 0.01), except for DVT (p > 0.05).
Serum BDNF and GDNF in schizophrenia and HC
Serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in the patients
compared to the HC (2.72 ± 1.85 ng/ml vs. 3.43 ± 1.71 ng/ml
vs.
9.86 ± 4.01 ng/ml,
F = 96.456,
p < 0.001)(Fig.
1a).

Furthermore, BDNF levels showed a tendency of decrease in
the DS group than the NDS group, but without statistical
significance (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in
the GDNF levels of the patients (DS and NDS) and HC
(527.32 ± 136.86 pg/ml
vs.
587.03 ± 193.90 pg/ml
vs.
547.49 ± 134.66 pg/ml, F = 1.992, p = 0.140) (Fig. 1b).
The relationships between BDNF or GDNF levels and
cognitive functioning
GDNF levels were positively correlated with scores of
Stroop words only (r = 0.311, p = 0.033), Stroop colors
only (r = 0.356, p = 0.014) and Stroop interference (r =
0.348, p = 0.016) in DS group (Fig. 2a, b and c). There
were no correlations between either BDNF or GDNF
levels and the cognitive tests in NDS and HC groups.
Discussion
Our study for the first time detected serum BDNF and
GDNF levels in patients with DS and NDS in Chinese
population [24]. Given that serum BDNF levels might be
influenced by the menstrual cycle, we only chose male
individuals as research subjects [25]. It has been re-
ported that the peripheral levels of BDNF can reflect the
changes of CNS levels [26]. A large amount of evidence
showed BDNF may be related to the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia because of its role in the development, re-
generation, survival and maintenance of brain neurons
[9, 27]. Some literatures reported that the levels of
BDNF and TrkB receptor mRNA in prefrontal cortex
and hippocampus of patients with chronic schizophrenia
were significantly decreased [28, 29]. Our study also
found a significant reduction of serum BDNF in the

chronic schizophrenic patients (DS and NDS) compared
to HC, which is consistent with many previous studies
[12, 30]. However, no significant differences in serum
BDNF were seen between the DS and NDS subgroups,
while only a slight decrease was found in the DS pa-
tients. This is also consistent with a previous study
showing decreased serum BNDF in the schizophrenic
patients compared to the healthy individuals, without
any significant difference between the DS and NDS sub-
groups [20]. In another study, Akyol et al. reported
reduced serum BDNF levels in the DS patients com-
pared to the controls but no significant difference be-
tween
the
NDS
and
control
groups
[19].
These
contradictory findings may be attributed to confounding
factors like the patients’ age, gender, severity of the
illness, treatment modules, and the genetic background
of the patients. Notably, both male and female schizo-
phrenic patients were included in Akyol’s study.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
explore the serum GDNF levels in DS patients. However,
we didn’t find any significant differences among the DS,
NDS and HC groups in terms of serum GDNF, which is
consistent with one recent study that reported similar
serum
GDNF
levels
in
the
chronic
schizophrenia
patients and controls [15]. Another study also showed
no differences in serum GDNF between female schizo-
phrenia patients and healthy individuals [16]. Our previ-
ous study have demonstrated that serum GDNF were
significantly lower in drug-free schizophrenic patients
than in healthy controls, and the reduced serum GDNF
Fig.1 a Serum BDNF levels in DS and NDS patients and HC. b Serum GDNF levels in DS and NDS patients and HC. a shows that serum BDNF
levels were significantly lower in the patients (DS:2.72 ± 1.85 ng/ml, NDS: 3.43 ± 1.71 ng/ml) compared to the HC (9.86 ± 4.01 ng/ml) (F = 96.456,
p < 0.001). But there is no difference in the BDNF levels between DS and NDS (p > 0.05). b shows that there is no difference in the GDNF levels of
the patients (DS and NDS) and HC (527.32 ± 136.86 pg/ml vs. 587.03 ± 193.90 pg/ml vs. 547.49 ± 134.66 pg/ml, F = 1.992, p = 0.140)

gradually returned to normal levels with the improve-
ment in psychiatric symptoms following antipsychotic
therapy [31]. Increase in GDNF levels during treatment
is in line with a few previous studies that showed that
antipsychotic medications stimulated C6 glioma cells to
secrete GDNF [32], and enhanced GDNF signaling in
experimental [33] and clinical settings [34]. In our study,
the chronic schizophrenia patients had received long-
term
antipsychotic
treatment
during
hospitalization,
which likely altered their serum GDNF levels to near
normal levels. Therefore, more detailed longitudinal
studies are required to determine if GDNF may be asso-
ciated with the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and the
response to pharmacological treatment. In contrast,
Tunca et al. reported lower serum GDNF levels in
schizophrenic inpatients or outpatients who received
antipsychotic and antidepressant treatment [17]. The
likely reasons for this discrepancy could be the different
ages and antipsychotic drug doses in the two studies.
Another major finding of our study is the significant
difference in the cognitive scores, except that for DVT,
seen in the pairwise comparisons between DS, NDS and
HC groups. These findings are consistent with that of
our previous study indicating greater impairments in
every neuropsychological measure and cognitive domain
in the DS compared to the NDS patients [35]. The
present study provided evidence to support the hypoth-
esis that the deficit syndrome may be a specific subgroup
within schizophrenia. In addition, this is the first study
to correlate BDNF and GDNF levels with cognitive dys-
function in DS and NDS patients. Consistent with one
study reporting no correlation between the serum levels
of BDNF and cognitive functions in schizophrenia pa-
tients [36], we also found that BDNF serum levels were
not related to cognitive function in DS, NDS, and HC
groups. However, the reported BDNF levels in healthy
controls were negatively correlated with verbal working
memory in this article. In a recent study of a Chinese
sample, the authors found that there was no correlation
between serum BDNF levels and cognitive function in
patients with first-episode schizophrenia and healthy
controls [37]. Our result contradicts previous studies on
chronic schizophrenia patients [12, 13] and a recent
meta-analysis [5], which suggested that higher BDNF ex-
pression was associated with better neurocognitive per-
formance in schizophrenia patients. Several factors can
account for this discrepancy, such as different cognitive
tests used, the duration of the illness, comorbidities,
smoking, diet, obesity and even genetic background of
the patients.
The third major finding of our study is that higher
serum levels of GDNF are associated with better per-
formance on Stroop words only, Stroop colors only and
Stroop interference in the DS group. However, no
Fig.2 a Correlation between serum GDNF levels and the Stroop
words in DS. b Correlation between serum GDNF levels and the

the Stroop interference in DS. a, b and c shows that GDNF levels were
positively correlated with scores of Stroop words only (r = 0.311,
p = 0.033), Stroop colors only (r = 0.356, p = 0.014) and Stroop
interference (r = 0.348, p = 0.016) in DS group

significant correlations were observed between GDNF
and cognitive test scores in either the NDS or HC
groups. Stroop interference test is used to evaluate cog-
nitive flexibility which is one of the critical roles of
executive function domain, whereas Stroop words only
and Stroop colors only test provides information on sus-
tained attention. Our results indicate that lower GDNF
serum levels in DS patients are related to more severe
cognitive impairments in executive function and atten-
tion. GDNF is widely expressed in the brain and play
particularly
important
roles
in
the
physiology
of
catecholaminergic neurons [38]. Moreover, it has been
reported to be related to the development and mainten-
ance of various types of neurons: dopaminergic, seroto-
nergic, noradrenergic and GABAergic [39], which are all
involved in the pathological process of schizophrenia.
Previous animal studies demonstrated that GDNF was
closely related to learning and memory [14, 40] and
GDNF+/−mutant mice exhibit abnormal hippocampal
synaptic transmission [41], indicative of a role for GDNF
in cognitive abilities. These results may explain, to some
extent, the association between serum GDNF with sev-
eral subsets of cognitive abilities in DS patients in our
study. However, one study has shown that higher GDNF
levels result in more severe attention deficit in schizo-
phrenia outpatients [15]. But we found that lower serum
levels of GDNF were associated with more severe cogni-
tive impairment in attention distribution and verbal
fluency in first-episode schizophrenics in our previous
study [8]. The differences of sample sources, subject
characteristics, and study paradigms in these studies
may be one of the reasons for the inconsistent findings.
Limitations of the study
Our study has several limitations. First, BDNF contains
multiple
proteolytic
isoforms
(pro-BDNF,
truncated
BDNF, mature BDNF) in the serum, but we only tested
serum total BDNF levels. Carlino et al. confirmed that
mature BDNF and pro-BDNF levels were increased
while that of truncated BDNF was decreased in the
schizophrenic patients, and low serum levels of the trun-
cated BDNF isoform were associated with cognitive im-
pairments [42]. Therefore, the proteolytic isoforms of
BDNF may affect the results of the present study. Sec-
ond, we did not analyze the influence of inflammation
on the correlation between BDNF and schizophrenia.
Some studies reported that interactions between inflam-
matory factors and BDNF may be implicated in the
pathophysiology
and
cognitive
impairment
seen
in
chronic schizophrenia [43, 44]. Therefore, an as yet un-
known interaction between inflammatory factors and
BDNF in DS may be an avenue worth researching fur-
ther. Third, it is unclear whether GDNF content in
serum is correlated with the brain GDNF content.
Previous studies have found that GDNF had a very low
capacity of crossing the blood-brain barrier [45]. Fourth,
this study is an exploratory analysis of a relatively small
sample, but did not include correcting the correlations
between NFs and cognitive performance for multiple
comparisons. We attempt to increase the homogeneity
of subjects by eliminating or minimizing confounding
factors, such as gender, fluctuations of psychiatric symp-
toms and social environment, which will make it difficult
to recruit DS and NDS patients. The present study in-
cluded larger DS samples, compared with other pub-
lished studies of NFs in this group. However, the limited
power to be the current sample size means that we can-
not accurately determine the different contributions of
cognitive impairment and subgroup effects on NFs alter-
ations. A larger sample size is needed to increase the
statistical power in future research. Finally, all patients
in our study had been receiving medications, and their
effect on NFs could not be ruled out. In addition, as we
only recruited male subjects, the future researches in-
clude both male and female participants would be
needed.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our preliminary data suggests that serum
BDNF level maybe not a suitable biomarker for DS, des-
pite its significantly lower levels in the schizophrenia pa-
tients. In addition, the differences in the neurocognitive
functions of DS and NDS patients support the concept
of DS being a different clinical entity of schizophrenia.
Although serum GDNF levels in the DS group were not
significantly different from the NDS and HC groups,
only the DS patients showed an association between
higher serum GDNF levels with better cognitive per-
formance, which indicates that GDNF may be a protect-
ive factor in maintaining cognitive function in DS.
Therefore, future longitudinal studies that include un-
treated patients with DS would provide new insights.
