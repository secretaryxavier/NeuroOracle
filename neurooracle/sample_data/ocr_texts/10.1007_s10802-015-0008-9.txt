Abstract
An integration of family systems perspectives with developmental psychopathology provides a
framework for examining the complex interplay between family processes and developmental
trajectories of child psychopathology over time. In a community sample of 98 families, we
investigated the evolution of family relationships, across multiple subsystems of the family (..e.,
interparental, mother-child, father-child), and the impact of these changing family dynamics on
developmental trajectories of child internalizing symptoms over 6 years, from preschool age to
pre-adolescence. Parent—child relationship quality was observed during lengthy sessions,
consisting of multiple naturalistic, carefully scripted contexts. Each parent completed reports
about interparental relationship satisfaction and child internalizing symptoms. To the extent that
mothers experienced a steeper decline in interparental relationship satisfaction over time, children
developed internalizing symptoms at a faster rate. Further, symptoms escalated at a faster rate to
the extent that negative mother-child relationship quality increased (more negative affect
expressed by both mother and child, greater maternal power assertion) and positive mother-child
relationship quality decreased (less positive affect expressed by both mother and child, less
warmth and positive reciprocity). Time-lagged growth curve analyses established temporal
precedence such that decline in family relationships preceded escalation in child internalizing
symptoms. Results suggest that family dysfunction, across multiple subsystems, represents a
driving force in the progression of child internalizing symptoms.

functioning (Guyer et al. 2011). Internalizing symptoms increase over time (Bongers et al.
2003; Gilliom and Shaw 2004), yet risk factors for escalating anxiety and depressive
symptoms throughout childhood are not well understood (El-Sheikh et al. 2013). Despite the
prevalence and consequences of internalizing symptoms in young children, conceptual
frameworks explaining pathways of risk are not well developed. This oversight might be
attributed to the introverted nature of internalizing symptoms which tend to be less
disruptive and more difficult to detect than other forms of childhood maladjustment (e.g.,
externalizing problems; Tandon et al. 2009).
A family systems perspective (Cox and Paley 1997; Cox et al. 2003; Minuchin 1985)
provides a framework for understanding key factors leading to the development of
internalizing symptoms in children, and emphasizes the centrality of family relationships in
the development of these disorders. Within a systems framework, families are
conceptualized as comprising multiple interdependent subsystems. Individual members of
the family belong to multiple subsystems, and functioning in these subsystems influences
each other’s wellbeing.
Research examining the role of family in the development of child psychopathology has
been focused primarily on the mother-child subsystem (Parke and Buriel 2006). A large
body of literature demonstrates that multiple aspects of the mother-child relationship (e.g.,
power-assertive control, attachment security, responsiveness, interactive quality) are
associated with increased risk for child internalizing symptoms across multiple periods of
development spanning early childhood to adolescence (e.g., Brumariu and Kerns 2010;
Chorpita and Barlow 1998; Crawford et al. 2011; Dubois-Comtois et al. 2013; Easterbrooks
et al. 2008; Gilliom and Shaw 2004; Graham and Easterbrooks 2000; Kerns et al. 2011; Lee
and Hankin 2009; McLeod et al. 2007; Silk et al. 2011).
Although informative, a focus on the mother-child dyad is incomplete. Adopting the tenets
of ecological perspectives (Belsky 1984), many researchers have advocated for inclusion of
additional subsystems that include the father (i.e., the interparental relationship, the father-
child dyad) to gain a more comprehensive perspective on the whole family, and its impact
on child psychopathology (Cox et al. 2003; Lamb 2010). Researchers have examined the
quality of the father-child relationship, and its role in the development of child internalizing
symptoms (e.g., Allen et al. 2012; Brumariu and Kerns 2010; Milevsky et al. 2006; Sheeber
et al. 2007); however, much of this research has focused on adolescence. Thus, the impact of
the father-child relationship on child internalizing symptoms during earlier developmental
periods (e.g., preschool age and middle childhood) warrants attention.
Examinations of the associations between parent-child relationship quality and child
internalizing symptoms are important; however, they yield an incomplete picture. The
interparental relationship sets the tone for the larger family unit, and must also be considered
in efforts to explain the development of children’s internalizing symptoms over time. The
interparental relationship has been described as the “cornerstone” of family functioning
(Davies and Cicchetti 2004), regulating the family environment (Hindman et al. 2013), and
discord and dysfunction in the interparental relationship predicts the functioning of both the

family as a whole and of its individual members (Bonds and Gondoli 2007), including child
adjustment (Emery 1982; Grych and Fincham 1990).
The influential work of Cummings, Davies, and colleagues has demonstrated a key
mechanism through which interparental discord influences child adjustment. Specifically,
they propose an emotional security hypothesis (Davies and Cummings 1994) that purports
that the child’s sense of emotional security within the family is undermined as a result of
interparental discord, contributing to child maladjustment (e.g., Cummings et al. 2012;
Cummings et al. 2006; Goeke-Morey et al. 2003; Harold et al. 2004). Although extensive
research has demonstrated the detrimental impact of interparental discord on child
adjustment, much of this research has been focused on externalizing disorders. Further
inquiry into the effects of the interparental relationship on children’s internalizing symptoms
is warranted. For example, in a recent article based on the same sample, we demonstrated
that maladaptive marital conflict and negative emotional aftermath of conflict during toddler
age predicted children’s future internalizing problems, and identified child insecurity as a
mechanism through which these pathways unfold (Brock and Kochanska 2015). Those
analyses, however, did not consider the quality of the interparental and parent-child
relationships more broadly and over time.
Family systems perspectives recognize multiple subsystems contributing to individual
functioning and well-being; furthermore, another Key tenet of this framework is that families
are dynamic, developing systems. In response to transitions and strain from external forces,
families are forced to adapt and reorganize (Cox et al. 2003). The process of adaptation and
change within the family unit can have important implications for the developmental
processes contributing to psychopathology in family members. Consequently, the evolution
of family processes over time is key for understanding how these processes contribute to the
development of internalizing disorders in children, and those dynamics must be captured.
Yet, the majority of existing research has focused on concurrent family functioning as a
static phenomenon, as opposed to family processes unfolding over time as they evolve and
change (Davies and Cicchetti 2004). There is a need for long-term research designs and
statistical techniques that are capable of modeling not only patterns of change in family
subsystems over time, but also the interplay of these processes with developmental
trajectories of child psychological adjustment (Davies and Cicchetti 2004).
From the point of view of developmental psychopathology, longitudinal studies of the
developmental period from late preschool age to preadolescence are particularly valuable.
Such studies provide a window into children’s emotional functioning after the normative
transition to a new social ecology (kindergarten), followed by the continuing management of
drastically expanding developmental tasks and challenges. The emerging salient issues of
development include negotiating daily lengthy separations from the attachment figures,
achieving multiple academic and social competencies, entering a broad social milieu, and
navigating often conflicting influences of family, school, and the peer group. Those evolving
tasks represent significant challenges for children’s coping and emotion regulation abilities.
Consequently, an understanding of factors that contribute to children’s vulnerability to
feelings of anxiety, sadness, depression, and worry over the course of that period, and of
factors that offset such symptoms, is an important research goal. In particular, relatively

long-term individual trajectories of internalizing symptoms, such as anxiety and depression,
and familial factors that contribute to continuity, change, acceleration, or deceleration of
such symptoms are of great interest in developmental psychopathology (Degnan and Fox
2007; Kennedy et al. 2010; Ollendick and Benoit 2012).
The Present Study
In the present study, we investigated the evolution of multiple family processes over time
and across multiple subsystems of the family (1.e., interparental, mother-child, father-child).
We examined the impact of these changing dynamics on developmental trajectories of child
internalizing symptoms. Growth curve analytic (GCA) techniques were used, which model
within-subject change in a phenomenon over time (e.g., internalizing disorders) along with
between-subject differences in those growth curve trajectories (see Karney and Bradbury
1995, and Kenny et al. 2006, for a discussion of the advantages of GCA.)
Modeling the development of psychological symptoms over time is advantageous because
the progression of symptoms is conceptualized as more informative than symptom levels at
a given point in time (Graber 2004). Indeed, although notable exceptions exist, particularly
in research on anxiety (e.g., Degnan and Fox 2007), most of the existing research has been
largely limited to “still photographs of moving targets” (p. 4; Hayden and Mash 2014),
failing to capture the dynamic nature of child psychopathology. Developmentally sensitive
measures of psychopathology across a broad span of child development have numerous
advantages (Hayden and Mash 2014). Further, dynamic assessments of symptom trajectories
are considered more reliable and informative than simply controlling for prior levels of
symptoms (Cole et al. 2002), as in the context of an autoregressive model.
We further argue that it is insufficient to simply examine concurrent covariation between
family processes and child internalizing disorders over time, which is customary in GCA,
given the bidirectional relations between child psychopathology and family functioning
(Cox et al. 2003; Cox and Paley 1997; Emery 2014; Schermerhorn and Cummings 2008).
Thus, we also implemented a time-lag approach such that changes in family processes were
modeled as temporally preceding changes in internalizing symptoms. That is, we examined
whether interparental and parent-child relationship quality assessed at time t were associated
with changes in child internalizing symptoms at time f+1 (i.e., 1 to 2 years later).
To capture the quality of the interparental relationship, we used a measure of relationship
satisfaction (i.e., global relationship sentiment or happiness as a unitary construct; Lawrence
et al. 2009). Relationship satisfaction can be conceptualized as a global indicator of
functioning in the interparental relationship across multiple domains. More positive
relationship functioning (e.g., high levels of emotional intimacy, adequate partner support)
and more negative relationship processes (e.g., poor conflict management) are robustly
related with global relationship satisfaction (Lawrence et al. 2011). Further, repeated
measures of relationship satisfaction over extended periods of time capture a relationship
trajectory that is sensitive to fluctuations in overall relationship functioning (Bradbury et al.
2000). We hypothesized that decreases in interparental relationship satisfaction would

predict subsequent increases in child internalizing symptoms, controlling for the passage of
time.
Multiple aspects of parent-child relationship quality were observed and coded during
lengthy observations of interactions of each mother-child and father-child dyad in the
laboratory. To assess negative relationship quality, the parent’s expressions of negative
affect with the child, the child’s negative affect with the parent, and the parent’s observed
power-assertive control with the child were scored and aggregated.
Positive aspects of the parent-child relationship were also observed and coded. In addition
to the parent’s positive affect with the child, and the child’s positive affect with the parent,
we examined a dyadic construct of mutually responsive orientation (MRO) — a cooperative,
trusting, supportive, and reciprocal parent-child relationship, infused with positive
affectivity (Kochanska 1997). MRO has been well-established as a correlate and a cause of
overall adaptive socio-emotional development, particularly a broad range of outcomes
reflecting internalization of values, and regard for and compliance with rules of conduct
(e.g., Kochanska 2002; Kochanska et al. 2014; Kochanska and Kim 2013). The association
of MRO with child internalizing disorders, however, has rarely been studied and warrants
attention. Based on the extant literature on parental warmth and responsiveness (e.g.,
Ollendick and Benoit 2012), we hypothesized that increases in negative parent— child
relationship quality and decreases in positive parent— child relationship quality would
predict subsequent increases in child internalizing symptoms, controlling for the passage of
time.
Participants and Procedures
Two-parent families of infants (V=102) volunteered for a longitudinal study in response to
advertisements and fliers distributed in the community. A family was accepted if the parents
were living together and both wished to participate, parents were willing to speak English
during sessions, the infant was their biological child, normally developing, and free of major
birth complications or health problems, and the family had no plans to move in the next 5
years. Mothers were, on average, 30.80 years of age (SD=5.30) and fathers were 32.23
(SD=6.03). Approximately 25 % of mothers had a high school education (or less), 54 % had
an associate or college degree, and 21 % had a postgraduate education. The respective
figures for fathers were approximately 30, 51, and 20 %. Thirty-eight percent of mothers and
55 % of fathers were employed in a management or professional occupations. The annual
incomes of families ranged from less than $20,000 (8 %), to $20,000-$40,000 (17 %), to
$40,000-$60,000 (26 %), to over $60,000 (49 %). Approximately 90 % of mothers were
White, 3 % Hispanic, 2 % African American, 1 % Asian, 1 % Pacific Islander, and 3 %
other non-White. Among fathers, 84 % were White, 8 % Hispanic, 3 % African American, 3
% Asian, and 2 % other. In 20 % of families, one or both parents were non-White. On
average, families had 2.03 children (SD=1.07); 37 % of the target children were first-borns.
All procedures were approved by the institutional review board at a large Midwestern
university.

We report data collected across five time points ranging from when children were aged 4.5
to 10. Four families had withdrawn from the longitudinal study by the time the target child
was aged 4.5. Each parent completed reports about interparental relationship satisfaction (at
4.5 years, N=98; 5.5 years, N=89, 6.5 years, N=84; 8 years, N=80) and child internalizing
symptoms (at 5.5 years, N=92, 6.5 years, N=90; 8 years, N=87; 10 years, N=82). Trained
observers produced multiple measures of the quality of the mother-child and father-child
relationships (at 4.5 years, N=98; 5.5 years, N=90, 6.5 years, N=87), based on many lengthy
scripted interactive contexts (see the supplemental tables for more information).
Each parent-child dyad was observed during lengthy sessions (2—3 h). Measures of parent—
child relationship quality encompassed the parent’s and the child’s expressed affect toward
one another, an overall dyadic quality of their interaction, and the parent’s power assertion
used during control encounters. Those constructs were coded, by independent groups of
coders, in multiple naturalistic, carefully scripted, developmentally appropriate contexts that
had been designed to elicit a variety of emotions, behaviors, and interactions within the dyad
(e.g., parent is busy while child has free time, snack time, parent and child play with toys or
complete a craft project, child cleans up toys, parent and child open gifts together). Notably,
all of the reported coding systems have been used extensively in our laboratory including the
systems for the parent’s and the child’s expressed affect (e.g., Kochanska et al. 2007),
parent-child MRO (e.g., Kochanska et al. 2013), and the parent’s power assertion (e.g.,
Kochanska et al. 2008). Overall, each parent-child dyad was coded in 185 min over the
repeated assessments (65, 60, and 60 at 4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 years). All sessions were conducted
by female experimenters, and videotaped for future coding. The laboratory includes a
naturalistic living room and a sparsely furnished playroom.
Parent-Reported Child Internalizing Behavior Symptoms
Mothers and fathers completed Child Symptom Inventory-4 (CSI-4; Gadow and Sprafkin
2002; Sprafkin and Gadow 2002). CSI-4 is a well-established instrument that corresponds to
DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association 2000), with excellent psychometric properties
(Gadow and Sprafkin 2002; Sprafkin and Gadow 2002). We used Symptom Severity
scoring, based on each parent’s ratings of the CSI-4 items from 0 (never) to 3 (very often).
For each parent, we created an internalizing symptoms score by adding the scales of
depression, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
post-traumatic stress, tic disorder, social phobia, and separation anxiety. Cronbach’s alphas
ranged from 0.61 to 0.66 for mothers over time and 0.62 to 0.70 for fathers. The mothers’
and fathers’ scores modestly correlated (average r of 0.33 across time), and were averaged
into one score of child internalizing symptoms at each time point (5.5, 6.5, 8, and 10 years;
see Lengua et al. 2008 for benefits of such approach).
Interparental Relationship Satisfaction
The Quality of Marriage Index (QMI; Norton 1983) is a well-established self-report
questionnaire designed to assess the “essential goodness of a relationship” or global
sentiment about one’s intimate relationship. The measure includes six items (e.g., “we have
a good relationship,” “my relationship with my partner makes me happy’’). Participants
indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with each item using a 7-point Likert

scale. Cronbach’s alphas ranged from 0.95 to 0.98 for mothers over time and 0.97 at each of
the time points for fathers. Sum scores of mother-reported marital satisfaction and father-
reported marital satisfaction were calculated (at 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, and 8 years). The possible
range of composite scores was 7 to 42 (note that an alternative version of the QMI includes a
10-point Likert scale for the sixth item for a possible range of 7 to 45).
Negative Parent—child Relationship Quality
An aggregate (average) score of the parent’s and the child’s negative affect and the parent’s
power-assertive control was computed separately for each dyad (mother-child, father-child)
at each time point (4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 years).
The Parent’s Negative Affect with Child—The parent’s affect was coded in each of
the scripted contexts, for every 30-s segment. Kappas ranged from 0.73 to 0.84 across time
and both parents. We then tallied the instances of the parent’s intense or pervasive negative
affect (weighed by 3), discrete negative emotions (weighed by 2), and neutral/negative
mood (weighted by 1). Those figures were added and divided by the number of coded
segments into a score of the parent’s negative affect with the child.
The Child’s Negative Affect with Parent—During each of the scripted contexts, the
child’s affect was also coded, for every 30-s segment. Kappas ranged from 0.65 to 0.83.
Instances of the child’s expressions of negative affect (intense or pervasive, discrete
negative emotions, or neutral/negative mood) were weighted and tallied, added across
contexts, and divided by the number of coded segments into a score of the child’s negative
affect with the parent.
The Parent’s Observed Power-Assertive Control—At the outset, parents were asked
to convey to their children a prohibition that pertained to not touching very attractive toys
displayed on low, easily accessible shelves, and enforce it throughout the session (the same
scripted contexts that were coded for affect). First, coders identified all episodes of control
(starting when the child’s attention turned to the prohibited toys). Then, another coding team
coded, for every 30-s segment within those episodes, the parent’s overall control style. Only
codes reflecting power assertion were used here: assertive control (matter-of-fact, firm,
decisive control style), and forceful, negative control (negative, angry, threatening, harsh
control style). Also for each 30-s segment, the parent’s physical power-assertive strategies
were coded: assertive physical control (firmly holding the child, taking a toy away, blocking
access to toys), and forceful, negative physical control (handling child roughly, spanking,
yanking toys away). Reliability, kappas, ranged from0.68 to 0.76 across repeated
assessments.
During another context (the toy cleanup), parents were instructed to ask their children to
clean up numerous small toys or craft materials, and the parent’s style of control was also
coded for every 30s segment, using the same coding system. Reliability, kappas, ranged
from 0.71 to 0.88 across repeated assessments.
The instances of each code were tallied, divided by the number of coded segments, and
standardized. For the prohibition encounters, the two scores for the overall control style

(assertive and forceful) were averaged, and the two scores for physical power-assertive
strategies (assertive and forceful) were averaged. Those scores were then averaged to create
an overall score for prohibition. A parallel overall score was also obtained for the toy
cleanup. Finally, the overall prohibition and toy cleanup scores were aggregated into one
parent’s observed power-assertive control score at each time of assessment.
Data Aggregation—Correlations among the scores that were averaged to create a
composite score were generally small to medium in magnitude (average r of mother-child
scores was 0.12 at 4.5 years, 0.02 at 5.5 years, and 0.04 at 6.5 years; average r of father-
child scores was 0.40 at 4.5 years, 0.17 at 5.5 years, and 0.09 at 6.5 years).We had
anticipated relatively low correlations among components used to create aggregate scores
for three reasons. First, negativity in the family can manifest in numerous ways, and we did
not necessarily expect its various forms to be related. For example, a parent’s negative affect
may be associated either with harsh or intrusive discipline or with a disengagement from
control interactions altogether (Cummings and Davies 1994; Dix 1991). Never-theless, each
of the three variables (the parent’s and the child’s negative affect, the parent’s power
assertion) can be legitimately viewed as reflecting a poor quality of their relationship.
Second, as expected in a community sample, instances of negative affect and power
assertion were relatively infrequent, reducing the magnitude of correlations (although the
final composites had acceptable distributions). And third, power assertion occurred only in
the small subset of the time in which affect was coded (during the actual episodes of
control), and thus was less robust than the affect scores. Scores were standardized before
averaging to create a final score of negative parent-child relationship quality.
Positive Parent—child Relationship Quality
An aggregate (average) score of the parent’s and the child’s positive affect and MRO in the
parent—child relationship were computed separately for mothers and fathers, and at each
time point (4.5, 5.5, and 6.5 years). The same scripted contexts were used as those coded for
scores of negative parent-child relationship quality.
The Parent’s Positive Affect with Child—The parent’s affect was coded in each of the
contexts, for the parent’s intense or pervasive positive affect (weighed by 3), discrete
positive emotions (weighed by 2), and neutral/positive mood (weighted by 1). Those figures
were added and divided by the number of coded segments into a score of the parent’s
positive affect with the child. Kappas ranged from 0.73 to 0.84 across time and both parents.
The Children’s Positive Affect with Parent—During each of the scripted contexts, the
child’s affect was also coded, for every 30-s segment. Kappas ranged from 0.65 to 0.83.
Instances of the child’s expressions of positive affect (intense or pervasive, discrete positive
emotions, or neutral/positive mood) were tallied, added across contexts, and divided by the
number of coded segments into a score of the child’s positive affect with the parent.
Parent—child MRO—Parent-child MRO was coded in the same contexts as affect. Coders
assigned one overall MRO rating for each observed context (e.g., snack, play), ranging from
1 (very untrue of the dyad) to 5 (very true of the dyad). The coder integrated four dyadic

dimensions (low and high anchors are described below). Coordinated routines: Dyad has no
routines or routines are choppy, rough, and a source of conflict; dyad has easy, comfortable,
coordinated routines that reflect shared procedural expectations. Harmonious
communication: Dyad communicates very little or not at all; dyad communicates smoothly,
in a connected, harmonious, back-and-forth way. Mutual cooperation: Dyad is unable to
cooperate, struggles and conflicts escalate; parent and child adopt an open, willing, receptive
stance toward each other, with even subtle cues sufficient for cooperation. Emotional
ambience: Negative ambience permeates interaction, there are bouts of negative affect;
parent and child clearly enjoy each other’s company, very positive, warm ambience, with
bouts of joy and displays of affection. The conventions specified how to arrive at the overall
score for each context. Reliability, weighted kappa, was 0.73. At each assessment, the scores
across all observed contexts cohered substantially, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging from
0.75 to 0.81. Consequently, they were averaged across all contexts into one score for each
parent— child dyad at each time.
Data Aggregation—The parent’s positive affect with the child, the child’s positive affect
with the parent, and parent-child MRO were averaged into an aggregate score of positive
parent— child relationship quality (separately for mother-child and father-child dyads).
Correlations among averaged scores at each time point were generally medium to large in
magnitude (average r of mother-child scores was 0.36 at 4.5 years, 0.43 at 5.5 years, and
0.23 at 6.5 years; average r of father-child scores was 0.35 at 4.5 years, 0.39 at 5.5 years,
and 0.42 at 6.5 years). Scores were standardized before averaging to create a final score of
positive parent— child relationship quality.
Statistical Analyses
Results
Analyses were conducted with growth curve modeling techniques (GCM; Bryk and
Raudenbush 1987; Raudenbush and Bryk 2002) and the HLM computer program
(Raudenbush et al. 2004). GCM estimates within-individual change or growth trajectories
for a variable (i.e., child internalizing symptoms) described by two parameters: intercept and
slope (e.g., rates of change in internalizing symptoms over time). GCM provides tests of
whether, on average, intercepts and slopes differ significantly from zero and whether there is
variability in parameter estimates. In GCM, the coefficients can be understood as
functionally similar to unstandardized regression coefficients, and they represent the degree
of association between two variables. HLM uses all available data from each individual to
estimate within-subject parameters; thus, participants without data at every time point are
retained in the analyses. HLM also provides reliable estimates of parameters in the context
of relatively small samples, compared to other analytic approaches (e.g., OLS, SEM).
Missing data were addressed using GCM techniques, which incorporate all available data
regardless of missing data at certain points in time. Descriptive statistics for each family
variable and child internalizing symptoms, at each time point, are reported in Table 1.
Correlations among scores of family processes are reported in Table 2 and suggest that

parent—child relationship are distinct family processes. However, within the same family
process, there were consistently significant and moderate correlations between the two
parents (e.g., between mother-child and father-child negativity). Correlations between
family processes and scores of internalizing symptoms are reported in Table 3.
Models of Change in Child Internalizing Symptoms, Age 5.5 to Age 10
We tested a linear model of change for child internalizing symptoms by specifying the
following model:
Level 1: Y, Internalizing Symptoms) = 1g; (Intercept) + 17; (Time) + e,;
Level 2: 19; (Intercept) = Bog + ro;
(Time) = Bi0 + 71
where Y;; is the level of symptoms at time ¢ for subject i, 1; is the intercept for subject i, 14;
is the rate of linear change in symptoms over time for subject i, and e;; is the residual
variance in repeated measures for individual i, which is assumed to be independent and
normally distributed.
On average, there was a trend toward internalizing symptoms increasing over time,
t(91)=1.73, p=0.087. There was significant between-subject variability in slope coefficients,
12(89)=152.93, p<0.001, suggesting that rates of change in symptoms varied across children.
Next, we examined sex differences in rates of change in child internalizing symptoms over
time by testing the following model:
Level 1: Y, Internalizing Symptoms) = 1g; (Intercept) + 17; (Time) + e,;
Level 2: 19; (Intercept) = Bgg + Ba; (Child Gender) + ro;
11(Time) = By + By (Child Gender) + 7;
Child gender did not predict rates of change in internalizing symptoms, 1(90)=0.39, p=0.697.
Children also did not differ with regard to levels of internalizing symptoms at age 10
(Intercept), as a function of gender, t(90)=0.83, p=0.409. Accordingly, child gender was not
included as a covariate in subsequent analyses.
The Interparental Relationship and Internalizing symptoms: Time-Lag Associations
We conducted time-lagged analyses to test whether changes in interparental relationship
satisfaction predict subsequent changes in child internalizing symptoms. Maternal and
paternal reports of relationship satisfaction were added as time-varying covariates at Level
1: Y;47; Symptoms) = 1g; + 17; (Time) + 1; (Maternal Satisfaction) + 13; (Paternal
Satisfaction) + e,;, where Y;. 7; represents internalizing symptoms for child i at Time f+1, 1;
is the intercept of child 7 at Time 0, 711; is the rate of linear change in internalizing symptoms
for child i over time, 11; is the association between maternal relationship satisfaction at Time
t and child internalizing symptoms at Time #+/ (i.e., time-lag association), 7 3; is the
association between paternal relationship satisfaction at Time ¢ and child symptoms at Time
t+/, and e;; is the residual variance in repeated measures for child 7 (random error).

Maternal satisfaction and paternal satisfaction were examined simultaneously within the
same model to account for interdependence. Changes in maternal relationship satisfaction
were associated with subsequent changes in child internalizing symptoms, t(226)=—2.06,
p=0.04. Changes in paternal satisfaction were not significantly associated with changes in
child symptoms, #(226)=0.00, p=0.997. See Table 4 for detailed model results (i.e.,
coefficients, SEs, and t-values for all model parameters). Fig. 1 includes an application of
these results for estimating diverging trajectories of child internalizing symptoms based on
different patterns of change in maternal interparental relationship satisfaction over time.
The Parent-child Relationship and Internalizing Symptoms: Time-Lag Associations
Next, we examined associations between changes in the quality of the parent-child
relationship with subsequent changes in internalizing symptoms. Mother-child relationship
quality and father-child relationship quality were added as time-varying covariates at Level
1: Y,, 7; Unternalizing Symptoms) = 1g; (Intercept) + 1,; (Time) + 1; (Mother-Child
Relationship Quality) + 73; (Father-Child Relationship Quality) + e,;. Note that, due to the
multiple levels of aggregation necessary for creating global scores of negative and positive
parent-child relationship quality, final scores are standardized. Thus, changes in parent—
child relationship quality over time reflect changes in status relative to other families as
opposed to fluctuations in raw scores.
Negative Relationship Quality—Mother-child negative relationship quality and father-
child negative relationship quality were examined simultaneously within the same model to
account for interdependence. Changes in mother-child negative relationship quality were
associated with subsequent changes in child internalizing symptoms, t(226)=2.39, p=0.017.
Changes in father-child negative relationship quality were not significantly associated with
changes in child symptoms, #(226)=0.37, p=0.709. See Table 4 for detailed model results.
Positive Relationship Quality—Mother-child positive relationship quality and father-
child positive relationship quality were examined simultaneously within the same model to
account for interdependence. Changes in mother-child positive relationship quality were
associated with subsequent changes in child internalizing symptoms, t(226)=—2.00, p=0.047.
Changes in father-child relationship quality were not significantly associated with changes
in child symptoms, t(226)=—0.33, p=0.742. See Table 4 for detailed model results.
Supplementary Analyses
Accounting for Interrelations Among Family Variables—Two types of family
relationship variables (functioning in the interparental subsystem and quality of the mother-
child relationship) emerged as significant predictors of child internalizing symptoms.
Consistent with a family systems perspectives and the spillover hypothesis (Erel and
Burman 1995), dysfunction in the interparental relationship may spill over into the parent—
child relationship (Parke et al. 2001). Thus, dysfunction in the parent-child relationship
might account for the link between interparental discord and child maladjustment.
Accordingly, a follow-up analysis was conducted to account for this possibility: Y,; (Mother-
Child Relationship Quality) = 1; (Intercept) + 17; (Time) + 1; (Maternal Relationship
Satisfaction) + e,. Rates of change in maternal relationship satisfaction were not

significantly associated with rates of change in negative mother-child relationship quality,
t(211)=—-0.79, p=0.433. Further, changes in maternal relationship satisfaction were not
associated with changes in positive mother-child relationship quality, t(211)=—0.77,
p=0.441. Increasing dysfunction in the interparental relationship and escalating dysfunction
in the parent-child relationship appear to serve as independent risk factors for the
progression of internalizing symptoms in children. However, not surprisingly, positive
mother-child relationship quality significantly covaried with negative mother-child
relationship quality, t(211)=—6.00, p<0.001. To the extent that positivity in the mother-child
relationship decreased over time, negativity increased, and vice versa.
Incremental Effects of Family Variables—We also tested a multivariate model to
determine whether changing dynamics in certain subsystems demonstrate incremental
predictive utility for explaining escalation in child internalizing symptoms. Maternal and
paternal interparental relationship satisfaction, negative parent-child relationship quality,
and positive parent— child relationship quality were entered simultaneously within the same
model as cross-lagged, time-varying covariates of child internalizing symptoms. Only
decline in maternal interparental relationship satisfaction was uniquely associated with
subsequent escalation in child internalizing symptoms, controlling for other family dynamics
and the passage of time, 1(222)=—2.08, p=0.039. Notably, this finding is most likely due to
the robust association between negative mother-child relationship quality and positive
mother-child relationship quality. Positive versus negative aspects of the parent-child
relationship do not uniquely predict child internalizing problems. Rather, the overall quality
of the mother-child relationship appears to be key. In contrast, changes in interparental
relationship satisfaction were not significantly associated with changes in mother-child
relationship quality; thus, these family subsystems appear to function as independent, not
overlapping, risk factors for child internalizing problems.
Discussion
Within the past decade, researchers have been urged to integrate family systems approaches
with developmental psychopathology to capture the complexity and richness of the family
unit, and to elucidate how changing family systems explain psychopathology in children
(Davies and Cicchetti 2004; Hayden and Mash 2014). Davies and Cicchetti (2004) proposed
“an ongoing transactional interplay between an active changing organism in a dynamic
changing context” (p. 478), and advocated for research explaining the interplay between
family processes and developmental trajectories of psychopathology. Consistent with this
growing emphasis, we investigated the evolution of family processes, across multiple
subsystems of the family and the role of these changing family dynamics in developmental
trajectories of child internalizing symptoms from preschool age to early pre-adolescence.
Consistent with research demonstrating escalation in internalizing symptoms during
childhood (Bongers et al. 2003; Gilliom and Shaw 2004), we found that, on average, there
was a trend for child internalizing symptoms to increase from childhood to preadolescence.
Nonetheless, there was significant between-subject variability in these trajectories,
suggesting that internalizing symptoms increase and decrease at varying rates for individual
children. Examinations of family processes revealed that changes in the quality of the

interparental and parent-child subsystems explain, in part, differing trajectories of child
internalizing symptoms over time. Indeed, the effect of time on child internalizing
symptoms was no longer significant when accounting for changes in the quality of the
mother-child relationship. Thus, evolution of the mother-child relationship appears to
explain most of the time-related changes observed in internalizing symptoms.
To the extent that mothers experienced a steeper decline in their interparental relationship
satisfaction, children experienced a faster rate of increase in symptoms over time. Further,
internalizing symptoms developed at a faster rate to the extent that there was (a) an
escalation in negative mother-child relationship quality (1.e., more displays of negative
affect by both mother and child during interactions, more power assertion by mothers), and
(b) an erosion in positive mother-child relationship quality (i.e., fewer displays of positive
affect by both mother and child, less mutually positive and warm dyadic ambience). The
implementation of time-lagged growth curve models establishes temporal precedence,
indicating that decline in family functioning represents a driving force in the progression of
child internalizing symptoms.
We believe that our analyses strongly imply causality, such that deterioration in the
interparental relationship and in the mother-child relationship likely cause the subsequent
elevation in the child’s internalizing symptoms, encompassing sadness, depression, fears,
worries, concerns about separation, etc. Although certainly valuable, those results yield an
incomplete account of the developmental mechanisms involved, and they lead to a next set
of questions. For example, consistent with the spillover hypothesis (Erel and Burman 1995),
perhaps an erosion in the interparental relationship was the primary pathogenic factor, which
caused the worsening of the mother-child relationship, and it, in turn, led to the child’s
internalizing symptoms? In additional analyses, we examined such a possibility by testing
whether changes in the interparental relationship were associated with changes in the
parent-child relationship which, in turn, contributed to escalating child internalizing
problems. However, the associations between the interparental relationship and parent—
child relationships were not significant.
As well, although this study establishes temporal — and presumably causal — precedence
between the quality of family relationships and children’s rate of change in internalizing
problems, it does not elucidate specific mechanisms that account for those links.
Developmental psychopathology literature offers multiple explanations that should be tested
in the future, along with the examination of the causal links. For example, extensive
literature has described children’s emotional (in)security as a factor mediating links between
interparental conflict and children’s adjustment (e.g., Brock and Kochanska 2015;
Cummings et al. 2012; Cummings et al. 2006; Goeke-Morey et al. 2003; Harold et al. 2004).
Further, equally extensive evidence has shown that a positive parent-child relationship
fosters children’s attachment security, associated with adaptive regulation of emotion and
constructive coping (DeKlyen and Greenberg 2008; Thompson 2006).
Examining mother and father scores simultaneously as predictors of internalizing symptoms
addressed interdependence inherent in interparental dyads, providing a rigorous test of
maternal versus paternal contributions to child psychopathology. Whereas changes in

interparental relationship satisfaction (reported by mothers) and the quality of the mother-
child relationship explained the development of children’s internalizing symptoms over
time, evaluating the father’s relationships within the family system did not result in any
unique predictive utility. Research focused on internalizing disorders in adolescence
suggests that insecurity in the father-child relationship is associated with depression and
anxiety (e.g., Brumariu and Kerns 2010); however, in our sample of children, assessed
consecutively from ages 4.5 to 10, father-child relationship quality and the father’s report of
interparental relationship satisfaction did not explain the trajectories of internalizing
symptoms.
Despite non-significant direct associations between paternal family variables and child
internalizing symptoms, it is worth noting that the correlations between the father’s and
mother’s scores of family variables were significant (see correlations along the diagonal in
Table 2). Consistent with a family systems perspective, which emphasizes the interrelated
nature of the family, fathers may exert indirect influences on child internalizing symptoms
by undermining or bolstering the quality of the mother-child relationship and maternal
interparental relationship satisfaction. Moreover, father-child relationships may influence
trajectories of children’s social competence more prominently than they influence
trajectories of internalizing problems. Indeed, numerous studies demonstrate a robust link
between father-child relationship quality and social competence in peer groups (e.g.,
McDowell et al. 2003; Williams and Kelly 2005), perhaps because of the prominent role of
play in father-child interactions and its links to social competence with peers (McDowell
and Parke 2009). Finally, relations between father-child relationship quality and
internalizing problems might emerge in clinical samples comprised of families exhibiting
greater family dysfunction and higher levels of internalizing problems relative to the
community sample of families followed in the present study.
The present study has several limitations. Despite the strengths of GCA techniques,
examining the association between changes in family processes and changes in internalizing
symptoms limits our ability to test certain developmentally-focused questions, such as
whether family processes have differential effects across different developmental periods.
Further, the sample was low in risk, and relatively ethnically homogenous. Levels of
internalizing symptoms were comparable to a normative group, as reported in the CSI
manual (Gadow and Sprafkin 2002), such that children’s scores were in the low-severity
range. This was expected in a sample of typically developing children; consequently,
replication in clinical samples of children with more severe internalizing symptoms is
necessary. Moreover, family relationships were generally harmonious, limiting the
generalizability of the results. It is notable that, despite the restricted ranges observed in this
sample, significant associations between family dysfunction and child internalizing
symptoms were nevertheless detected. We would expect larger effect sizes in at-risk
populations.
Due to the low-risk nature of the sample, we chose to focus on symptoms of internalizing
disorders in general, rather than on specific sub-domains of symptoms (e.g., depression,
generalized anxiety, separation anxiety). Perhaps various family subsystems would have
unique implications for different sub-domains of internalizing disorders in at-risk or clinical

populations. Finally, examining satisfaction in the interparental relationship allowed us a
window into global functioning in this subsystem, reflective of multiple underlying
relationship processes. Nonetheless, future research should include examinations of specific
facets of interparental relationship quality (e.g., levels of intimacy, respect, balance of
power, conflict management, support, etc.), and determine how various facets are associated
with differing trajectories of child psychopathology. Indeed, specific aspects of family
relationships may differentially predict unique dimensions of child internalizing symptoms
(e.g., depressive versus anxiety symptoms). Additionally, including measures of parents’
personality and internalizing symptoms, such as neuroticism, depression, and anxiety, which
themselves may follow divergent trajectories over time and interact with their family
relationships and with children’s symptoms, would be very informative. As well, including
sibling relationships would certainly enrich the picture of the family system.
Finally, the implementation of a time-lag approach to examining whether changes in family
processes temporally precede changes in child internalizing symptoms represents an
important advancement to prior research given the expected reciprocal relations between
family systems and individual psychopathology. Nonetheless, due to insufficient data (there
was only one cross-lag pairing of internalizing symptoms at age 5.5 to subsequent parent—
child relationship at Age 8), we were unable to examine the reverse, cross-lag association
between internalizing symptoms and subsequent family processes. Future research might
include closer examinations of the bidirectional dynamics between family processes and
child internalizing problems over time.
The present study has clinical implications. Early intervention for treating childhood
internalizing disorders, especially anxiety disorders, is of paramount importance, given that
these disorders tend to persist later in adolescence and adulthood if untreated (Hirshfeld-
Becker et al. 2010). Unfortunately, younger children tend to be underrepresented in
treatment outcome research; however, emerging research has produced promising results.
For example, Hirshfeld-Becker et al. (2010) demonstrated the efficacy of a developmentally
modified parent— child cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for anxiety disorders in children
ages 4-7. Results of the present study demonstrate the potential utility of implementing a
family systems approach into treatment protocols, by targeting and improving aspects of
both the interparental and parent-child relationships. Indeed, existing interventions largely
target aspects of the parent-child relationship, overlooking the interparental relationship.
Results of the present study highlight the importance of promoting adaptive functioning in
the interparental relationship in preventative interventions to most effectively disrupt
maladaptive developmental pathways leading to increased child internalizing symptoms.
Conclusions
The dynamic, evolving nature of multiple family subsystems has important implications for
the developmental course of child internalizing disorders from early childhood to pre-
adolescence. To the extent that family functioning improves over time, children may
actually experience decline in internalizing symptoms, thus demonstrating the importance of
promoting healthy adaptation during family transitions and stressors. Further, the
interparental relationship and the parent-child relationship appear to function as independent

sources of risk, having unique implications for the development of childhood internalizing
disorders. As such, interventions that target multiple subsystems of the family appear highly
promising as means to best promote child mental health, including treatment components
that target the interparental relationship (e.g., couples therapy), as an important complement
to strategies that address the quality of the parent-child relationship.

Diverging trajectories of internalizing symptoms from 5.5 to 10 years as a function of
change in maternal QMI over time. The results of the GCA were applied to estimate
trajectories of internalizing symptoms for three different scenarios: (1) maternal QMI scores
decrease by 1 unit per month, (2) maternal QMI scores remain stable over time, and (3)
maternal QMI scores increase by 1 unit per month. Trajectories were estimated assuming a
similar starting point: scores of internalizing symptoms at 5.5 years were estimated at mean
levels of maternal QMI at 4.5 years (M@=33.66).
