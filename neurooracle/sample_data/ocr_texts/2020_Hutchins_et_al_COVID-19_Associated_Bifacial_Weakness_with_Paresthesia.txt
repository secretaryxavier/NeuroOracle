ABSTRACT
SUMMARY: We report a case of bifacial weakness with paresthesia, a recognized Guillain-Barré syndrome subtype characterized
by rapidly progressive facial weakness and paresthesia without ataxia or other cranial neuropathies, which was temporally associ-
ated with antecedent coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). This case highlights a potentially novel but critically important neurologic
association of the COVID-19 disease process. Herein, we detail the clinicoradiologic work-up and diagnosis, clinical course, and
multidisciplinary medical management of this patient with COVID-19. This case is illustrative of the increasingly recognized but
potentially underreported neurologic manifestations of COVID-19, which must be considered and further investigated in this
pandemic disease.

S
evere Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus responsible for the pan-
demic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). First identified
in Wuhan, China, in late December 2019,1 global transmission
increased rapidly, with the first case of COVID-19 reported in
the United States on January 19, 20202 and .1.34 million cases
and nearly 81,000 deaths reported in the United States as of
May 12, 2020.3 While the typical presentation is respiratory
symptoms (dry cough and dyspnea), a number of other associ-
ated symptoms have been described, including fever, diarrhea,
abdominal pain, fatigue, and altered mental status. Potential
neurologic manifestations are increasingly recognized but may
be underreported.4-8 A potential association between COVID-
19 and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) has been suggested in
2 recent editorial correspondences;7,8 however, the temporal
relationship of GBS antecedent to COVID-19 symptomatology
raised a question of causality in 1 report.7 In this brief report,
we detail a case of bifacial weakness with paresthesia subtype
GBS that demonstrated a postinfectious temporal association
with COVID-19, developing approximately 2 weeks after the
onset of COVID-19 symptomatology. This Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act–compliant investigation
was reviewed by the institutional review board at our medical
school and was (BFP) exempt from further review and
monitoring.
Case Report
A 21-year-old man presented to the emergency department with
progressive 4-day history of fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, nau-
sea, headache, and sinonasal congestion. Aside from a medical
history of hypertension, prediabetes, and class I obesity, the
patient was otherwise healthy and denied tobacco, alcohol, sub-
stance abuse, or recent travel. Vital signs were remarkable for a
body temperature of 37.5°C, blood pressure of 116/57 mm Hg,
pulse of 76 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation of 95% on
room air. Physical examination documented nonlabored respira-
tions and clear lungs. Neurologic examination was intact. Chest
radiographs (Fig 1) demonstrated patchy bilateral air space opac-
ities without lobar consolidation.
A nasopharyngeal swab was performed, and a respiratory
pathogen panel was negative for all tested pathogens. Additionally,
nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were sent to
an outside private laboratory for SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse
transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. He was dis-
charged home with pulse oximetry monitoring, self-isolation
instructions, and strict return precautions.

During the next 24hours, the patient experienced increased
dizziness with oxygen saturation falling into the mid-80s docu-
mented by pulse oximetry. He returned to the emergency depart-
ment febrile (body temperature of 39.1°C), mildly tachycardic
(102 beats per minute), tachypneic (28 breaths per minute), and
hypoxic (89% on room air). Chest radiographs demonstrated
increased bilateral air space opacities, and a complete blood count
revealed lymphopenia (absolute lymphocyte count of 0.7 K/
mm3). He was admitted for oxygen support and monitoring, and
blood oxygenation was weaned from 2 L by nasal canula to room
air. He was discharged home on hospital day 4, and his sent-out
testing confirmed COVID-19 positivity the day after discharge.
He initially did well with convalescence at home, but on day
16 of illness, he began to experience right-sided facial numbness
and weakness. During 24hours, his symp-
toms became bilateral and resulted in
severe dysarthria, necessitating a return
to
the
emergency
department.
He
also
reported
associated
hypogeusia.
Neurologic examination demonstrated a
bilateral lower motor neuron pattern of fa-
cial weakness with otherwise normal cra-
nial nerve (CN) examination findings,
preserved strength and sensation in all
extremities, and intact muscle stretch
reflexes. He was admitted for observation
and underwent MR imaging of the brain
and temporal bones, as well as fluoro-
scopically guided lumbar puncture for
CSF sampling. The CSF was negative for
bacterial culture and stain and demon-
strated normal glucose levels (65 mg/dL),
no leukocytes, and mildly elevated protein
levels (49mg/dL). MR imaging demon-
strated abnormal enhancement of the
facial (CNVII) and abducens (CNVI)
nerves bilaterally, as well as the right ocu-
lomotor nerve (CNIII) (Figs 2–4).
The patient was discharged with
stable facial weakness, no progression
of symptoms, and oxygen saturation
of 99% on room air. Neurology outpa-
tient follow-up was arranged with
multiple CSF and serum lab results
pending. On day 19 of illness, he
reported new subjective bilateral lower
extremity weakness, bilateral upper
extremity paresthesia, and continued
facial weakness, prompting readmis-
sion for further work-up and treat-
ment. Repeat neurologic examination
demonstrated
unchanged
bifacial
weakness, but new grade 4/5 weakness
in the deltoids and hip flexors bilater-
ally, as well as diffuse areflexia. MR
imaging of the total spine was per-
formed, which did not reveal any sus-
picious spinal cord signal abnormality or abnormal enhancement
of the cord or cauda equina. Electromyography and nerve con-
duction studies demonstrated findings consistent with an acute
sensorimotor polyneuropathy with both demyelinating and axo-
nal features (On-line Tables 1–4).
For religious reasons, he declined treatment with intravenous
immunoglobulin (Ig) and alternatively underwent treatment with
5 cycles of plasma exchange, which he tolerated well with slight
improvement in facial weakness and paresthesia. Findings of CSF
labs and serologies remained negative except for serum herpes
simplex virus (HSV), immunoglobulin G (IgG), and immuno-
globulin M (IgM), and the patient was discharged to inpatient
rehabilitation. He declined a repeat lumbar puncture that was
offered before discharge.

paresthesia subtype Guillain-Barré syndrome. Posterior-anterior (A) and lateral (B) upright chest
radiographs demonstrate low lung volumes with patchy bilateral air space opacities, but no lobar
consolidation.
FIG 2. MR imaging of the temporal bones in a patient with antecedent COVID-19 and new-onset
bifacial weakness and paresthesia subtype Guillain-Barré syndrome. Coronal postcontrast T1-
weighted fat-saturated MR imaging of the right (A) and left (B) temporal bones demonstrates
abnormal “tuft-like” enhancement at the anterior-superior fundus of the internal auditory canal
bilaterally (white arrows), corresponding to the distal canalicular segments of the facial nerves
(CNVII). Note additional contrast enhancement along the tympanic segments of the facial nerve
bilaterally (white arrowheads), which is greater in degree than typically encountered.
Enhancement along the canalicular segments of the facial nerves (white arrows) is always consid-
ered abnormal on MR imaging, though mild tympanic segment enhancement is considered within
normal limits.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Diagnostic Testing for COVID-19
At the initial emergency department visit, chest radiography (Fig
1) was performed, and nasopharyngeal swab specimens were sent
for multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction via
a NxTAG Respiratory Pathogen Panel (Luminex) to assess ade-
novirus, influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza 1, parainfluenza
2, parainfluenza 3, parainfluenza 4, Chlamydia pneumoniae,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, bocavirus, coronavirus, respiratory
syncytial virus A, respiratory syncytial virus B, metapneumovirus,
rhinovirus, and enterovirus infection (On-line Table 5). Additional
nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens were sent
to an outside private laboratory (Viracor Eurofins Clinical
Diagnostics) for SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse-transcriptase po-
lymerase chain reaction testing. During subsequent hospital read-
missions and before final discharge, COVID-19 status was tested
with nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs and SARS-CoV-2
PCR assays performed at our hospital laboratory.
Diagnostic Testing for GBS
MR imaging of the brain, temporal bones, and total spine was
performed (Figs 2–4). Respective serologic, stool, and urine
antibody tests, including antiganglioside (GM1, GD1b, and
GQ1b IgG and IgM), aquaporin-4 receptor (IgG), HIV 1/2,
HSV 1/2 (IgG and IgM), cytomegalovirus (IgM), Mycoplasma
pneumoniae (IgG and IgM), Borrelia burgdorferi (IgG and
IgM), Bartonella species (IgG and IgM), and syphilis (Venereal
Disease Research Laboratory test), were obtained (On-line
Tables 6–9). A serum angiotensin-converting enzyme level was
also obtained to screen for sarcoidosis. CSF was tested for cell
count, protein and glucose levels, red blood cell count, and infec-
tious etiologies, including bacterial and fungal culture and stain,
meningoencephalitis panel (varicella
zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, entero-
virus, HSV 1, HSV 2, human herpesvi-
rus 6, human parechovirus, Epstein-
Barr virus, Cryptococcus neoformans/
gattii, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus
influenzae, Listeria monocytogenes,
Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus
agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumo-
niae), Bartonella species, syphilis, and
Lyme disease (On-line Table 10).
RESULTS
Specimen Testing for COVID-19
Positive SARS-CoV-2 viral status was
confirmed via initial sent-out naso-
pharyngeal/oropharyngeal swabs. On
subsequent hospital readmission, in-
ternal PCR reconfirmed SARS-CoV-
2 viral status. Repeat PCR before dis-
charge was negative for SARS-CoV-2
detection.

weighted fat-saturated MR imaging of the temporal bones (A) shows subtle-but-abnormal
enhancement along the cisternal segments of the abducens nerves (CNVI) bilaterally (white
arrows), as well as subtle enhancement along the tympanic segments of the intratemporal facial
nerves (CNVII) bilaterally (white arrowheads). Coronal postcontrast T1-weighted fat-saturated
MR imaging (B) shows subtle asymmetric enhancement along the cisternal segment of the right
oculomotor nerve (CNIII, black arrow).

(CNIII, white arrow, A), the cisternal segments of the abducens nerves (CNVI) bilaterally (white arrowheads, B), the distal canalicular segments
of the facial nerves (CNVII) bilaterally (black arrows, C), and the proximal tympanic segments of the intratemporal facial nerves (CNVII) bilater-
ally (black arrowheads, C).

Specimen Testing for GBS
Serologic testing for infectious and inflammatory mimics was
unremarkable apart from elevated HSV-1 IgGof .8.0 and initial
HSV-1/2 IgM of 1.07 index values (On-line Tables 6–9). Repeat
HSV-1/2 IgM at 10 days postpresentation was further elevated at
2.39 index values. CSF protein was mildly elevated (49 mg/dL,
which corrected to 46 mg/dL when accounting for 2425 red blood
cells) with no white blood cells. CSF stains were negative for bac-
terial or fungal organisms, and cultures demonstrated no growth.
The CSF meningoencephalitis panel and Bartonella species, syph-
ilis, and Lyme disease tests were also negative (On-line Table 10).
DISCUSSION
Our report details a case of bifacial weakness and paresthesia
subtype Guillain-Barré syndrome that was temporally associ-
ated with COVID-19. In our case, a patient with antecedent
community-acquired COVID-19 pneumonia developed rapidly
progressive bilateral facial weakness, extremity paresthesia, and
mild proximal extremity weakness without ataxia or other cra-
nial neuropathies 16 days after the onset of COVID-19 symp-
tomatology.
He
exhibited
clinicoradiologic
features
most
consistent with GBS, affecting CNVII bilaterally and lacking
antiganglioside antibodies, concordant with prior reports of
BFP subtype GBS.8-10 Our patient demonstrated imaging find-
ings that align with prior reports of GBS following antecedent
viral infections.11,12 Enhancement of the cranial nerves is a
known MR imaging finding in GBS,8,13,14 and most interesting,
our patient demonstrated abnormal enhancement of CNVI
bilaterally and the right CNIII, which were clinically asymptom-
atic. On the basis of clinical grounds, we suspect that this indi-
cates subclinical disease in the BFP variant of GBS, rather than
the Miller Fisher variant of GBS,15 given lack of ophthalmopare-
sis and ataxia. Our patient did not demonstrate any typical spi-
nal imaging manifestations of GBS, which may include
thickening of the cauda equina nerve roots with enhancement,
often with a ventral nerve root predilection.16,17
To date, a recent editorial correspondence reports a small
observational series of 5 cases of suspected COVID-19–associated
GBS,8 but no prior detailed clinical reports have been published.
In a previously reported case of possible COVID-19–associated
GBS in a patient with recent travel to Wuhan, the patient mani-
fested an atypical temporal profile with acute bilateral lower
extremity weakness as an initial presenting symptom and subse-
quent development of COVID-19 pneumonia on hospital day 8,
raising concern for coincidental disease processes and possible
nosocomial infection.7
Our case demonstrates a postinfectious temporal relation-
ship between antecedent SARS-CoV-2 infection and GBS
symptomatology, but positive HSV serologies remain a con-
founder.
Although
ubiquitous,
HSV
infection
has
been
reported as an extremely rare antecedent to GBS.18-22 Whether
in our case the GBS was directly caused by COVID-19, the
COVID-19–associated
systemic
inflammatory
response
unmasked or exacerbated an HSV-mediated GBS, or the
patient simply manifested unfortunately timed coexisting dis-
ease processes remains unknowable. However, we note prior
immunologic research by Ziganshin et al19 that demonstrated
an increased risk of GBS triggering in simultaneous polyviral
infection, including HSV, which might have important implica-
tions for the pathoetiology of GBS in our patient. Most impor-
tant, the temporal association of antecedent COVID-19 and
subsequent development of GBS symptomatology in our
patient necessitates physicians being made aware of this possi-
ble linkage consideration.
GBS is a diverse disorder of the peripheral nervous system
characterized by acute immune-mediated neuropathy, which
may be broadly categorized into acute motor axonal neuropathy,
acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, and
acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy,23-25 as well as subdi-
vided into clinically distinct variants, such as Miller Fisher variant
and BFP.9,10,15 GBS is commonly associated with immune stimu-
lation from antecedent bacterial or viral infection, including gas-
trointestinal infection and upper respiratory tract infections.23-26
GBS is thought to be due, in great part, to molecular mimicry,23
whereby antibodies created in response to infectious antigens
cross-react with neurons and the myelin sheath, causing demye-
lination and/or axonal damage. GBS is typically multiphasic, with
rapid progression, a prolonged plateau, and variable recovery
with approximately 15%–20% permanent disability at 1 year.23,27
GBS-related mortality is approximately 5%, often due to neuro-
muscular respiratory failure and autonomic dysfunction.23,27
Early intravenous immunoglobulin or plasma exchange, along
with supportive care, is the mainstay of therapy.
There are limited data regarding neurologic manifestations
of COVID-19 infection. A recently published retrospective,
observational case series from Mao et al4 suggested that neuro-
logic manifestations of COVID-19 may be underrecognized.
They report neurologic manifestations in up to 36% of hospital-
ized patients with COVID-19, including dizziness (16.8%),
headache (13.1%), and altered level of consciousness (7.5%), as
well as impaired taste (5.6%), smell (5.1%), and vision (1.4%),
but no cases of GBS. COVID-19 has recently been implicated as
a presumptive cause of acute hemorrhagic necrotizing ence-
phalopathy, which may represent an intracranial manifestation
of a COVID-19–related cytokine storm.5 There is also suspicion
that the prothrombotic and proinflammatory states associated
with COVID-19 may increase the incidence of cerebrovascular
disease,4,6 though there is a paucity of evidence in the currently
published literature. Neurotropic animal and human coronavi-
ruses have been identified,28 and coronavirus-associated GBS
has been previously reported, including Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome.29,30 Given genetic similarities among the coronavi-
ruses, it is conceivable that similar neuropathology might be seen
with SARS-CoV-2.
CONCLUSIONS
This report details a case of postinfectious acute peripheral poly-
neuropathy in a patient recently diagnosed with and convalescing
from community-acquired COVID-19, highlighting the multidis-
ciplinary collaboration required to diagnose and manage this
complex patient. The clinicoradiologic features and temporal
profile are most consistent with a BFP subtype of GBS. Given the
paucity of data regarding neurologic manifestations of COVID-

and reporting of its potential neurologic sequelae.
