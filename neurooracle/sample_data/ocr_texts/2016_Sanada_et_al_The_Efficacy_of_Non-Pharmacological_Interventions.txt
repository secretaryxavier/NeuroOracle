Abstract:
Several studies have investigated the relationship between non-pharmacological
interventions (NPIs) and peripheral brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in schizophrenia
patients. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to review the efﬁcacy of NPIs
on peripheral serum and plasma BDNF in subjects with schizophrenia (including schizoaffective
disorder). Meta-analyses were conducted to examine the effects of NPIs on blood BDNF levels
by using the standardized mean differences (SMDs) between the intervention groups and controls.
In total, six randomized controlled trials with 289 participants were included. Of them, ﬁve studies
used exercise, physical training or diet products. One study used cognitive training. Overall, the
BDNF levels in the NPI group increased signiﬁcantly compared with the control groups (SMD = 0.95,
95% conﬁdence interval (CI) = 0.07 to 1.83, p = 0.03). Subgroup analyses indicated beneﬁcial effects of
a non-exercise intervention on peripheral BDNF levels (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.74, p = 0.01).
Meta-regression analyses showed that the completion rate inﬂuenced the variation in SMD (p = 0.01).
Despite insufﬁcient evidence to draw a conclusion, our results suggest that use of NPIs as adjunctive
treatments, speciﬁcally non-exercise interventions, may affect positively serum or plasma BDNF in
patients with schizophrenia.

1. Introduction
Over the past several decades, treatments with both ﬁrst- and second-generation antipsychotics
(FGAs and SGAs, respectively) have certainly reduced psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and
delusions) in patients with schizophrenia. However, the efﬁcacy of FGAs and SGAs, speciﬁcally in
terms of negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, has been limited. It has been suggested that a
possible explanation for this lack of effect is that negative symptoms and cognitive deﬁcits could be
caused by disruptions in neurodevelopment; therefore, the modulation of a single neurotransmitter
does not produce a full symptomatic response [1]. Hence, recently various types of interventions
targeting inﬂammation and oxidative stress in particular have been used. Some examples applied in
schizophrenia include the add-on treatment of omega 3 fatty acids [2], the add-on treatment of N-acetyl
cysteine (NAC) [3], folate plus vitamin B12 [4], and mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) [5].
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the most abundant of the growth factor family, has
been shown to play important roles in neurodevelopment, survival and the differentiation of neurons,
and synaptic plasticity [6]. BDNF protein is present in human platelets, and platelet BDNF is released
into serum but not into plasma when the blood sample is processed for analysis. Peripheral levels of
BDNF in serum are much higher than in plasma [7]. A considerable number of studies, at both the
preclinical and clinical levels, have examined the relationship between BDNF and mental disorders,
not just psychotic disorders but depression [8,9], anxiety disorder [8], post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) [10], and Alzheimer’s disease [11]. A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that peripheral levels
of serum and plasma BDNF were moderately decreased in schizophrenia compared with controls [12].
In addition, a clinical study observed a positive correlation between plasma and cerebrospinal ﬂuid
(CSF) BDNF levels in drug-naïve ﬁrst-episode psychotic (FEP) subjects [13]. With respect to the
association between antipsychotic therapy and changes in BDNF levels in schizophrenia, ﬁndings
from previous studies are inconsistent, although the same meta-analysis [12] demonstrated that the
plasma levels of BDNF, not serum levels, increased with antipsychotic treatment independent of each
patient’s response to medication.
On the other hand, several trials assessing the alterations in peripheral BDNF after
non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) in schizophrenia have been conducted. For example,
Kuo et al. [14] reported that a 10-week non-pharmacological weight reduction program in the day-care
unit, (including lifestyle modiﬁcation, psychosocial/behavioral therapy, and exercise), reduced body
weight with an elevation in serum BDNF levels in schizophrenia. In addition, Shiina et al. [15] noted
that 8-week augmentation therapy with sulforaphane (SFN)-rich broccoli sprout extract improved
some domains of cognitive function in schizophrenia, whereas there was no remarkable change in
serum BDNF after the trial. Thus, the aim of the current study was to review the efﬁcacy of NPIs on
peripheral serum and plasma BDNF in subjects with schizophrenia.
2. Methods
2.1. Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) [16] guidelines and the recommendations of the Cochrane Collaboration [17], we conducted
a systematic computerized literature search of EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO from inception
until 5 November 2015 with no restrictions on language in order to avoid language publication bias.
The following search terms were used: (schizophreni*) AND (brain derived neurotrophic factor OR
bdnf). The reference lists of the identiﬁed original articles and reviews were also hand searched for
additional studies that may have been missed. The study eligibility criteria are shown in Table 1.
We made a decision regarding whether to include articles based on these criteria.
The protocol was registered with PROSPERO, registration number CRD42015029701 [18].

2.2. Data Extraction
Two authors (Kenji Sanada and Iñaki Zorrilla) independently screened all titles and abstracts to
identify possible articles for full text retrieval. The full texts of potentially eligible studies were assessed
independently by the same two reviewers (Kenji Sanada and Iñaki Zorrilla). Any discrepancies or
divergences were resolved through discussion and consensus, and when in doubt, the ﬁnal decision
was made in consultation with a third author (Ana González-Pinto). When the necessary data were
not available from the included studies, we contacted each author and requested the information.
We extracted the following variables:
characteristics of the participants (i.e., number of
participants, diagnoses of participants, diagnostic procedure, conditions of participants, age, gender,
completion rate, duration of illness, daily dose of antipsychotics in chlorpromazine equivalents, body
mass index, and smoking status), characteristics of NPIs and controls (contents and duration of
intervention), type of control group (i.e., active control, AC, or passive control, PC), BDNF levels,
BDNF measurement and assessments (i.e., source, unit, kit, collection time and total time points), and
study design (study locations and sources of funding).
2.3. Assessment of Risk of Bias
Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool [19] to assess possible sources of
bias: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding
of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting, and other sources
of bias. An assessment of the validity of the included studies was carried out by two reviewers
(Kenji Sanada and Iñaki Zorrilla) independently, and any divergences were resolved through discussion
or consultation with a third reviewer (Ana González-Pinto).
2.4. Data Synthesis
Review Manager (RevMan) version 5.3 (http://tech.cochrane.org/revman, The Cochrane
Collaboration, London, UK) was used to conduct the meta-analysis and the subgroup and sensitivity
analyses. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) between the intervention and control groups were
determined by calculating the differences in the BDNF levels between the mean changes, namely the
differences between pre- and post-intervention scores. The inverse variance statistical method and
random effects model were used to adjust for study heterogeneity [20]. In cases where there were two
control groups (i.e., AC and PC) in a study, we used PC and calculated the SMD between the groups.
The 95% conﬁdence interval (95% CI) was also calculated [21,22]. Effects were categorized as small
(SMD = 0.2), indicating a small difference in BDNF levels between the intervention and control groups,
moderate (SMD = 0.5), and large (SMD = 0.8) [23].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016, 17, 1766

We tested the heterogeneity using the I2 statistic, assuming a value of 25% to indicate low
heterogeneity, 50%, moderate, and 75%, high [24–26]. We also calculated the Q statistic and the
associated p-value. A signiﬁcant p-value (<0.05) indicates the presence of heterogeneity. Because
the analyses showed that the studies were heterogeneous, leave-one-out sensitivity analyses [26]
were performed to assess the potential inﬂuences of any one single study on the pooled SMD and
associated p-values.
Subgroup analyses were conducted with the mixed effects model to evaluate possible differences
according to the intervention (exercise group or other groups) and comparison groups (AC or PC).
The direction of the effects was positive if patients presented increased BDNF levels and negative
if they showed decreased BDNF levels after intervention within the group.
A comprehensive meta-analysis (www.meta-analysis.com) was used to perform meta-regression
analyses, taking separately the mean age, percentage of male patients, completion rate, duration
of intervention, daily dose of antipsychotics in chlorpromazine (CPZ) equivalents, and body mass
index (BMI).
Publication bias was assessed initially through the construction of a funnel plot analysis [27–29].
Egger’s test was used to contrast the null hypothesis with biased absences [30], and Duval and
Tweedie’s trim and ﬁll procedure [27] provided a number of studies that were probably absent.
All of the tests were bilateral and they performed with a signiﬁcance level of p-value <0.05, except
for the bias-related tests, which were unilateral.
3. Results
The PRISMA ﬂow diagram of the study search and selection process is displayed in Figure 1.
We included six randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 289 participants (273 cases with patients and
16 healthy controls) in total.
3.1. Included Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)
The characteristics of each included study are summarized in Table 2. The studies were published
from 2009 to 2015 and conducted in North America (n = 3) [31–33], East Asia (n = 2) [34,35], and the
Middle East (n = 1) [36]. Of the included six RCTs, only two studies [31,34] were performed under AC
conditions and one [31] was under a two-arm control design, i.e., AC and PC. The sample size ranged
from 33 to 72 (mean: 48.1 ± 14.9). The mean age of subjects varied from 32.3 ± 10.2 to 53.5 ± 9.9 years.
The proportion of males was 68.9% ± 5.7%. Only two studies reported that the length of illness
ranged from 9.3 ± 7.3 to 25.3 ± 9.6 years [34,36]. The mean antipsychotic daily dose in CPZ equivalent
doses [37–40] varied from 258.9 ± 232.5 to 733.5 ± 432.5 mg.
Three categories of NPIs were used in the included studies: exercise or physical training, diet
products, and cognitive training. Almost all studies except one [31] were carried out using exercise or
physical training [32,34,35] or diet products [33,36]. One study [31] used cognitive training. The average
duration of each intervention was 10.6 ± 2.4 weeks (from 8 to 14).
All but one study [33] measured BDNF levels using an Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay
(ELISA) kit (Table S1). BDNF measurements were primarily taken at two time points: before and after
the intervention. One study measured the levels of BDNF not only pre- and post-intervention but also
at another time during the intervention [31]. BDNF was assessed in serum, except for in one study [34]
that measured plasma levels. Two trials [32,34] collected BDNF in the morning and another one [31] in
the early afternoon, while the other three [33,35,36] did not note the collection time.

3.2. Risk of Bias
The risk of bias in the included studies is shown in Figures S1 and S2. Of the included six RCTs,
ﬁve studies (83.3%) were judged as having an ‘unclear risk’ for performance bias because they did not
clarify the methods for blinding participants and personnel. The allocation concealment and blinding
of the outcome assessment were also undeclared, leading to ‘unclear risk’ in three studies (50.0%) for
the detection bias, respectively. Four studies (66.6%) were regarded as at ‘high risk’ of attrition bias due
to an inappropriate application of simple imputation. Four studies (66.6%) did not report all the data
of the study’s pre-speciﬁed outcomes and were considered ‘high risk’ for reporting bias. Regarding
other sources of bias, one study (16.6%) did not reveal funding support and it was judged as having an
‘unclear risk’, although the other studies were supported by government or non-proﬁt organizations.
Finally, only one study (16.6%) was considered to have a ‘low risk’ for bias, being of high quality.
3.3. Meta-Analyses
In the NPI group, the overall analysis showed a signiﬁcant increase in peripheral BDNF levels
compared with controls (SMD = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.07 to 1.83, p = 0.03) as shown in Figure 2. As the
studies were highly heterogeneous (I2 = 90.0%, p < 0.001), sensitivity analyses were conducted to
determine whether an individual study was responsible for this heterogeneity. The results remained
highly signiﬁcant in each case (I2: from 91.0% to 92.0%), except when one single study [35] was
excluded (I2 = 0.0%). In addition, we exploratory examined the effects of one outlier study [35] on
BDNF levels. The results showed signiﬁcant effects of NPIs on BDNF when the study was excluded
(SMD = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.58, p = 0.02).

levels. There were signiﬁcant effects of NPIs in peripheral BDNF levels in the intervention groups
compared with controls. BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CI, conﬁdence interval; IV, inverse
variance; SD, standard deviation; Std, standard.
3.4. Subgroup Analyses
The results are shown in Figures S3 and S4. We conducted the subgroup analysis by dividing
the studies according to the intervention (exercise or non-exercise) and type of control (AC or PC).
In the studies with exercise intervention [32,34,35], the beneﬁcial effects of NPIs on BDNF levels were
not found. On the other hand, we found that the studies with non-exercise interventions [31,33,36]
showed increased BDNF levels (SMD = 0.41, 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.74, p = 0.01). In the subgroup analysis
of the control groups (AC or PC), no signiﬁcant effects were observed in either group. In all subgroup
analyses, the heterogeneity remained high, except for the subgroup of non-exercise, in which it was
signiﬁcantly decreased (I2 = 5.0%).
3.5. Meta-Regression Analyses
We found there was a signiﬁcant association between the SMDs of the effects of NPIs on peripheral
BDNF levels and the completion rate (Figure 3).
This association indicated that the lower the
completion rate, the lower the SMDs of the effects of NPIs on blood BDNF levels (slope = 0.025,

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016, 17, 1766
8 of 14
95% CI = 0.004 to 0.047, p = 0.019). There were no associations between the SMDs and age, proportion
of males, duration of intervention, antipsychotic dose in CPZ equivalent dose, and BMI (Figure S5).

had a positive association with SMDs of effects of NPIs on blood BDNF levels (slope = 0.025, 95%
CI = 0.004 to 0.047, p = 0.019). BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CI, conﬁdence interval; NPIs,
non-pharmacological interventions; SMD, standardized mean difference.
3.6. Publication Bias
The publication bias statistic of Egger’s test was signiﬁcant (p = 0.04). The SMDs were not changed
when the trim-and-ﬁll method was used (SMD = 1.00 to 1.00). The funnel plot is shown in Figure S6.
4. Discussion
Despite a host of existing trials addressing the effects of pharmacological interventions (PIs) on
peripheral BDNF levels in schizophrenia, while discrepant ﬁndings have been observed both in serum
and plasma levels of BDNF [41–48], few studies have examined the association between NPIs and
peripheral BDNF levels in patients with schizophrenia, and the results of studies have been discordant.
This meta-analysis included six RCTs with 289 participants in total.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst meta-analysis to examine the effects of NPIs on blood
BDNF levels in schizophrenia. Our ﬁndings demonstrate that BDNF levels increase signiﬁcantly with
NPIs compared with other control treatments. This increase is consistent with the recent meta-analysis
regarding the inﬂuence of PIs on peripheral BDNF levels, although the increase is only in the plasma
levels of BDNF, not the serum levels, after PIs were found [11].
In subgroup analyses, we demonstrated signiﬁcant effects of non-exercise interventions [31,33,36],
including diet products and cognitive training, on blood BDNF levels in schizophrenia. With respect
to these non-exercise interventions, few studies have reported the relationship between these types of
interventions and BDNF levels in schizophrenia. For example, aside from these three interventions,
8-week sulforaphane (SFN) supplementation therapy was found to improve some domains of cognitive
function in schizophrenia, while no signiﬁcant change in serum BDNF levels was found [14]. Other
studies only using animal experiments reported that the levels of BDNF in rodents were increased
in response to a spatial learning task [49] or cognitively stimulating environments [50]. Meanwhile,
ﬁndings from previous studies have noted that a decreased expression of BDNF may be related
to schizophrenia patients. For example, a reduction in BDNF concentrations has been reported
in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus in schizophrenia compared with controls [51–54].

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2016, 17, 1766

A reduction in peripheral BDNF levels has been reported in patients with schizophrenia compared
to healthy controls [31,41,44,55,56], including medication naïve and ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia
patients [12,43,57–60]. However, a few studies reported increased serum BDNF levels [61,62] or
no signiﬁcant differences in serum BDNF levels [63,64]. In addition, note that peripheral levels of
BDNF are signiﬁcantly correlated with cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) concentrations [12,65,66].
To the contrary, no signiﬁcant effects were found in the subgroup analysis with respect to exercise
interventions, while one outlier study [35] showed a large effect of combined exercise on serum
BDNF. It is not clear whether this ﬁnding is speciﬁc to chronic patients with schizophrenia, is due
to hospitalized patients, or is applicable to patients with ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia. Exercise or
physical training, however, is one activity used to increase the levels of BDNF in the brain, as already
noted [67–69]. Moreover, although the ﬁndings did not show a pronounced effect on plasma BDNF,
some previous RCTs demonstrated the beneﬁts of yoga therapy in schizophrenia compared with
exercise training, speciﬁcally in negative symptoms and social function [70–72]. A recent RCT also
concluded that both aerobic exercise and yoga groups for early psychosis improved neurocognitive
function [73]. Several factors may cause differences in the results of this analysis, e.g., age, completion
rate, exercise intensity, and duration of intervention. Given that exercise and yoga therapy have a
positive effect in schizophrenia, further trials with exercise training including yoga under conditions
with moderate intensity and duration for schizophrenia patients could be designed to determine their
effect on BDNF levels.
In meta-regression analyses, we demonstrated that the completion rate was associated with the
effects of NPIs on BDNF levels, while no correlations were found between the effects of BDNF and
age, proportion of males, duration of intervention, antipsychotic dose in CPZ equivalent dose, and
BMI. However, the association between age and BDNF levels in this population has been reported.
For example, a meta-analysis identiﬁed the evidence of a positive correlation between lowered levels
of peripheral BDNF in schizophrenia and increasing age [74]. Another meta-analysis also showed
evidence of an inverse relation between lowered blood BDNF levels and a greater illness length [11].
Future studies are needed to investigate the relationships between alterations in peripheral BDNF
and some variables, including age, proportion of males, completion rate, duration of intervention,
antipsychotic doses, and BMI.
As a whole, the ﬁndings indicate the possibility that NPIs may have a favorable effect on blood
BDNF in schizophrenia patients, although the efﬁcacy of each NPI was unclear. In addition, it is not yet
known whether similar alterations in peripheral BDNF that are observed in other psychotic diseases
can be improved by NPIs. Moreover, increases in BDNF caused by NPIs can be studied in a healthy
population. Hence, further research is needed to clarify the effects of NPIs on blood BDNF in healthy
subjects, as well as in the patients with psychotic diseases, including schizophrenia.
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, the number of RCTs addressing NPIs on peripheral
BDNF in schizophrenia is limited. Only six RCTs were included in this review. Moreover, their
quality was evidently low, as only one study was considered high quality [31]. Our results need to
be interpreted with caution; Secondly, the number of subjects in each study was small, as the mean
sample size was 48.1 ± 14.9; Third, most participants were men (the percentage of men: 68.9% ± 5.7%).
This gender imbalance may lead to bias in the ﬁndings; Fourthly, no study has evaluated the long-term
effects of NPIs, that is, no included trials incorporated a follow-up period. Future research protocols
concerning NPI implementation with a focus on alterations in blood BDNF levels in schizophrenia
may ﬁnd it beneﬁcial to include a follow-up period; Fifthly, a high level of heterogeneity was found
among NPIs. They can be divided into three categories: exercise or physical training, diet products,
and cognitive training; Sixthly, a high diversity among the control groups, i.e., AC and PC, was
found; Finally, of the included trials, only two studies reported smoking status in each subject [31,32].
Pre-clinical and clinical studies have noted the relationship between nicotine and alterations in BDNF
expression [75–78]. For future research, more attention might be paid to the inﬂuence of smoking on
BDNF levels.

5. Conclusions
The results of our review show that, while the efﬁcacy of each NPI on serum or plasma BDNF
levels in patients with schizophrenia was inconsistent, NPIs have a beneﬁcial effect on peripheral
BDNF in schizophrenia. As several unresolved questions still exist however, further studies are clearly
required, with a focus on the following points: (1) NPIs, particularly non-exercise interventions,
including diet products and cognitive training, may present with pronounced effects on BDNF;
(2) longitudinal RCTs with a follow-up duration in a healthy population, as well as in patients
with a psychotic disease, may contribute to elucidate the speciﬁc features in each NPI; and (3) the
characteristics of patients with schizophrenia (i.e., age, gender ratio, daily antipsychotic doses, BMI,
and smoking status) and NPIs (i.e., duration of intervention) may affect the levels of blood BDNF
after NPI.
