Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) encodes five type VII secretion
systems (T7SS), designated ESX-1–ESX-5, that are critical for
growth and pathogenesis. The best characterized is ESX-1, which
profoundly impacts host cell interactions. In contrast, the ESX-3
T7SS is implicated in metal homeostasis, but efforts to define its
function have been limited by an inability to recover deletion mu-
tants. We overcame this impediment using medium supplemented
with various iron complexes to recover mutants with deletions
encompassing select genes within esx-3 or the entire operon.
The esx-3 mutants were defective in uptake of siderophore-bound
iron and dramatically accumulated cell-associated mycobactin side-
rophores. Proteomic analyses of culture filtrate revealed that se-
cretion of EsxG and EsxH was codependent and that EsxG–EsxH
also facilitated secretion of several members of the proline-glutamic
acid (PE) and proline-proline-glutamic acid (PPE) protein families
(named for conserved PE and PPE N-terminal motifs). Substrates that
depended on EsxG–EsxH for secretion included PE5, encoded within
the esx-3 locus, and the evolutionarily related PE15–PPE20 encoded
outside the esx-3 locus. In vivo characterization of the mutants un-
expectedly showed that the ESX-3 secretion system plays both iron-
dependent and -independent roles in Mtb pathogenesis. PE5–PPE4
was found to be critical for the siderophore-mediated iron-acquisi-
tion functions of ESX-3. The importance of this iron-acquisition
function was dependent upon host genotype, suggesting a role
for ESX-3 secretion in counteracting host defense mechanisms that
restrict iron availability. Further, we demonstrate that the ESX-3
T7SS secretes certain effectors that are important for iron uptake
while additional secreted effectors modulate virulence in an
iron-independent fashion.

acterial secretion systems play roles in pathogenesis, anti-
genicity, and virulence and are keys to understanding host–
pathogen interactions (1, 2). Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),
the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), encodes five type VII
secretion systems (T7SS) within genomic loci referred to as “esx-1”
through “esx-5” (3). There is considerable interest in understanding
these secretion systems, because they appear to be central to Mtb
pathogenesis. ESX-1 has been studied most extensively because
deletion of a large portion of this coding region is the primary
attenuating mutation in Mycobacterium bovis-bacillus Calmette–
Guérin (bacillus Calmette–Guérin), the widely used TB vaccine
(4–6). In addition to containing the secretion apparatus itself,
esx-1 encodes several substrates, including a pair of small helical
proteins belonging to the WXG100 family as well as members of
the proline-glutamic acid (PE) and proline-proline-glutamic acid
(PPE) families (named for conserved N-terminal amino acid
signatures) (7). A large body of data points to the importance of
ESX-1 in modulating host cell signaling and bacterial trafficking,
perhaps in large measure because of a membrane-lytic function
(8, 9). However, the precise mechanisms whereby individual
substrates contribute to ESX-1 functions are less clear. The less-
investigated ESX-3 provides an alternate system by which we can
explore how T7SS contribute to growth and virulence. ESX-3 has
been thought primarily to play a bacterial intrinsic role in metal
homeostasis. This notion is based on the observation that the esx-3
gene cluster (Rv0282–Rv0292) is transcriptionally de-repressed in
response to iron and zinc starvation and on genetic data pointing
to a role for ESX-3 in using iron bound to the siderophore
mycobactin (Mb) in both nonpathogenic mycobacteria and Mtb
(10–13). Similar to the esx-1 locus, esx-3 also encodes a pair of
WXG100 family members (EsxG and EsxH) and PE–PPE pro-
teins (PE5 and PPE4) (3), but their specific functions remain
largely undefined.
Emerging data point to additional roles of ESX-3 in virulence
and modulation of immune responses. Introduction of Mtb esx-3
into Mycobacterium smegmatis (Msmeg) strains lacking the
Significance
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) uses type VII secretion systems
to secrete cognate protein pairs that alter host interactions. Here,
we address the contributions of the ESX-3 secretion system to
Mtb growth and pathogenesis through a combination of genet-
ics, proteomics, and growth studies both in vitro and in vivo.
ESX-3 is demonstrated to play a critical role in iron acquisition
through secretion of a pair pf proteins belonging to the PE–PPE
family (PE5–PPE4). In vivo, the importance of PE5–PPE4 secre-
tion was found to depend upon host genotype, likely reflect-
ing a host capacity to restrict iron availability. However,
secreted effectors EsxG–EsxH play an iron-independent role in
Mtb virulence. Therefore, ESX-3 secretes multiple effectors that
target distinct host pathways to influence pathogenesis.

endogenous locus generates altered cytokine responses, and, when
used as a vaccine, this strain protects against subsequent challenge
with Mtb (14). EsxG and EsxH form a heterodimer (15) and
generate prominent CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses in mice and
humans (16–18). The EsxG–EsxH complex impairs phagosomal
maturation by interfering with the host endosomal sorting com-
plex required for transport (ESCRT) (19). Finally, repression of
the entire esx-3 locus in bacillus Calmette–Guérin impairs bacte-
rial survival in macrophages (13). Although ESX-3 has been im-
plicated in both metal homeostasis and virulence, it is not known
whether these two phenomena are related, and the roles of spe-
cific effectors are undefined. Investigation of these questions has
been hampered by the essentiality of ESX-3 in standard laboratory
medium. Here, we isolated Mtb strains lacking ESX-3 and mu-
tants deficient in the secreted substrates EsxG, EsxH, and PE5–
PPE4 by recovering the strains on iron-supplemented media. We
evaluated the esx-3 region mutants with regard to their iron and
zinc phenotypes, their ability to produce mycobactin, their ca-
pacity for siderophore-mediated iron uptake, and their virulence
in macrophages and in mice. Further, by comparing culture fil-
trates (CFs) of WT and knockout strains using label-free quanti-
tative MS, we comprehensively defined ESX-3–secreted factors
and determined their codependence on EsxG and EsxH. By
comparing the phenotypic data with the secretome analysis, we
were able to link secretion of particular substrates to specific ef-
fector functions. The phenotypic and proteomic analyses point to
a model in which PE5 and PPE4 are the critical ESX-3 substrates
involved in metal homeostasis and in counteracting host iron
restriction, while EsxG and EsxH also play an essential iron-
independent role in virulence.
Results
Hemin and Mb Rescue Growth of Mtb Δesx-3, ΔesxG, ΔesxH, and
Δpe5–ppe4. Because ESX-3 has been implicated in using Mb-
bound iron (13), we reasoned that we might be able to recover
mutants in the esx-3 locus if we used hemin as an alternative iron
source (20, 21). Because Esx proteins and PE–PPE family
members are implicated as substrates of T7SS (7, 22), we gen-
erated strains lacking esxG, esxH, and pe5–ppe4, all of which are
encoded within esx-3 (Fig. S1 A and G–I, Table S1, and Dataset
S1), as well as a complete esx-3 deletion (i.e., ΔRv0282–Rv0292)
(Fig. S1 A–F) and, for comparison of iron phenotypes, a deletion
mutant of mbtB (Fig. S1J), which codes for a peptide synthase
required to produce Mb (23) (see SI Materials and Methods for
details of iron-containing media used to recover mutants). The
Δesx-3 mutant, ΔesxG, ΔesxH, the double-knockout Δpe5–ppe4,
and ΔmbtB all grew on medium containing 100 μM hemin, failed
to grow on unsupplemented medium (Fig. 1 A and B), and were
rescued with integrating plasmids expressing the relevant genes
under control of the heat-shock protein 60 (hsp60) promoter
(Fig. S2A and Table S2) or, for Δesx-3 and ΔmbtB, with a cosmid
containing the entire esx-3 region or the entire mbt-1 Mb syn-
thesis locus, respectively (Fig. 1 A and B, Fig. S2A, and Table
S2). For unclear reasons, Δesx-3, ΔesxH, and Δpe5–ppe4 also
required Tween 80 to grow on hemin-containing medium, whereas
ΔesxG and ΔmbtB did not (Fig. 1A).
Previous work in Msmeg suggested that ESX-3 participates in
the utilization of iron bound to Mb (13). Therefore, we were
surprised at the abundant growth of Mtb Δesx-3 when 2 μg/mL
mycobactin J (MbJ) (a standard concentration used for culturing
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis) was provided. On
titrating MbJ, we found that 100-fold more MbJ was needed for
growth rescue of the esx-3 mutants than for growth rescue of the
ΔmbtB mutant (Fig. 1B). Similarly, 10-fold more hemin was
needed to rescue ΔesxH than to rescue ΔmbtB (Fig. 1A and Fig.
S2B), and most of the mutants were not effectively rescued by
supplementation with an approximately sixfold excess of ferric
ammonium citrate (FAC) and a 10-fold excess of zinc sulfate (Fig.
S2C), compared with standard 7H10 medium. The only exception
was ΔesxG, which grew with zinc supplementation and was further

(mc27827), ΔesxG (mc27789), ΔesxH (mc27790), Δpe5–ppe4 (mc27792), and ΔmbtB (mc27808) (Fig. S1 and Table S1) were plated on 7H10 medium with or
without 100 μM hemin and Tween 80 (0.05%) (Tw 80) (A) or with increasing concentrations of MbJ (B). Some late-appearing contamination was present when
Δpe5–ppe4 was plated on medium containing hemin and Tween 80 in A. (C and D) The indicated strains, which differ from those used in the plating ex-
periments shown in A and B in that the sacB-hygR cassettes were removed, were grown in 7H9 medium (C) or 7H9 medium supplemented with 100 μM 2,2′-
dipyridyl (D). Data points represent the mean ± SEM from duplicate cultures.

enhanced by additional FAC after prolonged incubation (Fig. S2
C and D). Thus, ΔesxH and Δpe5–ppe4 phenocopy Δesx-3, but
ΔesxG exhibits a somewhat distinct phenotype. In contrast to the
findings on solid medium, the esx-3 mutants had relatively mild
growth defects in 7H9 broth unless the lipophilic iron chelator
2,2′-dipyridyl was included (Fig. 1 C and D), but growth of
ΔmbtB was severely restricted even in nonchelated medium (Fig.
1C). In conclusion, the data are consistent with esx-3 playing a
role in siderophore-mediated iron acquisition, a role that ap-
pears to be more crucial on solid medium than in liquid medium.
Furthermore, ESX-3 is nonessential provided that iron is avail-
able in an accessible form. This result suggests the presence of a
less efficient uptake system(s) that functions in the absence of
ESX-3. Finally, the high concentration of hemin required to
rescue growth of the esx-3 region mutants suggests potential in-
volvement of ESX-3 in iron uptake from other sources in addition
to siderophores.
The esx-3 Mutants Overproduce Mb and Fail to Assimilate Mb-Bound
Iron. When grown in iron-replete 7H9 broth, the esx-3 region
mutants developed a distinct orange pigmentation (Fig. S3A),
which we reasoned might represent excess Mb. To address this
possibility, bacteria were grown under iron-limited conditions
(chelated Sauton’s medium) in the presence of 7-[14C]-salicylic
acid, the biosynthetic precursor of Mb. These experiments used
esx-3 and mbtB mutants generated in the auxotrophic mc26230
(H37Rv ΔRD1 ΔpanCD) strain background (Table S1), which
facilitates work with radiolabeled, infectious samples because it
can be used at biosafety level 2 (BSL2) (24, 25). When analyzed
by TLC, only Mb was observed in cell pellets, whereas the CF
contained both Mb and carboxymycobactin (cMb). ΔmbtB
showed the expected absence of Mb and cMb (26, 27). In con-
trast, Δesx-3 produced Mb slightly in excess of the parental
strain, which was restored to WT levels in the complemented
strain (Fig. S3B). When cell pellet extracts from Δesx-3, ΔesxG,
ΔesxH, and Δpe5–ppe4 grown in iron-replete 7H9 medium were
analyzed by TLC, the orange-pigmented material comigrated
with Mb; this material was undetectable in H37Rv WT, Δesx-3::
esx-3TB, and ΔmbtB (Fig. S3C). These data are consistent with
the idea that the esx-3 mutants experience iron deprivation in
standard 7H9 medium and respond by up-regulating production
of Mb. In iron-limited medium, both WT and esx-3 region mu-
tants experience iron starvation and increase production of Mb,
so the differential increase for the mutants is less apparent. To
quantify the relative accumulation of Mb in the Δesx-3 and
ΔesxH mutant strains, we analyzed them by MS after growth in
7H9 as described in SI Materials and Methods. As expected, Mb
and cMb were absent or were present in trace amounts in ex-
tracts of the ΔmbtB strain (Fig. 2A). In the Δesx-3 and ΔesxH
strains there was >15-fold accumulation of Mb in the cell pellets
and CF compared with the parental strain, accounting for >4%
of total lipids in both fractions. cMb also was increased in the CF of
the mutants, although the changes were more modest (Fig. 2A).
Because a previously described ΔmmpS4/S5 siderophore ex-
port mutant became “intoxicated” by excess intracellular side-
rophores (28), we asked whether the Mb accumulation in the
mutants might contribute to their growth defect. We deleted the
entire mbt-1 gene cluster in strains lacking both esxG and esxH or
esx-3 (Fig. S1 K and L) and found that the ΔesxG–esxH Δmbt-1
double-deletion strain behaved similarly to ΔesxG–esxH in re-
quiring high concentrations (200 ng/mL) of MbJ for growth on
solid medium (Fig. 2B). Similarly, the Δesx-3 Δmbt-1 double

mutant was highly impaired for growth in 7H9 medium, even
with supplementation (Fig. 2C). Therefore, although esx-3 mutants
accumulate Mb, this excess siderophore does not account for the
growth defect.
To verify that esx-3 plays a role in siderophore uptake, we
examined the accumulation of 55Fe-loaded cMb by WT and
Δesx-3. At 37 °C, Δesx-3 accumulated <50% of the radiolabel
acquired by the parental strain (Fig. 2D), although the strains
exhibited similar levels of nonspecific adsorption at 4 °C. Al-
though uptake of 55Fe-cMb was substantially less for Δesx-3 than
for WT, it was not completely absent, supporting the idea that
a lower-affinity Mb uptake system functions in the absence of
esx-3. Taken together, these results substantiate a role for esx-3
in siderophore-mediated iron acquisition.
Virulence Role of pe5–ppe4 and mbtB Depends on Host Genotype. To
assess the virulence of numerous mutant strains rapidly, we ini-
tially infected BALB/c SCID mice by the i.v. route. A dose of 104
cfu of H37Rv was lethal by ∼40 d postinfection, whereas mice
survived ∼107 cfu of Δesx-3 (Fig. 3A). Despite their strikingly
similar in vitro iron-related growth defects, mutants harboring
individual deletions within the esx-3 region were less severely
attenuated. After infection of SCID mice with ∼2 × 106 cfu, the
median survival time (MST) was 22 d for mice infected with the
WT strain, 27 d for mice infected with ΔmbtB and Δpe5–ppe4,
and 65 d for mice infected with ΔesxH; this substantial attenu-
ation of ΔesxH was largely reversed by genetic complementation
(Fig. 3B). Most dramatically, the Δesx-3–infected mice survived
for 12 mo, whereas complementation of Δesx-3 resulted in slight
hypervirulence (MST 19 d). The relatively modest attenuation of
Δpe5–ppe4 and ΔmbtB was surprising, given their profound
phenotypes in vitro. To address whether hemin supplementation
in the growth medium used before i.v. infection provided iron
stores that the bacteria could use in vivo, we examined the vir-
ulence of the strains following growth in different amounts of
hemin. For ΔmbtB, the kinetics of mortality were nearly identical
if bacteria were pregrown in 5 or 100 μM hemin (MST 30 d; Fig.
3C). Similarly, when the Δpe5–ppe4 mutant was cultured in the
absence of hemin, it was only mildly attenuated (Fig. 3C), similar
to when it was pregrown in 100 μM hemin (Fig. 3B). These re-
sults show that, despite their profound growth defects in vitro,
the Δpe5–ppe4 and ΔmbtB mutants are only mildly attenuated
in vivo.
The SCID mice used here were in the BALB/c background,
which is defective in natural resistance-associated macrophage
protein 1 (Nramp1) (29), a metal transporter localized to the
endosomal compartment of macrophages that may restrict
phagosomal iron (30). In inbred mouse strains, nramp1 is found
in two allelic forms, nramp1R (resistant) and nramp1S (suscep-
tible); the susceptible allele results in degradation of the protein
and susceptibility to a variety of intracellular pathogens (31).
Nramp1 is functional in CBA mice (29), which we challenged by
i.v. infection with ∼2 × 106 cfu of H37Rv, ΔmbtB grown in high
or low hemin, or Δpe5–ppe4. Strikingly, in contrast to observa-
tions in the nramp1S mice, Δpe5–ppe4 and ΔmbtB were highly
attenuated in nramp1R CBA mice (Fig. 3D). These data dem-
onstrate a host-dependent requirement for ESX-3 substrates.
Δesx-3 and ΔesxH Are Attenuated for Growth in Human Macrophages,
but Intracellular Growth of Δpe5–ppe4 Depends on Macrophage
Polarization. Differences in iron handling have been described
for classically (M1) as opposed to alternatively (M2) activated
macrophages (32, 33). Similar observations have been made
for human macrophages differentiated with macrophage colony-
stimulating factor (M-CSF) versus GM-CSF (34), where GM-CSF
may promote a more iron-restrictive state. We therefore examined
the growth of Δesx-3, ΔesxH, and Δpe5–ppe4 in human macro-
phages differentiated with M-CSF or GM-CSF (Fig. S4). The Δesx-3
and ΔesxH mutants were highly attenuated for growth in human
macrophages, regardless of the cytokine used for differentiation.
However, Δpe5–ppe4 showed a modestly improved growth capacity

(∼2.4-fold) in the M-CSF–differentiated macrophages, indicating
that the requirement for pe5–ppe4 may differ depending upon
macrophage polarization, possibly resulting in differences in iron
handling of M-CSF– versus GM-CSF–differentiated cells. In con-
trast, Δesx-3 and ΔesxH were essential for intracellular growth
irrespective of macrophage polarization.
The in Vitro Iron Phenotype Does Not Correlate with Virulence in SCID
or Recombination-Activating Gene Knockout Mice. To explore fur-
ther the relationship between the iron phenotype and virulence,
we compared Δesx-3 complemented with the Mtb esx-3 region and
a strain complemented with the Msmeg esx-3 region. Although the
Msmeg esx-3 region complemented the in vitro iron-related
growth defects of Δesx-3 (Fig. 4A), only the Mtb esx-3 region re-
stored growth in vivo. Infection with Δesx-3::esx-3SMEG did not
result in any mortality (Fig. 4B), even after 12 mo of infection.
Therefore, despite the substantial homology between the Msmeg
and Mtb esx-3 regions (14), Msmeg esx-3 lacks functions necessary
for virulence. Additional evidence that virulence is separable from
the iron requirement comes from analysis of a ΔesxG mutant
expressing an aberrant EsxG protein product that has 12 addi-
tional N-terminal amino acids (referred to as “esxGH**12aa;
pJP148”) (Table S2). Remarkably, the in vitro phenotype of the
hygromycin-marked ΔesxG strain (mc27789) was rescued by
the EsxG**12aa variant even though EsxG–EsxH secretion was
nearly undetectable on Western blotting (Fig. 4 C and D). This
finding is consistent with reports in Msmeg, in which <1% of
EsxG–EsxH secretion reversed the iron-related growth defects
(12). Despite correcting the iron-related growth defect, the strain
complemented with EsxG fused to 12 N-terminal amino acids
(ΔesxG::esxGH**12aa) behaved almost identically to ΔesxG in
recombination-activating gene knockout (RAG1−/−) mice (Fig.
4E). Interestingly, although able to restore growth of ΔesxG on
solid medium, the same plasmid (pJP148) was unable to rescue
growth of Δesx-3 (Fig. 4F), implying that EsxG–EsxH secretion
in Mtb is dependent on the presence of esx-3, consistent with
findings in Msmeg (13).
esx-3 and esxH Are Essential for Virulence in Aerosol Infections, but
pe5–ppe4 and mbtB Are Dispensable. We next sought to determine
whether the differences in virulence between strains also would
be observed in a model that more closely mimics the natural
infection. We infected C57BL/6 (nramp1S) mice by aerosol with
WT, Δesx-3, and Δesx-3::esx-3TB strains. In contrast to WT, the
Δesx-3 mutant could not be recovered from the lungs, and it
failed to disseminate to the spleen; Δesx-3::esx-3TB was mildly
hypervirulent (Fig. 5 A and B). Similarly, ΔesxH did not pro-
liferate in vivo, failed to disseminate, and was complemented by
expression of esxG–esxH (pYUB1944) (Fig. 5 C and D). The
marked attenuation of Δesx-3 and ΔesxH was in striking contrast
to the Δpe5–ppe4 and ΔmbtB mutants, for which bacterial
numbers were similar to WT (Fig. 5 C and D). Overall, these
findings support the idea that defects in iron acquisition do not
underlie the dramatic in vivo attenuation of Δesx-3. Rather esx-3
must play an additional role in virulence that is dependent upon
EsxH and independent of PE5–PPE4.
Identification of Rv1386 (PE15)/Rv1387 (PPE20) as ESX-3–Secreted
Substrates. To elucidate further the role(s) played by esx-3 in
iron acquisition and virulence, we sought to define the secreted
effectors. CF from triplicate samples of WT, Δesx-3, ΔesxG,
ΔesxH, Δesx-3::esx-3TB, Δesx-3::esx-3SMEG, and ΔmbtB cultured
in chelated Sauton’s medium was analyzed by MS using the
MaxQuant software suite with the Andromeda search engine for
peptide identification (SI Materials and Methods and Fig. S5).
Label-free quantitation (LFQ) algorithms were used to deter-
mine relative protein amounts (SI Materials and Methods) (35). A
panel of ribosomal and chaperonin proteins (Dataset S2) was
used to verify similar amounts of lysis in the samples (Fig. S5B).
Correcting for multiple testing by controlling for a false discovery
rate (FDR) at 5% using the Benjamini–Hochberg method (36),
we detected 854 proteins in total (Dataset S2), of which 72 were
differentially secreted in the WT strain compared with Δesx-3
(Fig. 6A, and SI Materials and Methods, and Fig. S6A). Esx pro-
teins encoded outside the esx-3 locus that could be unambiguously

identified, including EsxA, EsxB, EsxL, EsxN, and EsxO, were
present in similar amounts in both samples, demonstrating that
the esx-3 deletion does not globally impair Esx protein secretion
(Fig. 6A). As expected from analogy to EsxA and EsxB, EsxG and
EsxH exhibited codependent secretion; EsxH was present at
greatly diminished levels in the CF of the ΔesxG mutant compared
with WT, and similarly EsxG was present at greatly reduced levels
in the CF of ΔesxH (Fig. 6 B and C and Figs. S5C and S6 B and C).
Genetic complementation resulted in partial restoration of both
EsxG and EsxH secretion in both mutants (Fig. S6 B and C).
To identify ESX-3 substrates, we focused on eight proteins
that were present in all three WT samples and were diminished
in Δesx-3 (Fig. 6 A, E, and G and Fig. S6). Of these, secretion of
Rv1009/RpfB was not restored by complementation (Dataset
S2), suggesting that it may not be a substrate for secretion. Of the
remaining proteins, five (Rv0282, Rv0283, Rv0285/PE5, EsxG,
and EsxH) were encoded within the region deleted in the mu-
tant strain. We detected trace levels of these five proteins in the
Δesx-3 samples (below 3% of WT levels), consistent with a typ-
ical level of carryover. To verify this result, we reran one sample
from each strain on an extensively washed column; as expected,
these proteins were not detected (Fig. S5C). Rv1387/PPE20 and
Rv2477c were the only other proteins that satisfied our criteria
for being potential substrates. However, Rv2477c also was un-
detectable in two of three ΔmbtB samples (Dataset S2), sug-
gesting that its absence might reflect an adaptation to iron
deprivation as opposed to its being a direct ESX-3 substrate.
Thus, only Rv1387/PPE20 fulfilled criteria as a potential ESX-3
substrate. Although it did not meet our strict criteria for signif-
icance, Rv1386 (PE15) also was diminished in the esx-3 mutant
(P value 0.007, which corresponds to an FDR of 13%) (Fig. 6A)
and was undetectable when the Δesx-3 sample was reanalyzed
after carryover removal (Fig. S5C). CF samples prepared from
ΔesxG and ΔesxH also had greatly reduced or undetectable PE15
and PPE20 (Fig. 6 B and C and Figs. S5C and S6 B and C),
demonstrating that secretion of these proteins is dependent on
EsxG and EsxH. Combined, these data strongly suggest that
PE15 and PPE20 are ESX-3 substrates.
Secretion of PE5–PPE4 Is Required for Iron Acquisition, Whereas
Secretion of EsxG and EsxH Is Important for Virulence. We next ex-
amined whether secretion of EsxG–EsxH and PE5–PPE4 are
codependent. Although still detectable, secretion of PE5 was
substantially reduced in ΔesxG and ΔesxH (Fig. 6 B and C and
Figs. S5C and S6B). This diminution reached significance for
ΔesxG but not for ΔesxH, using our strict criteria [P values for
PE5 of 0.0003 (FDR = 6%) in WT vs. ΔesxG and 0.001 (FDR
26%) in WT vs. ΔesxH]. We did not detect PPE4 in the CF of
any sample, and this protein likely remains membrane localized
because it contains several hydrophobic, potentially membrane-
spanning domains, analogous to the situation in ESX-1, where
PE35 is found in the CF and PPE68 remains membrane asso-
ciated (37, 38). In contrast, the Δpe5–ppe4 mutant secreted
nearly WT levels of EsxG and EsxH (Figs. S5C and S6D), a
finding confirmed on Western blotting using a polyclonal anti-
body recognizing the EsxG–EsxH complex (Fig. 6I). Thus, the
Δpe5–ppe4 mutant exhibits a severe iron phenotype but secretes
EsxG and EsxH normally and is not attenuated in vivo in
nramp1S hosts. This observation shows that the iron-acquisition
function of ESX-3 is not simply related to the secretion of EsxG–
EsxH. Taken together with the phenotypic studies, the data
suggest that PE5–PPE4 is important for the iron-acquisition
function of ESX-3, whereas virulence correlates with secretion of
EsxG, EsxH, PE15, and PPE20 (Fig. 6J).
Discussion
Mtb encodes five evolutionarily related T7SS, ESX-1–ESX-5 (7,
39–41). These systems are believed to influence the outcome of
infection by directing the secretion of specific effector proteins.
However, apart from the intensively investigated ESX-1, there
are limited data characterizing the secretomes of individual ESX
systems or correlating these findings with in vivo data to define
the contributions of individual effectors to pathogenesis. This
undertaking is complex, because ESX systems have been shown
to secrete a variety of substrates lacking classical N-terminal

signal sequences, including Esx family members, members of the
diverse PE and PPE protein families, and, in some cases, addi-
tional substrates (such as Esp proteins secreted via ESX-1) (41).
The studies of ESX-3 described here demonstrate how a single
ESX system can secrete multiple effectors to modulate varied
host defenses to influence pathogenesis.
Previous findings have suggested that ESX-3 functions in the
acquisition of iron (11, 13); in the context of host infection, this
iron-uptake capacity is of critical importance to nearly all bac-
terial pathogens (42, 43). Here, using a panel of Mtb deletion
mutants, we demonstrate that not only the entire esx-3 locus but
specifically the secreted substrates EsxG–EsxH and PE5–PPE4
are required for iron acquisition. We further demonstrate that
the contribution of iron acquisition to Mtb virulence in human
macrophages and mouse models depends on the host phenotype.
Remarkably, analysis of the esx-3 region mutants showed that
ESX-3 plays a critical role in virulence, which correlates with the
secretion of effectors distinct from those required for iron acqui-
sition (Fig. 6J). Although all mutants required iron supplementa-
tion to grow on solid medium, we found striking differences in their
impact on virulence in mice. The Δpe5–ppe4 and ΔmbtB strains,
which retained the ability to secrete EsxG–EsxH and PE15–PPE20,
were virulent in i.v. infections of SCID mice and aerosol infections
of C57BL/6 mice; this virulence may reflect the ability of Mtb to
exploit in vivo sources of iron such as heme (20, 21). Still, this
result was surprising, given the reported phenotype of other mu-
tants defective in Mb synthesis or trafficking. Some of the data are
not directly comparable to ours, because the other studies used
bacillus Calmette–Guérin rather than Mtb or guinea pigs rather
than a murine model (27, 44). However, both mbtK, which trans-
fers fatty acids to the Mb peptide core, and mmpS4/S5, which are
required for siderophore export, are essential for virulence in mice
(45, 46). Notably, however, both of these mutants also have addi-
tional phenotypes (altered lipid profiles and toxic accumulation of
siderophores, respectively) that could contribute to their in vivo
attenuation (28, 45). In contrast to Δpe5–ppe4 and ΔmbtB, the
ΔesxH mutant behaved similarly to the strain bearing a deletion of
the entire esx-3 region in aerosol infections of C57BL/6 mice. Both
ΔesxH and Δesx-3 were substantially attenuated, failing to pro-
liferate in the lungs and to disseminate to the spleen. This finding
suggests that the virulence defect of Δesx-3 is not caused solely by
defective iron acquisition and further suggests that the attenua-
tion is primarily attributable to absence of EsxH, either directly

anticipated (Fig. S5C). See Fig. S6 for lists of proteins that are present at significantly different levels for the various comparisons and Dataset S2 for lists of all

or through the loss of other substrates that rely on EsxH for
secretion.
We considered the possibility that the requirement for iron-
acquisition systems in Mtb might depend on the capacity of the
host to restrict iron by comparing infection in mouse lines that
differ in the nramp1 gene (29, 47). Nramp1 is thought to export
divalent metals out of the phagosome, and that export is pos-
tulated to starve bacteria of essential metals and/or to heighten
oxidative stress (30). Remarkably, both the ΔmbtB and Δpe5–
ppe4 mutants were highly attenuated in nramp1R CBA mice, in
contrast to their relatively preserved virulence in the nramp1S
mice (C57BL/6 and BALB/c). Interestingly, an extensive body of
literature suggests that the nramp1R locus does not confer resistance
to infection with fully virulent Mtb in mice (48, 49), although in
humans polymorphisms in NRAMP1 (termed “SLC11A1”) are as-
sociated with the development of pulmonary tuberculosis in West
African and Asian populations (50, 51). The pe5–ppe4 and mbtB
mutants, with defects related to iron utilization, may reveal a role of
Nramp1 in host defense against Mtb and point to siderophore-
mediated iron uptake as an immune evasion mechanism. Of course,
additional differences between the inbred strains also could un-
derlie the distinct phenotypes (52, 53), and further studies using
congenic strains will clarify the contribution of Nramp1. Our
macrophage data also indicate that the importance of pe5–ppe4
for intracellular growth of Mtb may depend on macrophage gene
expression and polarization. Overall, our studies reveal a re-
lationship between host genotype and bacterial iron handling in
determining the outcome of infection with Mtb.
Our proteomic analysis points to a limited set of ESX-3–
secreted substrates: EsxG, EsxH, the PE–PPE pair encoded
within the locus (PE5–PPE4), an evolutionarily related pair of
proteins encoded outside the locus (PE15–PPE20), and perhaps
a few others such as Rv2477c. However, Rv2477c lacks the
characteristic YxxxD/E T7SS motif and also is reduced in CF
from ΔmbtB, making its assignment as a direct ESX-3 substrate
less likely. The limited number of substrates assigned to the Mtb
ESX-3 secretion system differs somewhat from ESX-1, which
secretes a number of Esp substrates, and from ESX-5, which
appears to secrete multiple PE–PPE family members (41). How-
ever, additional ESX-3 effectors may remain membrane associ-
ated and undetectable in CF or may be secreted under culture
conditions different from those tested here. Nonetheless, several
features of ESX-1 and ESX-5 also appear to be shared by ESX-3.
EsxG and EsxH, which form a heterodimer (15, 54), exhibited
codependent secretion, as did EsxA and EsxB (55, 56). In addi-
tion, elimination of EsxG or EsxH impaired the secretion of PE5
and PE15–PPE20. This suggests that EsxG may behave like its
counterpart EsxB, which recently has been shown to promote the
ATPase activity of the secretion apparatus (57).
Our data also clearly support the observation that specific PE–
PPE pairs are targeted to specific ESX systems (58, 59). To our
knowledge, PE15–PPE20 is the first PE–PPE pair encoded
outside an esx locus for which the data support secretion by an
ESX system other than ESX-5. It is not surprising that ESX-3
secretes this pair, because there is a strong connection between
PE5 and PE15: They are evolutionarily closely related (60) and
are highly conserved in members of the Mtb complex, share 67%
identity, and are suggested to play role(s) in intracellular survival
in macrophages (61). Moreover, their relationship is under-
scored by transcriptional data, because both pe5–ppe4 and pe15–
ppe20 appear to belong to the ZuR regulon (62, 63) and are
down-regulated by nutrient starvation (64). Interestingly, how-
ever, two lines of evidence suggest that PE15 and PPE20 are not
responsible for the iron-acquisition function of ESX-3. First,
complementation of Δesx-3 with esx-3SMEG corrected the in vitro
growth defect (Fig. 4A) but failed to restore secretion of PE15/
PPE20 (Fig. 6F). Second, Δpe5–ppe4 exhibited iron-related
growth defects very similar to Δesx-3 but secreted PE15/PPE20
in excess of WT (Fig. S5C). Our finding that the Δpe5–ppe4
mutant has preserved secretion of EsxG/EsxH is also consistent
with findings from genetic analysis of the ESX-1 locus, where
deletion of ppe68 resulted in a modest increase in EsxA secretion
(55, 65). However, the data are more complex for ESX-5, in
which deletion of the ppe25–pe19 gene cluster in H37Rv led to
loss of EsxN and PPE41 secretion (66), although differing re-
sults were obtained for a ppe27 mutant in the CDC1551 back-
ground (67).
In summary, our findings implicate the PE5–PPE4 proteins as
the critical ESX-3 effectors involved in iron acquisition. EsxG–
EsxH may be required for iron utilization simply by virtue of
promoting PE5–PPE4 secretion, or both complexes may act in
concert to assimilate Mb-bound iron (see the model in Fig. 7).
Our data also indicate that ESX-3 regulates Mtb growth and
virulence in vivo in a manner independent of the iron-acquisition
functions that are so critical in vitro. This regulation may be
related to recent observations that the ESX-3 region can mod-
ulate host immune responses; removal of the Msmeg esx-3 region
attenuated the organism as the result of clearance by an MyD88-
dependent innate immune response (14). Further, EsxH has
been demonstrated to interact with and inhibit the mammalian
cell ESCRT machinery that plays critical roles in membrane
trafficking (19). Additional studies will be required to elucidate
the in vivo functions of EsxG–EsxH and to clarify how ESX-3
facilitates iron acquisition and under what circumstances differ-
ent ESX-3 effector proteins are required for virulence. Finally,
this work reinforces the significance of T7SS for mycobacterial–
host interactions and highlights the need for continued in-
vestigation into their role in pathogenesis.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains. Mtb H37Rv and mc26230 (H37Rv ΔRD1 ΔpanCD) were used
to generate mutants as listed in Table S1. Mutants were constructed using
specialized transduction (68, 69). The antibiotic cassette was removed from
selected strains using phage-delivered γδ-resolvase, with sacB counter-
selection facilitating the isolation of unmarked strains (69). The L5 phage
integration system was used for complementation. Details of strain and
plasmid construction are provided in SI Materials and Methods.
Fig. 7.
The schematic illustrates ESX-3 substrates and their distinct func-
tional roles. EsxG and EsxH are cosecreted and facilitate secretion of PE5–
PPE4 (the latter remaining membrane-localized). PE5–PPE4, perhaps in
concert with EsxG–EsxH, plays a role in siderophore-mediated iron uptake.
EsxG and EsxH also facilitate secretion of PE15–PPE20, and, separately or
together, these proteins play additional, iron-independent roles in virulence.

Liquid Growth Conditions. Mycobacterial strains were cultured at 37 °C in
Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) with 10% (vol/vol) oleic acid-albumin-
dextrose-catalase (OADC) enrichment (BBL; Becton Dickinson), 0.2% glycerol
(Fisher), and 0.05% Tween 80 or 0.05% tyloxapol (referred to as “7H9”),
with additional supplements as indicated. Strains bearing antibiotic cas-
settes were cultured with 50–75 μg/mL hygromycin or 25 μg/mL kanamycin
as appropriate. Chelated Sauton’s medium consisted of 0.5 g KH2PO4, 4 g
L-asparagine·H2O, 2 g citric acid, 60 g glycerol/L, adjusted to pH ∼7.0, and
treated overnight with chelex-100 (10 g/L) (Bio-Rad) to remove trace iron
contaminants. After filtration, 0.5 g/L of MgSO4·7H2O was added.
Solid Medium Growth Experiments. Bacterial cultures were washed in PBS
containing 0.05% Tween 80 or 0.05% tyloxapol (PBS-T), were resuspended
in PBS-T, and were adjusted to equivalent OD600 values. Serial dilutions
were plated onto 7H10 base medium containing 10% OADC and 0.5%
glycerol with additional additives as indicated. Supplements included
bovine hemin (Sigma), 0.05% Tween 80, FAC (Sigma), zinc sulfate (Sigma
or Fisher), and MbJ (Allied Monitor). Plates were incubated for ∼3–6 wk
at 37 °C.
Liquid Growth Curves. Bacteria were cultured in 7H9 medium with ∼5 μM
residual hemin from the frozen stock. In some experiments 10 μM hemin
was added to promote growth of ΔmbtB; 100 μM hemin was added for the
Δesx-3 Δmbt-1 double mutant. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation,
washed in PBS-T, and inoculated into growth medium at a starting OD600 of
∼0.02. Medium was unsupplemented 7H9 or included 100 μM 2,2′-dipyridyl
(Sigma), 100 μM hemin, or 200 ng/mL MbJ. MbJ was prepared as described
(27) by solubilizing 100 μg in a solution containing 250 μg tyloxapol in
1.25 mL ethanol (20% wt/vol). The ethanol was evaporated under vacuum,
and the tyloxapol and MbJ were resuspended in 7H9 medium and added to
500 mL 7H9.
Siderophore Uptake and Synthesis. Uptake of cMb was quantified as described
previously (46), using Msmeg cMb, which was deferrated and then labeled
with 55Fe (see SI Materials and Methods for details). Analysis of radiolabeled
siderophores from Mtb grown in iron-deficient medium and extraction of
unlabeled siderophores from iron-replete cultures was performed essentially
as described previously (46); additional details are provided in SI Materials
and Methods. For MS analysis of siderophores, strains were cultured in 7H9
medium with 24 μg/mL D-pantothenate. Cell pellets were washed with PBS
and were extracted with CHCl3/MeOH (2:1). Two and a half milliliters of
sterile filtered supernatants were acidified with 15 μL 3M HCl and extracted
with 3.5 mL ethyl acetate (70). The organic phases of pellet and supernatant
extractions were dried, resuspended in isopropanol/acetonitrile/water (2:1:1;
vol/vol/vol), and subjected to ultra high-performance liquid chromatography
(UPLC)-MS analysis as described in SI Materials and Methods and ref. 71.
Intracellular Bacterial Growth Assays. Human macrophages were prepared as
described (72) following the method of Vogt and Nathan (73) and differ-
entiation with either 2 ng/mL recombinant human GM-CSF or 10 ng/mL
recombinant human M-CSF (R&D Systems), as detailed in SI Materials and
Methods. Following infection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.02,
mycobacterial growth was enumerated at 14 d postinfection by plating on
7H10 plates containing 200 ng/mL MbJ (Allied Monitor). Colonies were
counted after ∼2–3 wk of incubation.
CF Preparation. CFs were prepared as described (19). Following growth to log
phase in 7H9 medium (with 10 μM hemin for the ΔmbtB strain), Mtb were
subcultured for 2 d in chelated Sauton’s medium, pelleted by centrifugation,
and the supernatants were filtered through 0.22-μM filters followed by
precipitation with 12% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (also see SI Materials
and Methods).
Proteomics MS. Protein pellets were reconstituted in 2-M urea buffer, pH 7.8,
before reduction, alkylation, and digestion with trypsin. After desalting the
peptide mixtures were gradient eluted directly into a Q Exactive mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). The MaxQuant software suite was used for
protein identifications and LFQ (35). Protein intensities were compared using
a two-sided t test and correcting for multiple testing by controlling for FDR
at 5% using the Benjamini–Hochberg method (36). Details are provided in SI
Materials and Methods.
EsxG–EsxH Antibody Production and Western Blotting. A His-tagged EsxG–EsxH
fusion construct (74) was produced in Escherichia coli as described (19)
and was used to immunize rabbits. Rabbit polyclonal serum was used in
Western blotting.
Mice and Infections. Mouse studies were performed in accordance with Na-
tional Institutes of Health guidelines (75), and all work was approved by the
Albert Einstein College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee (Protocol #20120114). Female C57BL/6 and SCID mice were from
the National Cancer Institute, and female CBA/J mice and B6.129S7-
Rag1tm1Mom/J (RAG1−/−) mice were from Jackson Laboratories. Mycobacterial
strains were grown in 7H9 medium with antibiotics as appropriate. For all
infections, bacteria were washed in PBS-T and were sonicated. For i.v. in-
fections, mice were injected via the lateral tail vein with the indicated doses
of bacteria in 200 μL PBS-T. The actual dose delivered was determined by
serial dilution and plating. For aerosol infections, the bacterial suspension
also contained 0.04% antifoam Y-30 emulsion (Sigma) and was targeted to
deliver a dose of ∼50–150 cfu per lung. Mice from each infection group were
killed 24 h after aerosol exposure, and lung homogenates were plated to
determine initial bacterial numbers delivered per strain. Bacterial burdens in
lungs and spleen were determined by plating organ homogenates, prepared
and diluted in PBS-T, from three or four mice per infection group onto ap-
propriate medium. Details are provided in SI Materials and Methods.
Statistical Analysis. Differences between groups were analyzed by Student’s
t test. A P value ≤0.05 was considered statistically significant. Survival curves
were compared with the log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test using GraphPad Prism
for Windows (GraphPad Software). Statistical comparisons of protein intensities
in CF samples were performed as described in SI Materials and Methods.
