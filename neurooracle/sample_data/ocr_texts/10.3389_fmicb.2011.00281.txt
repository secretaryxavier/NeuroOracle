Tuberculosis is a disease associated with the infection of a great part of the world’s popula-
tion and is responsible for the death of two to three million people annually. Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infects macrophages and subverts its mechanisms of killing. The pathogen
suppresses macrophage apoptosis by many different mechanisms.We describe that, upon
uptake by macrophages, M. tuberculosis overexpresses an operon Rv3361c-Rv3365c and
secretes Rv3364c. The Rv3365c knockout strain is deﬁcient in apoptosis inhibition. The
Rv3364c protein binds to the serine protease cathepsin G on the membrane, inhibiting
its enzymatic activity and the downstream activation of caspase-1-dependent apoptosis.
In summary, M. tuberculosis prevents macrophage pyroptosis by a novel mechanism
involving cytoplasmic surveillance proteins.

INTRODUCTION
Tuberculosisisaleadingcauseof deathintheworld,withtheglobal
signiﬁcance exacerbated by its common association with HIV-
1 infection. Host–pathogen interaction during Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infection is a complex process in which the bacterium
evades defensive mechanisms (Deretic et al., 2006; Davis et al.,
2007). M. tuberculosis’ability to survive innate mechanisms of host
defense has a signiﬁcant role in the outcome of the infection. M.
tuberculosis interferes with host-initiated inﬂammatory responses
and cell death, as part of a complex adaptation to subvert host
innate and adaptive responses. Initial detection of M. tuberculo-
sis involves a number of phagocyte receptors, including several
Toll-like receptors (TLRs; Bhatt and Salgame, 2007), nucleotide
oligomerization domain (NOD)2 cytoplasmic receptor (Ferwerda
et al., 2005), complement, and mannose receptors (Hirsch et al.,
1994). Upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular pat-
terns (PAMPs), the host induces an array of responses aimed at
limiting growth of the pathogen. Bacteria, however, have been
showntouseeffectorproteinsinapro-activemannertocounteract
the defense strategies. Previous studies indicate that M. tuberculosis
infection of macrophages stimulates TLR-2, subsequently leading
to the translocation of NF-κB (Aliprantis et al., 1999) and produc-
tion of cytokines, chemokines, and the synthesis of nitric oxide
(NO; Heldwein and Fenton, 2002). The pathogen also blocks the
delivery of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) to the vacuole membrane
and thus avoids the killing effects of NO (Davis et al., 2007).
One of the recently described host mechanisms to eliminate
intracellular bacteria is autophagy. Autophagy and apoptosis are
interventions used by the human host to control microbial infec-
tion. Salmonella, Yersinia, Legionella, Shigella, to cite a few, have
been shown to manipulate both autophagy and apoptosis to cre-
ate a favorable environment inside the host (Gao and Kwaik,
2000; Campoy and Colombo, 2009). M. tuberculosis inhibits both
processes, as well. Physiological or pharmacological induction of
autophagy limits intracellular survival of M. tuberculosis through
maturation of phagolysosomes in infected macrophages (Gutier-
rez et al., 2004). M. tuberculosis infection also has been shown
to protect cells against apoptotic death by modifying the expres-
sion of death receptors, such as Fas (CD95), or by triggering the
synthesis and release of soluble TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2; Loeuil-
let et al., 2006). In contrast, other laboratories have also shown
that macrophages infected with virulent strains of M. tuberculo-
sis undergo TNF and caspase-independent apoptosis (O’Sullivan
et al., 2007). Although discrepancies exist regarding the observa-
tions, they are possibly related to the model and timing used in the
investigational systems. A few studies, however, have conﬁrmed
that, in animal models, the ability to inhibit macrophage apopto-
sis is directly related to M. tuberculosis strain virulence (Park et al.,
2006).
Some mycobacterial effector proteins interfering with host
defensive mechanisms have recently been discovered. Using a
gain-of-function genetic screen, nuoG was identiﬁed as an anti-
apoptotic gene in M. tuberculosis (Velmurugan et al., 2007).
The deﬁciency in nuoG gene signiﬁcantly reduced bacterial vir-
ulence in vivo, leading to inhibition of macrophage apoptosis.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis and macrophage apoptosis
Zn2+ metalloprotease has been shown to activate inﬂammasome
through increased secretion of IL-1β (Master et al., 2008). The
zmp1 gene plays a critical role in M. tuberculosis survival in
macrophages and in virulence in vivo. Recently, our group has
demonstrated that M. tuberculosis Rv3654c and Rv3655c proteins,
which are secreted and transported to the outside of the bacterial
phagosome by a novel “type IV pili” apparatus, inhibited TNF-
induced apoptosis. The interaction of these proteins with host
PSF and ALO17 interfered the caspase post-transcriptional events
and blocked the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis (Danelishvili et al.,
2010).
By screening a transposon mutant library, we previously iden-
tiﬁed M. tuberculosis knockout mutants that failed to inhibit
macrophage apoptosis in contrast with the wild-type bacterium
(Danelishvili et al., 2010). We selected 20A11 out of 10 deﬁcient
in inhibition of apoptosis (DIA) mutants, based on the obser-
vation that pro- and anti-inﬂammatory cytokines produced by
macrophages upon infection, differed between 20A11-infected
macrophages and the wild-type infection or other tested mutants.
We investigated the mechanism by which M. tuberculosis interfered
with the apoptosis. Here we show that the M. tuberculosis Rv3364c
protein (inactivated in the 20A11 clone), which is a component of
a signal transduction operon, was capable of inhibiting caspase-1
activation, and consequently the host cell apoptosis (pyropto-
sis), through interaction with macrophage membrane-associated
serine protease, cathepsin G, and suppression of its enzymatic
activity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
BACTERIAL CLONES AND CELL CULTURE INFECTION ASSAY
Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Rv (ATCC 25618) and
20A11 transposon mutant generated with the temperature-
sensitive plasmid pTNGJC, as previously described (Danelishvili
et al., 2010),were cultured in liquid or solid Middlebrook medium
(Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA) supplemented with
10% oleic acid, albumin, dextrose, and catalase (OADC) enrich-
ment (Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA) and 200 μg/ml
kanamycin sulfate (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO, USA), where
appropriate. M. tuberculosis PM638 clone, a derivative of H37Rv
strain containing deletion of the β-lactamase gene (Flores et al.,
2005), was kindly provided by Dr. Martin S. Pavelka, Jr. at
University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and
Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Rochester, NY,
USA. Human monocytic cell line U937 (ATCC CRL-1593.2) was
purchased from ATCC and cultured in RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with heat-inactivated 10%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were
seeded at 80–100% conﬂuence into 75 cm2 tissue culture ﬂasks,
in 96-well plates or chamber glass slides as needed. Phorbol-12-
myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-activated monolayers, as described
previously (Danelishvili et al., 2010), were infected with M. tuber-
culosis wild-type and 20A11 mutant or complemented strains at
MOI of 10:1 for 2 h at 37˚C and 5% CO2. Bacteria were sub-
sequently removed by washing the monolayer three times with
Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS), and the tissue culture wells
replenished with RPMI-1640 (Invitrogen) medium + 10% FBS.
Macrophage monolayer,macrophage lysates,or supernatants from
experimental and control wells were collected at different time
points for apoptosis, caspase, or cytokine assays. All infections
were carried out in duplicate, and experiments were performed in
triplicate.
Infection of macrophages and phagocytosis were assessed with
rhodamine (200 μg/ml) labeled M. tuberculosis PM638 clone or
PM638 containing β-lactamase constructs, described below, at
MOI of 10:1. Macrophages were visualized after 1 and 2 h of post-
infection by ﬂuorescein-phalloidin staining of actin, as previously
described (Danelishvili et al., 2007). Duplicate experiments were
performed, and at least 200 cells per slide were counted to cal-
culate the percentage of infected macrophages. Preparations were
visualized under a Leica ﬂuorescence microscope.
MEASUREMENT OF CYTOKINES
Supernatants from cell cultures infected with M. tuberculosis wild-
type or knockout mutant and from uninfected control wells were
harvested at 4, 24, and 48 h, centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min,
and assayed for presence of cytokines. TNF, IL-12 (eBioscience
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), and TGF-β, IFN-β (Antigenix Amer-
ica, Inc., New York, NY, USA) were detected by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits, following the instructions
provided by the manufacturers. Supernatants from macrophages
without infection were used as additional controls. The cytokine
concentrations were quantiﬁed from standard curves obtained
from sequential dilutions of the corresponding recombinant
cytokines.
APOPTOSIS ASSAY
Quantitative analysis of macrophage apoptosis was performed
using TUNEL technology for labeling of DNA strand breaks by
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, according to the manu-
facture’s protocol (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA).
Macrophages were seeded in 24-well plates and infected with
M. tuberculosis H37Rv, 20A11 mutant, or 20A11 complemented
strains. In the duplicate wells of 20A11-infected macrophages,
50 μM of caspase-1 inhibitor or caspase-1 control (Calbiochem,
La Jolla, CA, USA) were added to the wells during infection and
processed for TUNEL assay after 3 days of infection. In another set
of experiments, macrophages seeded in 24-well plates were trans-
fected with PAR4 and NOD1 siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 8 h or treated with 50 nm cathepsin
G Inhibitor I (EMD Biosciences, Inc., Madison, WI, USA), then
infected with 20A11 mutant and processed for apoptosis assay. In
all infection experiments, the MOI was maintained as 10 bacteria
to one cell.
RNA EXTRACTION, PROBE SYNTHESIS, AND QUANTIFICATION OF
BACTERIAL- AND HOST-GENE EXPRESSION
U937 macrophages were exposed to M. tuberculosis wild-type for
30 min or infected for 4 h with MOI 100 bacteria:1 cell and used
as a source of total experimental RNA. M. tuberculosis, growing in
Middlebrook 7H9 broth to the exponential phase of growth, was
exposed to RPMI-1640 medium + 10% FBS for 30 min or 4 h and
used as a source of control RNA. Bacterial RNAs from control and
experimental (exposed and intracellular) samples were extracted
and processed for Real-Time PCR,as previously described (Danel-
ishvili et al., 2004). Brieﬂy, macrophage monolayers were lysed

Mycobacterium tuberculosis and macrophage apoptosis
with 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Sigma Chemicals, St.
Louis, MO, USA) and differentially centrifuged to recover the
intracellular bacteria. Bacterial pellets were resuspended in a
guanidine thiocyanate-based buffer (Trisol,Invitrogen,San Diego,
CA, USA) and lysed with rapid mechanical agitation in a bead-
beater. RNA was cleaned with RNA Cleanup kit (QIAGEN,Valen-
cia, CA, USA). The quality and concentrations of DNase-treated
RNA samples were analyzed spectrophotometrically, as well as
veriﬁed on a 1% denaturing agarose gel.
Host cell RNAs obtained from uninfected, as well as M. tuber-
culosis-infected macrophages, at 4 and 24 h time points were
extracted using the Atlas Pure Total RNA Labeling System, accord-
ing the manufacturer instruction (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
Brieﬂy, cell cultures were lysed in denaturing solution, vortexed,
and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4˚C to remove cellular
debris, extracted three times with saturated phenol–chloroform,
precipitated in isopropanol, and washed with 80% ethanol. DNase
treatment of total RNA samples was carried out according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. The quality of RNA was ver-
iﬁed on a 1% denaturing agarose gel and the concentration was
measured at 260 nm absorbance.
Mycobacterial and host cell total RNAs (1 μg) were reverse
transcribed with 100 U of Superscript III Plus RNase H−Reverse
Transcriptase, using RT primers according to the manufacturer’s
instruction (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Quantitation of the
expression of M. tuberculosis and macrophage genes was carried
out on the iCycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) with SYBR
Green I assay by Real-Time PCR detection system using gene-
speciﬁc primers. Approximately 100–150 bp target cDNAs from
experimental and control samples were ampliﬁed in separate PCR
reactions. The calculated threshold (Ct) cycle for each bacterial
gene ampliﬁcation was normalized to the Ct of the 16S rRNA gene
ampliﬁed from the corresponding sample. The host-gene expres-
sion was normalized with an internal control of β-actin. The fold
change in gene expression was quantiﬁed as described in User
Bulletin #2 for the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system
(Applied-Biosystems, 1997).
GENERATION OF COMPLEMENTED STRAINS AND SCREENING
To complement the defect of M. tuberculosis 20A11 mutant, M.
tuberculosis Rv3365c, Rv3364c, Rv3363c-61c, and Rv3364c-61c
genes were ampliﬁed from the wild-type H37Rv strain using
Fidelitaq PCR system (US Biochemicals, Inc.). PCR-Generated
fragments were cloned into EcoRI and HindIII sites of E.
coli–Mycobacterium shuttle vector pMV261 +AprII, containing
hsp60 promoter and encoding apramycin resistance. The result-
ing plasmids pLDRv3365c, pLDRv3364c, pLDRv3363-61c, and
pLDRv3364-61c were propagated in DH10B E. coli, following the
transformation into M. tuberculosis 20A11 mutant by electropo-
ration. Transformants were selected on Middlebrook 7H10 agar
plates containing apramycin 200 μg/ml and screened by PCR for
apramycin gene (50).
β-LACTAMASE (BlaC) ASSAY FOR PROTEIN SECRETION
We have constructed the β-lactamase reporter vector for Mycobac-
terium and visualized bacterial protein translocation (secretion)
in the cytoplasm of macrophages. The assay uses technology
based on β-lactamase-catalyzed hydrolysis of the substrate, which
changes the ﬂuorescence of substrate molecules from green to
blue by disrupting resonance energy transfer. Rv3364c gene was
fused with BlaC gene lacking the ﬁrst 69 nucleotides impor-
tant for β-lactamase enzyme secretion, over-expressed in pLDG13
plasmid and transformed into M. tuberculosis PM638 clone.
Human macrophages (106) were seeded in 96-well plates or in
two-chamber slides and infected with M. tuberculosis PM638 or
PM638 clones expressing BlaC(+) with secretion segment and
Rv3364c:BlaC(−) fusion lacking BlaC secretion segment at a mul-
tiplicity of infection of 10:1. Cells were incubated at 37˚C in
5% CO2 for 2 h and washed three times with Hank’s balanced
salt solution (Invitrogen) to remove extracellular bacteria. After
48 h infection, macrophages were loaded with the ﬂuorescent
substrate CCF2-AM at room temperature using manufacturer’s
protocol (Invitrogen). Readings were recorded with two ﬁlter
sets: excitation 405 ± 20 nm/emission 460 ± 40 nm and excitation
405 ± 20 nm/emission 530 ± 30 nm using Tecan Inﬁnity 200 cyto-
ﬂuorometer. Fluorescence micrographs were captured with CCF2
ﬁlter sets (Leica).
WESTERN BLOT ANALYSIS OF M. tuberculosis Rv3364c PROTEIN
The pLDG13:His:Rv3364c construct was introduced into M.
tuberculosis H37Rv and grown for 21 days, after which cells were
harvested, disturbed in a bead-beater, and processed for west-
ern blot to insure that His:Rv3364c protein was expressed in
M. tuberculosis. Over-expressed clone was washed two times with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and used for infection of U937
macrophages. After 48 h, cell cultures were lysed with 0.1% Triton
X-100 and centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min to remove bacterial
pellet from the suspension. Pre-cleared cell lysate was incubated
with His-tag primary agarose conjugate antibody, overnight at
4˚C. Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on 12% Tris–HCl
gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with
5% non-fat milk solution. Membrane was exposed to His primary
antibody at a dilution of 1:1,000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 1 h, followed by incubation with anti-
rabbit IgG linked to AlexaFluor680 secondary antibody (1:5,000;
Li-Cor,Lincoln,NE,USA) for 30 min. Reactivity was assessed with
Odyssey Imager (Li-Cor).
CASPASE-1 ACTIVITY AND INHIBITION ASSAYS
Uninfected and infected macrophages with the 20A11 mutant,
M. tuberculosis H37Rv or 20A11 complemented (Rv3361c-65c)
strains were assayed for in situ labeling and detection of active
caspase-1,using theAPO LOGIX™-Carboxyﬂuorescein (FAM) kit
(Bachem, Torrance, CA, USA). Staurosporine-treated U937 cells
were used as a positive control. Brieﬂy, 10 μl of 30× Caspase-1
detection reagent (FAM–YVAD–FMK) were added to the cells in
300 μl medium of 96-well plate and incubated at 37˚C for 2 h.
Wells were gently washed two times. After the ﬁnal wash, 100 μl
of wash buffer were added to experimental wells, and immediately
processed for ﬂuorescence microscopy or ﬂuorometric analysis.
Readings were taken on a Cytoﬂuorometer II (Biosearch, Bed-
ford, MA, USA) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 515–
530 nm. A cell-permeable inhibitor I of caspase-1 at concentration
of 10 μM and a caspase-inhibitor negative control at a 10-μM

concentration (irreversible cathepsin B inhibitor; CalBiochem,
Los Angeles, CA, USA) were used in caspase-1 inhibition assay.
Macrophage monolayers in two-chamber slides were treated with
caspase-1 inhibitor or negative control and then were infected with
the 20A11 mutant strain. Apoptosis was quantiﬁed with TUNEL
assay.
IMMUNOPRECIPITATION AND IMMUNOBLOT ANALYSIS
U937 cells, infected with M. tuberculosis wild-type and 20A11
mutant, were scraped from tissue culture plates in 25 cm2 ﬂasks
after 24 h, 2 or 4 days of infection, and lysed with 0.1% SDS. Pre-
cleared cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 5 h
at 4˚C using A/G beads,and NOD1,NOD2,and PAR4 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) primary antibodies,
according to the method recommended by the manufacturer. The
captured proteins were washed three times with PBS and resolved
on 12% Tris–HCl gels. The Western blot analysis for the cathep-
sin G protein was processed without immunoprecipitation; cell
lysateswereseparatedbyelectrophoresison12%Tris–HClgelsand
transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes,using a semidry trans-
fer apparatus (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Membranes were
blocked with 3% non-fat milk solution, following washes with
PBS-0.1% Tween-20. Proteins were probed with anti-cathepsin
G, PAR4, NOD1, and NOD2 (1:1,000) primary antibodies (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA) for 1 h, followed
by incubation with anti-mouse, rabbit, or goat IgG linked to Alex-
aFluor680 secondary antibodies (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE, USA) at a
dilution of 1:5,000 for 30 min. Membranes were scanned using
Odyssey Imager (Li-Cor).
PURIFICATION OF Rv3364c AND TARGET HOST PROTEIN PULL-UP
ASSAY
The M. tuberculosis Rv3364c gene was cloned into pMV261 vector
containing His-tag red ﬂuorescent protein (RFP) fusion, trans-
formed into M. smegmatis and grown for 8–10 days on 7H10 agar
platescontaining50 μg/ml km.M.smegmatis redcoloniesexpress-
ing His-tag-RFP–Rv3364c fusion were harvested in PBS,disrupted
with bead-beater, and isolated directly from a crude cell lysate
using 30 μl of paramagnetic pre-charged His–nickel particles,
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Fitchburg,
WI,USA). The activated U937 cell extracts were prepared,as previ-
ously described (Danelishvili et al., 2007). The macrophage lysates
were mixed with captured His-tag-RFP–Rv3364c or His-tag-RFP
(control) proteins overnight at 4˚C and next day pulled-out with
magnetic holder. The captured complex was washed three times
with PBS, resuspended, and boiled in Laemmli sample buffer con-
taining mercaptoethanol for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed
on 12% Tris–HCl gel and stained with Coomassie blue stain-
ing. The target protein was cut from the gel and processed for
In-Gel Tryptic digestion (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL, USA).
Digested protein was analyzed at Environmental Health Science
(EHS) Center of Mass Spectrometry Facility, Oregon State Uni-
versity, Corvallis, by chromatography and electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). A database search was per-
formed using Mascot (Matrix Science, London, UK) and IPI
human (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., PEAKS Studio, Canada)
software.
LENTIVIRAL TRANSDUCTION FOR COLOCALIZATION OF M. tuberculosis
AND HOST PROTEINS
The interactions of bacterial Rv3364c protein with Homo sapi-
ens cathepsin G in macrophages were investigated by using the
Lenti-X™Lentiviral Expression and Delivery Systems (Clontech).
M. tuberculosis Rv3364c was cloned in fusion with dtTomato
gene in pLVX–dtTomato–C1 vector and cathepsin G in fusion
with ZsGreen1 gene in pLVX–ZsGreen1–C1 vector. The pLVX–
dtTomato–C1 vector was used as a control for colocalization
assays.
The packaging mixes of above constructs were prepared in
accordance with the supplied protocol (Clontech),added to 293FT
cells and incubated for overnight at 37˚C in 5% CO2 incubator.
Next day, medium were replenished with the complete medium
and incubated for additional 48 h. Virus containing supernatants
were collected and titers were determined according to the man-
ufacturer’s protocol (Clontech). Cultures of U937 cells were coin-
fected with lentiviruses containing both bacterial and human
genes, and immunoﬂuorescence microscopy was performed 24 h
following transduction.
CATHEPSIN G ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY ASSAY
U937 macrophages were seeded onto six-well plates and infected
or not infected with M. tuberculosis wild-type or 20A11 bacteria
for 2, 12, and 24 h. Lysed cells were pre-cleared and processed for
detection of active cathepsin G,as previously described (Peterszegi
et al., 1997). Fifty micro liters of samples were mixed with 200 μl
Tris–Hcl buffer (100 nM) containing 0.05% of CaCl2, 0.02% of
NaNO3, and 0.01% of Brij 35, pH 8.0. A 100-nM water-soluble
peptide MeOSuc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Met-pNA (CalBioChem,Los Ange-
les, CA, USA) was added to samples as a substrate for cathepsin G.
The rates of nitroanilide (pNA) hydrolysis were measured at 25˚C
on a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), and cleav-
age of pNA was monitored colorimetrically at 405 nm. Enzyme
activity was expressed as % of cathepsin G inhibition in 106 cells.
In addition, the effects of puriﬁed His-tag-RFP–Rv3364c protein
at the concentration range of 0.1–100 μg/ml was measured on
cathepsin G activity with the same procedure. The following con-
trols were used, together with the experimental samples: water
alone, water with substrate, His-tag-RFP alone, His-tag-RFP with
substrate, and His-tag-RFP–Rv3364c protein alone.
INACTIVATION OF PAR4 AND NOD1 WITH siRNA AND CATHEPSIN G
INHIBITION ASSAY
The PAR4 and NOD1 siRNAs, as well as control siRNA (scrabbled
sequences),werepurchasedfromSantaCruzBiotechnology(Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA). To examine the
contribution of both PAR4 and NOD1 expressions to caspase-1
activationandapoptosis,macrophagesweretransfectedwithPAR4
or NOD1, and then infected with the M. tuberculosis clone 20A11.
The transfection was performed according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations. In brief, 1 × 105/ml cells were seeded onto
six-well tissue culture plates, washed once with siRNA transfec-
tion medium, and replaced with transfection medium containing
PAR4 or NOD1 siRNA transfection reagent mixture containing
6 μl of each siRNA duplex or negative control siRNA, 8 μl siRNA
transfection reagent,and 200 μl medium. After 8 h of transfection,

RESULTS
GENE ORGANIZATION AND COMPLEMENTATION OF M. tuberculosis
20A11 TRANSPOSON MUTANT
Mycobacterium tuberculosis DIA mutant 20A11 was identiﬁed in
macrophage assays as previously described (Danelishvili et al.,
2010). The sequencing of 20A11 with non-speciﬁc nested suppres-
sion PCR method (Tamme et al., 2000) identiﬁed the interrupted
Rv3365c (2,631 bp) gene at 2,624 bp location (Figure 1A). The
gene Rv3365c is part of an operon that consists of ﬁve genes that
are highly conserved in mycobacteria. Although M. tuberculosis
Rv3361c, Rv3363, Rv3364, and Rv3365c genes are annotated as
conserved hypothetical proteins, signiﬁcant homologies to other
bacterial proteins were found, based on the domain search. The
Rv3365c belongs to the histidine kinase sensory family of proteins,
possibly initiating the signal transduction. The Rv3364c gene con-
tains the Roadblock/LC7 domain associated with the outer/inner
ﬂagellar dynein and cytoplasmic dynein of eukaryotic cells, and
possibly plays a structural or regulatory role. The Rv3363c gene
encodes a protein that has the DUF472 domain. This class of
proteins belongs to the helix-turn-helix (HTH) family proteins
that contain a DNA-binding helix-turn-helix domain. Rv3363c
most likely is the partner protein for the sensory histidine kinase
Rv3365c. The downstream genes in the operon are an ATP/GTP
binding protein Rv3362c and putative Rv3361c protein containing
ﬁve pentapeptide repeat domains. The Rv3361c protein has been
shown to have an inhibitory effect on ﬂuoroquinolone resistance
through binding to DNA gyrase and suppressing its activity. The
crystal structure of this protein has been well investigated (Hegde
et al., 2005). Genes Rv3365c-Rv3361c are highly expressed dur-
ing M. tuberculosis exposure to macrophages, as well as within
the cells, established by Real-Time PCR (Figure 1B). The com-
plementation of 20A11 using the pMV261–AprII plasmid with
Rv3365c, Rv3364c, or Rv3364c-Rv3362c genes did not restore the

M. tuberculosis Rv3364c PROTEIN IS TRANSLOCATED INTO THE
CYTOPLASM OF MACROPHAGES
In an effort to identify if M. tuberculosis Rv3364c protein was
exported in the cytoplasm of host cells, we created a β-lactamase
gene reporter vector. Using a cell-permeable ﬂuorescent substrate
CCF2-AM for β-lactamase enzyme, assay was performed on U937
cells infected with M. tuberculosis PM638 (BlaC knockout) strain
(Figure 2A), PM638 clones either expressing BlaC(+) protein
containing a secretion region (Figure 2B) or BlaC(−) protein lack-
ing a secretion region (Figure 2C), and PM638 clone containing
Rv3364c fusion with BlaC(−) (Figure 2D). Upon endogenous
β-lactamase hydrolysis, CCF2-AM substrate is rapidly converted
to a product that lacks the FRET and ﬂuoresces blue. In the
absence of the cytoplasmic β-lactamase enzyme charged form of
the CCF2-AM ﬂuoresces green. The strong changes were observed
in the emission between control [PM638, PM638 BlaC(−)] and
experimental[PM638BlaC(+),PM638Rv3364c:BlaC(−)]groups
recorded with the cytofuorometer (Figure 2E). Analysis of the
intracellular distribution of bacteria indicated 59–64% infection
rate of U937 macrophages in all groups (Figure 2F). In addition,
western blot analysis was performed on macrophages infected with
M. tuberculosis over-expressed His:Rv3364c clone, conﬁrming
Rv3364c protein secretion in U937 cells (Figure 2G).
EFFECT OF M. tuberculosis WILD-TYPE AND 20A11 INFECTION ON
CYTOKINE PRODUCTION
Macrophage-derived cytokines are important players in the con-
trol of M. tuberculosis infection. To examine if there were any
differences in cytokine induction activating or inhibiting anti-
mycobacterial activity in macrophages, U937 mononuclear cells
were infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv or DIA mutant 20A11,
andtheproductionof IL-12,TNF,IFN-β,andTGF-βcytokineswas
then analyzed in the supernatants after 4,24,and 48 h (Figure 3A).
The results indicate that infection of the 20A11 mutant was associ-
ated with signiﬁcantly greater IFN-β and lower TGF-β production,
but no signiﬁcant changes in IL-12 and TNF production were
observed, when compared to the wild-type infection.
EXPRESSION PROFILE OF NF-κB AND INTRACELLULAR PATTERN
RECOGNITION RECEPTORS OF MACROPHAGES
Previously shown is the importance of IFN-β initiating signal-
ing in activation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB; Yang et al.,
2000), a transcription factor that controls many among host
immune response mechanisms, such as cytokine synthesis, apop-
tosis, and cell cycle. Real-Time PCR was performed to assess
the NF-κB gene expression levels in M. tuberculosis H37Rv and
20A11-infected macrophages. Higher levels of NF-κB expres-
sion were observed in both wild-type and mutant infected
cells, but the expression level was signiﬁcantly higher in 20A11-
infected macrophages, compared to the wild-type infection at 24 h
(p < 0.01; Figure 3B).
The cytosolic proteins nucleotide-binding oligomerization
domain 1 and 2 (NOD1 and NOD2) are involved in intracellu-
lar recognition of microbes and their products (Carneiro et al.,
2004), and have been described as activators of NF-κB pathway
(Athman and Philpott, 2004). Alternatively, since NOD proteins
interact or enhance caspase-1 and caspase-9 activation, a role
for these proteins in apoptosis has been proposed (Hong and
Jung, 2002; Franchi et al., 2009). Because the 20A11 mutant is
associated with signiﬁcant macrophage apoptosis, higher IFN-β
production and NF-κB synthesis in macrophages, we investi-
gated the expression of NOD1 and NOD2, as well as caspase-1
activation, and compared them with macrophages infected with
the wild-type bacterium. Figure 3B shows that, while high lev-
els of NOD2 expression were observed in both, M. tuberculosis
H37Rv and 20A11-infected macrophages after 24 h post-infection,
NOD1 expression was signiﬁcantly reduced in wild-type-infected
macrophages at day 4 after infection. In fact, NOD1 expression in
20A11-infectedphagocyticcellswassixfoldhigherthantheexpres-
sion in wild-type-infected cells at day 4 (p < 0.05). Western blot
analysis of U937 mononuclear phagocytes upon the wild-type or
mutant infection conﬁrmed the Real-Time observations. Results
revealed the high levels of NOD2 protein in H37Rv- and 20A11-
infected cells. The NOD1 protein levels were signiﬁcantly lower
during the wild-type infection at 24 h and 4 days post-infection,
compared with the NOD1 protein level after 20A11 infection at
day 4 (Figures 3C,D).
CASPASE-1 ACTIVATION DURING M. tuberculosis WILD-TYPE AND
20A11 MUTANT INFECTION
Caspase-1 has been shown to be a potent activator of NF-κB
(Bauernfeind et al., 2009). In situ labeling and APO LOGIX™-
FAM detection system for active caspase-1 were performed to
assess any changes in caspase-1 activation during M. tuberculosis
wild-type and mutant infection. Our results indicate that, while
infection of macrophages with 20A11 mutant or treatment with
staurosporine resulted in sixfold to eightfold greater caspase-1
activity than uninfected or untreated controls, signiﬁcant inhi-
bition of caspase-1 activation was seen in macrophages infected
with M. tuberculosis H37Rv or complemented 20A11 clone at
the 24-h time point infection (Figures 4A,B). We then examined
whether 20A11-associated caspase-1 activation was related to the

caspase-1 inhibitor, infected with M. tuberculosis 20A11 mutant,
and the levels of apoptosis were determined after 3 days. Inhibi-
tion of caspase-1 had a direct correlation to the decreased levels of
apoptosis during 20A11 infection of U937 cells (Figure 4C).
M. tuberculosis Rv3364c INTERACTION WITH CATHEPSIN G PROTEIN
In order to identify Rv3364c interacting host protein, we per-
formed His pull-up assay. The bacterial His-tagged RFP–Rv3364c
protein was incubated with activated macrophage lysates for
overnight and after 24 h captured with the paramagnetic pre-
charged His–nickel particles, following the isolation of interacting
host protein present in the U937 cell lysate (Figure 5A). The mass
spectrometric analysis of captured target protein identiﬁed 29 kDa
plasma-membrane-associated protease cathepsin G (Trypsin-like
serine protease; Table 2).
Western blot analysis of macrophages infected with M. tuber-
culosis H37Rv and 20A11 mutant showed differences in cathepsin
G protein expression levels. While the cathepsin G protein was
presented at a high level in 20A11-infected cells, M. tuberculosis
H37Rv infection signiﬁcantly reduced the levels of cathepsin G
protein at the 4-h time point (Figure 5B).

in wild-type-infected cells, in opposition to 20A11 mutant infec-
tion at both 12- and 24-h time point infections (Table 3). In
order to identify whether the Rv3364c protein was capable of
inhibiting cathepsin G activity, we exposed different concentra-
tions of puriﬁed bacterial protein to macrophage cell lysates
and the percentage of the decreased cathepsin G activity was
measured after 4 h of incubation. As shown in the Figure 5C,
the high inhibitory effects of the Rv3364c protein on cathepsin
G activity were found in macrophage lysates exposed to 1, 10,
and 100 μg/ml concentrations compared to the RFP treatment
alone.
The further interaction studies of Rv3364c with cathepsin G
using the lentiviral expression system conﬁrmed the colocalization
of these over-expressed proteins in macrophages (Figure 6).

et al., 2000). PAR4 is considered an effective mediator of platelet
activation and inﬂammation (Ramachandran et al., 2007). Alter-
natively, PAR receptors have been shown to modulate the pro-
gram cell death (Borensztajn and Spek, 2008). To investigate
the possible mechanism by which the inhibition of cathepsin
G by M. tuberculosis wild-type inhibited activation of caspase-
1, we examined the PAR4 protein expression levels in wild-type
and 20A11 mutant infected cells (Figure 7). Western blot analy-
sis of immunoprecipitated PAR4 protein showed a detectible
level of this protein in 20A11-infected macrophages. The PAR4
protein was not presented in wild-type-infected or uninfected
cells.
We observed the changes in PAR4 and NOD1 protein expres-
sion levels during 20A11 infection. To determine if either protein
expression in macrophages was the reason for increased levels of
apoptosis and caspase-1 activation, using interference siRNA sys-
tem, we inactivated PAR4 and NOD1. Cells were then infected
with M. tuberculosis 20A11 and apoptosis levels and caspase-
1 activations were determined. There were similar high levels
of macrophage apoptosis in PAR4- or NOD1 siRNA-transfected
cells compared to 20A11-infected macrophages alone or siRNA
scrambled control, as shown on Table 4, suggesting that none of
these protein had direct role in caspase-1 activation.
DISCUSSION
Early inﬂammatory and innate responses during M. tuberculo-
sis infection play essential roles in the host defense mechanisms.
Apoptotic response of macrophages to mycobacterial infection
appears to be an important aspect of the host innate immu-
nity. Inhibition of apoptosis results in M. tuberculosis survival
in macrophages both in tissue culture and in vivo (Danelishvili
et al., 2003; Park et al., 2006; Velmurugan et al., 2007), and in
infected mice apoptosis of macrophages is indirectly related to
virulence (Park et al., 2006). TNF, IL-12, and IFN-γ are essen-
tial cytokines that contribute to protective immunity against M.
tuberculosis (Bhatt and Salgame,2007); whereas,cytokines,such as
IL-10 and TGF-β,down-regulate the immune response and inhibit
excessive inﬂammatory response (Toossi et al., 1995).
We evaluated a M. tuberculosis clone, with a transposon in
the gene Rv3365c, an inactivation that lead to a polar effect on
a chromosomal region with ﬁve genes. The ﬁrst gene in the
operon, Rv3365c, encodes for a putative regulatory protein that
www.frontiersin.org

Danelishvili et al.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis and macrophage apoptosis
may be able to sense the environment. Rv3364c encodes most
similar protein to the Roadblock/LC7 family of proteins, which
in Myxococcus xanthus is associated with gliding motility, and in
eukaryotes, with dynein (Koonin and Aravind, 2000). Rv3361c,
the last gene in the operon, encodes for a protein involved in
ﬂuoroquinolone resistance (Hegde et al., 2005). The gene just
upstream (Rv3362c) encodes for a probable ATP-binding pro-
tein. The Rv3363c most likely is a partner protein to Rv3365c
and is activated by this sensory histidine kinase. Therefore, the
operon is suggestive to be composed of genes encoding for pro-
teins to sense the surrounding environment. The expression of

and changes in cathepsin G activity were measured as% of cathepsin G

whole operon is highly upregulated inside phagocytic cells, which
again supports the hypothesis that the secreted protein(s) would
have a function within the host cell. The ﬁnding that Rv3364c
inactivation and consequent lack of function in the region was
associated with a signiﬁcant increased production of IFN-β by
infected macrophages raised the possibility of an association
between M. tuberculosis Rv3361c-Rv3364c and host cytosolic sen-
sors. Type I IFNs are an important class of cytokines, responsible
for a number of diverse immune responses to pathogens (Monroe
et al., 2009). This group of cytokines is transcribed in response
to signals from surveillance pathways, such as caspase recruit-
ment domain (CARD)-containing sensors like RIG-1 and MDA5
and NOD proteins (Franchi et al., 2008). These latter proteins,
also known as NOD-like family receptors (NLR) recognize pri-
marily microbial molecules. The cytosolic receptors, NOD1 and
NOD2, bind to meso-diaminopimelic acid and muramyl dipep-
tide, respectively. Once activated, NOD1 and NOD2 undergo
conformational changes and activate NF-κB downstream. Many
bacteria were demonstrated to activate NOD1, including Shigella
ﬂexneri (Girardin et al., 2001), and Listeria monocytogenes (Park
et al.,2007). Staphylococcus aureus (Kapetanovic et al.,2007) and L.
monocytogenes (Kobayashi et al., 2005) have been associated with
NOD2 activation. Ferwerda et al. (2005) showed that NOD2 is a
recognition system for M. tuberculosis. This intracellular receptor
has been shown to regulate the host response to M. tuberculosis and
BCG infection in human macrophages (Brooks et al., 2011). Our
results also conﬁrm the previous observation that M. tuberculosis
infection inhibits NOD2 expression. The reason NOD2 transcript
and protein were down-regulated in macrophages after 4 days of
infection is not known, but it indicates that the phagocytic cell
does not transmit any message using that pathway, silencing a
recognition path. Since NOD2 is constitutively expressed in cells,
in contrast to NOD1, one would expect that NOD2 production
would be sustained during infection. NOD1 expression, how-
ever, was only triggered at late time points by the mutant 20A11
(Rv3364c-inactivated), but not by the wild-type bacterium. Con-
sidering that the bacterial structure responsible for the activation
of NOD1 is almost certainly present on the 20A11 mutant strain
(diaminopimelic acid), since the synthetic pathway is present,
one wonders about the reasons why NOD1 is only expressed
late in the infection. Although this may be related with the late
release of diaminopimelic acid from the vacuole, further stud-
ies are necessary to conﬁrm it. Alternatively, M. tuberculosis or
bacterial antigens derived from the pathogen may suppress NOD1
expression by unknown mechanisms.

Protein–protein interaction assay demonstrated that the host
protein that binds to Rv3364c is cathepsin G, a serine protease
found in the lysosome and associated with membranes of phago-
cytic cells and epithelial cells (Maison et al., 1991; Moriuchi et al.,
2000). Both cathepsin G and B have been linked to apoptosis of
epithelial cells and phagocytic cells (Sabri et al., 2003; Averette
et al.,2009; Chung et al.,2010). In addition,cathepsin D activation
during pneumococcal infection was shown to induce apoptosis of
macrophages killing this pathogen (Bewley et al., 2011). Due to its
direct proteolytic activities, cathepsin G has been shown to have
antimicrobial killing effects against S. aureus (Reeves et al., 2002).
Cleavage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ﬂagellin by cathepsin G has
been shown to inactivate the biological function of this virulence
factor (Lopez-Boado et al., 2004). The interaction of membrane-
associated serine protease of U937 monocytes with gp120 protein
during HIV infection has been described to help the virus to enter
host cells and spread the infection (Avril et al., 1994).
How membrane cathepsin G is activated is still unknown, but
it has been shown that cathepsin G cleaves and activates IL-1-
β in vivo (Hazuda et al., 1990). This serine protease has also
been shown to stimulate protease-activated receptor-4 (PAR4;
Sambrano et al., 2000; Ramachandran et al., 2007), belonging to
a family of transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor

PARs function on epithelial cells and macrophages as a part of
the immuno-surveillance system and trigger caspase-1 activation
through the activation of NOD proteins (Chung et al., 2010;
Rohani et al., 2010). Cathepsin G is also described as stimulat-
ing the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, secondary to oxidative
stress (Blomgran et al., 2007), and caspase-8-mediated apoptosis
(Baumgartner et al., 2007).
Our results suggest that the wild-type M. tuberculosis inhibits
expression and activation of cathepsin G. The inhibition has
important effect downstream, with consequent suppression of
caspase-1 activation. These ﬁndings are quite intriguing and bring
to light the complexity of the process. M. tuberculosis has been
shown to inhibit apoptosis by interfering with the eicosanoid

pathways (Divangahi et al., 2010) and the extrinsic pathway of
apoptosis by secreting nuoG (Velmurugan et al., 2007). The bac-
terium also suppresses the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis by
blocking post-transcription mechanisms of caspase activation
(Danelishvili et al., 2010). In addition, a recent study showed that
M. tuberculosis prevents the inﬂammasome activation, probably
by secreting Zmp-1, a putative metalloprotease, and inhibiting
the stimulation of caspase-1-dependent apoptosis (Master et al.,
2008). We now describe a different pathway that the bacterium
interferes with and, consequently, blocks pyroptosis. It is clear that
the success of M. tuberculosis as a pathogen depends on the ability
to interfere with a number of redundant mechanisms of apoptosis
in macrophages. Cathepsin G most likely plays a relevant role in
the early host defense against mycobacterial infection. The activa-
tion of cathepsin G in the membrane triggers effects downstream
that lead to the stimulation of the inﬂammatory process. Whether
the reason for blocking this pathway is only related to apopto-
sis suppression or is also aimed to regulate the inﬂammatory
process is currently unknown. The signiﬁcant down-regulation
of the expression of cathepsin G by M. tuberculosis virulent strain
infection of macrophages has been reported to increase bacterial
survival (Rivera-Marrero et al., 2004). Cathepsin G was also found
strongly upregulated during M. bovis BCG infection of alveolar
macrophages in vivo (Srivastava et al., 2007). Adding this to our
data explains that sensor mechanisms in M. tuberculosis are in
place, which stimulate the synthesis of a number of downstream
proteins, including release of Rv3364c and inactivation of one
of many pathways leading to apoptosis. Apparently, the puzzle is
beginning to come together, and we are once more reminded of
how fascinating this pathogen is.
