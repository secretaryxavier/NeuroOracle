Abstract
Objective—This study examined the effects of age at injury on the persistence of behavior
problems and social skill deficits in young children with complicated mild to severe traumatic
brain injury (TBI).
Method—A concurrent cohort/prospective research design was used with repeated assessments
of children with TBI (n = 82) or Orthopedic Injury (OI) (n = 114). Parents completed the Child
Behavior Checklist, the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions, and the Preschool and
Kindergarten Behavior Scales or the Home and Community Social and Behavior Scales shortly
after injury to assess preinjury functioning, and at an extended follow-up an average of 38 months
postinjury. Generalized linear modeling was used to examine the relationship of age at injury to
the maintenance of behavior problems, and logistic regression was used to examine the persistence
of clinically significant behavior problems.
Results—At the extended follow-up, severe TBI was associated with significantly greater
anxiety problems relative to the Group OI. With increasing time since injury, children who
sustained a severe TBI at an earlier age had significantly higher levels of parent-reported
symptoms of ADHD and anxiety than children who were older at injury.
Conclusions—Findings suggest that longer-term treatment for behavior problems may be
needed after severe TBI, particularly for those injured at an earlier age.

Introduction
Children who sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI) commonly exhibit long-term behavior
difficulties that are among the most troubling consequences of brain injury (Schwartz et al.,
2003; Taylor et al., 2002; Chapman et al., 2010; Andrews, Rose, & Johnson, 1998;
Ganesalingam, Sanson, Anderson, & Yeates, 2006; Ganesalingam, Sanson, Anderson, &
Yeates, 2007; Catroppa, Anderson, Morse, Haitou, & Rosenfeld, 2008; Yeates et al., 2010).
A series of recent studies demonstrated that behavior is adversely affected after TBI in
young children, with symptoms failing to resolve at long-term follow-ups conducted one
year or more postinjury. Persisting symptoms included those related to Attention Deficit/
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), externalizing behavior problems, executive dysfunction
(Chapman et al., 2010), and social competence deficits (Yeates et al., 2010). Catroppa and
colleagues (2008) also examined functional outcomes in young, preschool aged children 5
years postinjury and found deficits in adaptive functioning, behavior, and academic
achievement. Additionally, all of these studies found a relationship between long-term
problems and injury severity, with significantly greater behavior problems among those with
severe injury.
These findings are consistent with investigations of school-age children and adolescents that
have reported elevated rates of both internalizing (e.g., Bloom et al., 2001; Max et al.,
1998c; Wade, Michaud, & Brown, 2006) and externalizing behavior problems (Bloom et al.,
2001; Max et al., 1998d; Schwartz et al., 2003) after TBI. Childhood TBI has also been
linked to elevated rates of clinical syndromes, including ADHD (Wassenberg, Max, Lind-
gren, & Schatz, 2004; Bloom et al., 2001; Max et al., 1998a; Max et al., 2005), oppositional
defiant disorder (ODD; Max et al., 1998a; Max et al., 1998b; Max et al., 1998c; Bloom et
al., 2001), and anxiety disorders (Max et al., 1998c; Levi, Drotar, Yeates, & Taylor, 1999;
Wade, Michaud, & Brown, 2006; Grados et al., 2008; Vasa et al., 2002). However, research
with school-age children suggests that internalizing problems are more likely to resolve over
time than externalizing problems (Bloom et al., 2001). Because the current body of research
has focused predominantly on school-age children and adolescents, research examining the
long-term development and maintenance of behavior problems among young children with
TBI is needed (Catroppa et al., 2008; Chapman et al., 2010; Yeates et al., 2010).
Early childhood is theorized to be a time of increased vulnerability to the long-term effects
of neurological insult (Taylor & Alden, 1997; Ewing-Cobbs, Prasad, Landry, Kramer, &
DeLeon, 2004). Specifically, injuries occurring during early childhood have been purported
to compromise subsequent development to a greater extent than later insults (Taylor &
Alden, 1997). Examining the role of age at injury with regard to symptoms of anxiety one
year postinjury, Vasa and colleagues (2002) found that among children with severe TBI,
younger age at injury was positively correlated with postinjury anxiety symptoms,
particularly obsessive–compulsive behavior, separation anxiety, and simple phobias.
However, the bulk of the research to date that has examined the effect of age at injury on
TBI sequelae has largely focused on neurocognitive and academic outcomes rather than
behavior outcomes in school-age children. These studies indicate that children who are
younger at the time of injury (less than 7–8 years old) exhibit worse long-term
neurocognitive and academic outcomes and less recovery relative to children injured at older
ages (Anderson & Moore, 1995; Verger et al., 2000; Anderson, Catroppa, Morse, Haritou, &
Rosenfeld, 2000) with the effect of age more salient among those with severe injury
(Anderson, Catroppa, Morse, Haritou, & Rosenfeld, 2000). Anderson and Moore (1995)
found that IQ scores for younger children (less than 7 years of age at injury) remained stable
during the initial two years postinjury, whereas those of older children increased
significantly, suggesting less recovery in intellectual functioning after early injury. Younger
age at injury has also been associated with less recovery in a variety of specific abilities,

including attention (Ewing-Cobbs et al., 1998; Anderson et al., 2010), perceptual motor
skills (Ewing-Cobbs et al., 1998), visuospatial abilities (Verger et al., 2000; Anderson et al.,
2010), language, memory (Anderson et al., 2010), processing speed (Anderson et al., 2010;
Anderson, Catroppa, Godfrey, & Rosenfeld, 2012), and executive functions (Anderson et
al., 2010; Slomine et al., 2002).
However, not all studies have found poorer outcomes among children injured at an earlier
age. Ewing-Cobbs and colleagues (1997) found that age at injury was unrelated to
neuropsychological test performance when comparing children who were ages 4 to 41
months at the time of injury with those who were ages 42 to 72 months at the time of injury.
Similarly, Yeates and colleagues (2002) found that age at injury did not moderate group
differences on a range of neuropsychological measures including short-term memory
(STM), verbal fluency, intelligence, and motor integration. The single exception was
performance on the Contingency Naming Task, on which children who were younger at the
time of injury (less than 7 years) exhibited more pronounced deficits 12 months postinjury
than older children. In the same cohort of children injured between the ages of 6 and 12
years, Taylor and colleagues (2002) found no evidence for moderating effects of age at
injury on behavior deficits and long-term academic ability.
Because of these inconsistent findings, it is unclear whether the association between earlier
age at injury and poorer neurocognitive outcomes is limited to children with severe TBI.
Some studies have found that younger children have poorer outcomes regardless of their
injury severity (Anderson & Moore, 1995; Verger et al., 2000), whereas others found a
relationship between intellectual outcomes and age at injury only among those with severe
TBI. For example, Anderson and colleagues (2000) found that children with severe injury
who were between the ages of 3 and 7 years exhibited less recovery from baseline to 12
months postinjury than did children with severe injury who were 8–12 years of age at the
time of injury, whereas similar effects of age at injury were not observed among those with
mild to moderate TBI (Anderson, Catroppa, Morse, Haritou, & Rosenfeld, 2000).
Although research indicates that TBI is associated with long-term behavior problems among
school-age children, few studies have comprehensively described the long-term behavioral
functioning of children injured at an early age. Research investigating the relation of age of
injury to the persistence of behavior problems is also lacking. The aim of the current
investigation was to fill this gap in knowledge by investigating associations of age at injury
to long-term behavior problems in children injured in early childhood. We hypothesized that
severe TBI would be associated with higher levels of behavior problems and higher rates of
clinically significant problems at the extended follow-up and that both more severe TBI and
younger age at injury would be associated with more persistent attention problems, anxiety,
and externalizing behavior problems.
Method
Participants
A concurrent cohort/prospective research design was used with repeated assessments of
children aged 3–7 years with TBI or OI requiring hospitalization. An OI comparison group
was recruited to control for the experience of hospitalization and preexisting factors that
might make the child vulnerable to injury. Participants were recruited from three children's
hospitals and one general hospital. Parents completed retrospective ratings of children's
preinjury behavior problems, executive function behaviors, and social competence at a
baseline assessment conducted shortly after injury (mean number of days = 39.92; SD =
19.57). Relevant demographic information was also collected at the baseline assessment. At
an extended follow-up a minimum of 24 months postinjury (mean number of month =

38.34; SD = 10.29), 68 parents of children with TBI (19 severe, 49 complicated mild to
moderate) and 75 with children who sustained an orthopedic injury (OI) again completed the
measures of child behavior, executive function, and social competence. Of the 196 families
who completed the baseline assessment, 143 (72%) participated in the extended follow-up.
Those who completed the follow-up were younger at the time of injury and significantly
more likely to have sustained a TBI versus OI (p < .05). Analysis failed to reveal any other
significant differences in baseline characteristics between participants and nonparticipants
(all ps ≥ .44 for the nonsignificant variables).
The sample was divided into three groups: severe TBI, complicated mild to moderate TBI,
and OI. Inclusionary criteria included having sustained the injury between 36 and 83 months
of age, no evidence of child abuse as the cause of the injury, no history of documented
neurological problems or developmental delays preinjury, and English as the primary
language in the home. To be eligible, all children had to be hospitalized for at least one
night. Among those with TBI, additional eligibility criteria included an alteration of
neurological functioning as measured by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score less than 13 or
evidence of trauma-related abnormality as seen on MRI or computerized tomography.
Children in the severe TBI group had a GCS score less than or equal to 8 as the lowest
postresuscitation score; those in the complicated mild to moderate TBI group had either a
GCS score of 9–12 or a GCS score of 13–15 accompanied by evidence of abnormality on
imaging. The OI group included children who sustained a bone fracture, other than to the
skull, and had no alterations in consciousness or other symptoms of head trauma.
Procedure
The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards at each study site, and informed
consent was obtained from the parent or legal guardian once the child was known to be in
stable medical condition. Medical charts were reviewed for relevant information. At the
baseline and extended follow-up assessments, parents completed questionnaires regarding
the child's behavior and social competence that are described below.
Demographic Measures
Relevant demographic and injury-related information was collected at the baseline study
visit. Family income was estimated using the census tract median income for the zip code of
the participant's primary residence. A composite measure of socioeconomic status (SES)
was constructed by averaging z scores for primary caregiver education and median census
tract income.
Parent-Report Measures
The Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000, 2001) is a parent
rating of child behavior problems that is widely used in both clinical and research settings.
Per the CBCL manual, parents with children younger than the age of 6 years received the
CBCL 1[1/2]–5 version and those with children 6 years or older received the CBCL 6–18
version. For the current study, scores for internalizing behaviors and externalizing behaviors
subscales were used, along with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
fourth edition (DSM–IV)–oriented Anxiety and Attention Deficits/ Hyperactivity clinical
subscales. The CBCL has high test–retest reliability and criterion validity (Achenbach &
Rescorla, 2000, 2001) and is sensitive to behavior problems after TBI (Taylor et al., 2002;
Schwartz et al., 2003). DSM-oriented clinical scales were examined because of their
correspondence to clinical diagnoses. For example, the DSM-Oriented Anxiety scale has a
greater degree of correspondence with clinical diagnoses than the Anxious/ Depressed
Syndrome scale (Ebesutani et al., 2009). For the CBCL Anxiety and Attention Deficits/
Hyperactivity DSM-oriented clinical scales, t scores are truncated at 50, resulting in a
Karver et al.

restricted range of scores. In an effort to alleviate this problem, raw scores were used in all
analyses except when calculating the proportion of participants who met criteria for
clinically elevated behavior problems. Consistent with prior investigations of pediatric TBI,
a t score greater than or equal to 63 was used as a clinical cutoff for significant behavior
problems (Schwartz et al., 2003; Chapman et al., 2010).
The Preschool and Kindergarten Behavior Scales–Second Edition (PKBS–2; Merrell, 2002)
and the Home and Community Social and Behavior Scales (HCSBS; Merrell & Caldarella,
2002) were used to assess social competence. The PKBS and HCSBS are similar in structure
and content but are normed for younger (ages 3 to 6 years) and older (ages 5 to 18 years)
children, respectively. For the purposes of this study, parents of children younger than 6
years of age completed the PKBS and those with children ages 6 or older completed the
HCSBS. Both measures have demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity (Lund &
Merrell, 2001; Merrell, 1996; Merrell & Boelter, 2001; Merrell, Streeter, & Boelter, 2001).
For this study, we used the social competence composite from each measure to obtain a
single measure of this dimension. The two sets of z scores demonstrated substantial
correlations across time, supporting the assumption that they provide equivalent measures of
social competence. A clinical cutoff of z = 1.5 was used to indicate clinically significant
deficits in social competence.
Parents also completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF;
Gioia, Isquith, Guy, & Kenworthy, 2000), a rating of the child's executive functioning
abilities. Parents of children ages 3 to 5 years old were administered the preschool version
(Gioia, Espy, & Isquith, 2000), and parents of children ages 6 and older were administered
the school-age version (Gioia, Isquith, Guy, & Kenworthy, 2000). This measure has
demonstrated high levels of internal consistency and stability and acceptable levels of both
interrater and test–retest reliability (Gioia, Espy, & Isquith, 2000; Gioia, Isquith, Guy, &
Kenworthy, 2000). The General Executive Composite (GEC), or total score, was used as a
broad measure of executive ability. Clinically significant deficits in executive function
behaviors were defined as t scores ≥63 (Chapman et al., 2010).
Statistical Analyses
Means, standard deviations, and simple correlations were used to summarize the overall
distribution of the data and to describe bivariate relationships among the variables in the
study. General linear mixed model analysis was used to examine the persistence of behavior
problems over time as a function of injury severity, time since injury, and age at injury. The
initial model included all interactions involving injury group, time since injury, and age at
injury; covariates included retrospective ratings of preinjury behavior functioning completed
by the parents at the baseline assessment, child's race (White vs. non-White), sex (male or
female), and SES. To illustrate significant interactions, we reported the estimated values for
the dependent variables at one standard deviation above or below the mean age at injury and
mean time since injury. To make the models more parsimonious, manual backward
elimination was used where initial models were trimmed by eliminating nonsignificant
higher-level interactions, starting with three-way interactions, and then reestimating the
model before eliminating lower level interactions and main effects. Use of this method is
consistent with previous research (e.g., Yeates et al., 2010; Taylor et al., 2002; Yeates et al.,
2002; Yeates et al., 2004; McCoy, McMillen, & Spitznagel, 2008; van der Heijden,
Donders, Stijen, & Moons, 2006). Backwards manual elimination of nonsignificant factors
can also be justified as a means to increase the numerical stability and generalizability of
results (Hegewald, Pfahlberg, & Uter, 2003). We used logistic regression to test the
relationship between time since injury, age at injury, and TBI severity on the likelihood of
exhibiting clinically significant levels of behavior problems, controlling for the same
covariates included in mixed model analysis. In reporting the results of continuous and

logistic regression, we retained age at injury and time since injury in all models, even if
statistically nonsignificant, because these factors were central to the aims of the study.
Additionally, we retained child's gender as this information is relevant for interpretations
and comparisons on the CBCL clinical scales. We also determined the proportion of
participants by injury group that met criteria for clinically significant behavior problems at
the extended follow-up.
Results
Participants
Means and standard deviations for baseline data for those who completed the extended
follow-up can be found in Table 1. Included for descriptive purposes in Table 1 is the family
census tract median income and primary caregiver education; however, the composite SES
measure was used in subsequent analyses.
Demographic comparisons of the injury groups revealed no significant differences in
primary caregiver education or the child's sex, race, or age at injury (p > .05). 42% of the
severe group, 14% of the complicated mild to moderate group, and 10% of the OI group
reported receiving psychopharmacological interventions at the extended follow-up (χ2 (2, n
= 141) = 12.20, p = .002). The majority of the reported medications (approximately 68%)
were used to address symptoms related to ADHD. Group differences were found in the
number of days from injury to the baseline visit, with the OI group having a shorter time
from injury to visit than either the severe or mild to moderate TBI group. Additionally, the
OI group had a significantly longer time since injury to the extended visit relative to the
complicated mild to moderate TBI group, and the OI group had a significantly greater
median income than the severe TBI group (see Table 1).
Simple correlation coefficients among baseline variables ranged from 0.003 between the
Internalizing Behaviors subscale and age at injury to 0.79 for both the Externalizing
Behaviors subscale and the BRIEF GEC and the ADHD subscale and the BRIEF GEC. The
CBCL Externalizing and ADHD subscales were also highly correlated (r = .71). We
examined and failed to find evidence of multicollinearity among the predictor variables. The
combined family income and maternal education variables were moderately correlated with
the behavioral measures, with correlations ranging from −0.23 on the Anxiety subscale to
−0.42 on the Externalizing subscale. Examination of the distributions revealed skewness
values that ranged from −.97 for PKBS/HCSBC to 1.55 for the CBCL Anxiety subscale.
Kurtosis values ranged from −.04 for PKBS/ HCSBS to 2.67 for the CBCL ADHD subscale.
Longitudinal Analysis of Behavior Outcomes
Means and standard deviations for the behavior measures at the baseline and extended
follow-up are presented in Table 2. Results from mixed model analysis revealed significant
main effects for group for Externalizing, t = 2.90, p = .004, the BRIEF GEC, t = 2.43, p = .
01, and Internalizing, t = 2.58, p = .01. Simple effects tests indicated that the severe TBI
group was elevated relative to the OI and complicated mild to moderate TBI group on all
three measures. Interactions of group × time since injury × age at injury for were found for
both the CBCL ADHD scale, t =−2.22, p = .02, and CBCL Anxiety scale, t =−2.16, p = .03
with moderate corresponding effect sizes (partial η2 = .04 for the ADHD scale and partial η2
= .05 for the Anxiety scale). For both measures, ratings were higher for the severe TBI than
for the other two groups, but only for children with younger age at injury at a longer time
since injury. The latter findings are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, with estimates based on
raw scores that were 1 SD above and below the sample mean. Group comparisons failed to
reveal significant differences on ratings of social competence.

Rates of Clinically Elevated Behavior Ratings at Extended Follow-Up
Rates of clinical elevations in behavior ratings were consistently higher in the severe TBI
group than in the other two groups. For the severe TBI group, complicated mild to moderate
TBI group, and OI group, respectively, 36.8%, 18.4%, and 11.0% had elevations on
Externalizing; 42.1%, 18.4%, and 16.2% on the CBCL ADHD subscale; 42.1%, 26.5%, and
14.7% on BRIEF GEC; 36.8%, 12.2%, and 12.3% on Internalizing; and 26.3%, 10.2%, and
10.8% on Anxiety. However, only the group difference on the Anxiety subscale was
significant controlling for SES, race, and baseline behavior ratings (see Table 3). Results as
illustrated in Figure 3 indicated that the severe TBI group had a significantly higher rate of
score elevations relative to the OI group but not relative to the mild to moderate TBI group.
The baseline (preinjury) rating was the most consistent predictor of clinical elevations across
all of the rating scales.
Discussion
The current study examined the moderating effects of injury severity, age at injury, and time
since injury on the persistence of behavior problems, social problems, and executive
functioning deficits in a large cohort of young children with TBI more than 2 years
postinjury. Consistent with our hypothesis, age at injury, in conjunction with time since
injury and injury severity, moderated long-term behavior outcomes on the CBCL ADHD
and Anxiety subscales. Specifically, with increasing time since injury, children who
sustained a severe TBI at an earlier age reported significantly higher levels of symptoms
than children who were older at injury. Age at injury did not moderate other behavior
outcomes including social competence, executive dysfunction, overall internalizing
symptoms, or overall externalizing symptoms. As anticipated, children with severe TBI had
significantly higher levels of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems as well as
higher levels of executive dysfunction.
Our primary study hypothesis was that age at injury would moderate the persistence of
behavior problems on the CBCL ADHD, Anxiety, and Externalizing Behaviors subscales,
such that children who were younger at injury were expected to evidence greater behavior
problems at the extended follow-up. The results partially supported these predictions.
Consistent with our hypothesis, a triple interaction among injury group, time since injury,
and age at injury was found for both ADHD and anxiety symptoms on the CBCL. The
interactions revealed higher levels of persistent symptoms among children who were
younger at the time of injury.
Past research suggests that a relationship exists between ADHD and anxiety disorders, with
rates of comorbidity reportedly as high as 25% (Schatz & Rostain, 2006). Symptoms of
ADHD and anxiety may be related to long-term neurocognitive deficits in the domains of
attention and executive functioning that are more prominent among children who are
younger at the time of injury (Ewing-Cobbs et al., 1998; Anderson et al., 2010; Slomine et
al., 2002). Deficits in these domains have been suggested to contribute to decreased
behavior regulation and attentional capabilities (Barkley, 1997) and decreased ability to
regulate emotional reactions (e.g., Baum et al., 2010; Morgan & Lilenfeld, 2000), which in
turn may affect behavioral functioning. The correlations reported in the current study
suggest a substantial amount of shared variance among the Externalizing Behaviors
subscale, the ADHD subscale, and the GEC.
We also hypothesized that severe TBI would be associated with clinically significant levels
of behavior problems at the extended follow-up. Although the severe TBI had higher rates of
clinically elevated behavior ratings, groups differences were significant only on the Anxiety
scale in analyses controlling for background factors and preinjury ratings. Previous research

reported that social deficits are common postinjury (e.g., Janusz, Kirkwood, Yeates, &
Taylor, 2002; Warschausky, Cohen, Parker, Levendosky, & Okun, 1997), suggesting that
our measures were insensitive to social skills deficits in childhood TBI or that these deficits
are less evident in younger children.
Overall, this study adds to previous research demonstrating effects of school-age TBI on
long-term behavior problems (Schwartz et al., 2003; Bloom et al., 2001; Ganesalingam,
Sancon, Anderson, & Yeates, 2006; Ganesalingam, Sancon, Anderson, & Yeates, 2007;
Taylor et al., 2002). Specifically, the findings confirm past findings of internalizing and
externalizing problems (Bloom et al., 2001; Max et al., 1998c, 1998d; Schwartz et al., 2003;
Wade, Michaud, & Brown, 2006) and elevated rates of clinical symptomology, including
ADHD (Wassenberg, Max, Lindgren, & Schatz, 2004; Bloom et al., 2001; Max et al.,
1998a; Max et al., 2005) and anxiety disorders (Max et al., 1998c; Levi, Drotar, Yeates, &
Taylor, 1999; Wade, Michaud, & Brown, 2006; Grados et al., 2008; Vasa et al., 2002).
These findings confirm previous reports indicating that behavior problems and symptoms of
clinical disorders are worse among children with severe TBI (Catroppa et al., 2008; Taylor
et al., 2002; Schwartz et al., 2003). The results are also in accord with previous reports of
persistent behavior problems in the severe TBI group (Chapman et al., 2010; Yeates et al.,
2010). The current study extends these findings by demonstrating that behavior problems
continue to be present at a further follow-up conducted an average of 38 months postinjury.
These findings are contrary to prior research that failed to reveal associations of age at injury
with injury severity (Anderson & Moore, 1995; Verger et al., 2000) and are instead
compatible with other studies that have examined the role of age at injury with regard to
long-term neurocognitive outcomes, showing that children who are younger and sustained
severe injury often experience greater long-term deficits (Anderson, Catroppa, Morse,
Haritou, & Rosenfeld, 2000; Ewing-Cobbs et al., 1998). The current study extends these
findings by demonstrating that behavior problems, specifically ADHD symptoms and
anxiety, may also be related to age at injury and injury severity, so that children who are
younger and sustain a severe injury exhibit higher levels of symptoms over time.
The primary limitation of the current study is the reliance on retrospective parent ratings of
premorbid behavior functioning. Because parents rated premorbid symptoms after the injury
occurred, they may have been biased by the child's current behavior problems. Also of
consideration, controlling for baseline behavior may have limited our ability to detect long-
term behavior deficits as parent ratings of behavior problems may have been elevated at
baseline. The use of the CBCL also has limitations. The two versions of the CBCL that are
used in this age range are not identical. Of relevance to the current study, the content of the
Anxiety scales differs between versions, as anxiety is thought to manifest differently in
school-age and preschool-age children (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000, 2001). At the
extended follow-up, eight participants received the preschool version of the CBCL (three
OI, five complicated mild to moderate, and no Severe). To examine the possibility that
findings differed for the two versions of the CBCL scale, the continuous and logistic
regression models were rerun with version considered as an additional factor. No significant
differences were found between the models with and without version type as a factor. The
current study also included a relatively small number of children with severe TBI, which
may have limited our ability to describe the behavior functioning of this subgroup. The
small overall sample size at the extended follow-up may also explain the failure to find
group differences in clinically elevated behavior problems. The confidence interval for the
CBCL Anxiety scale was especially large relative to that of the other behavioral measures.
Additionally, simple correlations among the behavioral measures revealed a high degree of
shared variance among the behavioral measures, specifically, the BRIEF GEC, CBCL
ADHD, and CBCL Externalizing; however, among these measures, significant findings

were only found for the CBCL ADHD scale. While these findings suggest that long-term
symptoms of ADHD and Anxiety may be uniquely affected by age at injury and injury
severity, the current results will need to be replicated with larger samples and broader ranges
of age at injury. A further limitation is attrition at the extended follow-up, with higher
attrition within the OI group and among older participants; this bias for participants who
were younger at the time of injury may be especially germane the current study that sought
to examine the role of age at injury. Finally, future investigations may need to use structured
diagnostic interviews, observational measures, or teacher report measures to obtain more in-
depth information about behavior functioning across settings and contexts.
The current study is among the first of which we are aware to examine the effect of age at
injury on the maintenance of behavior problems at least two years post-TBI in a sample of
young children. The use of a comparison group of children that sustained an orthopedic
injury also allowed meaningful conclusions to be made about the specific effects of head
injury relative to other types of traumatic injury. Another strength of the current study is the
comprehensiveness of the behavior domains assessed, including externalizing and
internalizing behavior problems, DSM–IV–oriented symptoms of clinical disorders, social
competence deficits, and problems related to executive functioning.
The current results suggest that care after an early TBI must continue long-term, as
behavioral effects often persist with the passage of time. Given that severe TBI is associated
with greater behavior problems several years postinjury, health care providers need to
closely monitor these issues and diligently refer patients to appropriate services as
necessary. The results further suggest that children who are younger at the time of injury are
at increased risk for greater long-term behavior problems, specifically for symptoms of
ADHD and anxiety. Future studies examining the nature of long-term behavior problems
and issues that exacerbate these problems will be helpful for clinicians who deliver
postinjury rehabilitation services and develop interventions for those with TBI.

Impact and Implications
•
The current study adds to the literature by describing the long-term behavior
sequelae of traumatic brain injury (TBI) (average of 38 months postinjury) in
young children while also addressing the role of age at injury. Although age at
injury has been examined in relation to neurocognitive sequelae after TBI, less
is known about age-at-injury effects on long-term behavior outcomes.
•
For clinical practice, the findings suggest that longer-term treatment may be
necessary after TBI in young children. More specifically, children who are
younger at injury may be particularly at risk for the development of symptoms
of ADHD and anxiety, and thus may be benefit from greater postinjury
intervention.
•
The current study offers valuable information regarding children who may
benefit the most from postinjury interventions. An understanding of the nature
of long-term behavior problems and issues that exacerbate these problems, such
as time since injury and age at injury, is relevant for clinicians who provide
postinjury rehabilitation services and seek to develop interventions.
