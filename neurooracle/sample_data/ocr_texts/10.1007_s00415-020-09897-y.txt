Background
Acute neuropathy in patients with Covid-19 is increasingly
reported [1-6]. We present another case with fulminant
polyradiculoneuritis, suggestive of Guillain-Barré-syndrome
(GBS), leading to a locked-in syndrome with corresponding
generalized nerve root contrast enhancement on MRI.
Case
A 51-year-old male patient was referred to our hospital on
April 2nd, 2020 with a 2 day history of progressive upper
and lower limb weakness and acral paresthesias. He also
reported fluctuating fever and flu-like symptoms with
marked fatigue and dry cough over the last 2 weeks.
On clinical examination, substantial tetraparesis with
limb muscle strength ranging from 2/5 to 4/5 (MRC grad-
ing scale) as well as generalized areflexia were documented.
Vital signs were stable at that point.
A low dose chest CT scan upon admission revealed typi-
cal bilateral interstitial infiltrates in keeping with Covid-19
pneumonia. Covid-19 infection was then confirmed by a
SARS-CoV-2 positive PCR testing result from a pharyn-
geal swab.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on admission revealed mild
pleocytosis (9 cells/l), normal protein content and nega-
tive PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2. Serum anti-ganglioside
antibodies were negative.
Electroneurography on the day after admission demon-
strated prolonged distal motor latencies (left median nerve
8.4 ms; left tibial nerve 11.6 ms) and loss of F waves sug-
gesting peripheral demyelination.
Due to a rapidly deteriorating pulmonary gas exchange
the patient needed endotracheal intubation on day two after
admission. After pulmonary stabilization tracheostomy was
performed on day seven after admission and weaning from
the ventilator attempted.
Despite treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins
(IVIG, 30 g daily for 5 days starting upon admission) the
neurological status deteriorated to an almost complete
peripheral locked-in syndrome with tetraplegia, complete
sensory loss in all extremities, bilateral facial and hypoglos-
sal paresis as well as ongoing respiratory failure due to mus-
cular weakness.
In light of the fulminant neurological course plasma
exchange therapy (PE) was begun on day 13 after admis-
sion (total of 14 treatments). Just prior to initiation of PE
a second CSF sample was taken which now demonstrated
marked protein elevation (10.231 mg/l; normal range up to
450 mg/l) in the absence of pleocytosis.
An MRI of the spine was performed on day 14 after
admission and demonstrated massive symmetrical contrast
enhancement of the spinal nerve roots at all levels of the
spine including the cauda equina. Interestingly anterior and
posterior nerve roots were equally affected (Fig. 1).
Thirty-one days after admission the patient was referred
to a specialized rehabilitation clinic. At that time he showed
signs of motor improvement with regressive facial and hypo-
glossal paresis but still needed mechanical ventilation.

Discussion
In the presented Covid-19 patient, the clinical diagnosis of
acute polyradiculoneuritis, highly suggestive of para-infec-
tious GBS, was confirmed by spinal MRI.
The complete sensory loss in our patient, which is con-
sidered uncommon in GBS, corresponds to the extensive
posterior nerve root involvement, the ongoing neurogenic
respiratory failure to the cervical root involvement. Since
respiratory failure is known to be a common and hazardous
problem in acute Covid-19 patients, high cervical polyradic-
uloneuritis should be considered a possible cause in patients
developing limb weakness or cranial nerve involvement.
IVIG and PE are the two treatment options in moderate to
severe GBS. We started with IVIG therapy right upon admis-
sion, expecting a low risk of harm with regards to Covid-
19. With exacerbating neurological symptoms, a therapeutic
switch to PE was considered early but initially not performed
due to concern to remove the just administered [VIG and
to compromise the patient’s immunocompetence in active
Covid-19 pneumonia. PE was started only on day 13 after
admission, when pulmonary gas exchange had normalized
and a SARS-CoV-2 tracheal specimen was tested negative.
Our case provides further evidence that GBS is a relevant
complication of Covid-19. The value of [VIG and PE needs
to be further evaluated in this specific setting.
