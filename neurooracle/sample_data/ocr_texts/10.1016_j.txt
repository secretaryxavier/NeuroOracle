Quantum critical points (QCP) accompanied by superconductivity are ubiquitous in
condensed matter physics. In general, the transition temperature Tg of an ordered
state, e.g. antiferromagnetic, goes to zero under the influence of an external
parameter, e.g. pressure. Superconductivity appears before the disappearance of the
ordered state, but reaches its maximum 7. when Tp = 0. Presently, the implications
of the QCP's on superconductivity are a subject of debate. It is propose here that both
transition temperatures satisfy the relation T,o + T,” = 1, where the tilde indicates
normalization to the maximum values. Inspired from the basic postulate of SO(NV)
theories of superconductors, it is proposed as an extension from Bilbro-McMillan
relation.

The study of phase transitions is central to the understanding of the physical
properties of condensed matter [1]. Standard phase transitions, at a transition
temperature T, # 0, can be treated classically, even those between different quantum
states. Quantum phase transitions, where the transition between two different phases
takes place at T,=0, are qualitatively different, as their critical fluctuations must be
treated quantum mechanically [2,3]. Great progress has been made in their
understanding, e.g. in the case of magnetic quantum phase transitions [4,5,6]. In a
large number of materials including pnictides, heavy fermions, charge or spin density
wave materials, the phase transition at 7, =0 as a function of a certain parameter 6
(pressure, doping, etc.) from an ordered, generally bad conductor, state to a
conducting disordered phase, is surrounded in the T — 6 plane by a superconducting
region (see Fig. 1). The central point is that there is a region where the ordered and
the superconducting state (SC) coexist. For charge density waves (CDW) this
coexistence has been studied by several groups [7,8,9]. In particular, Bilbro and
McMillan (BM)[8] studied the interaction of CDW and SC in A15 materials within
mean field. Here, both states compete for developing their respective gaps in the same
Fermi surface. They obtained the following relation between 7). , the superconducting
transition temperature, and Ty , the CDW transition temperature,
To "°(P)T.”°(P) = Tema (1)
where ”, is the fraction of the Fermi surface under the CDW gap and 7, the
superconducting transition with no CDW.
Different works have shown that under pressure there are clearly two regimes
for the evolution of 7, on its way to the QCP. First a classical BCS at low pressures
one and then a quantum fluctuations (QF) one near the QCP. For example, both the

one dimensional transition metal trichalcogenide NbSe,, a well-studied charge
density wave (CDW) compound [10,11,12] and Cr metal [13] display, at low
pressures, an decrease of 7, following an exponential with pressure BCS tuned
variation, consequence of the dependence of Tgwith the coupling parameter / , 1.e.
Tg~e~/* _ A quantum region appears below a crossover value of 7, where QF take
control through a power law behavior with an exponent y= '4 (See the behavior of
Ago 33¥20. on Fig. 1).
It is clear that Eq. (1) can only be applied in the BCS régime and is that not valid in
the QF region. However, at least for CDW and SDW materials, a direct relation
between 7, and 7. describing that both states are the result of the same Fermi surface
and electron-phonon interaction is expected and needed. In order to have a hint
towards it, an analysis of how the BM relation works experimentally is clarifying.
In A-15 compounds, ”“%) ~ some 10%'s and changes only a few percents in the
measured pressure range [8]. Considering then ”, approximately constant in the
pressure range, expression (1) becomes,

a, (2).
We see from Fig. 2 where the variation with pressure of both transition temperatures
for the two most studied A-15 compounds, V,Si and Nb,Sn is plotted as logarithms,
that expression (2) is verified, “) being constant within experimental error, and 0.26
for V,Si and 0.14 for Nb,Sn; the obtained Tosi, OE 17.7K and 20.1K for V;Si and
Nb,Sn , respectively. Experimentally we InT,,(P) = InT,,(0) + a,,P have , a, being a
constant and x either c or 0. The logarithmic variation with pressure of both transition
temperatures is the result of the exponentially tuned BCS expression. In other words,
at all the shown pressures, both transitions without any doubt obey BCS statistics.

However, as described above, the CDW/SDW transition deviates from the
exponentially tuned BCS behavior towards a power law dependence of the type
(6,-6)]*/2 ; 7
To & [e—| near to the QCP. It is apparent that the transition temperature does
not more follow BCS statistics, but another possibly due to the QF near the QCP. QF
accelerate the rhythm of decrease of To, destabilizing the CDW/SDW and, at the same
time, inducing a faster transfer of carriers from the CDW/SDW gap to the SC gap.
Equation (1) is thus no longer valid. Phenomenologically, expression (1) adds the
variations of the 7's using the functional that is linear with pressure, which in the
BCS régime is the logarithm of the transition temperature. The same approach may be
taken for the power law régime. Thus, instead of the logarithms, as now
[To /Tp(0)|* = 1—P/P. , the squares of the transition temperatures should be added
and equated to a constant. It is thus expected that the equivalent of BM for the power
law region would be a summation of squares of the type
aTy’ + bT.2 =k (3)
To advance further in obtaining a BM formula for the quantum régime, it 1s useful to
take into account the SO(5) formulation. In the paper [14] on SO(5), it was argued
that the simplest way to construct an unified theory of antiferromagnetism and
superconductivity for cuprates was to define a five dimensional spinor composed by
the three components of the magnetization and the real and imaginary part of the d-
wave superconducting gap. In this way, it would be possible to recover all the
relevant physics of the problem of high temperatures superconducting cuprates[15].
More complicated problems would require higher dimensions spinors to obtain all the
physics, i.e. the complete phase diagram with all the possible ground states, e.g.
SO(8) for a two chains model of correlated fermions[16]. However, experimentalists
can be less ambitious, and just try to describe phenomenologically with the most

compact expression a restricted region of the phase diagram, e.g. the one near to QCP.
Basically, there are two coexisting phases. The ordered phase should rigorously have
several components. However, systems with presumed different number of
components, show the same behavior near the QCP. SO(5) and SO(4) has been
successfully used to explain properties of the Co doped BaFe,As, system[17], and
the Beechgard salt[18] (TMTTF), PF, , respectively. Thus, just one component for the
ordered phase may be enough for this portion of the phase diagram. A similar
reasoning can be used for the superconducting phase, that may also be accounted by
one component. The actual formula is suggested by expression (3). It is (Fig. 3a)

To) (6) can be calculated. The

the dependence of T,(6) = a —
normalization to To (5,,) is a way to apply the formula only to the actual region of
coexistence of the ordered and superconducting phase (Fig. 3b). Thus, the dependence
of To(6) determines that of T,(6). The satisfactory application of the formula is also
shown for the examples on Fig. 1.
For 6 > 6, the dependence of Tg is naturally extended to negative values (low-right
quadrant of Fig. 3a), and its module is used in the determination of 7. . In the case of
magnetic QCP's, this extension can be associated to the crossover or coherence line,
below which the system recovers normal Fermi liquid properties. It follows the power
law T,con~ ( c /,5.) [6], where v is the correlation length exponent and z the

dynamical exponent. As for low dimensions vz = wW is often valid, 1.e. both Tp = Ty
and Tcoh should follow the same power law. On the other hand, for CDW-s, a negative
Tg can be traced to the soft phonon that exists even with values of 6 that hinder the
occurrence of the lattice distortion[19,20]. In other words, the interaction, responsible
for the ordering, does not obviously disappears when Tg = 0, and the extrapolation to
negatives values of Ty is an approximation to its magnitude.
In fact, already a study of the antiferromagnetic QCP, considering that
superconductivity is due to spin fluctuations caused by its criticality, arrives at a
formula of similar nature by derivation of the lines of constant coherence lengths [21]

max. (7). In the case of a T, (7.,,) with a critical exponent

w = 1 (vz = 1), expressions (4) and (7) are almost identical. It is clear that the type
of analysis done on Ref. 21 can be a way for the understanding of superconducting
domes around QCP's of different nature.
In conclusion, a formula equivalent to the Bilbro-McMillan expression for
coexistence between a charge density wave and superconductivity but applicable to
the quantum fluctuations controlled regions of the phase diagram is proposed to
describe the superconducting domes that appear around quantum critical points. It is
shown that it describes phenomenologically the observed behavior for several
systems.
