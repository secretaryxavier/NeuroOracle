Dynamic Remodeling of the 
Host Cell Membrane by Virulent 
Mycobacterial Sulfoglycolipid-1

Lipids dictate membrane properties to modulate lateral membrane organization, lipid/protein diơusion 
and lipid-protein interactions, thereby underpinning proper functioning of cells. Mycobacterium 
tuberculosis harnesses the power of its atypical cell wall lipids to impact immune surveillance machinery 
centered at the host cell membrane. However, the role of speciƤc virulent lipids in altering host cellular 
functions by modulating membrane organization and the associated signaling response are still 
pertinent unresolved questions. Here, combining membrane biophysics and cell biology, we elucidate 
how virulent Mtb sulfoglycolipids hijack the host cell membrane, aơecting its order, ƪuidity, and 
stiơness along with manipulating the linked cytoskeleton. The functional outcome of this perturbation 
was assayed by monitoring membrane-associated autophagy signaling. These actions form a part of 
the overall response to commandeer host membrane-associated immune processes during infection. 
The Ƥndings on the mechanism of action of Mtb lipids on host cell membrane structure and downstream 
signaling will deepen the collective understanding of their functional aspects in membrane-dictated 
bacterial survival, pathogenesis and drug resistance and reveal suitable membrane driven-therapeutic 
intervention points and diagnostic tools.
Te emergence of antibiotic resistance in general and in tuberculosis has created an unmet need to identify novel 
drug targets and requires understanding of the intricate web of host-pathogen interactions during the infectious 
process1. Virulence factors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) are multifaceted, enabling circumvention of a 
dedicated immune response2. Herein—next to proteins—structurally complex atypical lipids are also utilized 
as central eﬀectors in pathogenesis3–7. However, despite progress demonstrating the contribution of Mtb lipids 
to pathogenicity, relatively little is known about their mechanism of action, and more speciﬁcally, how these 
lipids interact with the host cell at the molecular level. Te cell membrane of host immune cells is the ﬁrst bar-
rier against many pathogens and is targeted by their various evolved strategies focused towards cellular entry/
exit as well as promotion of survival and infection8. Te exhaustively studied bacterial lipid-centric mechanism 
in host-pathogen interaction is the functional outcome of the recognition of lipids as molecular signatures by 
speciﬁc host cell receptors. For example, trehalose motif of Mtb trehalose dimycolate (TDM) is recognized by 
the calcium dependent C-type lectin receptors (CLR), Mincle, triggering pro-inﬂammatory cytokine produc-
tion9. Contrastingly, mannosylated moieties from mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (LAM) are recognized 
by mannose and DG-SIGN receptors initiating anti-inﬂammatory signaling cascade that permits Mtb to evade 
immune detection10.
More recently the indirect mechanism of perturbing host cell function by Mtb lipids propose their inser-
tion into the host membranes impairing their biophysical properties and leading to altered activities of 
membrane-bound eﬀectors and modulated membrane-associated signaling3,11. In general, optimal membrane 
biophysical properties precede normal cellular functions, and thus have been subsequently manipulated by path-
ogens12–14. For example, Mtb lipid LAM has been shown to insert within the raf domains of the host cell mem-
brane, modulate activities of associated eﬀector kinases that prevent phagosome maturation and down-regulate 
autophagy activity5,15,16. In vitro biophysical studies on solid supported membranes furnished that incorpora-
tion of LAM in membranes modiﬁes the morphology of the cholesterol-enriched domains and prevents vesicle 
fusion17. Surprisingly, which biophysical membrane properties are altered upon LAM incorporation still remains 
unknown. Similarly, TDM has been shown to insert into model and natural membranes wherein it decreases 
membrane ﬂuidity and enhances permeability18. TDM also has been demonstrated to inhibit calcium-induced

vesicle fusion, and thus implicated towards the inhibition of phagosome maturation19. On the other hand, inser-
tion of glycopeptidolipids (GPL) increase membrane permeability with minor eﬀect on ﬂuidity18. Structurally 
unrelated Mtb virulent lipid, phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) has been shown to decrease membrane polar-
ity, interpreted as changes in lipid organization in the host cell membrane leading to increased rigidity11. Later in 
an independent study, these PDIM coordinated changes were correlated to induction of host cell death via necro-
sis4, even though the molecular mechanism of this membrane reorganization, direct visualization of the same and 
how that is linked to PDIM-induced host cellular response remains to be elucidated.
Collectively, the data underlines a plausible “host cell membrane insertion” mode of action of Mtb lipids either 
alone or in conjunction with other factors to facilitate infection. However, direct correlations between pathogenic 
lipids, the host cell membrane and the associated signaling response have not been addressed before. Moreover, 
the data also highlights a unique pattern of interaction of structurally diverse Mtb lipids with host cell membrane 
that leads to distinct eﬀects including altered membrane ﬂuidity, permeability, reorganization of lipid domains, 
and disruption of bilayer ordering. Given this progress, little is known about the most abundant sulfatide in 
the Mtb outer membrane, Sulfoglycolipid-1, SL-1 (Fig. 1A), a tetra-acylated trehalose-based lipid. It is uniquely 
expressed in pathogenic mycobacteria with its cellular abundance correlating with the strain virulence. It has been 
demonstrated to be released from the membrane surface of Mtb, thus qualifying as a plausible virulence factor to 
infect the host cells20–22. SL-1 has been proposed to modify phagosome-lysosome fusion, disrupt mitochondrial 
phosphorylation and activate as well as suppress cytokine levels in human leukocytes, ofen leading to conﬂicting 
results20. To directly address the role of SL-1 in tweaking host cell membrane, we characterized the biophysical,

nanomechanical and cell biological properties of live THP-1 macrophage cell membranes upon interaction with 
SL-1. In this work, SL-1 was used at a concentration range that is physiologically relevant in context of the amount 
of these lipids present within the extractable pool of lipids in the outer bacterial cell membrane23. Our results 
show that the SL-1 remodels the cell membrane’s architecture, alters its nanomechanical properties and aﬀects 
membrane ﬂuidity. Te eﬀect percolates to the actin cytoskeleton underneath the membrane, and ﬁnally leads to 
activated autophagy signaling. Tis result aligns with the work by Lee et al., that revealed direct engagement of 
total Mtb lipids and not proteins from diﬀerent bacterial strains in tempering with host autophagy24.
Taken together, we probed various aspects of host cell membrane-lipid interactions to generate a framework 
for improving our understanding of the role of Mtb lipids in hijacking the “host cell membrane” and manipu-
lating the same to commandeer host membrane–associated processes. Tese results reinforce that an in-depth 
understanding of Mtb lipid-host membrane interactions, guided designs of structural analogs of lipids and 
well-described steps of membrane modulation, together, holds a promise as a lipid-based therapy. Tis approach 
also has the potential to avoid occurrence of resistant phenotype by virtue of targeting specific membrane 
properties.
Results
SL-1 mediates remodeling of the macrophage cell membrane ƪuidity. 
Te lateral organization of 
cellular membrane is highly complex and displays varying levels of heterogeneity in lipid packing. Accumulating 
evidence suggests existence of liquid ordered cholesterol-enriched (lo) lipid raf domains alongside less organized 
more ﬂuid liquid disordered (ld) regions in cellular membranes, potentially regulating various cellular functions 
such as signal transduction25–27. To assess the role of SL-1 in regulating cell membrane properties, we performed 
quantitative imaging of lipid membrane order in the cell membranes of live THP-1 macrophages using a polar-
ity-sensitive probe, Laurdan, and two photon microscopy. Visualization of ordered (peak emission λ ~ 440 nm) 
and disordered ﬂuid membrane regions (peak emission λ ~ 490 nm) was rendered by probing the degree of lipid 
packing, using the ratiometric measure of two emission regions known as generalized polarization, GP (Eq. 1)28. 
Collective data from model and cell membranes have shown that the ﬂuid ld regions have average GP values from 
~−0.05 to 0.25 and lo ordered regions vary from 0.25 to 0.5529,30. Pseudo-colored GP images of control THP-1 
macrophages (Fig. 1B) showed, a heterogeneous membrane lipid order distribution with irregularly distributed 
high GP areas (colored red to orange). Tese areas do not represent single membrane domains, but rather cellu-
lar areas in which the fraction of ordered lipid domains is higher. Moreover, in the complex environment of cell 
membranes, GP values only reﬂect the overall membrane structure. Tese structures could also correspond to 
lipid droplets enriched in saturated lipids and cholesteryl esters and hence display high lipid order and GP values 
(see below)31. Global GP histogram of control membranes displayed a bimodal distribution centered at distinct 
GP values (C1 = 0.01, and C2 = +0.54, Table S1), indicative of co-existing ﬂuid (46% coverage) and ordered (54% 
coverage) membrane regions (Fig. 1C): the latter likely to have contribution from plasma membrane due to the 
presence of cholesterol, compared with intracellular membranes.
Addition of SL-1 leads to a concentration-dependent perturbation of the cell membrane order. Overall 
membrane ﬂuidization was evident (Figs 1B and S1A) and was also supported by the shif of the global GP 
distribution to lower values (Fig. 1C). The high GP domains/regions were reduced/re-distributed in a 
concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). From the global GP distribution, the mean GP values for ﬂuid and 
ordered membrane regions decreased to −0.10 (C1, 85% coverage) and 0.42 (C2, 15% coverage, Table S1), respec-
tively. Tus, ordered regions became less abundant and less ordered, indicating membrane de-condensation, 
while the ﬂuid regions became more abundant and more ﬂuid in nature upon SL-1 interaction. Additionally, the 
formation of distinct domains with outer ring-like structures of relatively higher GP (than inside) was visible on 
cell membrane, plausibly reﬂecting selective lipid phase separation/de-mixing induced by SL-1 (Fig. 1B, inset). 
For better observation of GP changes, the diﬀerence GP distribution was plotted, which showed a SL-1 depend-
ent decrease in GP values for ordered regions from ≈+0.1 to +0.75, and a minor increase was observed for 
disordered regions from ≈−0.1 to −0.8 (Fig. S1B). Tese regions could possibly correspond to the GP intervals 
reported for lo (raf-like), ld (non-raf), pure ﬂuid (<−0.05) and gel (>+0.55) phases, respectively. A multimodal 
GP distribution, especially at the highest tested SL-1 concentration, could reﬂect the existence of these lipid 
phases in THP-1 macrophage membranes (Fig. S1C) and reﬂect ﬁne-tuning of host cell membrane organization 
between rigid and ﬂuid lipid phases with varying membrane order and ﬂuidity upon bacterial lipid perturbation. 
Previous studies on THP-1 cells have revealed signiﬁcant augmentation in the number and reorganization of 
rigid lipid domains under oxidative stress32. We thus hypothesize that the decreasing GP population corresponds 
mostly to disappearance of the ordered lo domains. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent studies also support 
a signiﬁcant loss of ordered membrane regions upon SL-1 interaction, displaying lower temperature sensitivity 
(Fig. S2). Te minor increase of the low GP value population could either correspond to de-novo de-condensation 
or redistribution of ﬂuid membrane regions.
Next, we analyzed the contribution originating from cell plasma membrane (PM) within the global GP 
changes, as Laurdan can also internalize and stain intracellular membranes. Laurdan GP images for THP-1 mac-
rophages made it diﬃcult to extract GP pixels corresponding to PM by simple visual inspection, mostly stemming 
from their morphology. Tus, we performed spectral imaging of cells coupled with PM segmentation to remove 
the cytosolic contribution of the internalized dyes33. GP distribution corresponding to the plasma membrane 
showed a unimodal distribution upon SL-1 interaction with loss of high GP regions, suggesting ﬂuidization/
reorganization of the cell plasma membrane by SL-1 (Figs 1E,F and S1D). Te reduction in the ordered lipid 
domains corresponding to PM (2.3-fold) was lower than that observed with ordered lipid domains observed 
globally (3.6-fold). Tis indicates that SL-1 interaction does alter the membrane organization of host cell plasma 
membrane as well, though the eﬀect is minor (Fig. 1G). A decreased microviscosity of the cell plasma membrane, 
denoted by restricted rotational mobility of the TMA-DPH membrane probe was obtained supporting the GP

results (Fig. 1H). Orthogonally, using methyl-β cyclodextrin (MβCD) which causes cholesterol depletion from 
the cellular PM34 we identiﬁed that the ordered GP population discernible in the global GP distribution was most 
aﬀected by this treatment, leading to a shif to lower GP values with a signiﬁcant reduction of its surface coverage 
within 30 minutes of incubation (Fig. S3 and Table S2). Tis predominantly reﬂects the PM, where, as expected 
the lipid packing and order decreases upon cholesterol depletion. Tis indirectly suggests that the changes in the 
diﬀerence GP distribution (Fig. S1B) might correspond to the alterations induced by SL-1 in the host cell PM as 
well. Next, using the object segmentation program of the spectral imaging toolbox, we obtained a rather complex 
lipid environment of the circular membranous structures (Fig. 1B, inset and 1I) induced by SL-1, spanning a wide 
range of membrane order (Fig. 1J) compared with the control. Te highly ordered red domains on the control 
THP-1 cells seen in global GP imaging could also correspond to intracellular lipid droplets (plausibly seen due to 
Laurdan internalization), as demonstrated by quite intense staining with Nile red (Fig. 1K). SL-1 treatment caused 
a substantial reduction in the lipid droplets (including size), possibly explaining the drastic reduction of ordered 
GP pixels in global GP distribution (without aﬀecting the PM GP distribution much).
Altogether, these data indicate that SL-1-membrane interaction leads to a substantial redistribution of lipids 
and plausibly proteins, causing reorganization of lipid domains and hence the host cell membranes. SL-1–mem-
brane interaction evolved temporally with changes being observed as early as 30 min (Fig. 2 and Table S2). 
Initially, a transient clustering of ordered domains was seen, followed by their gradual decrease and within 
2 hours, the membrane displayed gross ﬂuidization with intermittent patterns of intermediate GP domains sur-
rounding more ordered regions. Tese observations are clearly indicative of dynamic alterations in the cell mem-
brane organization during host-pathogen crosstalk. Te eﬀect of SL-1 on the cell membrane organization was also 
found to be highly speciﬁc to this class of Mtb lipid compared with other virulent lipids such as PDIM and LAM 
(Figs 3A,B and S1D). PDIM did not cause any substantial change in the membrane ﬂuidity and organization, 
whereas, LAM led to minor ordering of the cell membrane surface with an associated increase in the coverage 
of the ordered membrane region (Fig. 3C). Tis could also be a manifestation of varying degree of membrane 
partitioning of the diﬀerent lipids. However, lipids with chain lengths greater than 18 carbon atoms have been 
shown to partition equally into phase segregated model membranes35. Tus, given that the major chain lengths 
in the investigated lipids are above C20, it might be reasonable to assume their similar incorporation eﬃciency 
into host membranes, with an only minor contribution, if any, to the observed phenotype. Tis underscores that 
the crosstalk of virulent lipids with the host cell membrane is highly selective and speciﬁc, leading to diﬀerential 
membrane re-organization with associated changes in membrane order and hydration, which till now remained 
unexplored.
Nanomechanical cell membrane properties and membrane tether formation are perturbed by SL-1.  
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a versatile tool for mapping the nanomechanical properties of cell mem-
branes. Membrane stiﬀness, especially, is reported to regulate a plethora of cellular processes, including diﬀeren-
tiation, migration, proliferation, and is markedly altered in diseased states12,13. Te analysis of the cortical stiﬀness 
of THP-1 macrophages revealed a signiﬁcant sofening upon SL-1 interaction (Fig. 4A, median elastic modulus 
of 1.74 kPa and 1.44 kPa for control and SL-1 treated cells, respectively; P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Tese 
results suggest SL-1 perturbs the cell mechanical property via reduction in membrane order, increase in hydration 
and inducing cell cortical sofening. Next, we investigated membrane tethers or nanotubes which are important 
regulators of cellular adhesion and communication and owe their existence to the highly dynamic PM36. Te 
single-tether force distribution for SL-1 treated cells showed a signiﬁcant reduction (13%) in the median tether 
force (74.4 pN) when compared with the control (85.7 pN) (Fig. 4B; P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test). Tis indi-
cates that SL-1-treated cell membrane tethers require less force to be extended, and hence their surface tension 
or bending rigidity/elastic modulus is smaller. Te number of tethers per cell increased upon SL-1 treatment 
(Fig. 4C) with a median centered at 5.0 and 7.0(P < 0.05, Mann-Whitney test) for control and SL-1 treated cells, 
respectively. Furthermore, a reduction in the total extension of the last tether (i.e. tether length) was observed 
(Fig. 4D), 6.2 ± 0.2 μm in control and 5.2 ± 0.1 μm in SL-1 treated (mean ± SEM, P < 0.001, t-test). All these 
results point towards the cell membrane being more susceptible to tether formation governed by the eﬀect of SL-1 
on the cell mechanical properties coupled with a decreased lipid ordering as revealed by the Laurdan ﬂuorescence 
studies (Fig. S1A).
Modulation of actin cytoskeletal organization by SL-1. 
Various pathogens actively interfere with 
the actin cytoskeleton to trigger uptake37. Pathogenic mycobacteria disrupts the actin cytoskeleton by induc-
ing its rearrangement and fragmentation. However, the exact mechanism is still unknown, and the identity of 
implicated moieties remain obscure38. Various studies have highlighted intimate crosstalk of the cell’s PM and 
the underlying actin ﬁlaments attuning many physiological processes37,39. Given these facts and our observation 
of dynamic reshaping of the host cell membrane, we investigated the eﬀect of SL-1-membrane interaction on the 
actin cytoskeleton in THP-1 macrophages. Untreated cells displayed (Fig. 5A) at least three distinct actin mor-
phologies40 – (a) thin actin ﬁlaments, 87.3 ± 2.1%, (b) F-actin cortical patches, 1.6 ± 0.3% and (c) actin punctate 
structures, 11.2 ± 1.9% (data are mean ± SEM). Incubation of cells with SL-1 led to a concentration-dependent 
increase and decrease in actin puncta and ﬁlamentous actin, respectively. Te actin patches showed a non-linear 
response with maxima centered at the lowest SL-1 concentration tested, suggesting a transient increase in the 
actin patches followed by subsequent fragmentation forming punctate structures of actin (Fig. 5B). Tus, it is 
tempting to speculate that the pool of actin patches might act as a reservoir for the redistribution of actin into 
various morphologies under selective perturbation, in this case, SL-1-membrane interaction. Altogether, it can 
be clearly seen that the SL-1-host membrane interaction profoundly aﬀects the actin cytoskeleton underneath the 
cell PM without aﬀecting the cell viability (Fig. S4).

SL-1 activates host-autophagy signaling. 
SL-1 interaction with the macrophage cell membrane led to 
prominent changes in the membrane biophysical properties. Hence, we characterized the diﬀerences between the 
membrane-associated signaling pathways—potentially dictated by cell membrane properties. Te stress-response 
autophagy pathway—dependent upon actin and ordered lipid domains—detects intracellular pathogens, and 
various Mtb virulent strains have been documented to impair the same24. Intriguingly, SL-1 belongs to the family 
of sulfatides, the ﬁrst ever reported Mtb component to inhibit generic phagosome-lysosome fusion and acidiﬁ-
cation, similar to that observed for a well characterized glycolipid man-LAM40. SL-1 was recently shown to act 
as a TLR-2 antagonist and perturb pattern-recognition-receptor host signaling pathways such as NF-κB and 
IFN21. Tese ﬁndings implicate SL-1 to perturb host cellular signaling. Tus, we sought to characterize the eﬀect 
of SL-1 on the host autophagy-signaling pathway using a cell-based ﬂuorescence assay employing LC3-green 
ﬂuorescent protein (GFP). Control cells exhibited a minor abundance of LC3-GFP puncta/cell characteristic of 
low basal autophagy activity (Fig. 6A). SL-1 induced a signiﬁcant increase (≈9.3 fold)in the LC3-GFP puncta 
in a concentration–dependent manner, indicative of activated autophagy-signaling (Fig. 6B; P < 0.0001). Tus, 
SL-1 communication with macrophage cell membranes potentially leads to activation of membrane-associated 
autophagy-signaling.

Discussion
Cellular membranes are highly heterogeneous structures with their biological properties intimately coded by 
their biophysical characteristics. One such characteristic parameter essential for cellular function is membrane 
ﬂuidity categorizing relative motion of molecules within the membrane. Lipid domains of distinct compositions 
spatially regulate membrane ﬂuidity and inﬂuentially control lipid-protein sequestration. Tey generate func-
tionally relevant platforms within the membrane and modulate the nature of downstream signaling. Alterations 
in membrane ﬂuidity play a critical role in the regulation of membrane properties under physiological condi-
tions and importantly in diseases. As such, evaluating membrane ﬂuidity is imperative for understanding the 
membrane-dependent mechanisms governing various cellular processes including signaling. Evidence under-
pinning the indispensable involvement of speciﬁc lipid moieties in diseases is emergent41,42. Lipids are attractive 
targets exploited throughout evolution by pathogens43,44. Among them, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the 
causative agent for tuberculosis aptly exempliﬁes the use of lipids as central eﬀectors in pathogenesis44, with the 
host cell plasma membrane as its ﬁrst point of contact. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of their 
interaction with host cell membranes and the consequent modulation of membrane-associated signaling are not 
well understood. Tus, characterizing the molecular biophysical and cellular mechanisms underlying the cross-
talk between virulent lipids and the host cell membrane along with integrated signaling is expected to deepen our 
understanding of the host-pathogen interactions.
In this work, we have investigated the eﬀect of the virulent Mtb sulfoglycolipid, SL-1 on the physical and 
cell biological properties of the THP-1 macrophage cellular membranes. Te work uncovers molecular mech-
anisms by which pathogen regulates the host cell membrane’s physical properties with associated alteration in 
host membrane-associated processes during infection. Using Laurdan Generalized Polarization microscopy we 
show that THP-1 cell membranes are heterogeneous. Te distribution of GP values clearly shows the co-existence 
of ordered and disordered ﬂuid regions in THP-1 cells. SL-1 from within the pool of exposed lipids on the outer 
Mtb cell envelope triggers remodeling of the THP-1 cell membrane in a time and concentration-dependent man-
ner. Te membrane reorganization was associated with increased membrane ﬂuidity synonymous with higher 
hydration at the membrane interface (both globally and in PM regions) along with less restricted rotational and 
translational diﬀusion. SL-1 mediated membrane reorganization led to selective demixing of lipids and decreased

the ordered regions of the cell membrane. Tese provide functional support to previous ﬁndings that show SL-1 
to impede the innate immune response by inhibiting TLR2 and TLR1/6 heterodimers21, which reside within 
the raf-like lipid domains in the PM45. Surprisingly, though a dipalmitoylated SL-1 is suﬃcient to inhibit TLR 
signaling21, the functional role of longer and branched fatty acyl chains of SL-1 remains elusive. We hypothesize 
that these fatty acid chains ﬁne-tune the host cell membrane properties, as the structure of these chains critically 
guide the partitioning location and kinetics of their membrane insertion. Tis would eventually modulate various 
cellular responses such as decreased TLR activity, upregulated reactive oxygen species production, and altered 
protein phosphorylation patterns. In this respect, investigations into the ﬁne structure of acyl chain conformation 
and dynamics and its biophysical properties would help understand the SL-1 host cell membrane interaction in a 
more detailed manner. Finally, SL-1 reduced the highly ordered lipid droplet accumulation within the cell.
We found that the decoded pattern of membrane reorganization is selective to SL-1, as other Mtb virulent 
lipids failed to recapitulate similar eﬀects. Tis is in well conformity with previous studies showing strain-speciﬁc 
Mtb lipids linked to variable cellular responses, e.g., man-LAM reduces phagosome-lysosome fusion and apop-
tosis, and reorganizes membrane domains to disrupt of membrane-associated signaling15,46. By contrast, LAM 
counteracts some of the eﬀects of man-LAM, and PILAM, and activates host apoptotic response instead. Taken 
together, these reports highlight that the structurally diverse Mtb lipids act as highly selective modulators of 
membrane properties and signaling pathways in host cells. Next, our AFM investigations demonstrated a more 
compliant cell membrane of SL-1 treated cells. Membrane tethers akin to nanotubes are involved in various cel-
lular functions, especially in immunoregulation36. SL-1 led to a signiﬁcant decrease in the tether force, implying 
either alterations in bending stiﬀness, in-plane membrane tension or membrane-cytoskeleton interactions. As

the number of tethers per cell increased upon SL-1 treatment, it entails a reduced resistance of the membrane to 
bend. Furthermore, generation of membrane tethers involves induction of highly positive and negative curved 
membrane phases around the circumference and at the base, respectively. Te structural aspect of SL-1, i.e., 
the likely inverted cone-shape of the molecule, may foster formation of highly curved regions at the site of cell 
membrane insertion, thus leading to more frequent membrane nanotube generation. Such SL-1induced de novo 
curved membrane regions are expected to have unique lipid order and hydration47 and hence may account for the 
distinct global GP distribution patterns. It is well known that lipid raf domains are involved in connecting actin 
to the cell membrane39. Tus we investigated the correlation between the decreasing lo regions in SL-1 treated cell 
membrane and the actin rearrangement. We observed a marked disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton under-
neath the PM by SL-1 without any eﬀect on the cell viability. Te most salient feature were the disappearance of 
ﬁlamentous actin, and appearance of actin punctate structures in accordance with previous studies using intact 
bacteria38. Head-to-head comparisons with previous studies on PM-cytoskeleton will distinguish the interactions 
regulated by pathogen invasion and lead to new mechanism grounded rationale for therapeutic targeting.
Finally, the aforementioned changes in the biophysical properties and morphology of the PM and actin 
cytoskeleton, respectively, led to signiﬁcant alterations in a central membrane-associated process – autophagy. 
Autophagy endows cells with the ability to eliminate toxic cellular material and plays decisive roles in innate 
immunity48. As a result, pathogenic organisms including Mtb have evolved precise mechanisms to tweak host 
autophagy24. We found that the autophagy activity was considerably increased afer SL-1 treatment. In light of our 
ﬁndings, one could hypothesize that TLR2/6 antagonist SL-1 triggers host cell autophagy to generate a protective 
niche preventing their detection and enhanced survival. A recent report showed that a decreased plasma mem-
brane tension (similar to that induced by SL-1) triggers PI(4,5)P2 lipid phase separation driving the inactivation

PM to actin ﬁlaments, co-localizes with lipid raf markers and is strongly implicated in host-pathogen interac-
tions; it’s involvement in SL-1–mediated eﬀect remains unexplored44.
To conclude, our data highlights lipid molecules as highly efficient effectors of pathogenesis―next 
to proteins. Te data indicates that virulent SL-1 lipid present in the extractable lipid pool on the surface of 
pathogenic mycobacteria is intimately involved in host cell membrane interactions and subsequently aﬀects 
membrane-associated downstream cellular functions. The proposed role of SL-1 is multifaceted and our 
findings establish a novel and prominent role for SL-1 in modulating specific biophysical properties of the 
host cell membrane such as ﬂuidity, hydration and lipid domain re-organization, and eventually activating 
membrane-associated autophagy signaling. Notwithstanding, SL-1 possesses a high potential for developing 
anti-tuberculosis therapeutic approaches and demands a deepened molecular understanding of its mode of action 
coupled with identiﬁcation of host mediators as potential targets.
Methods and Materials
Laurdan generalized polarization imaging. 
THP-1 cells were seeded in glass bottom dishes and dif-
ferentiated using 20 nM PMA for 72 h. Cells were treated with SL-1 at the indicated concentrations and time at 
37 °C and 5% CO2 followed by washing with phosphate buﬀer saline (PBS) and addition of 5 μM Laurdan for 
45 min. Prior to imaging, cells were washed and imaged on a laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, 
Germany) with excitation at 780 nm with a multi-photon laser (Titanium sapphire, Coherent Radiation, CA).Two 
simultaneous emission images were recorded in the range of 400–460 nm and 470–530 nm. Calibration images 
(to calculate G factor) were measured using 5 μM Laurdan solution in DMSO. Pseudo-coloured GP images were 
constructed using a custom-made Matlab program described as following:

GP values are given in a range of −1.0 (high ﬂuidity) to +1.0 (lowest ﬂuidity, ordered phase) using a custom 
colour palette. Te stacks of confocal images were converted to binary images (with background 0 and intensities 
above background set to 1), threshold were set and then multiplied with the respective GP images. All GP images 
were corrected using the G-factor as mentioned above. Laurdan pixeled counts were obtained from the Matlab 
based-macro and GP distributions were obtained from the histogram of the GP images, which were ﬁtted to 
Gaussian functions using Origin Sofware (Origin Pro.9.1).
Immunoƪuorescence confocal microscopy. 
Afer treatment of diﬀerentiated THP-1 cells with SL-1, 
cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature (RT) and rinsed with PBS. Ten, 
cells were permeabilized followed by blocking in 1% BSA for 1 h, rinsed with PBS/PBST. TRITC-Phalloidin 
(Invitrogen) was used to stain F-actin (2 μg/mL) for 30 min in dark, rinsed thoroughly with PBS and DAPI 
(Invitrogen, 12 μg/mL) was added. Images were taken on Laser scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss) 
using a 63X/1.4NA objective. All post-acquisition image analysis for quantitating F-actin structures was done 
using ImageJ. For autophagy, brieﬂy, diﬀerentiated cells were transiently transfected with p-GFP-LC3 plasmid 
using lipofectamine-3000 for 24 h followed by treatment with indicated concentrations of SL-1 for 4 h. GFP-LC3 
(puncta) were quantiﬁed using ImageJ. Statistical analysis was performed using two-tailed Student’s t-test in 
GraphPad Prism 5.0, unless indicated otherwise. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences: *p < 0.01; **p < 0.005; ***p < 0.0001. 
For complete cell culture conditions, transfection and lipid suspension preparation please see SI.
Fluorescence spectroscopy. 
Laurdan (6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethylaminonaphthalene) and TMA-DPH 
(1-(4-trimethylammoniumphenyl)-6-Phenyl-1, 3, 5 p-toluene sulfonate) hexatriene were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich and Cayman Chemicals, respectively. Laurdan and TMA-DPH were dissolved in DMSO. 105 
cells were ﬁrst treated with SL-1 for 2 hours and then trypsinized and suspended in PBS buﬀer and labeled with 
Laurdan (5 µM) or TMA-DPH (4 µM) at RT for 20 min, followed by washing (5000 rpm, 5 minutes) with PBS. Te 
ﬂuorescence spectroscopic measurements were performed on a Varian Eclipse ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer 
with a temperature controller having an accuracy of ±0.1 °C. Te temperature of the cuvette holder was adjusted 
to 37 °C by a circulating water bath. Laurdan was excited at 350 nm and TMA-DPH was excited at 352 nm.
For ﬂuorescence anisotropy measurements, intensities at 440 nm and 430 nm for Laurdan and TMA-DPH, 
respectively, were measured with excitation and emission polarizer parallel to each other (both at 0°, I0) and 
polarizer perpendicular (excitation: 0°, emission: 90°, I90). Te anisotropy was calculated according to Eq. (3),

Atomic force microscopy. 
Force spectroscopy was performed in contact mode with MFP-3D atomic force 
microscope (Asylum Research) and silicon nitride cantilevers (Oxford Instruments) having nominal resonance 
frequency and spring constant 22 kHz and 0.16 N/m, respectively. Te cantilever was calibrated using the thermal 
noise method (spring constant of 0.10–0.19 N/m). Te applied load was 60 nN and the cantilever velocity was 
ﬁxed at 2 µm/s. THP-1 cells were incubated with SL-1 suspension (4.16 µM) for 2 h followed by recording of the 
force curves. Elastic modulus was estimated using the Hertz model, Igor sofware (Asylum research). For analysis 
of membrane tethers (tether force, tether number and lengths), a reported custom-made Matlab program was 
used9. (for details, see the SI).
Statistics and reproducibility. 
Te sample sizes and statistical tests were selected based on previous 
studies with similar methodologies. All experiments were repeated at least three times (AFM experiments were 
conducted twice due to limited SL-1 amount), giving similar results. Te results of independent experiments 
are presented as mean or median values; error bars represent SEM. Statistical signiﬁcance was tested using 
either using unpaired two-tailed t-test for all data showing normal distribution. AFM results demonstrated a 
non-normal distribution (Fig. 4A–C) and thus were statistically compared using non-parametric unpaired 
Mann-Whitney test to compare medians. All data with a P value < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant.
