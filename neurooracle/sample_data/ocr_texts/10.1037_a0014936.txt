Abstract
Longitudinal patterns of functional deficits were investigated in 37 children with severe traumatic
brain injuries (TBI), 40 children with moderate TBI, and 44 children with orthopedic injuries (OI).
They were from 6 to 12 years of age when injured. Their neuropsychological, behavioral, adaptive,
and academic functioning was assessed at 6 months, 12 months, and 3-5 years post injury. Functional
deficits (<10th percentile for age) were identified within each outcome domain at each occasion.
Children were classified into four a priori longitudinal patterns of outcomes within domains (i.e., no
deficits, improvement, deterioration, persistent deficits). In multinomial logistic regression analyses,
severe TBI predicted an increased likelihood of persistent deficits in all outcome domains, as well
as deterioration in behavioral functioning and improvement in neuropsychological, adaptive, and
academic functioning. Severe TBI also predicted a greater total number of functional deficits across
domains at each occasion. However, many children with severe TBI showed no deficits from 6
months to 4 years post injury in one or more outcome domains. The findings help to clarify the course
of recovery for individual children following TBI.

Predicting Longitudinal Patterns of Functional Deficits in Children with
Traumatic Brain Injury
Childhood traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with a variety of cognitive, behavioral,
adaptive, and academic performance deficits in school-age children. Numerous studies have
established persistent neuropsychological sequelae, higher incidences of post-injury
psychiatric, emotional, and behavioral problems, difficulties in adaptive functioning, and
academic performance deficits after moderate to severe TBI in children (Anderson et al.,
2005; Fay et al., 1994; Fletcher et al., 1990; Jaffe et al., 1995; Kinsella et al., 1995; Max et al.,
1997; Schwartz et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 1999, 2002; Yeates et al., 2001, 2002; Yeates &
Taylor, 2006).
As a group, children with TBI show distinct longitudinal patterns of change in cognitive,
academic, behavioral, and adaptive domains. Children with moderate to severe TBI generally
show significant improvement in their neuropsychological functioning during the first year
post injury, yet recovery often begins to plateau after the first year post injury, with negligible
rates of change appearing during the following 2 years post injury (Chadwick et al., 1981;
Jaffe et al., 1995). Persistent neuropsychological sequelae of childhood TBI continuing past 1
year post injury have also been documented (Chadwick et al., 1981; Jaffe et al., 1995; Kinsella
et al., 1995; Yeates et al., 2002).
Because recovery is a developmental process that occurs over time, new impairments may also
emerge (Anderson et al., 1997; Dennis et al., 1995). Long-term follow-up of children with
severe TBI suggests that behavioral, adaptive, and academic deficits often fail to resolve over
time, despite partial recovery in cognitive functions during the first year (Anderson et al.,
2005; Jaffe et al., 1995; Kinsella et al., 1999; Perrot et al., 1991; Schwartz et al., 2003; Taylor
et al., 1999, 2002; Yeates et al., 2002). Many studies have found evidence of deterioration in
behavioral adjustment across time and persistent post injury behavior problems in children
with TBI (Jaffe et al., 1995; Schwartz et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 1999, 2001). Adaptive
functioning also may decline during the first year post injury, particularly in the domain of
socialization (Anderson et al., 1997; Stancin et al., 2002). Yeates et al. (2001) demonstrated
that while cognitive and somatic symptoms declined during the first year post injury in children
with TBI, emotional and behavioral symptoms became more common. In addition, a number
of studies have demonstrated that initial improvements in academic skills may be most
prominent in children with severe TBI, with persisting or worsening functional deficits
emerging at later time points (Barry et al., 1996; Ewing-Cobbs et al., 1998; Jaffe et al., 1995;
Max et al., 1997).
Almost all previous studies on the outcomes of TBI have compared children with TBI to those
with injuries not involving the head or healthy children by testing the statistical significance
of mean differences between groups, rather than by examining the presence of functional
deficits in individual children. Very few studies have reported the proportion of individual
children who display significant functional deficits in specific outcome domains after TBI. The
few studies that have explored individual functional deficits in childhood TBI have focused
on behavioral and academic impairments. For example, Max et al. (1997) found that by the
second year post injury, 36% of children with moderate to severe TBI met criteria for a new
psychiatric disorder. Schwartz et al. (2003) found higher rates of clinically significant behavior
problems at 3 years post injury in children with moderate to severe TBI than in children with
orthopedic injuries. Similarly, Anderson et al. (2005) found that the percentage of moderate to
severe behavioral impairment in children with severe TBI increased from 4.8% immediately
post-injury to 34.6% by 30 months post-injury. Ewing-Cobbs et al. (1998) examined school
performance in children with severe TBI and found that 79% of the cohort had either repeated
a grade or were receiving special assistance in school by a two-year postinjury follow-up. In

addition, Taylor et al. (2003) investigated the rates of placement in special education programs
following TBI and found that half of the severe TBI group were in special education programs
several years post injury.
In the current study, we investigated longitudinal patterns of functional deficits in children with
moderate to severe TBI as compared to children with OI. Our study differs from most previous
research by focusing on individual children's performance across the broad array of domains
that are often examined by neuropsychologists in clinical practice, including behavioral and
adaptive functioning and academic and neuropsychological performance. Moreover, we did
not examine the statistical significance of group differences in means between children with
TBI and orthopedic injuries (OI) using a variable-centered approach, as past research has done
almost exclusively; instead, we adopted a person-centered approach and studied patterns of
functional deficits over time in individual children. Person- and variable-centered approaches
are associated with complementary analytic methods that conceptualize the organization of
longitudinal data differently. Both approaches contribute to the understanding of specific links
between predictors and outcomes, relations between individual positions on latent dimensions,
and patterns of individual development across time (Laursen & Hoff, 2006; Magnusson, 2003;
Bergman & Trost, 2006; von Eye & Bogat, 2006).
For our purposes, we identified individual patterns of functional deficits across time by
choosing a cutoff score. The use of a cutoff score was necessary to classify each child's
performance in terms of whether or not it represented a deficit that was atypical from a
normative perspective, and hence likely to be apparent in ‘real world’ functioning. No universal
agreement exists regarding the definition of functional deficits or clinically-relevant
impairments. Furthermore, cutoff scores unavoidably impose an arbitrary group structure on
continuous distributions (Francis et al., 2005). However, scores that fall below the tenth
percentile (i.e., ≤ −1.3 standard deviations) are often considered to represent significant
impairment or deficits in clinical neuropsychological practice (Hannay & Lezak, 2004; Golden
et al., 1991; Heaton et al., 1991). We thus defined a functional deficit in this manner for the
neuropsychological, academic, and adaptive domains, and in a similar manner for the behavior
domain (i.e., ≥ +1.3 standard deviations). We then classified children into four a priori
longitudinal patterns of outcomes within each domain: no deficits, persistent deficits,
improvement (initial deficit followed by no deficit), and deterioration (no initial deficit
followed by later deficit).
Based on previous research, we hypothesized that injury severity would be a predictor of
persistent individual deficits in all domains (Anderson et al., 1997, 2005; Fay et al., 1994; Jaffe
et al., 1995; Taylor et al., 1999). Because previous literature has shown declines in behavioral
functioning, we also hypothesized that children with moderate to severe TBI would be more
likely to demonstrate deterioration in behavioral functioning across time than children in the
OI group (Anderson et al., 2005; Max et al., 1997; Taylor et al., 2002; Yeates et al., 2001).
Finally, in accordance with previous research (Jaffe et al., 1995; Taylor et al., 2002), we
expected that improvements in neuropsychological and academic functioning would be more
common among children with severe TBI than those with OI.
Method
Study Design and Procedures
The study used a concurrent cohort-prospective design in which children 6 to 12 years of age
were followed for approximately 3 to 5 years post injury. The total sample included 109
children with TBI and 80 children with orthopedic injuries (OI) recruited from admissions to
four hospitals in North-Central Ohio between 1992 and 1995. Children who were admitted to
the hospital with a moderate to severe TBI or OI and who met criteria for inclusion were

contacted prospectively by the study coordinator at each site. An initial assessment was
completed on average 3 weeks post injury (mean interval 3.1 weeks, SD = 1.5). Children with
TBI had to demonstrate recovery from post-traumatic amnesia prior to any testing; only one
child was excluded because of persistent post-traumatic amnesia that did not resolve within
the necessary time frame, and that child was not testable because of a persistent vegetative
state. Estimates of childhood pre-injury behavioral and adaptive functioning and pre-injury
family functioning were obtained for both groups, based on retrospective parent ratings
collected during or shortly after hospitalization. Child and family outcomes were assessed 6
and 12 months after the initial evaluation, and again at an extended follow-up on average 4
years post injury (M = 4.16, SD = 0.91). Data included in this study were obtained in compliance
with the appropriate Institutional Review Boards.
Research Participants
Recruitment occurred after informed consent was obtained from the child's parent or guardian.
Participants were required to (a) be between 6 and 12 years of age at time of the injury, (b)
reside in an English speaking household, (c) be hospitalized for at least one night's duration
for either TBI or OI, and (d) have no evidence of child abuse or previous neurological disorder.
Children with TBI whose injuries did not fall into the general category of closed head injuries
were excluded (e.g., brain injury due to near drowning or toxic exposure, projectile wounds,
or stroke).
As reported previously (Taylor et al., 2002; Yeates et al., 2002), children with TBI were
classified into two severity groups. Severe TBI was defined on the basis of the lowest Glasgow
Coma Scale (GCS) score of 8 or less (Teasdale and Jennett, 1974). Moderate TBI was defined
in terms of a GCS score of 9-12 or a score greater than 12 accompanied by complications (i.e.,
skull fracture, intracranial mass lesion or contusion, diffuse cerebral swelling, post-traumatic
neurological abnormality, or documented loss of consciousness greater than 15 minutes).
Although many children in the TBI group had accompanying orthopedic injuries, the OI group
was limited to children without any symptoms suggestive of a possible central nervous system
insult (e.g., symptoms of concussion). Children with OI were chosen as a comparison group
to control for the effects of hospitalization as well as for premorbid characteristics that could
increase the risk of non-intentional injury. The severity of traumatic injuries that were sustained
by children in both groups was assessed using the Injury Severity Scale (ISS) (Mayer et al.,
1980; Taylor et al., 1999). The ISS is an anatomical scoring system that provides an overall
score for patients with multiple injuries. Each injury is assigned an Abbreviated Injury Scale
(AIS) score and is allocated to one of six body regions, including the head. Only the highest
AIS score for each body region is used. The scores for the three most severely injured body
regions are squared and summed together to produce the ISS score.
For the purposes of the current analysis, we included only children who completed all follow-
up assessments (6 months, 1 year, and 4 years post injury). No significant differences were
observed in age, gender, race, family composition, or severity of injury when comparing
children with TBI who returned for follow-up testing to those that did not. However, families
of children with TBI who did not return demonstrated a lower socioeconomic status. Among
children with OI, no significant differences in demographic characteristics were found between
those who returned for follow-up testing and those who did not. The final sample consisted of
37 children with severe TBI, 40 with moderate TBI, and 44 children with OI.
Table 1 summarizes the demographics characteristics of the three groups, which did not differ
in age at injury, gender, family composition, socioeconomic status, or time from injury to the
4 year follow-up testing. Children from the OI group were more likely to be of African
American ethnicity χ2 (1, N = 121) = 5.97. In addition, and as expected, the groups differed
significantly in duration of hospitalization (p < .05) and ISS (p < .01), with the severe TBI

group demonstrating the longest hospitalization stay and most severe injuries. The moderate
TBI group had a somewhat higher mean GCS score than might be expected, but included
children who in some studies would be classified as complicated mild TBI (i.e., GCS 13-15
but with extended loss of consciousness or abnormal neuroimaging).
Measures
Family functioning—Family measures included parent ratings of premorbid family
functioning and non-injury-related environmental stress, obtained at the baseline assessment,
as well as a composite measure of socioeconomic status. The 12-item General Functioning
Scale from the McMaster Family Assessment Device was used as a summary measure of family
functioning (FAD; Miller, et al., 1985; Stevenson-Hinde & Akister, 1995). Environmental
stress unrelated to the injury was measured using a composite derived from the Life Stressors
and Social Resources Inventory-Adult Form (LISRES-A; Moos & Moos, 1994). The
composite was an average of T scores for all stress subscales aside from those specific to the
child and to negative life events. Potential effects of the original injury on the latter two
subscales justified their exclusion. A Socioeconomic Composite Index (SCI) was computed
to provide a distal measure of the family environment (Yeates & Taylor, 1997). It was computed
by averaging sample z scores for the Duncan Occupational Status Index (Stevens &
Featherman, 1981), annual family income as coded on the LISRES-A, and years of maternal
education as measured at the baseline assessment.
Neuropsychological functioning—Children were administered a set of
neuropsychological tests (see Yeates et al., 2002 for details). The tests included a short form
of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition (WISC-III; Wechsler, 1991),
which provided prorated Verbal and Performance IQ scores; Recalling Sentences subtest of
the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Revised (CELF-R; Semel et al., 1987);
Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration (VMI; Beery, 1989); Contingency Naming
Test (Taylor et al., 1998; Anderson et al., 2000), Boston Naming Test (Yeates, 1994);
Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWA; Spreen & Strauss, 1991); a prepublication
version of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; Delis et al., 1986); Continuous
Performance Test-3 (CPT-3; Lindgren & Lyons, 1984); Subtests 2, 4, and 9 of the Underlining
Test (Rourke & Orr, 1977); and Grooved Pegboard Test (Knights & Norwood, 1980). All tests
were completed at each assessment, with the exception of the Grooved Pegboard, which was
administered only at the 6 and 12 month assessments.
A poor neuropsychological outcome was defined based on the presence of three or more
functional deficits (i.e., age-based standardized scores below the 10th percentile) at each
assessment. Age-corrected standard scores were used in coding tests with published norms.
For tests without published norms, raw scores were transformed to age and gender-corrected
z scores prior to analysis (Taylor & Schatschneider, 1992). Transformations were based on the
performances of the OI group at each assessment. Eleven neuropsychological tests were
administered in total; the cutoff of three or more functional deficits minimizes the likelihood
of false positives when identifying a poor neuropsychological outcome at each assessment
(Ingraham & Aiken, 1996).
Behavioral functioning—Behavioral functioning was assessed by having parents complete
the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach, 1991), a widely-used rating scale with good
reliability and validity. A functional deficit in behavioral adjustment was defined as a Total
Behavior Problem T-Score above the 90th percentile.
Adaptive functioning—Adaptive functioning was assessed using the Vineland Adaptive
Behavior Scales, which is a semi-structured parent interview (VABS; Sparrow et al., 1984). A
Fay et al.

functional deficit in adaptive behavior was defined as one or more age-based standard scores
below the 10th percentile on the Communication, Daily Living Skills, or Socialization scales.
Academic outcome—Children completed the Word Identification, Writing Sample, and
Calculation subtests of the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Achievement- Revised (WJ-R;
Woodcock & Mather, 1989). A functional deficit in academic skills was defined as one or more
age-based standard scores below the 10th percentile.
Data Analysis
Each individual child's outcomes at each occasion within each domain (i.e.,
neuropsychological, behavioral, adaptive and academic) were coded into dichotomous
dependent variables (i.e., functional deficit versus no deficit) using the criteria described above.
We then examined patterns of outcomes in each domain across time. Children were classified
into four a priori longitudinal patterns of outcomes within domains: no deficit at any occasion;
persistent deficits at all occasions; improvement (i.e., deficit at 6 months followed by no deficit
at 1 and 4 years or deficits at 6 months and 1 year followed by no deficit at 4 years); and
deterioration (i.e., no deficit at 6 months followed by deficits at both 1 and 4 years post-injury
or no deficits at 6 months or 1 year followed by deficit at 4 years post-injury). The classification
represents a person-centered approach to outcome assessment in high-risk groups (Laursen &
Hoff, 2006; Connell et al., 2006; Masten, 2001), focusing on patterns of outcome suggested
by previous longitudinal studies of children with TBI (Taylor, 2004).
Multinomial logistic regression was used to compare the TBI and OI groups in terms of the
frequency of different patterns of post-injury functional deficits for each of the four types of
outcomes. The analyses included two dummy variables that represented contrasts between the
severe TBI and OI groups and between the moderate TBI and OI groups. Predictors used as
covariates included ethnicity (white vs. non-white), socioeconomic status (SCI), pre-injury
family functioning (FAD General Functioning) and environmental stress (LISRES-A), child
pre-injury child behavioral adjustment and school performance (CBCL Total Problems T score
& school competence T score), and pre-injury child adaptive functioning (baseline VABS
Adaptive Behavior Composite standard score). Preinjury child status was thus assessed using
multiple indicators. The dependent variable in each analysis was the pattern of outcome, using
“no deficits” as the reference category.
To identify indices of TBI severity associated with patterns of functional deficits over the
follow-up interval, separate multinomial logistic regression analyses for each functional
outcome were conducted for the TBI sample only. Instead of dummy variables representing
group membership, the lowest post-resuscitation GCS score and duration of impaired
consciousness were used as indices of severity of injury. Because the two indices are highly
correlated, analyses including both indices would not converge or were characterized by
singularities; therefore, separate multinomial logistic regression analyses were conducted for
each measure of severity. The other predictors remained largely the same as the group
comparisons, although environmental stress (LISRES-A) was eliminated from the analyses
because some analyses would not converge to a solution when it was included. The reference
category for each dependent variable again was “no deficits”.
A variable number of children showed patterns of functional deficits that could not be classified
into the four major categories, and were excluded from the respective multinomial logistic
regression analysis. Seven children were excluded in the neuropsychological domain (one
severe TBI, three moderate TBI, three OI), nine in the behavioral domain (one severe TBI,
four moderate TBI, four OI), four in the academic domain (one severe TBI, one moderate TBI,
two OI), and 13 in the adaptive domain (six severe TBI, five moderate, two OI). The children

excluded from one analysis were not always the same as those excluded from any other. The
total number of participants reported in Table 1 includes all cases.
To examine the co-morbidity of functional deficits, ordinal regression analyses were conducted
on the total number of functional deficits (range = 0-4) at each of the follow-up assessments.
Similar to the multinomial regression analysis, the ordinal regression analyses were conducted
with the same dummy variables representing group contrasts and the same covariates.
Additionally, separate ordinal regression analyses were conducted on the TBI sample only with
GCS score and duration of impaired consciousness used as indices of injury severity. The
ordinal regression analyses included all children.
Results
Group Differences in Functional Deficits
Table 2 presents the number and percentage of children from each group who displayed the
four longitudinal patterns of outcome within each domain. In the multinomial logistic
regression analyses, the addition of the severe TBI and OI group contrast contributed to
improved model fit in all four outcome domains (see Table 3), all χ2 s > 8.13, and all p < .05.
As Table 2 shows, the severe TBI group was more likely than the OI group to display persistent
deficits in all four outcome domains (i.e., 17-23% vs. 3-7%, depending on domain). In addition,
the severe TBI group was more likely than the OI group to display a pattern of deterioration
in behavioral outcomes (19% vs. 5%). Notably, Table 2 also shows that between 48% and 67%
of the severe TBI group showed no functional deficits in neuropsychological, behavioral,
academic or adaptive functioning over time.
The addition of the moderate TBI and OI group contrast also contributed to improved model
fit for the neuropsychological and academic outcomes, χ2s > 7.90, p < .05 (see Table 3). The
moderate TBI group was significantly more likely than the OI group to display persistent
neuropsychological deficits (14% vs. 5%; see Table 2). None of the specific patterns involving
adaptive or academic outcomes was significantly more common among the moderate TBI
group.
Children's premorbid functioning was also a consistent predictor of outcome. Premorbid
adaptive functioning significantly predicted neuropsychological, behavioral, adaptive and
academic outcomes, all χ2 s > 8.34 and all p < .05, premorbid behavioral functioning
significantly predicted behavioral and adaptive outcomes, both χ2 s > 13.59 and both p < .05,
and premorbid school functioning significantly predicted academic outcomes, χ2 = 22.79 and
p < .01. In general, poorer premorbid functioning predicted an increased likelihood of persistent
deficits (see Table 3). Poorer premorbid functioning also predicted an increased likelihood of
improvement in some domains, although poor premorbid school performance predicted an
increased likelihood of deterioration in academic outcomes.
Environmental factors at baseline also predicted outcomes in multiple domains.
Socioeconomic status predicted neuropsychological, behavioral and academic outcomes, both
χ2 s > 18.78 and all p < .01, and family environmental stress (i.e., LESRI) predicted academic
outcomes, χ2 = 8.59 and p < .05. In general, lower socioeconomic status was associated with
increased likelihood of persistent deficits, and lower family stress predicted an increased
likelihood of improvement in academic functioning (see Table 3).
Table 4 shows the number and percentage of children from each group who displayed from 0
to 4 total deficits across domains at each occasion. The groups differed significantly in the total
number of total functional deficits. The models that included the contrast between the severe
TBI and OI groups demonstrated a significantly better overall fit than models without that

contrast at all three time periods (all Wald statistics >8.36, and all p< .05 ). As Table 4 shows,
children in the severe TBI group were more likely than those in the OI group to display 3 or
more functional deficits at all time periods, depending on the time post injury (i.e., 16-25% vs.
2-12%).
Models that included the contrasts between the moderate TBI and OI groups resulted in a
significantly better overall fit than models without that contrast at only 1 year post injury (Wald
statistic =6.92, p< .05; see Table 4). Children in the moderate TBI group were more likely than
those in the OI group to display more total deficits (13% displayed 3 or more total deficits vs.
2% of the OI group).
Indices of TBI Severity as Predictors of Functional Deficits
Table 5 summarizes the results of the multinomial regression analyses using duration of
unconsciousness to predict the four longitudinal patterns of outcome within each domain.
Models that included duration of unconsciousness as a predictor demonstrated a significantly
better overall fit than models without that predictor for neuropsychological, adaptive, and
academic outcomes, χ2 > 8.41, p < .05. A longer duration of unconsciousness was associated
with a greater likelihood of persistent neuropsychological and adaptive deficits, as well as with
a greater likelihood of improvement in neuropsychological, adaptive, and academic outcomes.
Table 6 summarizes the results of the multinomial regression analyses using lowest GCS score
to predict the four longitudinal patterns of outcome within each domain. Inclusion of the lowest
GCS as a predictor yielded a significantly better overall fit than when that predictor was
excluded for behavioral, adaptive, and academic outcomes, χ2 > 8.14, p < .05. A lower GCS
score was associated with a greater likelihood of persistent adaptive deficits and improvement
in adaptive outcome, as well as with a greater likelihood of deterioration in behavioral
outcomes.
When examining the TBI group only, children's premorbid functioning remained a consistent
predictor of outcome. Premorbid behavioral functioning significantly predicted behavioral,
adaptive, and academic outcomes, all χ2 s > 9.13, and all p < .05, and premorbid school
performance significantly predicted neuropsychological, behavioral, and academic
functioning, all χ2 s > 10.91, and all p < .05 (see Tables 5 & 6). More behavioral problems at
baseline were associated with persistent deficits and deterioration in behavioral and adaptive
domains, and improvement in adaptive and academic domains. Poorer premorbid school
performance was associated with an increased likelihood of deterioration in academic
functioning. Environmental variables were less consistently associated with outcomes in the
TBI group, but lower socioeconomic status predicted persistent deficits in all outcome domains,
all χ2 s > 9.64, and all p < .05, as well as deterioration in behavioral and academic functioning
(see Tables 5 & 6).
Duration of unconsciousness and lowest GCS score were also significant predictors of the
number of functional deficits at each follow-up occasion. Models that included duration of
unconsciousness and lowest GCS score as predictors of the total number of deficits at each
occasion demonstrated a significantly better overall fit than models without these predictors,
such that greater injury severity was consistently associated with a higher total number of
functional deficits (all Wald statistics >4.59, and all p< .05 ).
Discussion
By focusing on individual functional deficits, the current findings help to clarify the nature of
the course of recovery after pediatric TBI. The findings support our central hypothesis that
children with severe TBI are more likely to demonstrate persistent functional deficits in

neuropsychological, behavioral, adaptive and academic outcomes than children with OI. On
the other hand, many children with severe TBI showed no deficits from 6 months to 4 years
post injury in one or more outcome domains. The apparent absence of deficits for these children
does not prove that they had no deficits, as many may have been more adversely affected prior
to the 6-month follow-up or may have sustained sequelae that were too mild to meet our criteria
for functional deficits. Moreover, the severe TBI group displayed significantly more total
deficits at all time periods as compared to the OI group. At 1 year post injury, nearly 60% of
the severe TBI groups showed functional deficits in at least one domain, as opposed to about
25% of the OI group. Similarly, at 4 years post-injury, about 40% of the severe TBI group
showed functional deficits in two or more domains, whereas less than 20% of the OI group did
so.
Duration of unconsciousness and lowest GCS score also were significant predictors of patterns
of deficits across time and total number of deficits. These results are consistent with our
previous findings from this study, as well as with other research demonstrating that injury
severity is a key predictor of outcome in childhood TBI (Anderson et al., 1997, 2005; Kinsella
et al., 1999; Schwartz et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2002; Yeates et al., 2001). We were unable to
compare the two measures as predictors of outcomes directly, because of their high correlation.
However, duration of unconsciousness was a significant predictor of outcomes in a somewhat
different set of domains (i.e., neuropsychological, adaptive, academic) than was lowest GCS
score (i.e., behavioral, adaptive). Thus, neither predictor appears to be consistently superior to
the other, consistent with previous research on the ability of measures of TBI severity to predict
neurobehavioral and functional outcomes (Massagli, Michaud, & Rivara, 1996; McDonald et
al., 1994).
As hypothesized, children in the severe TBI group not only were more likely to show persistent
functional deficits across domains, but also were significantly more likely to display a pattern
of deterioration in behavioral outcomes. The latter findings suggest the delayed onset of
significant behavior problems for some children with TBI. This result is consistent with our
previous findings, as well as with other studies showing that behavior problems in children
with severe TBI persist past 1 year post injury, and highlights the specific incidence of delayed
behavior problems in individual children following a severe TBI (Max et al., 1997; Schwartz
et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 1999, 2002; Yeates & Taylor, 2006). Anderson et al. (2005)
specifically demonstrated comparable findings, such that children with severe TBI showed
increased behavioral impairment by 30 months post injury.
Again as predicted, we found that improvement in neuropsychological and academic domains
was more common among children with severe TBI. For instance, 11% of children with severe
TBI demonstrated improvement in neuropsychological functioning over time compared to only
3% of children with moderate TBI and 5% of children with OI. This is consistent with a study
by Jaffe et al. (1995) that showed improvements in academic and neuropsychological
functioning during the first year post-injury, with persistent deficits continuing across 3 years.
Although not a primary focus, our analyses also showed that children's premorbid functioning
helped account for functional outcomes. For instance, poorer premorbid behavioral and
adaptive functioning predicted persistent neuropsychological, behavioral, and adaptive
deficits. Worse premorbid behavioral functioning also predicted deterioration in behavioral
and adaptive functioning. These findings are in line with previous studies on this cohort by
Schwartz et al. (2003) and Taylor et al. (2002), showing that preinjury behavioral adjustment
predicts the onset of behavior problems after injury. Anderson et al. (1997) reported similar
findings, with preinjury adaptive functioning predicting intellectual functioning at 12 months
post-injury in children with moderate and severe TBI. We also found that lower premorbid
school competence was associated with persistent neuropsychological deficits and

deterioration in adaptive and academic functioning. Additionally, low socioeconomic status
was consistently associated with persistent deficits in all domains. Taken together, these
findings indicate that children with poorer premorbid functioning and less advantaged family
environments are at greater risk for persistent functional deficits and deterioration in many
domains of functioning.
In summary, our findings build on the existing literature by demonstrating that a significant
proportion of children demonstrate functional deficits following severe TBI, and those who do
so are at risk for persistent deficits, even many years after recovery. The results also indicate
that some children with severe TBI demonstrate recovery in academic and neuropsychological
domains, but some show the delayed onset of significant behavioral problems. Children with
better premorbid functioning may have a greater chance of recovery or improvement over time,
while those with significant preinjury problems may be more likely to display negative long-
term sequelae of TBI.
At the same time, the findings also indicate that many children with moderate to severe TBI
actually show few functional deficits. Indeed, one of the central findings presented here is that
the TBI groups demonstrate less functional impairment than might have been expected based
on existing research, which generally uses a variable-centered approach that focuses on the
statistical significance of group differences in mean scores. Variable-centered analyses may
lead to an overestimation of the incidence of individual deficits following TBI, because the
conclusions drawn are based on groups that show considerable overlap in the distribution of
scores, even in the presence of a significant differences with effect sizes of the magnitude often
found in studies of TBI (i.e., .5 to 1 standard deviation). Our findings are based on individual
scores rather than group means, as well as on reasonably stringent definitions of clinical
impairment; they therefore provide an important and different perspective on the nature of
deficits following childhood TBI.
A limitation of this study is the use of a cutoff score to classify functional deficits. Cutoff scores
have inherent limitations, but are a convenient means of differentiating typical from atypical
performance. Any choice of a cutoff score is somewhat arbitrary, although we chose a cutoff
often considered to represent significant impairment in clinical neuropsychological practice.
A more liberal cutoff (e.g. 15th percentile) would have led to the identification of more
functional deficits, even in the OI group. A more conservative cutoff (e.g. 5th percentile) would
have resulted in the identification of few functional deficits, even among children with TBI.
In either instance, however, similar differences would have been found between the TBI and
OI groups in the relative incidence of deficits.
One concern about the use of cutoff scores is that they may not result in reliable classification,
because changes in classification can occur with relatively trivial changes in performance. We
performed follow-up analyses comparing the actual performances within outcome domains of
the individuals who were classified according to their patterns of functional deficits. The
analyses showed that the groups displayed significantly different patterns of mean scores in
each outcome domain across time (i.e., neuropsychological, behavioral, adaptive and
academic). Moreover, the mean scores showed significantly different trends across time,
consistent with the patterns of functional deficits into which they were classified (i.e., no
deficits, persistent deficits, improvement, and deterioration). Thus, the classification of
individual functional deficits across time was associated with corresponding group change or
stability in mean scores within domains.
Alternatively, we could have calculated a Reliable Change Index (RCI) to determine whether
the difference between initial and subsequent test scores from the same examinee could be
attributed to measurement error (Jacobson & Truax, 1991; Jacobsen et al., 1999; Slick,
Fay et al.

2006). However, a RCI can only be used with two time points, whereas our study examined
outcome over three time points. Additionally, RCI applies to a single measure, whereas some
of the outcomes in the current study were assessed based on multiple indices (e.g.,
neuropsychological functioning). Perhaps more importantly, a significant RCI can occur even
when neither score being compared is normatively atypical, and therefore would not
necessarily have functional implications (Slick, 2006). We were interested in whether or not
each child demonstrated a functional deficit at each time point, not whether the change from
baseline was significant. In clinical practice, neuropsychologists scrutinize individual test
scores to determine whether or not a child evidences functional impairment. This study used
similar methods to examine the functional outcomes of children with TBI.
The study was also limited because environmental variables were examined only as covariates
in the prediction of functional outcomes, rather than as potential moderators, as we have done
in past studies (Taylor et al., 2002; Yeates et al., 2002). We attempted to assess the effects of
interactions of injury severity with environmental variables in the multinomial logistic
regression analyses. However, in three out of the four cases, entry of the interaction terms led
to Hessian singularities or problems of convergence. This is most likely a function of the
multicollinearity between interaction terms, as well as the relatively small number of cases
within some of the groups of longitudinal patterns. Future studies with larger sample sizes will
be needed to investigate the moderating effects of environmental variables on functional
outcomes after childhood TBI. Another limitation in our analysis is that we did not use
advanced statistical techniques that derives patterns of outcomes across time empirically (e.g.,
latent transition analysis, latent class growth analysis), largely because our sample size would
not necessarily support such techniques (Muthén & Muthén, 2000).
Another limitation shared by many studies of childhood TBI is that children's behavioral and
adaptive functioning, as well as family functioning and environmental stress, were all assessed
by parent report. In addition, the parent's ratings of premorbid functioning were unavoidably
retrospective. Additionally, families of children with TBI who did not return for follow-up
were of lower SES than those who remained in the study. Because the outcomes examined in
this study are influenced by socioeconomic status, and the TBI participants who remained in
the study were of higher SES than those who did not, our results may underestimate somewhat
the proportion of functional deficits that occur after pediatric TBI. However, because we
controlled for socioeconomic status in our analyses and found no other demographic
differences between groups, group differences in functional deficits are unlikely to be strongly
impacted by this bias. A final limitation is that follow-ups assessments were not completed
between 1 and 4 years post injury; more frequent follow-ups would have allowed for a more
precise description and categorization of longitudinal patterns of outcome.
Despite these limitations, the current results indicate that children show significant variation
in their functioning after a moderate to severe TBI, with a substantial proportion actually
showing relatively few functional deficits during recovery. We found that a child's individual
pattern of functional deficits after a moderate to severe TBI is likely determined by a variety
of factors, including severity of injury, premorbid functioning, and environmental factors such
as socioeconomic status. Notably, functional deficits were not uncommon in the severe TBI
group. Approximately two out of five children with severe TBI demonstrated two or more
functional deficits that persisted more than 4 years post injury, despite the provision of
substantial clinical and educational services to many of them. These persistent deficits highlight
the need for careful evaluation and ongoing monitoring of children with severe TBI throughout
their recovery, because some of them will demonstrate multiple areas of functional impairment
that persist for many years after their injuries. These deficits are likely to have a significant
impact on children's general quality of life and presumably will necessitate ongoing
intervention (Stancin et al., 2002; Yeates & Taylor, 2006). On the other hand, the findings hold

out hope that children with severe TBI may demonstrate surprisingly few functional deficits.
A goal of future research will be to further clarify the reasons for variability in outcomes among
children with TBI.
