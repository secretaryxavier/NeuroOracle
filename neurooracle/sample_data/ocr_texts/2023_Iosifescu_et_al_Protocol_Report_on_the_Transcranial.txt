Abstract: Background: Alzheimer’s disease’s (AD) prevalence is projected to increase as the popula-
tion ages and current treatments are minimally effective. Transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM)
with near-infrared (NIR) light penetrates into the cerebral cortex, stimulates the mitochondrial respi-
ratory chain, and increases cerebral blood ﬂow. Preliminary data suggests t-PBM may be efﬁcacious
in improving cognition in people with early AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with aMCI and early AD
participants, we will test the efﬁcacy, safety, and impact on cognition of 24 sessions of t-PBM delivered
over 8 weeks. Brain mechanisms of t-PBM in this population will be explored by testing whether
the baseline tau burden (measured with 18F-MK6240), or changes in mitochondrial function over
8 weeks (assessed with 31P-MRSI), moderates the changes observed in cognitive functions after t-PBM
therapy. We will also use changes in the fMRI Blood-Oxygenation-Level-Dependent (BOLD) signal
after a single treatment to demonstrate t-PBM-dependent increases in prefrontal cortex blood ﬂow.
Conclusion: This study will test whether t-PBM, a low-cost, accessible, and user-friendly intervention,
has the potential to improve cognition and function in an aMCI and early AD population.

1. Introduction
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) affects an estimated 6.2 million Americans aged 65 and
older [1]. As life expectancy continues to increase, the number of expected AD patients
is predicted to reach 13.8 million by 2060 [1]. Furthermore, medical costs associated with
AD are expected to surpass $1 trillion by 2050 [2]. Despite many years of clinical trials,
few treatments have shown any clinical beneﬁt beyond moderate symptom alleviation.
Thus, it is imperative to investigate new therapeutic strategies that are clinically beneﬁcial
and more easily accessible for patients with AD.
Research over the last decade indicates that AD has a very long preclinical phase,
lasting possibly >10 years [3] with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) being a potential
transitional state from normal cognition to mild dementia due to AD [4]. Therefore, more

emphasis has been placed on understanding the factors that inﬂuence early brain pathology
in order to slow the ultimate clinical expression of AD. For many years, the dominant
theory for the etiology of AD was based on the neurotoxic effects of amyloid aggregates (i.e.,
the ‘amyloid-cascade hypothesis’). This hypothesis posits that accumulation of amyloid
beta (Aβ) peptides, a main component of plaques, in the brain parenchyma is the causative
event in the pathogenesis of AD [5]. However, conﬂicting empirical observations have cast
doubt over the validity of some aspects of this hypothesis. For example, amyloid plaques
have been found to occur in cognitively normal individuals [6]. There is also only a weak
correlation between the density of plaques and the degree of cognitive impairment [6,7].
Taken together, these ﬁndings provide little insight into the etiology of early amyloid
deposition or the onset of clinical symptoms.
Several theories have been proposed to explain the limitations of the amyloid-cascade
hypothesis. One is the mitochondrial cascade hypothesis in which inherited and envi-
ronmental factors inﬂuence mitochondrial function. These factors are thought to lead to
problems in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and to the formation of amyloid
beta and tau proteins (a microtubule-associated protein that is hyperphosphorylated and
aggregated in AD) [8] that are believed to play a critical role in AD pathogenesis [9,10].
A more contemporary view suggests a neuroenergetic hypothesis, focusing on not only
mitochondrial function, but overall energy production from glucose in the Central Nervous
System (CNS). This theory postulates that a decrease in glucose crossing the blood–brain
barrier leads to energy deﬁciency stress in the CNS, which in turn leads to the formation of
amyloid beta and tau proteins, as well as AD progression [11]. In support of these theories,
a decrease in glucose metabolism and mitochondrial activity has been noted decades before
clinical symptoms of AD emerge [12]. Furthermore, in patients with AD, mitochondria
are characterized by lowered oxidative phosphorylation, decreased ATP production, and
increased reactive oxygen species [13].
Given these ﬁndings of increased oxidative stress in mitochondria of patients with
AD, researchers have tried various ways to augment mitochondrial antioxidant defenses
with dietary supplements. Multiple research groups administered antioxidants, such as
selegiline, carotenes, and vitamins C and E, in patients with AD or healthy subjects and
followed their cognitive function over time [14–18]. However, ﬁndings from these studies
have been inconclusive. This may be because there are difﬁculties with ﬁnding adequate
antioxidant dosages and combinations [19]; it is also possible that these compounds poorly
penetrate the blood–brain barrier and may not adequately reach brain cell mitochondria [20].
Therefore, the discovery of more effective and targeted interventions for mitochondrial
abnormalities in AD is of great importance.
Transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) is a novel, non-invasive, neuromodulation
intervention with the potential to become an at-home, wearable treatment for AD [21]. It
uses non-retinal exposure to speciﬁc wavelengths, either visible red light (600 to 700 nm)
or Near-Infrared Radiation (NIR, usually 810–1100 nm), to stimulate, heal, and repair
damaged or dying cells and tissue. t-PBM with near-infrared (NIR) light, at wavelengths of
800~1200 nm, penetrates robustly into the cerebral cortex [22–24]. It has been found to act
on the brain in two speciﬁc ways: (1) by increasing mitochondrial ATP production, and
(2) by increasing regional Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF). Speciﬁcally, NIR delivered through
t-PBM is absorbed by a mitochondrial enzyme and chromophore, Cytochrome C Oxidase
(CCO), and is only minimally dissipated as thermal energy [25,26]. Results in cellular
and animal models indicate that t-PBM can enhance mitochondrial activity, because NIR
delivers energy to the CCO and stimulates the mitochondrial respiratory chain, leading
to increased ATP production [25,27,28]. This is relevant for AD, which is associated with
hypometabolism in speciﬁc brain areas [29,30] and mitochondrial dysfunction [13,31]. In
addition, NIR can improve mitochondrial activity by promoting the dissociation of nitric
oxide (NO) from the CCO, releasing the binding site for oxygen and restoring oxidative
phosphorylation [26]. The released NO may also act as a local vasodilator [32], resulting in

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2017

a focal, increased rCBF [33]. A study on isolated mitochondria also reported increased RNA
and protein synthesis after irradiation with a low-level laser (632.8 nm) [34].
Animal research suggests that t-PBM might exert, via its impact on mitochondria,
beneﬁcial effects on several pathophysiological mechanisms implicated in AD, such as
oxidative stress [35,36], neuroinﬂammation [37,38], and deﬁcits in neuroplasticity and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [39–41]. NIR can induce short bursts of reac-
tive oxygen species (ROS), leading to the activation of antioxidant mechanisms and the
activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), resulting in decreased
overexpression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and in a reduction
in oxidative stress [32,42,43]. In animal models, NIR light with 600 to 1000 nm reduced
neuroinﬂammation by decreasing proinﬂammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β,
and IL-8 [44–46], decreasing the inﬁltration of macrophages, and activating microglia and T
lymphocytes to the CNS [46]. Studies have also shown that t-PBM stimulates neurogenesis
and neuroprotective mechanisms in neuronal injury, possibly mediated by increased BDNF
and by the inhibition of GSK-3β and pro-apoptotic molecules [32,47–54].
In addition, the use of t-PBM in animal models of AD has demonstrated efﬁcacy in
the reduction of Aβ burden in the brain. In one study using a mouse model of AD, NIR
t-PBM was delivered to the tibia to stimulate bone marrow and mesenchymal stem cells.
This was then associated with a 35% increase in the phagocytosis of Aβ and signiﬁcant
reduction in the Aβ brain burden [55]. In a study using TASTPM AD mice, 5-month
treatment (with two treatment sessions per week) of 1072 nm NIR light delivered to the
whole body resulted in an increase in heat-shock proteins (involved in maintaining healthy
neurons) and a decrease in Aβ-associated proteins and plaques in the cerebral cortex,
along with a reduction in tau-P [56]. De Taboada et al. demonstrated that t-PBM applied
three times/week for 6 months at various irradiance doses signiﬁcantly reduced Aβ plaques
in Aβ protein precursor transgenic mice, and that there was a dose-dependent effect on
the amyloid load [57]. t-PBM was also found to reduce the expression of inﬂammatory
markers, increase ATP levels and mitochondrial function, and mitigate behavioral effects of
advanced amyloid deposition [57]. In a similar case, Purushothuman et al. applied 670 nm
NIR transcranially to two mouse models of dementia, the APPswe/PSEN1dE9 (APP/PS1)
transgenic mouse engineered to develop amyloid plaques and the K369Itau (K3) transgenic
mouse engineered to develop neuroﬁbrillary tangles. Treatments applied 5 days a week for
4 weeks resulted in a decrease in the Aβ burden in the cerebellum of the APP/PS1 mice and
in a reduction in immunoreactivity of hyperphosphorylated tau in the K3 mice compared
to the sham [58]. Oxidative stress was also reduced in the K3 mice while the expression of
CCO was maintained at near wild-type levels [58].
The safety and efﬁcacy of t-PBM in humans have been demonstrated in studies across
a variety of conditions, thereby making t-PBM a potential treatment strategy warranting
further examination. In a pooled sample of 1410 subjects with stroke from three randomized
control studies (RCTs) [59,60], no signiﬁcant difference in the rate of adverse effects was
observed between the groups receiving laser NIR (808 nm; 5 W) and sham. A clinical
trial, and its replication with 16 sessions, reported an increased number of mild side-
effects in the active treatment group, with the most frequent being insomnia, “seeing
vivid colors”, “an ashtray-like taste”, and an irritable mood [33,61]. A pilot study of t-
PBM in humans with cognitive deﬁcits has shown promising results: 19 participants with
impaired cognition were randomized to active or sham treatments over 12 weeks [62].
Active participants with moderate to severe impairment (Mini-Mental State exam [MMSE]
scores 5–24) showed a signiﬁcant improvement at the conclusion of treatment. In a case
series of ﬁve patients with mild to moderate AD treated with intranasal home-use PBM
devices, using pulsed, 810 nm light-emitting diodes (LEDs), a signiﬁcant improvement was
noted on neurocognitive tests such as MMSE and the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment
Scale–Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) [63].

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Objectives
Taken together, t-PBM has great potential to serve as a safe and easily accessible
treatment for aMCI and mild dementia due to AD. We hypothesize that compared to sham,
t-PBM will be associated with an improvement in cognitive function (which also could
manifest as a deceleration of rates of decline in cognitive function).
•
Aim #1: To assess the efﬁcacy of t-PBM for cognitive deﬁcits in amnestic MCI (aMCI)
and mild dementia due to AD. Participants will be randomized to t-PBM or sham and
their cognitive functions will be monitored with a change in the Repeatable Battery for
the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS-Update) [64] Total Scale score
after 8 weeks of treatment;
•
Aim #2: To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of t-PBM treatment in pa-
tients with aMCI and mild dementia due to AD. We will monitor changes in treatment
emergent adverse events by using Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent
Events (SAFTEE) [65], as well as scales that assess suicidal ideation and sleep quality;
•
Aim #3: To explore brain mechanisms of t-PBM in aMCI and mild dementia due to
AD. We will assess possible mediators of the treatment response including baseline
tau burden (measured using Positron Emitting Topography [PET] with a 18F MK-6240
tracer), changes in measures of mitochondrial function (assessed using Phosphorus
Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging [31P-MRSI]), and blood ﬂow in the pre-
frontal cortex (PFC) (measured with a Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent [BOLD] signal
change using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging [fMRI]).
2.2. Study Design
The present study will be the ﬁrst to evaluate the effects of t-PBM in aMCI and mild
dementia due to AD in a parallel group, sham-controlled, 8-week randomized, multi-site
clinical trial. The trial will run simultaneously across three study sites: NYU Langone
Health (NYU), Nathan S. Kline Institute for Psychiatric Research (NKI), and Massachusetts
General Hospital (MGH). With this data, we will attempt to assess the efﬁcacy and safety of
t-PBM as an easily administered treatment for those suffering from aMCI and mild dementia
due to AD. This study has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (Identiﬁer: NCT04784416).
A schematic of the study design can be found in Figure 1.
Figure 1. Schematic of TRAP-AD study design.
2.3. Study Participants
In total, 125 participants, aged 65–85 (inclusive), will be recruited from three study
sites, NYU, NKI, and MGH who meet the Petersen MCI criteria for aMCI [66], extended
to also include early AD, with a Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) [67] score between 0.5
and 1.0, and a Functional Assessment Staging (FAST) [68] score of 1–4. Participants will be
randomized to either active t-PBM or sham treatments, lasting for 8 weeks.

2.4. Screening Procedures
After informed consent, participants will undergo full medical and psychiatric screen-
ing, as well as initial neuropsychological testing. This screening phase includes obtaining
demographic information and administering the neuropsychological test screener Ad-
denbrooke’s Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III) [69], Clinical Global Impressions Scale-
Severity (CGI-S) [70], Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) [71,72], MRI
safety checklist, and Columbia Suicide Severity Risk Scale (C-SSRS) [73]. CDR, a measure
that determines the severity of dementia on a 0–3-point scale, and FAST, a measure of
dementia that assesses individual ability to function and perform activities of daily living,
will also be completed. The New Immigrant Survey–Skin Color Scale (NIS-SCS) [74] will
be administered, as t-PBM absorption may be dependent on skin tone. Medical history as
well as concomitant medications and therapies will be reviewed by a clinician to determine
eligibility. Peripheral blood and urine samples will be collected for laboratory testing
and/or storage; clinical laboratory evaluations include hematology, biochemistry, and
urinalysis. A portion of the collected blood will be stored as biospecimen and used for
the extraction of DNA and the assessment of Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes. Simoa
assays will be used for the blood detection of tau, Aβ40/42, neuroﬁlament light chain
(NfL), and Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP). Participants are also asked to complete
self-report measures, which include the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [75], Anxiety
Symptoms Questionnaire (ASQ) [76], irritability section of Concise Associated Symptom
Tracking (CAST-IRR) [77], Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [78], and Quality of Life
in Neurological Disorders (Neuro-QoL) [79].
2.5. Baseline Data
To elucidate t-PBM’s mechanisms of action, participants will undergo neuroimaging
related to critical features of AD prior to study treatment: a tau load (18F MK-6240 PET),
measures of brain bioenergetics (31P-MRSI), and functional connectivity (rs-fMRI). MRI
scanning will begin with the acquisition of structural images. Participants will be asked
to perform a 30 min dynamic 18F MK-6240 tau PET-MR scan 85 min after tracer injection,
which involves a single IV bolus injection of 185 MBq of the 18F MK-6240 tracer. PET
images corresponding to 90–110 min of post-injection tracer uptake will be acquired using
a Siemens 3T PET/MR scanner. 31P-MRS acquisition (which takes less than 30 min) will
take place in a separate session after relocation to a different MRI scanner. Subsequently,
we will collect approximately 30 min of functional MRI data during the administration
of a single, unblinded session of NIR t-PBM: ~10 min of fMRI before t-PBM, ~10 min
coinciding with t-PBM, and ~10 min following t-PBM.
We will conduct additional neuropsychological testing in order to gather comprehen-
sive baseline cognitive data for each participant. These test batteries include the North
American Adult Reading Test-short version (NAART 35) as a measurement of premorbid
verbal IQ [80,81], Letter and Pattern Comparison Task (LPC) as a measurement of attention
and concentration [82], Face-Name Associative Memory Exam Short Form (FNAME-12)
as a measurement of face recognition and memory [83,84], Trial Making Task (TMT) A
and B as well as Stroop Color Word Test as measurements of processing speed and ex-
ecutive functioning [85,86], RBANS-Update as this study’s primary outcome measure,
Letter Number Sequencing (LNS) as a measurement of working memory [87], and National
Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC)’s Uniform Data Set Neuropsychological Battery
Version 3 (UDSNB 3.0) [88]. If a participant is eligible for and interested in this study, their
ACE-III scores during screening will also be used as a part of the comprehensive baseline
cognitive data.
2.6. Randomization
After the collection of baseline data, participants will be randomized to either the
active t-PBM group or the sham/control group. To protect study blinding, three lists of
randomization sequences will be generated (one list for each site) using a block random-

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2017
6 of 16
ization of size 6, with three assignments to each of the two treatment groups within each
block. The lists will be created via the “blockrand” package in R by a study statistician,
who will not be involved in conducting any study procedures. Neither the study team
nor the participants will know which number corresponds to the active t-PBM group, and
the t-PBM device will not reveal any parameter settings of the treatment groups (i.e., only
group numbers are displayed).
2.7. t-PBM Treatment Phase
Once randomization is complete, participants will complete t-PBM/sham treatments
for ~12 min per day, 3 days per week, for 8 weeks. t-PBM will be delivered using laser
probes placed over the forehead bilaterally (at standard electroencephalography (EEG)
electrode positions F4, F3), via pulsed waves at an 808 nm wavelength. The speciﬁc param-
eters of administered t-PBM will be as follows: wavelength: 808 nm; average irradiance:
277.8 mW/cm2; peak irradiance: 833 mW/cm2; PW: 42 Hz; duty cycle: 33%; total area illu-
minated: 24 cm2 (2 × 12 cm2); exposure time: 667 s (11:07 min); ﬂuence: 185.3 J/cm2; and
total energy per session: 4.4 kJ. All treatments will be conducted in a clinic, and ﬁnancial
compensation for time and transportation will be provided to participants to minimize
dropout. With the short duration of treatments and study staff’s expertise in retaining
patients from the target population in our studies, we expect that the dropout rate will not
exceed 20%.
Transcranial PhotoBioModulation-1000 (t-PBM-2.0) used in this study is an investiga-
tional device based on LiteCure’s LightForce® EXPi Deep Tissue Laser TherapyTM System.
For our study, the EXPi System’s beam delivery (i.e., EmpowerTM) will be modiﬁed to
non-invasively deliver NIR at 808 nm to the forehead. The modiﬁed system will also be
conﬁgured to provide sham (placebo) treatment (with device modalities identical to t-PBM),
which delivers NIR at less than 0.5% of the intensity of the active dose (in order to make
the device functionality indistinguishable from active). No t-PBM light is reaching the eyes
(which are also protected with polarized laser safety eyewear).
The t-PBM-2.0 device is considered a Class II medical device per 21 CFR 890.5500
and 878.4810, and is manufactured per 21 CFR 820. Each t-PBM-2.0 device consists of
a therapeutic laser console (which produces laser energy as NIR), and an optical delivery
system consisting of a ﬂexible, double-sheathed optical ﬁber connected to a custom helmet
(cap). The helmet is conﬁgured to deliver NIR light to EEG sites F4 and F3 (or in close
proximity if covered by hair), covering a total surface treatment area of approximately
24 cm2 (12 cm2 × 2). The device utilizes a laser diode source with a maximum Continuous
Wave (CW) output of ≤30 watts at a wavelength of 808 nm and nominal beam diameter of
40 mm at the outside aperture. It also includes laser safety eyewear with an optical density
rating of >5.0 at 808 nm. Figure 2 showcases the t-PBM-2.0 treatment device.
The t-PBM-2.0 device operates in one of ﬁve modes: NIR continuous low irradiance
(50 mW/cm2), NIR continuous middle irradiance (300 mW/cm2), NIR pulsed middle
irradiance (300 mW/cm2), NIR continuous high irradiance (700 mW/cm2), and sham. Since
the proposed average irradiance dose of t-PBM at ~300 mW/cm2 is the most frequently
used dose reported in the literature [89], and has been associated with changes in CBF [90]
and cognition [62,63], for this study we will only employ the NIR pulsed middle irradiance
(~300 mW/cm2) and sham modes, at 42 Hz, with a pulsing 33% duty cycle. The 808 nm
NIR wavelength was chosen for this study because it is at the absorption peak of the
primary photoacceptor CCO [47,91], has optimal penetration through the skull [22–24],
and has proven effects on CBF [90] and on cognition [62,63]. A laser source of NIR will
be used in this study because lasers are currently the gold standard for t-PBM and are
likely to deliver a superior therapeutic beneﬁt compared to LEDs. Granted, LEDs can
cover a larger brain area simultaneously and are cost-effective with a great safety proﬁle,
thus potentially easier to be self-administered at home [92]. However, one of the main
issues with t-PBM is that a large proportion of the light administered to the scalp does not
reach the brain [24]. Optimizing light penetration through the skull is very important, and

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2017

LEDs have lower penetrance compared to lasers [22]. This is probably due to the higher
coherence of light in lasers, compared to LEDs [93]. The anatomical sites targeted by t-PBM
in this study include the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (standard EEG
electrode sites F4, F3). We chose to broadly irradiate and engage the PFC because these
areas are involved in relevant cognitive processes [94], and abnormalities in CBF have been
noted in these areas of patients with AD [95,96]. Due to the nature of NIR t-PBM treatments
and irradiance parameters, a warming sensation is identiﬁed as a potential concern for
treatment tolerability. Although in many previous studies, including in AD, t-PBM with an
irradiance of approximately 300 mW/cm2 was found to be tolerable, warming sensations
will be monitored at each treatment session via the use of side-effect questionnaires.

Once per week during the treatment phase, participants will be asked to complete
self-report measures (ASQ, GDS, Neuro-QoL, SAFTEE), review concomitant medications
and therapies with study clinicians (who administer C-SSRS, Clinical Global Impressions
Scale-Improvement (CGI-I), and CGI-S), have vital signs recorded, and report any adverse
events. Once per month, participants will be asked to complete the PSQI and the Perceived
Blinding Questionnaire (PBQ) [97].
2.8. Post-Study Data
Following the 8 weeks of t-PBM/sham treatment, participants will be asked to repeat
the self-report measures mentioned previously. They will also be administered the C-SSRS,
CGI-I, CGI-S, CDR, and FAST, and re-administered the neuropsychological test battery
(different versions of the same batteries are used when possible to minimize practice
effects). Their concomitant medications and therapies will be reviewed as well, with
vital signs and adverse events recorded. Additionally, participants will undergo a blood
draw and a 31P-MRSI scan as per the primary outcome procedures. Within 2 weeks of the
primary outcome phase, participants will be asked to complete a short-term follow-up
visit. This visit includes the completion of aforementioned self-report measures, as well as
the administration of C-SSRS, CGI-I, and CGI-S; a review of concomitant medications and
therapies, as well as recording of any adverse events, will also occur. Roughly 3 months
after the completion of the primary outcome phase, participants will be asked to complete
a long-term follow-up visit. This visit includes the completion of self-report measures,
the administration of C-SSRS, CGI-I, and CGI-S, a review of concomitant medications
and therapies, as well as a recording of any adverse events. Participants will also be re-

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2017

administered the neuropsychological test battery, so data can be collected on whether or
not the treatments’ effects on cognition (if any) persist for 3 months post treatment.
2.9. Data Management and Analysis
We hypothesize that compared to sham, t-PBM will be associated with an improvement
in cognitive function (or with a deceleration of rates of decline in cognitive function), as
measured with the primary outcome measurement (RBANS-Update Total Scale Score)
assessed at the 8-week timepoint. There will be two datasets in this study, (1) an Intention-
To-Treat (ITT) dataset and (2) a Modiﬁed Intention-To-Treat (MITT) dataset. ITT will include
all randomized participants and MITT will include all participants who will undergo at
least 1 week of t-PBM sessions and have at least one post randomization assessment. The
efﬁcacy analyses will include participants receiving the neuropsychological assessments
at primary outcome (i.e., treatment completers), as neuropsychological data cannot be
measured repeatedly without practice effects, despite the use of alternate test versions
when possible. The MITT dataset will be used for almost all other analyses, including the
examination of demographic or clinical differences between subject groups that do and do
not undergo at least one scan.
The distribution of all variables will be investigated using descriptive statistics prior
to a statistical analysis. Outliers will be identiﬁed and further examined to ensure data
integrity. Transformations of the variables will be employed, and non-parametric statistical
methods will be used when outcomes do not conform to required distributional assump-
tions. The treatment groups will be described with respect to baseline demographic, clinical,
and brain characteristics. All analyses will be adjusted for age, sex, and ApoE4 status. The
three study sites will be treated as ﬁxed effects in all analyses.
The primary efﬁcacy outcome will be assessed using the difference from baseline to
week 8 in the RBANS-Update Total Scale Score, which has well-established normative
ranges and psychometric properties [64,98]. We hypothesize that compared to the sham,
t-PBM will be associated with superior cognitive function scores at the 8-week timepoint
(primary outcome). This hypothesis will be tested using linear regression, which models
the post-treatment score on composite neuropsychiatric measures as a function of treatment
assignment, while adjusting for the baseline score of the composite as well as for sex,
age, ApoE4 status, and site. In addition to the formal hypothesis testing, we will provide
90% conﬁdence intervals for the estimated t-PBM effect and will report its effect size; the
effect size will be computed by dividing the effect estimated in the linear regression by the
standard deviation of the outcome measure at baseline.
Additionally, we will estimate the effect of t-PBM on the secondary outcomes (e.g.,
individual tests within the RBANS-Update), to allow for references to published effects
from other studies; the type I error rate in these secondary analyses will be controlled
with the false discovery rate [99]. We will also explore the potential differential effects of
the three study sites by including them in the model for the outcome interactions: site by
treatment, site by baseline covariate, and site by treatment by baseline covariate. Here, we
will estimate the site effects rather than perform a formal hypothesis test.
We will also seek to explore the potential mechanisms of action of t-PBM treatment
by investigating the following questions: (a) whether the baseline tau burden measured
with 18F MK-6240 PET, or changes in mitochondrial function measured with 31P-MRSI,
moderates the effect of t-PBM (in comparison to the sham) on the efﬁcacy outcomes, and
(b) whether the acute effects of t-PBM on cerebral blood ﬂow in the PFC measured via
a BOLD signal change on fMRI mediate the effect of t-PBM on the efﬁcacy outcomes.
For these, exploratory analyses will employ standard moderation (including interactions
between treatment and potential moderators in the model for the outcomes) and mediation
(a path analysis, estimating direct and indirect treatment effects) approaches [100]. We will
control for age, sex, ApoE4 status, site, as well as depressive symptoms and sleep quality
measured with the PSQI, both at baseline and after treatment.

With regards to detectable effects, the effects that can be detected with 80% power
of two-sided tests with signiﬁcance level alpha = 0.05 (detectable effects), with a total
of 125 subjects, will depend on the dropout rate and the proportion of variance in the
outcome that is explained by covariates in the model. With the short duration of individual
treatments and our expertise in retaining patients from the target population in our studies,
we expect that the dropout rate will not exceed 20%. In our experience, the baseline
levels often explain 40–50% of the variance in neuropsychological outcome measures after
treatments. Under such conditions, this study will be able to detect an effect of a medium
size (Cohen’s d = 0.64).
2.10. Demographic Data on Existing Participants
Participants are recruited from the greater New York City and Boston metropoli-
tan areas, as well as from the area surrounding Orangeburg, New York. As of 8 March
2023, a total of 109 participants have been recruited in this study. Forty-three participants
self-identify as female (39.4%), and ﬁfty participants self-identify as male (45.9%). The
participants have a mean age of 74.14 years, with the youngest participant being 65 and
the oldest participant being 85. All participants completed at least 12 years of education.
The majority of participants (n = 70, 64.2%) identify themselves as White, with ﬁfteen
participants (13.8%) identifying themselves as Black/African American, one participant
(0.9%) self-identifying as Asian, and three participants (2.8%) self-identifying as having
more than one race. A little less than half of the participants are married (n = 51, 46.8%),
while other participants report being divorced (n = 18, 16.5%), never married (n = 9, 8.3%),
or a member of an unmarried couple (n = 3, 2.8%).
3. Discussion
Given the ever-increasing prevalence of AD [1] and the lack of effective, easily accessi-
ble treatments, the need for novel treatment strategies is dire. t-PBM is an emerging neuro-
modulation therapy that has a potential to treat AD [21,25,27,28,33,34,42–58,62,63,89–91],
with a favorable safety proﬁle [33,59–61]. Our study will be the ﬁrst to evaluate the effects
of t-PBM in aMCI and mild dementia due to AD in a parallel group, sham-controlled,
8-week randomized, multi-site clinical trial. We aim to assess treatment efﬁcacy via the
administration of an array of comprehensive neuropsychological assessment batteries that
measure multiple domains of cognition.
Since the commencement of study activities, we have made several changes to our
initial study protocol. One major change concerns the inclusion criteria. Originally, our
inclusion criteria focused primarily on aMCI (with a CDR of 0.5 and a FAST of 1–3).
However, we decided to expand our enrollment to include the mild dementia range
in addition to our original target of aMCI, thus widening the original CDR and FAST
inclusion ranges (to 0.5–1 and 1–4, respectively). It is possible that in doing so, we may
see a differential response to t-PBM based on the heterogeneity of conditions and disease
severity. Another change is related to neuroimaging procedures. Given the age range of our
target population (65–85), MRI contraindications (such as pacemakers, joint replacements,
and claustrophobia) are common. As neuroimaging data will not be analyzed as primary
outcome, but only for exploratory analyses, we decided to randomize participants who
could not undergo neuroimaging procedures. We also anticipate some difﬁculties with
our participants, due to this population’s potential issues with involuntary movement and
maintaining a steady posture during scans, but we are hopeful that we will gather data
sufﬁcient for meaningful analyses regardless.
There are several potential ethical concerns with our study that are common to re-
search projects performed with AD participants. First, we have a sham group, for which
we do not expect to observe improvements in cognition, and participants in this group
may in fact decline. In addition, while we are hopeful that the active t-PBM group will
demonstrate cognitive improvements, the extent of improvements as well as the persistence
of improvements long term are unknown. To these points, we implemented an open-label

Healthcare 2023, 11, 2017

option that allows all interested participants, regardless of their randomized group as-
signment, to receive active, unblinded t-PBM treatments—given that they demonstrate
cognitive impairments as determined with the achieved ACE-III total score that is obtained
during post-treatment neuropsychological testing.
We are planning to randomize 125 patients over the course of 5 years. As it is a double-
blinded study, we will not report on any outcome results until all study procedures are
complete and the dataset is locked. However, it is possible that we may release some
initial baseline clinical, imaging, or biomarker data, which is dependent on the number of
participants that complete these procedures.
4. Limitations and Future Directions
It is worth mentioning that we have opted not to collect data on Aβ burden in the
brain, either by way of Amyloid PET or Aβ40/42 biomarkers in the cerebral spinal ﬂuid.
The reason behind this decision is four-fold: (1) Amyloid PET may be less speciﬁc to
AD than tau PET, as patients with AD seem to show an increased tau tracer uptake and
a characteristic brain distribution on tau PET, which is not present in other dementias
such as frontotemporal dementia or diffuse Lewy body disease (patients of which often
show increased tracer uptake on Amyloid PET) [101]; (2) with rare exceptions, amyloidosis
appears to be required for the detection of high levels of 3R/4R tau deposition with novel
tracers such as 18F-MK6240 [102,103]; (3) it is possible for abnormal Amyloid PET results to
be compatible with normal cognition, but the same is less likely for highly abnormal tau
PET [6,102]; and (4) AD is normally characterized ﬁrst by the appearance of amyloidosis and
later by tauopathy, with tauopathy being the proteinopathy mainly associated with clinical
symptoms, making tau PET more relevant for clinical symptom monitoring [102,103].
With that said, despite recent contentions in the ﬁeld regarding the validity of the amyloid
cascade hypothesis, measurements of Aβ burden in the brain remain widely used in clinical
trials involving patients with AD. Given the logistical and safety difﬁculties of acquiring
both Amyloid and tau PET and performing lumbar punctures, we decided to only obtain
the tau PET (also for the reasons discussed above), complemented by the collection of
peripheral blood samples for analyzing plasma Aβ40/42 levels.
The risks associated with this study include risks of the t-PBM and of the neuroimaging
procedures utilized. t-PBM has a favorable safety proﬁle as demonstrated by previous
studies [33,59–61]. Neuroimaging procedures (especially PET, which includes a radioactive
tracer) also carry a small safety risk. Extensive safety data will be collected (as described in
Section 2) to monitor and evaluate these risks.
Future study directions may include the implementation of additional blood work.
In upcoming studies, we plan to examine how central and peripheral mitochondrial
metabolism contributes to cognitive performances in clinical phenotypes of prodromal
AD and mild dementia due to AD in the context of t-PBM treatments. We will use novel
exosome analysis techniques to determine in vivo molecular biosignatures of brain mi-
tochondrial metabolism, with a focus on the mitochondrial metabolite acetyl-L-carnitine
(LAC). Speciﬁcally, we will measure key markers of LAC-related mitochondrial metabolism
in exosomes that are enriched for the L1 Cell Adhesion Molecule (L1CAM), a protein
highly expressed in the brain, at the following three time points: prior to the beginning
of t-PBM/sham, 1 week since the initiation of t-PBM/sham, and at the conclusion of
t-PBM/sham (i.e., 8 weeks since treatment initiation). In addition, we will enhance our
protocol to isolate exosomes enriched for speciﬁc brain areas/neurons of interest and
characterize their molecular cargo. We will achieve this by characterizing the transcrip-
tomic proﬁles in the response to t-PBM using unbiased RNAseq assays and bioinformatic
approaches. Next, we will measure peripheral LAC levels and the related mitochondrial
metabolism using mass-spectrometry. We will also assess peripheral insulin resistance,
which is a metabolic dysfunction that is regulated via LAC-related pathways. Lastly, we
will use computational approaches to determine the role of the novel biomarkers of t-PBM
responses in trajectories of functional connectivity.

Future studies may also want to investigate the effect of t-PBM on brain tau burden. In
the current study, we are only exploring whether the baseline tau burden predicts the t-PBM
response and are not following up with any post-treatment PET scans. If our hypothesis is
supported and t-PBM is found to improve memory and cognition in subjects with aMCI
and mild dementia due to AD, future research may elucidate the mechanism of action of
t-PBM by investigating changes in the tau or amyloid load as assessed with PET throughout
a course of treatment.
5. Conclusions
We are describing a large study testing t-PBM, a novel neuromodulation strategy, as
a potential treatment for aMCI and early AD. The importance of this study is three-fold:
(1) it targets aMCI and early AD, which are important initial stages of AD that lack adequate
approved treatments, (2) it evaluates the efﬁcacy and safety of t-PBM, an innovative, non-
invasive technology that has a well-established safety proﬁle, for improving brain function
and cognition at the aforementioned initial AD stages, and (3) it explores the association of
t-PBM treatment effects with important biomarkers relevant for AD illness progression. If
effects are conﬁrmed, the present study will both support short-term clinical development
of an easy-to-scale device for the treatment of aMCI and AD, and validate biomarkers for
the development of future, novel modulation strategies.
