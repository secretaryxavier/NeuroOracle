Abstract
Defining the mechanisms of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) persistence in the host macrophage and identifying
mycobacterial factors responsible for it are keys to better understand tuberculosis pathogenesis. The emerging picture from
ongoing studies of macrophage deactivation by Mtb suggests that ingested bacilli secrete various virulence determinants
that alter phagosome biogenesis, leading to arrest of Mtb vacuole interaction with late endosomes and lysosomes. While
most studies focused on Mtb interference with various regulators of the endosomal compartment, little attention was paid
to mechanisms by which Mtb neutralizes early macrophage responses such as the NADPH oxidase (NOX2) dependent
oxidative burst. Here we applied an antisense strategy to knock down Mtb nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) and
obtained a stable mutant (Mtb Ndk-AS) that displayed attenuated intracellular survival along with reduced persistence in
the lungs of infected mice. At the molecular level, pull-down experiments showed that Ndk binds to and inactivates the
small GTPase Rac1 in the macrophage. This resulted in the exclusion of the Rac1 binding partner p67phox from phagosomes
containing Mtb or Ndk-coated latex beads. Exclusion of p67phox was associated with a defect of both NOX2 assembly and
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to wild type Mtb. In contrast, Mtb Ndk-AS, which lost the capacity
to disrupt Rac1-p67phox interaction, induced a strong ROS production. Given the established link between NOX2 activation
and apoptosis, the proportion of Annexin V positive cells and levels of intracellular active caspase 3 were significantly higher
in cells infected with Mtb Ndk-AS compared to wild type Mtb. Thus, knock down of Ndk converted Mtb into a pro-apoptotic
mutant strain that has a phenotype of increased susceptibility to intracellular killing and reduced virulence in vivo. Taken
together, our in vitro and in vivo data revealed that Ndk contributes significantly to Mtb virulence via attenuation of NADPH
oxidase-mediated host innate immunity.

Introduction
The ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to adapt and thrive
intracellularly relies on a variety of strategies to alter mechanisms
of the host innate immunity. In particular, interference with
phagosome biogenesis was highlighted as a significant aspect of
Mtb persistence and replication within the macrophage [1,2].
How Mtb circumvents phagosomal acidity, bactericidal enzymes,
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) remains a central question for
many cellular microbiologists.
ROS are produced by the phagocyte NADPH oxidase (NOX2)
complex and were classified 30 years ago as powerful microbicidal
agents against many intracellular pathogens [3]. In vivo evidence
for the contribution of NOX2 to the innate immunity arsenal was
deduced from field observations of high susceptibility of chronic
granulomatous disease patients (CGD) to opportunistic pathogens
[4,5]. Such observations were experimentally confirmed in mouse
models of CGD [6,7]. Recent years have seen a growing body of
evidence to suggest a crucial role for ROS in the control of
mycobacterial infections [7]. In particular, one group has recently
identified Mtb nuoG as a potential virulence factor operating at the
level of NOX2 by mechanisms yet to be defined [8].
The NOX2 complex consists of two constitutively associated
transmembrane proteins, gp91phox and gp22phox and four cytosolic
subunits: p40phox, p47phox, p67phox, and Rac1, a small GTPase
[9]. Fully functional NOX2 requires membrane translocation of
p40phox, p47phox, active Rac1 (GTP-bound form) and p67phox, and
their assembly around gp91phox and gp22phox subunits [10].

cytosolic NADPH to phagosomal oxygen [9]. The production of
superoxide is in turn converted into several other microbicidal
molecules, such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, along
with peroxynitrite when combined with nitric oxide radicals [9].
While the role of NOX2 in innate immunity is well established,
several reports suggested that it might act beyond the control of
intracellular infections to trigger macrophage apoptosis [11,12], a
central event that paves the road to adaptive immunity [13–15].
Previous results from our laboratory identified Mtb nucleoside
diphosphate kinase (Ndk) as a GTPase Activating Protein (GAP)
acting on Rab5 and Rab7 GTPases, leading ultimately to reduced
phagolysosome fusion [16,17]. In the present study, we examined
whether Ndk GAP activity extends to other GTPases, with a
particular focus on Rho GTPases. We found that Mtb Ndk
interacts specifically with Rac1 and inactivates it leading to
inhibition of NOX2 assembly and activation in the macrophage.
We also established a link between Ndk-dependent NOX2
attenuation
and
inhibition
of
apoptosis
response
to
Mtb.
Consistent with these findings, Ndk knock down significantly
reduced Mtb survival in vitro and in vivo.
Results
Ndk contributes significantly to Mtb persistence
We recently showed that mycobacterial Ndk plays an essential
role in intracellular survival of the attenuated M. bovis BCG strain
by a mechanism dependent on phagosome maturation arrest [17].
To examine whether Ndk also contributes to survival of virulent
Mtb, we first attempted to generate an Ndk mutant in the Mtb
strain H37Rv using various methods, including a gene disruption
approach utilizing transducing mycobacteriophages [18]. Unfor-
tunately, ndkA gene disruption affected severely the growth of
bacteria. We therefore opted for protein knock down with mRNA
antisense, the only approach developed so far to study essential
genes in Mtb [19]. To do so, we transformed Mtb with the
integrative vector pJAK1.A, previously designed by us [20], to
express a stable full length antisense (or sense, control) mRNA
sequence to ndkA. Thus, we generated a strain (Mtb Ndk-AS) in
which Ndk protein expression was undetectable by western blot,
even after many passages in the absence of the selection marker
kanamycin, indicating a stable knock-down with the pJAK1.A
vector (Fig. 1A). Fortunately, Mtb Ndk-AS displayed a similar
growth profile to that of wild type Mtb and the control sense strain
(Mtb Ndk-S) in standard culture media (Fig. 1B), as well as in the
presence of oxidative stress (H2O2, Fig. S1). Thus potential fitness
disadvantage that could be associated with genetic manipulation of
Mtb are unlikely. Knock down of Ndk significantly affected Mtb
survival in RAW 264.7 macrophages to the extent that at 72 h
post infection, numbers of Mtb Ndk-AS dropped by 2 log colony-
forming units (CFUs), relative to the wild type or Ndk-S strains
(Fig. 1C). These findings suggested that the Ndk protein might
contribute to Mtb virulence in vivo. Virulence during the early
acute phase of infection is essentially controlled by innate immune
responses and can be rapidly assessed in the SCID mouse model
where innate immune responses are intact [21,22]. In this regard,
experiments of SCID mice infection by aerosol showed significant
reduction (,70%) of bacterial load in the lungs of Ndk-AS infected
animals compared to those infected with wild type and Ndk-S
strains (P = 0.002, unpaired t-test, Fig. 1D). Indicators of
morbidity were apparent in the mice within 6 weeks with no
significant difference between the three infection test groups (Fig.
S2). However, when infected subcutaneously, time to death was
extended to 12–15 weeks. Under these conditions, Kaplan Meier
survival analysis clearly demonstrated that animals inoculated with
Mtb Ndk-AS survived significantly longer (,20 days, P,0.0001)
than the control strain expressing Ndk sense mRNA, which caused
the death of mice at similar rates seen in mice infected with the
wild type strain (Fig. 1E). Taken together, these data demon-
strated clearly that Ndk contributes to Mtb survival in the host
through mechanisms that we have attempted to elucidate.
Mtb Ndk binds to Rac1 GTPase
Our recent findings that Ndk expresses GAP activity towards
Rab5 and Rab7 [17] suggested that this activity might extend to
other host GTPases. Therefore, we examined whether Ndk targets
macrophage Rho GTPases, known to play essential roles in early
events of innate immunity against intracellular pathogens [23,24].
To do so, macrophages were allowed to ingest Ndk-coated latex
beads and then cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation
with Ndk antibody. Proteins associated with Ndk were analyzed by
western blot with Rac1, Rho, or Cdc42 antibodies. The results
obtained showed that only Rac1 was interacting with Ndk within
the macrophage (Fig. 2A). Rac1 binding to Ndk was further
confirmed with reverse pull down experiments using Rac1
antibody and western blotting with Ndk antibody, which showed
clearly a physical association between Mtb Ndk and Rac1
(Fig. 2B). Results obtained with coated latex beads clearly
demonstrated the specificity of Ndk-Rac1 interactions within the
macrophage. Accordingly, we then examined Ndk-Rac1 interac-
tion in cells infected with the bacterium instead of beads and
showed that Rac1 antibodies are able to pull-down Ndk-Rac1
complexes from cells infected with wild type and Ndk-S but not
Ndk-AS Mtb (Fig. 2C)
Mtb uses Ndk as GAP activity towards macrophage Rac1
The results shown above (Fig. 2) suggested that Mtb Ndk must
cross the phagosomal membrane towards the cytosol to bind to
and inactivate Rac1. We first confirmed the hypothesis of cytosolic
translocation of Ndk using i) confocal microscopy analysis, which
showed diffused staining of Ndk distant from phagosomes
containing wild type and Mtb Ndk-S but not from those
containing Mtb Ndk-AS (Fig. S3A) and ii) immunogold staining
and EM analysis, which clearly demonstrated that Mtb Ndk

is
a
prerequisite for development of efficient strategies to
control TB disease. We have previously shown that Mtb

contributes
to
phagosome maturation arrest via inactivation of Rab5
and Rab7. In this study, we show that Ndk also targets and
inactivates the small GTPase Rac1, an essential component
of the macrophage NADPH oxidase (NOX2) complex. Ndk-
dependent inactivation of Rac1 was associated with
reduced NOX2-mediated production of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) and ROS-dependent apoptosis. Conversely,
disruption of Ndk expression converted Mtb into a mutant
strain that induces strong ROS and apoptosis responses.
This phenotype was associated with reduced survival of
Ndk mutant in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, our findings
demonstrate that Ndk contributes significantly to myco-
bacterial virulence.

effectively crosses the phagosomal membrane toward the cytosol
(Fig. S3B). We next examined the level of Rac1 activation in
infected macrophages with pull down experiments using binding
domain derived from Rac1 interacting protein (PAK-1 PBD),
which interacts with Cdc42 as well. We also examined levels of
Rho activation using Rho interacting protein (Rhotekin RBD).
These binding domains interact only with GTP-bound forms of
Rho GTPases [25]. Mtb infected RAW cells were exposed to LPS
in order to activate the Rho GTPases, then cell lysates were
examined for the amount of active Rac1, Rho, or Cdc42. Western
blot analyses with Rac1, Cdc42 and Rho antibodies demonstrated
that Mtb significantly inhibits the level of LPS-induced Rac1
activation (Fig. 3A, top panel). In contrast, Mtb had no
apparent effect on Cdc42 and Rho activation. This GAP activity
was also observed in macrophages ingesting Ndk-coated beads, as
opposed to Mtb bacilli, demonstrating a specific Ndk GAP activity
on Rac1 (Fig. 3A, lower panel).
To further examine Mtb effects on Rac1 and the phagosomal
events it regulates, we performed a time-course Rac1 activation
assay with macrophages infected by Mtb Ndk-AS and wild type
Mtb. The results obtained showed a dramatic reduction of active
Rac1 levels 15 min post infection and undetectable levels 1 h later

absence of selection marker kanamycin then lysed along with wild type Mtb in 50 mM Tris, 5 mM EDTA, 0.6% SDS in the presence of protease
inhibitors and 0.1 mm glass beads as described [17]. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis with Ndk and lipoamide
dehydrogenase (Lpd) antibodies. The latter was used to confirm loading of equal amounts of proteins. B. Growth curves comparing wild type, Ndk-S

thrice 2 h post infection to remove extracellular bacteria. Cells were reincubated in media plus gentamicin (50 mg/ml) and subsequently lysed in
0.025% SDS at the indicated post-infection time points. Serial dilutions of recovered Mtb were then plated on solid 7H10 media supplemented with
10% OADC and CFU counts were performed after 3 weeks incubation at 37uC. Results (mean CFU 6 SEM) correspond to 2 independent experiments.

determined. E. SCID mice were infected subcutaneously with 106 wild type, Ndk-S or Ndk-AS Mtb (n = 10 per group) and survival was monitored over
four months.

in macrophages infected with wild type Mtb (Fig. 3B, top
panel). In contrast, levels of active Rac1 remain unchanged in
macrophages infected with Mtb Ndk-AS (Fig. 3B, bottom
panel). Taken together, these data clearly demonstrated that Mtb
Ndk expresses GAP activity on both basal and induced Rac1-GTP
levels in the macrophage.
Ndk disrupts phagosomal recruitment of p67phox
Active Rac1 (GTP bound form) has been shown to translocate
to early phagosomes in order to facilitate recruitment of its binding
partner, the NOX2 subunit p67phox [26,27]. Given that Ndk
expresses GAP activity towards Rac1 (GTP into GDP switch), we
examined whether Mtb interferes with phagosomal recruitment of
p67phox. We first applied intracellular staining and confocal
microscopy to estimate the proportion of Rac1 and p67phox
positive phagosomes in Mtb-infected RAW cells. Results obtained
(Fig. 4A and 4B) showed a substantial reduction of Rac1 and
p67phox positive phagosomes (13% and 29% respectively) in cells
infected with live Mtb relative to those infected with killed Mtb
(86% Rac1 and 88% p67phox positive phagosomes, respectively).
In contrast, recruitment of p47phox to live Mtb phagosomes was
comparable to that of phagosomes containing killed Mtb. To
demonstrate that the NOX2 assembly defect is related to Ndk
GAP activity, we applied similar confocal analyses to cells infected
with Mtb Ndk-AS. The images (Fig. 4C and 4D) clearly showed
a restoration of Rac1 and p67phox recruitment to Mtb Ndk-AS
containing phagosomes to a level similar to those observed in cells
infected with killed Mtb (,% and 72% positive phagosomes,
respectively). As expected, much lower numbers of Rac1 and
p67phox positive phagosomes (13% and 30% respectively) were
observed in cells infected with control strain Mtb Ndk-S.
As an alternative approach, a previously developed quantita-
tive FACS analysis method [28] was used to assess the level of
NOX2 components on individual phagosomes. To adapt this
method
to mycobacterial phagosomes, macrophage plasma
membrane was stained with CellMask Deep Red (detectable by
FL4 channel), and then cells were infected with Mtb strains
expressing fluorescent DsRed protein (FL2). Following cell
disruption, mycobacteria included in cell membrane-derived
vacuoles (double FL2/FL4 positive events) were readily identified
by flow cytometry analysis (Fig. S4). Phagosome preparations
were then stained with Rac1 or p67phox antibodies and FITC-
conjugated secondary antibodies (FL1). Samples were subjected
to flow cytometry analysis and mean fluorescence intensities
(MFI) were deduced from fluorescence histograms. Results
obtained (Fig. 4E) showed higher recruitment of Rac1 and
p67phox to phagosomes containing Mtb Ndk-AS (MFI: 49.6 and
42.6 respectively) relative to phagosomes containing Mtb Ndk-S
(MFI: 25.3 and 21.8 respectively) or Mtb wild type (MFI: 23.9
and 15.7 respectively). To establish a direct link between Ndk
GAP activity and defective NOX2 assembly, additional flow
cytometry analyses were applied to phagosomes containing
coated beads (Fig. S5) and showed a marked decrease of Rac1
and p67phox recruitment to the Ndk bead phagosomes (MFI: 8.1
and 3.8 respectively) relative to control phagosomes containing
BSA-beads (MFI: 14.6 and 7.3 respectively). Taken together,
these findings showed for the first time that Mtb uses Ndk GAP
activity to disrupt phagosomal assembly of NOX2 via interfer-
ence with Rac1-dependent recruitment of p67phox.
Mtb Ndk inhibits the macrophage oxidative burst
Previous findings that Rac1 and p67phox subunits are essential
for NOX2 assembly and activation of gp91phox to generate
superoxide [10] suggested that disruption of Rac1/p67phox
translocation to the phagosome by Ndk would affect NOX2-
dependent ROS production. To verify this hypothesis, we applied
a luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assay to assess ROS
production in Mtb infected cells. Luminol is a membrane diffusible
reagent commonly used for quantitative detection of superoxide
anion radicals and hydrogen peroxide molecules. Bone marrow
derived macrophages (BMDM) from C57BL/6 mice were infected
with Mtb strains and assayed for kinetics of chemiluminescence
production over a period of 60 min. Relative luminescence profiles
obtained (Fig. 5A) revealed that cells infected with Mtb Ndk-AS
induced significantly higher amounts of ROS production (peak
value = 256 RLU) compared to those infected with wild type Mtb
or Mtb Ndk-S (peak value ,120 RLU). Thereafter, we confirmed
the apparent inhibitory effect of Ndk with experiments using
coated beads (Fig. 5B), which showed minor ROS response to
Ndk beads (peak value = 32 RLU) relative to ROS production
induced by BSA beads (peak value = 76 RLU). Additionally we
applied confocal microscopy to visualize intracellular accumula-
tion of ROS using CM-DCFDA, a cell-permeable probe that is
non-fluorescent until oxidized within the cell. Thus, in RAW cells
infected with Mtb Ndk-AS, the confocal images showed a strong
colocalization of oxidized CM-DCFDA (green fluorescence) with
bacterial phagosomes (red fluorescence) indicating accumulation
of large amounts of ROS around Mtb Ndk-AS (Fig. 5C and 5D).
Conversely, green signal was totally absent in cells infected with
either wild type Mtb or Mtb Ndk-S. This effect of Ndk on ROS
production was also reproduced when BMDM were used instead
(Fig. S6).
Previous studies reported that mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPKs) play an important role in the signaling pathway of
NOX2 activation [29,30]. To verify whether Ndk also interferes
with MAPK activation, macrophages were allowed to ingest Ndk-
beads or BSA-beads (control), and then stimulated with PMA or
LPS to activate ERK1/2, and p38MAPK respectively. Cell lysates
were then examined for the level of phospho-ERK1/2 and
phospho-p38MAPK, which reflects kinase activation. The western
blot results obtained (Fig. S7) did not reveal any changes in the
levels of kinase phosphorylation in cells infected with Ndk-beads
relative to those infected with BSA-beads. Therefore, Ndk effect
on NOX2 is clearly independent of MAPK inhibition.
Collectively, these experiments demonstrated that the macro-
phage oxidative response to Mtb is marginal and that knock down
of Ndk converts the bacterium into a potent inducer of the ROS
response.
Inhibition of NOX2 activity impairs apoptosis response to
Mtb infection
Mtb is known to inhibit macrophage apoptosis [14,15] by
mechanisms yet to be clarified. Based upon previous findings that
NOX2 activity might extend beyond intracellular killing to induce
apoptosis [8,14], we examined whether Mtb uses Ndk to disrupt
the NOX2-apoptosis link. First, we applied Annexin V cell surface
staining, a popular approach for detection of phosphatidylserine
(PS) translocation to the extracellular membrane leaflet, which
reflects early stages of apoptosis events [31]. Adherent RAW cells
on coverslips were infected with Mtb strains for 48 h then stained
with Alexa Fluor 488 conjugated Annexin V and examined by
confocal microscopy. The images showed very low numbers of
Annexin V positive cells in samples infected with wild type Mtb
and Mtb Ndk-S (5% and 6% positive, respectively). In contrast, a
higher number of Annexin V positive cells (44%) was observed in
samples infected with Mtb Ndk-AS (Fig. 6A, top panel). To
establish a direct link between ROS and apoptosis in infected cells,
Annexin V staining was repeated on macrophages exposed to Mtb

Ndk-AS in the presence of a specific gp91phox peptide inhibitor
(gp91 INH) or its control scrambled version (gp91 SCR) [32]. The
results obtained showed clearly that gp91 INH, but not gp91 SCR,
reversed completely Mtb Ndk-AS-induced PS translocation to the
cell surface (5% Annexin V positive, Fig. 6A, bottom panel).

antibodies and corresponding FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. Cells infected with killed Mtb showed clear yellow signals indicating

occurs during the final stages of apoptosis [33]. Thus, infected
macrophages were subjected to intracellular staining with antibody
to cleaved (i.e. active) caspase 3 and Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated
secondary antibody, then analyzed by FACS. Results obtained
(Fig. 6B) showed higher numbers of apoptotic macrophages in
sample tests infected by Mtb Ndk-AS (11.8% positive events)
relative to those infected with wild type Mtb or Mtb Ndk-S
(,4.6%). Not surprisingly, the wild type and Ndk-S strains
inhibited the spontaneous apoptosis observed in control non-
infected cells (7.3% positive cells). As expected, Mtb Ndk-AS-
induced caspase 3 cleavage was abolished in the presence of the
gp91phox inhibitor.
It is well known that apoptosis is also induced by nitric oxide
(NO) in mouse macrophages [34,35]. Therefore, the effect of Ndk
on macrophage apoptosis might be the result of simultaneous
inhibition of ROS and NO production. To verify this possibility
we examined IFN-c-induced NO production in cells infected with
Ndk-beads and BSA-beads (control) and the results deduced from
the Griess assay (Fig. S9) demonstrated that Ndk has no effect on
NO production.
Taken together, our data demonstrated that Mtb blocks
macrophage apoptosis by a mechanism dependent, at least in
part, on Ndk-mediated attenuation of NOX2 activity.
Ndk knock down increases Mtb susceptibility to ROS-
mediated intracellular killing
Results presented above (Fig. 6) together with initial experi-
ments showing attenuated Mtb Ndk-AS survival in RAW
macrophages (Fig. 1) suggested that Ndk-mediated inhibition of
ROS reduces the macrophage killing capability. To verify this
hypothesis, we repeated the survival assay using primary murine
macrophages in which ROS production was blocked with gp91
INH. At 72 h post-infection, control experiments showed a
significant reduction (,1.5 Log10) in CFU counts when infecting
with Mtb Ndk-AS relative to wild type or Ndk-S (Fig. 7A).
However, in the presence of gp91 INH, Ndk-AS survival was
restored to a level comparable to that of wild type Mtb at every
time point measured (Fig. 7B). These observations were validated

did not affect Ndk-AS survival. Taken together, these experiments

clearly demonstrated that down modulation of ROS production
by Ndk contributes significantly to Mtb persistence in the
macrophage.
Discussion
Previous studies from this laboratory showed that Mtb Ndk
exhibits GAP activity towards Rab5 and Rab7 leading ultimately
to diminished phagosomal recruitment of their respective effectors
EEA1 and RILP [16,17]. Defective recruitment of EEA1 and
RILP
correlated
with
reduced
maturation
of
phagosomes
containing Ndk mutant M. bovis BCG or Ndk-coated beads [17].
In the current study, we demonstrate that Ndk further enhances
Mtb virulence by additional GAP activity towards the Rho
GTPase Rac1. We provided direct evidence that Ndk blocks
phagosomal recruitment for both Rac1 and its partner molecule
Figure 6. Mtb Ndk inhibits ROS dependent macrophage apoptosis. A. RAW macrophages were infected for 48 h with the indicated Mtb
strains at MOI of 10:1. To block ROS production, gp91phox peptide inhibitor (gp91 INH) or its scrambled version (gp91 SCR) were added at 50 mM 1 h
prior to infection by Mtb Ndk-AS. Cells were then stained with Alexa Fluor 488-Annexin V and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Images are a merge
of bright field, red fluorescence (Mtb DsRed strains), and green fluorescence (Annexin V). Values in the top right corner indicate the percentage of
apoptotic cells. B. Macrophages were infected as described in A., and then stained for cleaved caspase 3 as described in materials and methods. Cells
with active caspase 3 were identified and quantified by FACS. Data are representative of two independent experiments.

p67phox leading ultimately to inhibition of NOX2-mediated ROS
production and ROS-mediated apoptosis. A link between Mtb
GAP activities and virulence was established with the observation
of reduced survival of Ndk mutant Mtb in vitro and in vivo.
Ndk is a ubiquitous small protein (,15 kDa) found in virtually
all organisms, from eukaryotes to prokaryotes. In Mtb, Ndk
catalyzes the production of nucleoside triphosphates as precursors
for RNA, DNA and polysaccharide synthesis, which are critical for
normal bacterial physiology [36]. This possibly explains why our
attempts to knock out the ndkA gene in Mtb were unsuccessful,
suggesting that Ndk is probably essential for Mtb growth.
Contrasting with this hypothesis, an effort to comprehensively
identify all genes required for Mtb growth using the transposon
site hybridization (TraSH) technique suggested that the Ndk gene
is not essential for Mtb growth [37]. However, as cautioned by the
authors of that study, TraSH is simply a screening tool and
therefore cannot provide a definitive conclusion about gene
essentiality. Indeed, several genes known to be essential for Mtb
growth, such as ideR [38], rmlD [39] and whiB2 [40] have not been
identified as essential by the TraSH approach. Thus, whether or
not Ndk is essential is a research question that is still open for
further investigation and remains beyond the scope of our current
study, which focused instead on deciphering the mechanisms by
which Ndk promotes Mtb survival in the host.
Mycobacterial Ndk has been shown to interact with and
inactivate recombinant Rho, Cdc42 and Rac1 proteins [41]. Here
Figure 7. Inhibition of ROS production prevents intracellular killing of Mtb Ndk-AS. A. BMDMs (56105/well) were infected with the
indicated Mtb strains (MOI of 10:1) and washed thrice 2 h post infection to remove extracellular bacteria. Thereafter, cells were reincubated in media
plus gentamicin (50 mg/ml) and lysed in 0.025% SDS at the indicated post-infection time points. Serial dilutions of recovered Mtb were then plated on
solid 7H10 media supplemented with 10% OADC and CFU counts were performed after 3 weeks incubation at 37uC. B. Similar experiment as in A., in
the presence or absence of 50 mM gp91phox inhibitor peptide (or its scrambled version) added 1 h prior to infection with Mtb Ndk-AS. Results (mean

we found that within the macrophage, both Mtb and recombinant
Ndk (delivered on the surface of latex beads) interact with and
inactivate native Rac1, but not Rho or Cdc42. This suggests that
results obtained from cell free systems do not always reflect host-
pathogen interactions in the whole cell system. Not surprisingly,
this type of discrepancy has been observed with other pathogens
that use GAP activities as a mechanism of virulence. For
instance, secreted YopE from Yersinia, and SptP from Salmonella
were shown to have GAP activity towards all three Rho GTPases
extracellularly. However, YopE acts only on Rac1 and RhoA,
[42] whereas SptP inactivates Rac1 and Cdc42, but not RhoA,
[43] in cultured cells. In the case of Yersinia, a recent study
established a direct link between YopE-mediated inactivation of
Rac1 and inhibition of ROS production [44] consistent with our
findings that selective Ndk GAP activity towards Rac1 is
sufficient
to
block
ROS
production
in
the
macrophage.
Inhibition of ROS production in nascent phagosomes has also
been reported in macrophages infected with the protozoan
Leishmania, an intracellular pathogen that is structurally and
metabolically distinct from Mtb, which interferes with NOX2 by
a mechanism independent of GAP activities [45]. Indeed,
Leishmania was shown to use its abundant surface lipopho-
sphoglycan to restrict phagosomal recruitment of both p47phox
and p67phox but not Rac1. Conversely, our study showed that
Ndk disrupts the recruitment of Rac1 and its binding partner
p67phox but not p47phox. The p47phox subunit contains a PRR
(Prolin Rich Region) at its C-terminus that binds with high
affinity to the C-terminal SH3 domain of p67phox in the cytosol
[46,47]. It also contains a PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain that
interacts specifically with membrane PI[3,4]P2 and phosphatidic
acid [48]. While the tail-to-tail association of p47phox and p67phox
plays a crucial role in NOX2 assembly [27], recent studies
showed that it is rapidly disrupted after membrane translocation
[49]. Therefore dissociated p47phox and p67phox would remain
separately attached to the phagosome via membrane lipids and
Rac1 respectively. This phagosomal configuration of NOX2
subunits is consistent with the specific dissociation of p67phox
from Mtb phagosomes as a result of Ndk-mediated Rac1
inactivation.
The overall emerging picture from ongoing studies of phago-
some remodelling by Mtb suggests that more than one virulence
determinant might act in concert to modulate a single event of
phagosome biogenesis. For instance, the cell wall glycolipid
lipoarabinomannan, which blocks the Ca2+ signaling pathway
[50], synergizes with the acid phosphatase SapM, which hydro-
lyzes PI[3]P [51], to abolish phagosome maturation processes that
are dependent on recruitment of EEA1. Such a synergism appears
to also be the case for mycobacterial interference with NOX2
activity on the phagosomal membrane. Indeed, a recent study
showed that the NuoG subunit of the type I NADH dehydroge-
nase also promotes Mtb interference with NOX2 activity, as
evidenced by increased levels of ROS on Mtb DnuoG phagosomes
[8]. However, the finding that NuoG is not secreted raises a
question about the mechanistic connection between distant NuoG,
contained within the bacterial cytosol, and NOX2 components on
the cytosolic face of the phagosome membrane. Conversely several
different groups have shown that Mtb Ndk is secreted [52–54],
suggesting that Ndk could translocate to the cytosolic surface of the
vacuole where it interacts with Rac1. In fact, our EM and confocal
data revealed that secreted Ndk crosses the phagosomal mem-
brane towards the cytosol. Consistent with these findings, previous
studies showed that live Mtb exports a variety of proteins and
glycolipids intracellularly [55–57], and that many of them cross
the phagosomal membrane towards the host cell cytosol to interact
with and inhibit critical regulators of phagosome biogenesis
[51,56,58]. A possible mechanism for the cytosolic translocation
of mycobacterial products is the generation of a semi-porous
phagosome membrane by the Mtb ESX-1 secretion system [59],
which was also shown to play an essential role in Mtb escape from
the phagosome in later stages of infection [60,61]. Therefore it is
possible that the ESX-1 secretion system also mediates transloca-
tion of Ndk to the cytosol.
A highly relevant finding from the present study is that Ndk
knock down converted virulent Mtb into an attenuated strain that
lost resistance to the hostile environment of the host cell. Indeed,
Mtb Ndk-AS infected cells were able to generate NOX2-
dependent ROS production and also to undergo apoptosis thus
ensuring maximal restriction of bacterial proliferation. In contrast,
virulent Mtb strains were shown to down-modulate apoptosis in
favor of necrosis [62,63], which releases viable intracellular bacilli
for further spreading of the infection and tissue damage during
active tuberculosis disease. The link between ROS production,
apoptosis and intracellular killing demonstrated in our study is
consistent with earlier findings that intracellular oxidative stress
induces phosphatidylserine externalization and increased caspase
3 activity [64,65], and that apoptosis induced by the Fas ligand
attenuates Mtb survival within the macrophage [66]. In addition
to restricting the niche for mycobacterial replication, macrophage
apoptosis contributes indirectly to the initiation of adaptive
immunity mediated by dendritic cells. Indeed, infected macro-
phages undergoing apoptosis shed vesicles loaded with bacterial
material (or apoptotic blebs) that prime dendritic cells for
enhanced presentation of mycobacterial antigen to T cells [13–
15].
In summary, while the role of Ndk in physiological processes has
been intensively investigated, its contribution to Mtb pathogenesis
has not been previously addressed. Our recent findings and
current investigations have extended the knowledge of the
biological effects of Ndk, to include inactivation of GTPase
effector functions in the macrophage, therefore highlighting a
novel strategy used by Mtb to circumvent host innate immunity

Bacteria
M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its derivative strains were grown in
Middlebrook 7H9 broth (BD Diagnostic Systems, Mississauga,
ON, Canada) supplemented with 10% (v/v) OADC (oleic acid,
albumin and dextrose solution; BD Diagnostic Systems) and
0.05% (v/v) Tween 80 (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37uC on standing
culture. Mtb Ndk-AS and Ndk-S were generated using our
integrative pJAK1.A plasmid (selection marker, kanamycin [17]
encoding the full length ndkA gene in sense and anti-sense
orientations as described [17]. To generate red-fluorescent
bacteria, Ndk-S, Ndk-AS, and wild type Mtb strains were
transformed with pSMT3 vector (selection marker, hygromycin)
encoding the DsRed protein as described [16].
Cell culture and infection
RAW 264.7 macrophages (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were
maintained in 10 cm diameter culture dishes (Corning Inc.,
Corning, NY) at a density of ,105 per cm2 in Endotoxin-free
DMEM containing 5% FCS and 1% each of L-glutamine,
penicillin-streptomycin mixture, HEPES, non-essential amino
acids (1006 solution, StemCell). Bone marrow derived macro-
phages (BMDM) were obtained by flushing out femurs and tibias
of 6–8 week old female C57BL/6 (Jackson Laboratory, Sacra-
mento, CA) according to protocols approved by the University of
British Columbia Animal Care and Use Committees. Cells were
then maintained in complete DMEM containing 10 ng/mL M-
CSF for 6 days. For macrophage infection, bacteria in mid-log
phase were harvested by 5 min centrifugation at 8,0006 g. They
were subsequently washed twice with 7H9 plus 0.05% tween and
passed several times through 25 gauge needles to break bacterial
clumps. Thereafter, numbers of bacteria were normalized by
optical density (OD600 1.0 = 36108 bacteria/ml) and adjusted for
the desired MOI. Macrophages were then exposed to Mtb strains
in complete media without antibiotic for 2 h at 37uC and then
washed thrice to remove extracellular bacteria. Cells were
reincubated in complete media plus gentamicin (50 ug/ml) for
the desired time periods.
Animal studies
Groups of 4- to 6-week old female Fox Chase SCID mice
(CB17/Icr-Prkdcscid/IcrCrl) were infected with ,150 bacteria by
inhalation using a Glas-Col inhalation exposure system (Terre
Haute, IN). Two mice from each group were processed on day 1
following infection to confirm bacterial deposition in the lung.
Remaining animals were monitored for signs of morbidity. Mice
were then euthanized and the bacterial load (CFUs) in the lung
was determined. Organs were homogenized and serial dilutions
plated in duplicate on nutrient 7H10 agar. In other experiments,
SCID mice were injected subcutaneously in the scruff of the neck
with 106 Mtb strains and then monitored for morbidity over a
period of ,15 weeks.
All animals were maintained in accordance with protocols
approved by the Animal Care and Use Committees at the
University of British Columbia. Experiments were approved by
the Animal Care and Usage Committees and performed according
to the Canadian Council on Animal Care Guidelines. The animal
assurance welfare number is A11-0247.
Preparation of recombinant Ndk and coating of latex
microspheres
Ndk was expressed as a C-terminal 66His tagged fusion protein
in E. coli strain BL21 and purified using Ni-NTA purification resin
(Qiagen) as described [17]. The purity of eluted Ndk was
confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.
S10A). Rabbit Ndk antibody was generated by GenScript, using
KLH conjugated ELASQHYAEHEGK peptide fragment corre-
sponding to amino acids 44 to 56 of Mtb Ndk. The specificity of
Ndk antibody is shown in Fig. S10B. Ndk or the control BSA
were non-covalently linked to latex beads as described [17].
Fluorescence microscopy
Coverslips were mounted on microscope slides and examined
by digital confocal microscopy as described [17].
Immunoelectron microscopy
Immunogold staining was conducted at the EM Facility of the
James Hogg Research Centre (Saint Paul Hospital, Vancouver,
BC, Canada). In brief, Mtb-infected macrophages were fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in 4% low melting point
agarose and dehydrated in ethanol. Samples were then transferred
to LR White resin. After polymerization at 50uC, 60 nm sections
were cut with a Leica EM UC6 microtome (Leica Microsystems,
Switzerland) and collected on nickel grids. Samples were labelled
with Ndk antibodies then F(ab9)2 of ultra-small goat-anti-rabbit
IgG (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Sections were
then post-fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and subjected to silver
enhancement for gold labeling with Silver R-Gent SE-EM
(Aurion, Wageningen, Netherlands). Samples were then washed
in distilled water, stained in 2% uranyl acetate, washed again, air
dried and examined with a Tecnai 12 electron microscope (FEI
Company, Hillsboro, OR).
Rho GTPase activation assay
Confluent RAW cells seeded on 6 cm plates were infected by
Mtb strains for 1 h at a MOI of 20:1. Thereafter, cells were
incubated in the presence of 200 ng/ml LPS for 15 min to induce
Rho GTPase activation. Subsequently, cells were lysed in cold
buffer containing 30 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 100 mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol, 1% Triton X100, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, and
1 mM PMSF. Soluble protein fractions were analyzed for levels
active Rho-GTPases by using a Rac/Rho/Cdc42 activation assay
kit (Millipore).
ROS detection assay
Macrophages were cultured in complete DMEM in 96 well
white plates (Corning) at 105 per well. Prior to ROS assay, cell
media was replaced with DMEM without phenol red and luminol
was added to a final concentration of 50 mM. Wells were then
infected with Mtb strains (MOI 10:1) or coated beads (MOI 5:1).
Thereafter, plates were loaded into a Tropix TR717 microplate
luminometer (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA) adjusted to 37uC
and relative luminescence was then measured at 60 sec intervals
over 60 min. Intracellular detection of ROS was achieved by
incubating adherent macrophages to cover slips with 10 mM CM-
DCFDA for 30 min at 37uC prior to infection with Mtb strains
expressing
DsRed.
Cells
were
then
analyzed
by
confocal
microscopy.
BMDMs, but not RAW cells, were primed with LPS (100 ng/
ml, 48 h) prior to ROS assays because expression of fully
functional NOX2 complex in BMDMs requires priming with
LPS or TNFa [67,68].
Apoptosis assays
Adherent RAW cells on coverslips were infected with Mtb
strains. At 48 h post phagocytosis, cells were washed twice with
cold PBS and then incubated in Alexa Fluor 488 Annexin V (1:20,

Invitrogen) in staining buffer containing 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4),
140 mM NaCl, and 2.5 mM CaCl2, for 20 min at room
temperature. Coverslips were then analyzed by confocal micros-
copy. Alternatively, infected cells were scraped and fixed in PBS
plus 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. Cells
were then washed with PBS and incubated with anti-cleaved
caspase-3 (1:250) in permeabilization buffer (0.1% Triton X100
and 1% BSA in PBS) for 20 min at room temperature. Thereafter,
cells were washed and stained with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated
goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200) for 20 min at room temperature,
washed again and analyzed by FACS.

FACS analysis of Mtb phagosomes. Macrophage cell
surface is labelled with CellMask Deep Red (detectable by FL4
channel) at 0.2 mg/ml for 5 min at 37uC prior to infection with
DsRed mycobacteria (FL2). Then cells are treated with Trypsin-
EDTA to remove non-ingested but partially attached bacteria.
Thereafter, cells are homogenized in 20 mM HEPES buffer,
pH 7.4 containing at, 0.25% sucrose, 0.1% BSA, and 0.5 mM
EGTA. Homogenates were then centrifuged at 3006 g for 2 min
to remove nuclei and intact cells and the upper fractions were
collected and centrifuged at 3,2006 g for 10 min at 4uC. The
pellets correspond to crude phagosome preparations where
bacteria included in cell membrane-derived vacuoles (double
FL2/FL4 positive events) are readily distinguished from both cell
debris and free bacteria released from disrupted vacuoles. Thus,
phagosome preparations can be stained with specific antibodies
followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies and levels of
phagosomal markers (FL1 histograms) can be easily determined by
FACS.
