Abstract
Background: Network is a useful way for presenting many types of biological data including protein-protein
interactions, gene regulations, cellular pathways, and signal transductions. We can measure nodes by their network
features to infer their importance in the network, and it can help us identify central elements of biological
networks.
Results: We introduce a novel Cytoscape plugin cytoHubba for ranking nodes in a network by their network
features. CytoHubba provides 11 topological analysis methods including Degree, Edge Percolated Component,
Maximum Neighborhood Component, Density of Maximum Neighborhood Component, Maximal Clique Centrality
and six centralities (Bottleneck, EcCentricity, Closeness, Radiality, Betweenness, and Stress) based on shortest paths.
Among the eleven methods, the new proposed method, MCC, has a better performance on the precision of
predicting essential proteins from the yeast PPI network.
Conclusions: CytoHubba provide a user-friendly interface to explore important nodes in biological networks. It
computes all eleven methods in one stop shopping way. Besides, researchers are able to combine cytoHubba with
and other plugins into a novel analysis scheme. The network and sub-networks caught by this topological analysis
strategy will lead to new insights on essential regulatory networks and protein drug targets for experimental
biologists. According to cytoscape plugin download statistics, the accumulated number of cytoHubba is around
6,700 times since 2010.
Background
Recent breakthroughs in high-throughput techniques
lead experimental data deluges in genomics, proteomics,
transcriptomics, metabolomics and interactomics. These
data can be represented as networks, in which the nodes
as surrogates for proteins, metabolites, or transcripts, are
connected by edges to show the interactions, reactions,
or regulations among nodes. Network analysis can help
us understand the function of an individual node and the
collaboration between other nodes. For example, network
centralities rank nodes of a biological network according
to a given importance concept, and Jeong et al. applied
this method on a protein-protein interaction network of
baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) [1]. They found
that the degree of a protein correlates with the essential-
ity of its gene; in other word, proteins with higher
degrees are more likely to be essential proteins.
Cytoscape [2] is an open platform with many plugins to
expand both the visualization options and the network
analysis power. Via Cytoscape, the graphical view of a net-
work is easy accessed, and multiple layers of information
including large-scale, genome-wise experiments, and pro-
tein function annotations can be granted on the interac-
tome. Several Cytoscape plugins can score and rank the
nodes by network features. For example, NetworkAnalyzer
[3] and CentiScaPe [4] computes various topological net-
work parameters for undirected and/ or directed networks.

These plugins provide more centrality measures than
other commonly used, but some other important features
and recent developed methods are not included. Different
methods focus on different topological features, or similar
features with different scoring strategies. To make the net-
work analysis easier for biologists to utilize more network
features, we compose cytoHubba plugin to execute our
newly developed algorithms and several popular algo-
rithms. The enhanced node retrieving function in cyto-
Hubba control panel helps researchers to search and
explore the network and to extract user interesting
subnetwork.
Results and discussion
The Usage of cytoHubba
CytoHubba provides a simple interface to analyze a net-
work with eleven scoring methods. First, scores from all
eleven methods are granted to each node in a preloaded
PPI network by executing “compute hubba result” func-
tion in the cytoHubba options in cytoscape menu bar
[plugins]. Next, top-ranked nodes of a particular scoring
method are retrieved from the cytoHubba tab in Cytos-
cape control panel, listed in the result panel, and the sub-
graph of these selected nodes are shown in the main win-
dow with a color scheme from highly essential (red) to
essential (green). The sub-graph of essential nodes is
extendable to include nodes that directly interact with
these top-ranked nodes by the option of “check first stage
node“ in control panel | hubba. Network topological fea-
tures of nodes are retrievable in the data panel as options
of node attributes. Tutorials and demo video are available
in the website (http://hub.iis.sinica.edu.tw/cytohubba).
An example of cytoHubba result using the Cytoscape
example dataset galFiltered.cys is shown in Figure 1.
CytoHubba control panel is also a handy tool to
retrieve subnetwork from the whole big PPI set. A list
of nodes can be extracted by an ID list from the whole
hubba-computed network. This manipulation can be
extended to include direct linking partners (check on
the option “check first stage node”), saved, and re-sub-
mitted to cytoHubba to evaluate the node essentiality on
the selected sub-network. For those nodes with no

direct link in between, cytoHubba provides a shortest
path detection tool (“display the shortest path” on the
display option). All connectible but not direct connected
node pairs in a network, retrieved either by ID search or
by top-ranked in topological feature score, are con-
nected by dotted-lines with number of the smallest edge
number (shortest path) to make this link. The stepping-
stone nodes and edges composing the shortest path will
be expanded by a mouse right-click action. Comparing
with the other cytoscape plugin ShortestPath which
sketches the path between two nodes [5], cytoHubba
fetches the shortest path among a group of nodes. This
abstractive view provides the distance among essential
nodes.
The performance
The studies of protein-protein interactions will be more
powerful when the interactome coverage increases. How-
ever, the complexity of the network will also increase,
that always hampers computation tasks. After the optimi-
zation on the programs, cytoHubba is able to complete all
eleven analysis of a small network (e.g. 330 nodes, 360
edges), a middle size one (7,600 nodes, 20,000 edges) and
a large set (11,500 nodes, 33,600 edges) in few seconds,
around 30 seconds and few minutes, respectively, on a
common desktop/ notebook (Cytoscape version 2.6.x /
2.7.x / 2.8.x on Window 7/8 platform; hardware spec as
Intel i7, 8 GB of RAM). CytoHubba has been updated
several times since 2009 (from v1.0 to v1.6). It is freely
accessible in Cytoscape App store (http://apps.cytoscape.
org/apps/cytohubba). The accumulated downloading
number is around 6,500 (http://chianti.ucsd.edu/cyto_-
web/plugins/plugindownloadstatistics.php, statistics on
May 2014). And it is used widely to analyze cancer meta-
bolic network[6], innate immune network[7], complex
biofilm communities[8] and so on.
Validation by Predict yeast essential proteins
We use cytoHubba to score all proteins in the yeast pro-
tein interaction network by the eleven methods. DIP
database (http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu, version: 20140117)
is composed of 4,908 proteins and 21,732 interactions
after removing self-interactions and redundant records.
The essential protein lists are collected from Saccharo-
myces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP) and Saccharo-
myces Genome Database (SGD). There are 1,122 and
1,280 proteins defined as essential proteins by SGDP and
SGD respectively. We use the union set (1,297 proteins)
for verifying the performance of the predictions.
The statistics of yeast PPIs are shown in Table 1. Twenty
three percent (=1148/4908) of the proteins in this network
are defined as essential proteins in the dataset. We call a
node is high-degree if the number of its neighbors is greater
than a threshold; otherwise we call it a low-degree node,
where the threshold is the maximum integer such that
2 ×

v∈V,Deg(v)>t Deg(v) >

v∈V Deg(v). The threshold
of the PPI network (DIP 20140117) used in this paper is 21.
As shown as Table 1, there are 4,396 proteins in low-degree
category and 512 proteins in high-degree category, in which
908 proteins and 214 proteins are essential proteins.
Table 2 shows the performance (precision of predic-
tion) to predict essential proteins in top × ranked node
identified by each method. In most methods, the preci-
sion decreases when the selected number increase.
Besides, a local-based method is better than global-
based method in discovering yeast essential proteins. To
further understand the preference of network feature
selected by different methods, we compare the number
of proteins in common in the top 100 ranked of any
two scoring methods (Table 3). The top 100 ranked list
of Closeness is most identical to the result of Radiality
(99%), indicate that the network features detected by
these two methods are very similar. MCC shares less
common components to other methods (less than 30%).
The top 100 ranked proteins suggested by DMNC do
not appear in other methods’ list except MCC (30%),
means this method detect different features from the
other ten methods.
As shown as Table 1, in the yeast PPIs, 21% of pro-
teins in low-degree category are essential proteins and
42% of proteins are essential proteins in high-degree
category. Accordingly, if we pick a protein randomly
from the high-degree pool, the probability that an essen-
tial protein being chosen is 0.42, and 0.21 from a low-
degree protein pool respectively. Table 4 is the number
of essential proteins found in the top × list with low-
degree feature. For example, among the top 30 protein
ranked by DMNC, 29 proteins are in the low-degree
category, in which 21 out of 29 proteins are essential
proteins. Methods except DMNC, MCC and EcCentri-
city tend to assign higher scores to a node when it owns
more neighbors while almost no any low-degree pro-
teins are found in their top × list. In other word, these
methods cannot find low-degree essential proteins.
Conclusions
In this study, we implement our network scoring meth-
ods, MCC, MNC and DMNC, and eight other popular

methods into a Cytoscape plugin, cytoHubba. Through
the extendable, flexible and modulated properties of
Cytoscape, cytoHubba can work together with other plu-
gins. The computing processes had been optimized and
can complete all eleven analysis on a common desktop/
notebook in a reasonable time cost. We also improve
the network retrieving function in cytoHubba control
panel. Therefore, users can utilize a PPIs network from
public domain and extract sub-networks based on users’
domain-knowledge.

Among the 11 methods, the newly proposed method
MCC performs better than the others. MCC captures
more essential proteins in the top ranked list in both
high-degree and low-degree proteins. Another method,
DMNC, catches different set of essential proteins sug-
gesting it scores the network in different way. Since the
biological network is heterogeneous, it is reasonable to
use more than one method for catching essential pro-
teins. We hope this handy tool can serve as good start-
ing points to new therapies and novel insights in
understanding basic mechanisms controlling normal cel-
lular processes and disease pathologies.
Methods
Implementation
The cytoHubba plugin is implemented in Java, based on
the Cytoscape API. The plugin implements eleven node
ranking methods to evaluate the importance of nodes in a
biological network including Degree [1], Edge Percolated
Component [9], Maximum Neighborhood Component
[10], Density of Maximum Neighborhood Component
[10], Maximal Clique Centrality (proposed in this paper),
Bottleneck [11], EcCentricity [12], Closeness [13], Radiality
[14], Betweenness [15], and Stress [16]. Each method is
associated with a function F which assigns every node v a
numeric value F(v). We say that the ranking of a node u is
greater than that of another node v if the score of u (i.e.
F(u)) is greater that of v (i.e. F(v)). The 11 methods can be
divided into two major categories: local and global meth-
ods. To calculate the score of a node within a network, a
local rank method only considers the relationship between
the node and its direct neighbors; on the other hand, the
global method examines the relationship between the
node and the entire network.

The algorithms
A. Local-based Methods
Here we state notations used for describing these meth-
ods. We assume that a biological network G = (V, E) is
an undirected network, where V is the collection of
nodes within the network and E is the edge set. We can
use another notation G = (V(G), E(G)) to represent a
network, where V(G) is the collection of nodes in a net-
work G, and E(G) is the collection of edges in a network
G. For a set S, we use |S| to denote its cardinality (i.e.
the number of elements in the set).
Local based method only considers the direct neigh-
borhood of a vertex. Given a node v, N(v) denotes the
collections of its neighbors. There are four local based
methods shown as follows:
1. Degree method (Deg)
Deg(v)=|N(v)|.
2. Maximum Neighborhood Component (MNC)
MNC(v) = |V(MC(v))|, where MC(v) is a maximum
connected component of the G[N(v)] and G[N(v)] is the
induced subgraph of G by N(v).
3. Density of Maximum Neighborhood Component
(DMNC)
Based on MNC, Lin et. al. proposed DMNC(v) = |E
(MC(v))|/ |V(MC(v))|ε, where ε = 1.7 [10].
4. Maximal Clique Centrality (MCC)
To increase the sensitivity and specificity, we propose
MCC to discover featured nodes. The intuition behind MCC
is that essential proteins tend to be clustered in a yeast pro-
tein-protein interaction network [17]. Given a node v, the
MCC of v is defined asMCC (v) =

C∈S(v) (|C| −1)!,
where S(v) is the collection of maximal cliques which contain
v, and (|C|-1)! is the product of all positive integers less than |
C|. If there is no edge between the neighbors of the node v,
then MCC(v) is equal to its degree.
B. Global-based methods
In cytoHubba we implement six node ranking methods
based on shortest paths and one method based percolated
connectivity. Before we introduce the shortest based meth-
ods, let us introduce some notation. The length of a shortest
path between nodes u and v is denoted as dist(u, v). Let C(v)
be the component which contains node v. The dist(u, v) is
equal to infinite if C(v) ≠C(w), and it makes methods of
this category cannot be applied to networks with discon-
nected components. To overcome this problem, we
enhance the original methods [11-16], and the score of a
node in a connected network computed by enhanced
method is the same as that computed by original one.

2. EcCentricity (EC)

max{dist(v, w) : w ∈C(v)}

where ΔC(v) is the maximum distance between any two
vertices of the component C(v).
4. BottleNeck (BN)
Let Ts be a shortest path tree rooted at node s.
BN(v) = 
s∈V ps(v)where ps(v) = 1 if more than |V(Ts)|/
4 paths from node s to other nodes in Ts meet at the
vertex v; otherwise ps(v) = 0.
5. Stress (Str)
Str(v) = 
s̸=t̸=v∈C(v) σst(v), where sst (v) is the number
of shortest paths from node s to node t which use the
node v.

, where sst is the number of
shortest paths from node s to node t.
7. Edge Percolated Component (EPC)
Given a threshold (0 ≤the threshold≤1), we create
1000 reduced networks by assigning a random number
between 0 and 1 to every edge and remove edges if
their associated random numbers are less than the
threshold.
Let the Gk be the reduced network generated at the kth
time reduced process. If nodes u and v are connected in
Gk, set δk
vt to be 1; otherwise δk
vt=0. For a node v in G,
EPC(v) is defined as EPC(v) = 1

The demo dataset and evaluation
Database of Interacting Proteins used in this study is
from DIP database ([18])(http://dip.doe-mbi.ucla.edu,
version: 20140117). Essential protein lists are collected
from Saccharomyces Genome Deletion Project (SGDP)
[19] and Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD) [20].
The protein ID match table from Uniprot ID to NCBI
gene id is downloaded from Uniprot ftp site.
The PPI network is loaded to cytoscape and calculated
by 11 methods using cytoHubba plugin. Precision of
each method is estimated by the performance of the
method to include essential proteins in the top × ranked
list (x = 10, 20, 30 ..... 100) by Precision:
Precision =
the number of essential proteins
the number of proteins in top × ranked proteins
