Abstract 
Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the effect of surface treatment with Er:YAG laser on shear bond streng-
th (SBS) of orthodontic brackets to fi ber-reinforced composite (FRC). 
Study Design: Ninety human premolars were randomly divided into six groups of 15. FRC bars were bonded to 
the teeth with a À owable composite (FC) and then underwent following treatments. In group 1 no further treatment 
was performed. In group 2 the FRC surfaces were covered by FC. An Er:YAG laser was employed to treat FRCs 
in groups 3 ( 200 mJ/10 Hz) and 4 (300 mJ/15 Hz). The FRC strips in groups 5 and 6 were fi rst covered by FC and 
then irradiated with Er:YAG laser at 200 mJ/10 Hz (group 5) or 300 mJ/15 Hz (group 6). Stainless steel brackets 
were bonded to FRCs using a light-cure adhesive system. After 24 hours, the samples were tested for SBS and the 
adhesive remnant index (ARI) scores were determined. 
Results: There was a signifi cant difference in SBS among the study groups (P <0.001). Pairwise comparisons in-
dicated that SBS was signifi cantly lower in group 1 compared to all other groups (p<0.05) except group 2. Bond 
strength in group 6 was signifi cantly greater than all the study groups (p<0.05) except group 5. No signifi cant di-
fference was found in ARI scores among the groups.
Conclusions: Covering the FRC surface by a layer of À owable composite and then application of Er:YAG laser at 
300 mJ/15 Hz could be recommended to increase bond strength of orthodontic attachments to FRC.

Introduction
Fiber reinforced composite (FRC) is a combination of 
long continuous fi bers and a bisphenol-a-glycidyl dime-
thacrylate (Bis-GMA) matrix, which provides optimal 
mechanical properties such as high À exural and fracture 
strength and adequate À exural modulus (1-2). FRC offers 
an esthetic metal-free alternative for many applications 
in dentistry including periodontal splints, endodontic 
posts and fi xed prosthodontic appliances, and it can be 
employed for stabilizing traumatized teeth (3-5). FRC 
can also be used for retention, space maintenance, an-
chorage and active tooth movement during orthodontic

The effect of Er:YAG laser treatment on bracket bonding to FRC
applied on the etched enamel and polymerized for 20 
seconds by a halogen light-curing unit (Australis 7; Ivo-
clar Vivadent). Afterwards, a layer of Àowable compo-
site (Heliomolar Flow, Ivoclar Vivadent) was placed on 
the enamel surface. A FRC bar was then pressed on the 
Àowable composite at the center of the crown and the 
excess resin was removed with an explorer. The speci-
men was cured with the Australis 7 unit at the light in-
tensity of 700 mW/cm2 for 40 seconds (20 seconds from 
the mesial and 20 seconds from the distal margins). 
Group 2: The teeth in group 2 were etched with 37% 
phosphoric acid gel for 30 seconds, rinsed with water 
and air-dried. A thin layer of bonding agent (Tetric N-
Bond; Ivoclar Vivadent) was applied on the etched ena-
mel, polymerized for 20 seconds and then covered by a 
layer of Àowable composite (Heliomolar Flow, Ivoclar 
Vivadent). Afterwards, a FRC bar was placed on the 
Àowable composite at the center of the crown and the 
excess resin was removed. The FRC-composite combi-
nation was then cured for 5 seconds, followed by the 
application of another layer of Àowable resin to com-
pletely cover the fiber. Final curing was performed with 
the Australis 7 unit at the intensity of 700 mW/cm2 for 
40 seconds (20 seconds from the mesial and 20 seconds 
from the distal margins).
Group 3: In this group, the bonding procedure was per-
formed similar to that described in group 1 and then an 
Er:YAG laser (wavelength 2940 nm; Smart 2940 D, 
Deka Laser, Firenze, Italy) was applied for FRC surface 
treatment. The laser was held manually and operated at 
200 mJ of energy, very short pulse, and frequency of 
10 Hz with the use of air and water spray. The beam 
was irradiated in a focused non-contact mode at a distan-
ce of 5 mm and perpendicular to the FRC surface. The 
bonding area was treated for 10 seconds using scanning 
movements.
Group 4: The bonding procedure and FRC treatment 
was similar to that described in group 3, except that the 
Er:YAG laser was employed at 300mJ of energy and 
pulse frequency of 15 Hz.
Group 5: After placing FRC on the tooth surface, the 
composite-FRC combination was cured for 5 seconds 
and then the FRC bar was thoroughly covered by a thin 
layer of Àowable composite as described in group 2. 
After 40 seconds of light curing, the Er:YAG laser was 
employed for 10 seconds using very short pulse, 200 mJ 
of energy and frequency of 10 Hz.
Group 6: The bonding procedure and FRC surface 
treatment was similar to group 5, except that 300 mJ of 
energy and pulse frequency of 15 Hz were employed.
Stainless steel standard edgewise maxillary central inci-
sor brackets (0.018-in slot, 3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, 
USA) were used in all the experimental groups. The 
FRC surface was coated by a thin layer of Transbond 
XT primer (3M Unitek) and light-cured for 10 seconds. 
treatment (6-8). From the orthodontic point of view, the 
great advantages of FRCs include easy and fast bonding 
technique with no need to laboratory work, biocompa-
tibility, excellent mechanical properties, esthetics, and 
reducing the need for bands, brackets and wires (1,9). 
When employed as an anchorage or a tooth movement 
unit, several teeth are connected to each other by a FRC 
bar to produce a single rigid segment, and then an or-
thodontic bracket, tube or hook is directly bonded to 
the FRC connecting bar (6). There are a few studies re-
garding the bond strength of orthodontic attachments to 
FRCs and the results of previous studies in this field are 
controversial.
Since the introduction of Er:YAG (erbium-doped: yt-
trium aluminum garnet) laser into dentistry in 1997, it 
has been employed for different purposes; one of them 
is surface preparation of dental materials and tooth tis-
sues. Recent experiments investigated the efficacy of 
erbium family (Er:YAG and Er,Cr:YSGG) lasers for et-
ching dentin and enamel (10-14), surface roughening of 
composite restorations to enhance bonding (15-16), and 
bracket base reconditioning (17-19). According to the 
authors’ knowledge, Er:YAG laser has not been emplo-
yed to date for FRC surface treatment. Considering the 
effectiveness of erbium lasers in roughening the surface 
(20) and increasing micromechanical retention (17-18), 
it seems that laser conditioning can be employed as a way 
to enhance bond strength of orthodontic attachments to 
FRC bars. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the 
effect of FRC surface treatment with Er:YAG laser on 
shear bond strength (SBS) and mode of bond failure of 
orthodontic brackets.
Material and Methods 
Ninety freshly extracted human upper premolars were 
collected and stored in distilled water at room tempera-
ture until required. The selected teeth were intact with 
no caries, enamel cracks, or other developmental de-
fects. The teeth were randomly divided into six groups 
of 15 each.
The FRC bars (Quartz Splint Woven, RTD, France) used 
in this study were 0.4 mm in diameter and were cut into 
lengths of 4 mm by scissors. The glass fibers were pre-
impregnated with a proprietary resin matrix from the 
manufacturer.
Before bonding, the facial surfaces of the teeth were 
cleansed using a non-Àuoridated pumice slurry and rub-
ber prophylactic cups, rinsed with water and air-dried. 
The treatment procedures in the study groups were as 
follows:
Group 1: The buccal enamel was etched by application 
of a 37 per cent phosphoric acid gel for 30 seconds, tho-
roughly rinsed with water and dried with an oil-free air 
source. A thin layer of bonding agent (Tetric N-Bond; 
Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) was later

The effect of Er:YAG laser treatment on bracket bonding to FRC
Then the bracket base was covered by Transbond XT 
adhesive and firmly pressed to the FRC surface. The ex-
cess adhesive was removed from the periphery of the 
base with an explorer and light-polymerization was per-
formed with the curing unit for 40 seconds (20 seconds 
from the mesial side and 20 seconds from the distal side 
of the bracket base).
After bonding, the specimens were stored in distilled 
water for 24 h at room temperature. Then each tooth was 
embedded in self-curing acrylic resin using a custom-
made mounting guide so that the bracket base was para-
llel to the direction of the debonding force. Shear bond 
strength of the FRC-bracket interface was measured in 
an Instron Universal Testing Machine (Santam, model 
STM-20, Iran) using cross head speed of 1 mm/min. The 
force at failure point was recorded in newtons (N) and 
subsequently converted to megapascals (N/mm2) by di-
viding the force by the surface area of the bracket base 
(12.51 mm2).
The fracture sites were examined under a stereomicros-
cope at ×10 magnification to determine the amount of 
adhesive left on the tooth according to the adhesive rem-
nant index (ARI) of Artun and Bergland (21): Score 0, no 
adhesive remained on the tooth; score1, less than 50% of 
the adhesive remained on the tooth; score 2, more than 
50% of the adhesive remained on the tooth; score 3, the 
entire adhesive remained on the tooth with distinct im-
pression of the bracket base.
Statistical analysis: The normal distribution of the data 
was confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the 
homogeneity of variances by the Levene’s test.  One-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was run to deter-
mine any significant difference in bond strength among 
the study groups followed by Duncan post-hoc test for 
paierwise comparisons. The difference in ARI scores 
among the six groups was assessed by Fisher’s exact 
test. The statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 
(Statistical Package for Social Sciences, Version 16.0, 
Chicago, IL, USA) software and the significance level 
was set at P<0.05.
Results
Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics and the results 
of statistical analyses for comparison of bond strength 
values among the study groups. The highest SBS (10.9 
± 0.95 MPa) was related to group 6 in which the thin 
layer of Àowable composite on the FRC bar was treated 
by Er:YAG laser using 300 mJ of energy and frequency 
of 15 Hz. The lowest SBS belonged to group 1 (8.29 ± 
0.84 MPa) in which neither the FRC surface was cove-
red by Àowable composite nor Er:YAG laser treatment 
was performed.
ANOVA demonstrated a significant difference in bond 
strength values among the study groups (P=0.009; Table 
1). Pairwise comparisons by Duncan test revealed that 
SBS was significantly lower in group 1 compared to all 
other groups (p<0.05) except group 2 (Table 1). Cove-
ring the FRC surface by a layer of Àowable composite 
and then application of Er:YAG laser at 300 mJ/15 Hz 
(group 6) resulted in significantly higher bond streng-
th compared to the other study groups (p<0.05) except 
group 5 in which 200 mJ/10 Hz was employed for surfa-
ce treatment of resin composite over the FRC bar.
The ARI scores of the study groups are shown in Table 
2. In all groups, score 1 was dominant, indicating that 
failure site was mainly at the FRC-adhesive interface.

The effect of Er:YAG laser treatment on bracket bonding to FRC
ARI score 2, which represents failure site at the bracket-
adhesive interface, was also prevalent in groups 5 and 6. 
Fisher’s exact test did not reveal any significant differen-
ce in the distribution of ARI scores among the various 
groups (P=0.15).
Discussion
Bond strength between attachments and FRCs should be 
high enough to resist intraoral forces during orthodon-
tic treatment. The present study proved the efficacy of 
Er:YAG laser in surface conditioning of FRC bars as 
represented by the significant increase in bond strength 
of orthodontic brackets. A Àowable composite was used 
for bonding FRCs to the teeth in this study, because of 
its higher viscosity compared to the light-cure or no-mix 
adhesive systems, which enables the operator to apply it 
in a thin layer. The use of Àowable composite, however, 
is not suitable for bracket bonding because the attach-
ments are inclined to drift until the resin is cured (22) 
and the resultant bond strength may be lower than that 
achieved by no-mix or light-cure systems (5,9).
In the present study, surface conditioning with Er:YAG 
laser was capable to significantly increase bond strength 
of brackets to FRC strips. Er:YAG laser was employed 
at 200 mJ/10 Hz or 300 mJ/15 Hz. Although the diffe-
rence between the two laser groups was not significant, 
but group 6 in which the FRC surface was covered by a 
layer of Àowable composite followed by application of 
Er:YAG laser at 300 mJ/15 Hz showed significantly hig-
her bond strength compared to most of the study groups. 
Therefore, this protocol could be recommended to be 
employed in the clinical conditions to increase bond 
strength of orthodontic attachments to FRC strips. 
Previous authors indicated the capability of Er:YAG 
laser in roughening different surfaces such as compo-
site (15-16), amalgam (23) and bracket bases (17-18). 
Although microscopic evaluaion of the FRC surfaces 
was not performed in this study, it is possible that laser 
conditionng provides microporosities and microretenti-
ve areas on the FRC surface which increase the surface 
area for bonding, thus leading to enhanced bond strength 
of ortodontic attachments.
Adding a thin layer of Àowable composite on the FRC 
bar before bracket bonding had no significant effect on 
SBS. However, when Er:YAG laser (300 mJ/15 Hz) was 
employed for conditioning the FRC surface covered by 
the Àowable resin, a significant increase in bond streng-
th was obtained compared to most of the study groups. 
In this case, Er:YAG laser actually roughened the com-
posite surface instead of the FRC surface and brackets 
were bonded to  the Àowable composite. This increased 
bond strength compared to the groups in which Er:YAG 
laser was irradiated on FRC itself may be attributed to 
the even surface of the Àowable composite that may be 
more appropriate for laser conditioning compared to the 
uneven FRC surface. Furthermore, it is possible that 
laser treatment causes some damage and weakens the 
FRC structure; thus reducing any positive effect of laser 
treatment on enhancing bond strength. The outcomes of 
this study are in agreement with those of previous au-
thors who found that Er:YAG laser is effective in pre-
paring the composite surfaces for the bonding process 
(15-16).
There are a few studies regarding bond strength of or-
thodontic attachments to FRC strips. Most of the pre-
vious studies evaluated the physical properties (1,8,24) 
or the effect of different adhesive systems on bond 
strength (5,9) of fiber-reinforced composite. Using 
hydroxyapatite stone instead of enamel, Freudenthaler 
et al. (4) evaluated bond strength of a metal attachment 
(control) with that of the FRC-attachment combination. 
They found that in all loading conditions, the FRC-atta-
chment combination exhibited superior bond strength 
compared with the metal attachment alone, and under 
some loading conditions, the loads before failure were 
as much as 3 times greater than those for the control (4). 
In contrast, Sfondrini et al. (9) demonstrated that  brac-
kets bonded with FRC nets under the base showed signi-
ficantly lower bond strength than those directly bonded 
to enamel (8.48 MPa versus 14.5 MPa using a light-cure 
adhesive). If we included a control group in the study 
design in which brackets were bonded to enamel, it was 
possible to compare SBS values of brackets bonded to 
FRC versus those attached to enamel.
In the present study, there was a higher frequency of ARI 
score 2 in groups 5 and 6 where greater SBS values were 
found, while ARI score 0 was more frequent in groups 
with lower SBS. A higher ARI score indicates that more 
adhesive remained on the tooth in the debonding area, 
representing fracture at the bracket-composite interfa-
ce. The overall fracture pattern, however, was similar 
in all groups. The statistical analysis did not show any 
significant difference in debond locations among the six 
groups, possibly due to the small sample size or to the 
close range of SBS values observed in the present in-
vestigation.
According to Reynolds (25), bond strength of 6-8 MPa 
should be considered as the minimum strength required 
for orthodontic brackets to resist intraoral conditions. In 
the current study, all groups showed SBS values greater 
than the threshold proposed by Reynolds, although bond 
strength values were just slightly greater than 8 MPa in 
groups that laser conditioning was not performed. Surfa-
ce treatment of FRC bars by adding a layer of Àowable 
composite combined with Er:YAG laser conditioning 
enhanced SBS significantly and thus this technique can 
be recommended to be employed in the clinical practi-
ce.

The effect of Er:YAG laser treatment on bracket bonding to FRC
Conclusions
Under the conditions used in this study:
• Shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets to FRC 
bars were above the acceptable threshold required in cli-
nical orthodontics. 
• When maximum bond strength of orthodontic brackets 
is required, it is recommended to add a layer of Àowa-
ble composite on FRC bar followed by surface treatment 
with Er:YAG laser.
