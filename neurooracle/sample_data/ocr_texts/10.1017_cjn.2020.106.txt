Guillain-Barré Syndrome with Facial Diplegia Related to
SARS-CoV-2 Infection
Keywords: Acute inﬂammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy,
COVID-19, Cranial neuropathy, Peripheral nervous system,
Polyradiculoneuropathy
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2) was ﬁrst detected in December 2019 and is the cause
of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19). Patients with COVID-19 commonly present with
fever, fatigue, cough, and shortness of breath. However, neuro-
logical manifestations of COVID-19 are becoming increasingly
recognized and include impairment of smell and taste, acute
cerebrovascular disease, and encephalopathy.1
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most common cause
of weakness due to acute polyradiculoneuropathy and consists
of immune-mediated demyelinating and axonal forms.2 It is
typically post-infectious, with onset occurring within 4 weeks
of symptoms of respiratory tract or gastrointestinal infection in
two-thirds of patients.2 Cases of GBS associated with COVID-19
have been rarely but increasingly reported.3–12
A 58-year-old, right-hand-dominant male who was otherwise
healthy presented with acute-onset bilateral facial weakness,
dysarthria, and paresthesia in his feet. He denied any other
neurological symptoms, including anosmia and ageusia. He
denied fever, fatigue, cough, shortness of breath, or any other
symptoms on review of systems. Notably, the patient and an
immediate family member work at a meat-processing plant and
were exposed to a known workplace outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Subsequently, the patient was physical distancing and isolating at
home in the 20 days prior to his presentation.
Initial vital signs included a temperature of 36.6 °C, maximum
heart rate of 140 beats/minute, maximum blood pressure of
187/103 mmHg, maximum respiratory rate of 34 breaths/minute,
and an oxygen saturation of 96% on room air, with resolution
of tachycardia, hypertension, and tachypnea within 12 hours.
Auscultation of the lungs revealed diffuse crackles bilaterally.
Neurological examination demonstrated complete facial diplegia
and areﬂexia in the lower extremities. He could not raise his
eyebrows and there was no creasing of the forehead. With
attempted eye closure, the palpebral ﬁssures remained symmet-
rically open with a width of 5 mm. His nasolabial folds were
ﬂattened symmetrically, and he could not smile or close his lips.
He had dysarthria with labial sounds. The remainder of the
neurological examination was normal. In particular, he had full
strength, normal sensation to pinprick, temperature, vibration,
and proprioception, and absence of ataxia in his upper and lower
extremities.
Laboratory investigations demonstrated a persistent thrombo-
cytosis with a maximum platelet count of 688 × 109/L (normal
150–400 × 109/L) and an elevated D-dimer at 1.47 mg/L (normal
≤0.5 mg/L). Oropharyngeal RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2
was positive and chest X-ray demonstrated diffuse heterogeneous
inﬁltration in both lungs (Figure 1 A). Computed tomography
(CT) and CT angiography (CTA) of the head and neck did not
demonstrate any intracranial or vascular abnormalities but dem-
onstrated ground-glass opacities in both lung apices, consistent
with COVID-19 (Figure 1B). The patient was immediately
started on empiric ceftriaxone and azithromycin, given his risk
of developing pneumonia. Bilateral intracranial and extracranial
facial nerve enhancement was present on brain magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) (Figure 2). Cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF)
analysis demonstrated cytoalbuminologic dissociation with a
protein of 1.00 g/L (normal 0.15–0.45 g/L) and a white blood
cell count of 4 × 106/L (normal ≤5 × 106/L). CSF RT-PCR
testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative.
Overall, the patient’s history, examination, and investigations
were consistent with GBS. Given the possibility of hypercoagu-
lability associated with COVID-19 and the patient’s persistent
thrombocytosis, the safety proﬁles of intravenous immunoglob-
ulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange were discussed with colleagues
in hematology. The thrombosis risks were thought to be equiva-
lent and 2 days after symptom onset, the patient started a 5-day
course of IVIG at 0.4 g/kg/day. Electrophysiological studies were
performed 6 days after symptom onset and demonstrated absent
blink reﬂexes bilaterally and an absent F wave in the left
tibial nerve, consistent with acute inﬂammatory demyelinating
polyneuropathy. Anti-ganglioside antibodies were not tested. The
patient was discharged from hospital 2 days after completing
IVIG. At that time, he had slight movements of his facial muscles,
and the distal paresthesias of his lower extremities were
unchanged.
Interestingly, GBS was the presenting disorder that led to a
diagnosis of COVID-19. Although the patient was asymptomatic
from a respiratory perspective, his positive SARS-CoV-2 test and
lung imaging (Figure 1) were indicative of an active infection at
the time of GBS onset. He had a clear source of infection from an
outbreak and his subsequent isolation at home for 20 days further
suggested that his infection preceded GBS onset. Taken together,
COVID-19 may manifest primarily with neurological symptoms
and signs. In context of the current pandemic, a patient with GBS
should prompt consideration for a preceding or concurrent
SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, assessment of acute neu-
rological presentations with CTA of the head and neck can assist
in diagnosing COVID-19 based on simultaneous CT imaging of
the lung apices.
At the time of writing, at least 14 cases of GBS associated with
COVID-19 have been reported worldwide: 12 cases presented
with symmetric, progressive, ascending weakness,3-11 1 case with
facial diplegia,5 and 1 case with Miller Fisher syndrome.12 In the
13 cases where COVID-19 symptoms preceded GBS symptoms,
the interval ranged from 5 to 24 days.4-12 Of the 12 cases with
electrophysiological studies, 4 had an axonal process4,5 and
8 had a demyelinating process.3,5,7–11 CSF RT-PCR testing for
SARS-CoV-2 was negative in 8 cases.5,8,11,12 All 14 cases were

treated with IVIG, with 2 cases receiving a second cycle of IVIG
and 1 case receiving subsequent plasma exchange.3–12
Typically, infections such as Campylobacter jejuni, cytomeg-
alovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, inﬂuenza A virus, Mycoplasma
pneumoniae, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, and Zika virus are thought
to cause GBS through an autoimmune reaction via molecular
mimicry.2 The mechanisms of GBS associated with COVID-19
are unclear. Neuroinvasive potential is a common feature of other
human coronaviruses (HCoVs), such as SARS-CoV, Middle East
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), HCoV-229 E,
and HCoV-OC43,13 and has led to the hypothesis that SARS-
CoV-2 may act directly on the nervous system to cause neuro-
logical symptoms. The absence of SARS-CoV-2 in the CSF in
this case and others5,8,11,12 does not support this hypothesis with
regard to GBS.
COVID-19 is associated with increased levels of proinﬂamma-
tory cytokines and systemic inﬂammatory response syndrome,14
which favor an inﬂammatory or immunological mechanism.
As such, cytoalbuminologic dissociation, similar to typical GBS,
may be a result of antibody production via molecular mimicry,
increased release of myelin protein from axons, or blood–nerve
barrier dysfunction. GBS associated with COVID-19 may involve
post-infectious or para-infectious processes, as cases have had
preceding or concurrent SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptoms,
respectively. Future investigation will be required to elucidate the
mechanisms of GBS associated with COVID-19.
The incidence of GBS is approximately 1–2 cases per 100,000
people per year and changes in incidence may correspond with
exposure to infectious agents known to cause GBS.2 For exam-
ple, during the 2015–2016 Zika virus epidemic, increases and

decreases in GBS incidence worldwide coincided with increases
and decreases in Zika virus disease incidence, with increases in
GBS incidence varying between 2 to 10 times the baseline.15
Nonetheless, GBS associated with Zika virus remained an
uncommon disorder. Although there is increasing evidence that
GBS may occur secondary to COVID-19 and cases may be
underreported, the rate is likely consistent with that associated
with other infectious diseases. As the COVID-19 pandemic
continues,
GBS
and
other neurological
manifestations of
COVID-19 will continue to be characterized.
