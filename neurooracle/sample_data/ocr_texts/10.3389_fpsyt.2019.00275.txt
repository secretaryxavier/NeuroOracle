Numerous neuroimaging studies have revealed structural brain abnormalities in 
schizophrenia patients. There is emerging evidence that dysfunctional nerve growth factor 
(NGF) signaling may contribute to structural brain alterations found in these patients. In this 
pilot study, we investigated whether there was a correlation between NGF serum levels 
and gray matter volume (GMV) in schizophrenia patients. Further, we investigated whether 
there was an overlap between the correlative ﬁndings and cross-sectional GMV differences 
between schizophrenia patients (n = 18) and healthy controls (n = 19). Serum NGF was 
signiﬁcantly correlated to GMV in the left prefrontal lobe, the left midcingulate cortex, and 
the brainstem in schizophrenia patients. However, we did not ﬁnd any correlations of NGF 
serum levels with GMV in healthy controls. Schizophrenia patients showed smaller GMV 
than healthy controls in brain regions located in the bilateral limbic system, bilateral parietal 
lobe, bilateral insula, bilateral primary auditory cortex, left frontal lobe, and bilateral occipital 
regions. In a conjunction analysis, GMV in the left midcingulate cortex (MCC) appears 
negatively correlated to NGF serum levels in the group of schizophrenia patients and also to 
be reduced compared to healthy controls. These results suggest an increased vulnerability 
of schizophrenia patients to changes in NGF levels compared to healthy controls and 
support a role for NGF signaling in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. As our pilot 
study is exploratory in nature, further studies enrolling larger sample sizes will be needed 
to further corroborate our ﬁndings and to investigate the inﬂuence of additional covariates.

INTRODUCTION
Structural brain abnormalities in schizophrenia patients have been repeatedly demonstrated by 
neuroimaging studies and were robustly conﬁrmed by numerous meta-analyses (1–8), supporting 
the hypothesis that schizophrenia is associated with altered cerebral connectivity and morphology 
(9–11). Te most consistent gray matter abnormalities were found in fronto-temporo-thalamic

regions lateralized to the dominant hemisphere (3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 
13). Notably, these changes were reported to be evident in ﬁrst 
episode patients (14–18) and to be more pronounced with 
increased duration of the illness and earlier age of onset (2–3, 4, 
6, 8, 12, 17, 19–24). Gray matter reductions were also frequently 
reported—although with lesser consistency—for cerebellar (21, 
25), occipital (26, 27), and parietal (1, 4, 28) structures.
Anatomically, decreased amounts of cortical neuropil, deﬁcits 
in dendritic arborization, and cortical aﬀerents were reported to 
be contributing volume reductions in schizophrenia (29–33). In 
some brain areas, gray matter volume (GMV) reduction partially 
can be explained by a decrease in synaptic conjunctions (34, 35). 
Tis relation was investigated particularly for the dorsolateral 
prefrontal cortex and suggests inﬂuence on cognitive functions 
in schizophrenia patients (34, 36).
It seems likely that the etiopathogenesis of the structural 
diﬀerences found in schizophrenia patients is multifactorial and 
related to diﬀerent interacting pathophysiological mechanisms 
(37). Members of the neurotrophin protein family, including 
nerve growth factor (NGF), have been repeatedly implicated 
not only in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia per se, but are 
plausible candidates to be involved also in the development 
of these neuroanatomical anomalies (38–40). Consequently, 
neurotrophins with their crucial role of contributing to the 
survival of neurons and the reorganization of neural circuits 
appear as worthwhile candidates to be studied in brain structural 
changes in schizophrenia.
NGF is essentially involved in neural development, diﬀerentiation,  
and maintenance of neurons not only in development, but throughout 
life, and has both short-time and long-term eﬀects on brain 
structure and function by inducing neurite outgrowth as well as 
the length and complexity of dendritic length in cortical neurons 
(38, 39, 41–45). Although only few studies have investigated 
correlations between NGF levels in the peripheral blood and 
the central nervous system, several lines of evidence suggest 
that peripheral NGF serum levels allow valid conclusions on 
central nervous concentrations. Animal studies have shown that 
NGF penetrates the blood–brain barrier (46, 47) signiﬁcantly 
better than albumin or IgG (48). In particular, NGF has been 
pointed out as the neurotrophin with the fastest passage of the 
blood–brain barrier in a mouse model (49). Tese properties 
render peripheral NGF as one of the most promising candidates 
within the neurotrophin family to infer on central levels. Recent 
evidence points to a reliable correlation between peripheral 
and central nervous NGF levels in humans, at least in healthy 
controls (50). Although further studies on larger collectives 
are warranted to corroborate these ﬁndings, we regard this as 
a highly encouraging lead that ﬁndings from animal models 
might be translatable to humans. Moreover, several studies 
have reported associations between peripheral NGF levels and 
various aspects of schizophrenia pathophysiology. For example, 
in schizophrenia patients, peripheral NGF levels were reported 
to be correlated with abnormal electrophysiological measures, 
namely p300 (51), while antipsychotic treatment was associated 
with an increase in NGF serum levels (24). Considering these 
ﬁndings, NGF serum levels may be a highly promising marker 
for central NGF concentrations.
NGF dysfunction, either due to pathological alteration of its 
concentration or its action on the receptor may contribute to 
impaired neuronal development, neuroplasticity, and synaptic 
disconnections. Tese changes may underlie structural and 
functional alterations observed in schizophrenia (52–54).
NGF serum levels in schizophrenia patients have been 
repeatedly reported to be signiﬁcantly reduced when compared 
to healthy subjects (54, 55). Besides decreased NGF levels in the 
peripheral blood, decreased levels of NGF in the cerebrospinal 
ﬂuid (CSF) (50) and decreased levels of NGF receptors (56), 
elevated NGF autoantibodies (57), and altered NGF gene 
expression (56) have been observed. Tus, changes of NGF levels 
might be involved in the formation of structural brain alternation 
of schizophrenia (24, 53).
While studies actually are still scarce, pioneer studies suggest 
a putative inﬂuence of neurotrophins on neural structure in 
schizophrenia patients. For example, a correlation was found 
between NGF autoantibodies in serum and total volume of 
the frontal lobe in schizophrenia patients (58). Another study 
explored the impact of the BDNF Val66Met gene variant in 
schizophrenia. Tis single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
maps to the neurotrophin precursor protein of BDNF (brain-
derived neurotrophin factor) (proBDNF) and is correlated with 
BDNF serum levels (59). Val66Met genotype was shown to 
correlate with reduced GMV in temporal and occipital regions 
known to be associated with verbal memory and visuospatial 
abilities in schizophrenia patients as well as healthy subjects (60). 
Another study suggests a contribution of the age-related decline 
of BDNF serum levels to hippocampal volume as well as memory 
decline in late adulthood (61). In patients with systemic lupus 
erythematosus with neuropsychiatric manifestation, immune 
cell NGF levels were found to be correlated with brain atrophy 
reﬂected by lateral ventricle enlargement and thalamic volume 
loss (62).
Tis study aimed to investigate a potential correlation between 
NGF serum levels and brain structural diﬀerences in schizophrenia. 
Furthermore, a potential overlap between the results of a whole 
brain correlation analysis between GMV and NGF serum levels 
and the results of GMV reductions in schizophrenia patients were 
identiﬁed in a conjunction analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Eighteen schizophrenia patients from the Department of Psychiatry, 
Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, University Hospital RWTH 
Aachen, Aachen, Germany, and 19 gender- and age-matched 
healthy controls from the general population participated in the 
present study (Table 1). All subjects were of Caucasian descent 
and right-handed. Diagnosis of schizophrenia was established 
using the International statistical classiﬁcation of diseases and 
related health problems (ICD-10) diagnostic criteria (code F20.X). 
Symptom severity in schizophrenia patients was measured using 
the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (63). Exclusion 
criteria for all subjects were 1) current substance or alcohol 
abuse or any diagnosed substance abuse or addiction in the past

(ICD-10: F10.1 or .2 - 19.1 or .2), 2) severe medical conditions such 
as chronic or acute diseases (i.e., infections, allergies), 3) general 
contraindications to MRI scanning, 4) gross morphological 
changes on MRI such as cerebral atrophy, hydrocephalus, or 
previous injury, and 5) incomplete scanning. Subjects treated with 
benzodiazepines were not included, except the drug was at least 
in its second elimination half-life period afer intake. Additional 
exclusion criteria for the healthy control subjects included any 
personal or family history of psychiatric disorders in ﬁrst-degree 
relatives. Te study protocol was approved by the local ethics 
committee of the RWTH Aachen University. Before being enrolled 
in the study, written informed consent was obtained from each 
subject in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Clinical Measures
We systematically assessed clinical variables, such as duration 
of disease and medication, by a detailed medical interview. 
Also, lifestyle habits such as smoking and weekly amount 
of physical activity were assessed, considering that these 
factors may influence the outcome of the disease and the 
neurotrophin levels (64–67). For antipsychotic medication, 
equivalent dose of olanzapine was calculated by using the 
conversion scale proposed by Gardner and colleagues (68). 
As antipsychotic medication (24) and body mass index (BMI) 
(69) have been shown to exert an influence on NGF serum 
levels, we explored whether these parameters were correlated 
in the entire sample, and the schizophrenia patients, as well as 
the healthy controls alone.
NGF Serum Level Assessment and Analysis
Subjects were allowed to have their usual breakfast in the 
morning. A venous blood sample of 10 ml was collected in 
serum tubes from all subjects at 8:00 AM to control for circadian 
changes in NGF levels (70). Subsequently, serum was obtained 
afer centrifugation at 2,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature 
and then stored at −80°C in polypropylene tubes until analysis 
to avoid adhesion of NGF to the tube surface (71). Mature/
biological active beta-NGF serum levels were measured with 
a double antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay (ELISA) using a commercial kit (Human NGF/NGF Beta 
PicoKine™ ELISA Kit, Boster Biological Technology Co., Inc., 
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions1. Te assay 
has a sensitivity of <1 pg/ml; the assay range comprises 15.6–
1,000 pg/ml. For each sample, standard and blank control were 
carried out in duplicate by trained research personnel and the 
results were averaged.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data 
Acquisition and Processing
Imaging was performed immediately afer the acquisition 
of the individual blood samples on a Siemens Trio 3T MRI 
scanner (Siemens Medical Systems, Erlangen, Germany) using 
a 32-channel head coil. A T1-weighed magnetization prepared 
rapid acquisition gradient echo (MP-RAGE) sequence that was

used to acquire anatomical images covering the whole brain 
[echo time (TE) = 2.52 ms, repetition time (TR) = 1,900 ms, 
inversion time (TI) = 900 ms, ﬂip angle = 9°, resolution matrix =  
256 × 256, slices = 176, slice thickness = 1 mm, voxel size = 
0.976 × 0.976 × 1 mm, duration = 7:49 min]. All images were 
collected during a single imaging session. Whole brain voxel-
based morphometry (VBM) (72) analysis was carried out on 
the T1-weighted images using the Diﬀeomorphic Anatomical 
Registration Trough Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) 
segmentation algorithm (73) as implied in SPM12. Image 
intensity inhomogeneity correction (bias-ﬁeld correction) was 
achieved using SPM bias correction algorithm implemented 
in SPM segment (72). Reorientation of the images was ﬁxed to 
the anterior commissure. Te automatic detection of diﬀerent 
tissue types within the T1-weighted images was archived using 
the standard segmentation model in SPM (72). Te resulting 
gray matter ribbon was used for achieving accurate intersubject 
alignment using DARTEL (73). Afer the iterative alignment 
process (74), DARTEL generated ﬂow ﬁeld images as well as the 
DARTEL template. Te resulting ﬂow ﬁeld maps and the DARTEL 
template were used to create the smoothed [6-mm full width at 
half maximum (FWHM)], Jacobian scaled, spatially normalized 
gray matter images into the Montreal Neurological Institute 
(MNI) coordinate system through nonlinear transformation 
(74, 75) before calculation of GMV and group comparison. With 
this choice of parameters, an aﬃne transformation leads to a 
correction for diﬀerences in whole-brain volumes. Hence, our 
approach picks up relative regional, not absolute, brain volumes.
Correlation Between Gray Matter Volume 
and Nerve Growth Factor Serum Levels
Whole-brain correlation analysis between NGF serum levels and 
GMV were performed for schizophrenia patients and healthy 
controls separately, as well as a combined group of patients and 
controls to identify disease-speciﬁc associations between NGF and 
GMV. Te main analyses were performed including voxel-wise 
GMV values as the dependent variable and NGF serum levels as a 
predictor. Group status was included as an additional regressor in 
the general sample (i.e., patients and healthy controls combined).
For all tests general linear model (GLM) was used to determine 
the statistical inference. Te cluster level multiple comparison 
correction was performed to delineate the signiﬁcant clusters 
(at p < .001, uncorrected). To focus all subsequent analyses on 
clusters of biological meaning, we chose a cluster extent threshold 
of k > 100 voxels. As brain structural changes afer disease onset 
show a regional pattern, we purposefully chose this approach 
that is especially prone to pick up these changes.
Overlap of Correlation Analysis and Group 
Comparison
To identify possible overlaps between clusters correlated to NGF 
levels and GMV diﬀerences, a conjunction analysis was conducted.
First, to achieve a whole brain voxel-wise group GMV 
comparison between patients and controls, GLM analysis was 
performed using a two-sample t-test (p < .001) to identify core 
structural gray matter diﬀerences in schizophrenia patients. 
Cluster-level threshold was set at p < .05 using family-wise error 
correction (FWE) with a voxel-level threshold set at p < .001. To 
focus all subsequent analyses on clusters of biological meaning, 
we chose a cluster extent threshold of k >100 voxels.
To objectify a potential anatomical overlap, we computed a 
conjunction analysis between the results of the group comparison 
(schizophrenia patients and healthy controls) and the ﬁndings 
of our correlation analyses (correlation between serum NGF 
levels and GMV). Tat is, by computing the intersection of 
the thresholded maps from the group comparison and the 
correlation analyses (76), we aimed to investigate an overlap 
between structural changes associated with schizophrenia and 
GMVs correlated with NGF.
Anatomical Labeling
We used the SPM Anatomy Toolbox 2.2c (77–79) to obtain an 
anatomical localization of the resulted clusters from the group 
comparisons as well as the correlation analyses. Te Anatomy 
Toolbox provides two diﬀerent sets of information for a given 
cluster: a cortical area and a probabilistic microanatomical 
allocation based on cytoarchitectural probabilistic mapping 
(77–79). Wherever obtainable, we report both the macro- and 
the microanatomical labels. In all other cases, we report the 
macroanatomical allocations as provided by the Anatomy Toolbox.
Functional Decoding
To obtain an observer-independent data-driven functional 
characterization of the clusters ensuing from our VBM analyses, 
we assessed whether we could ﬁnd signiﬁcant associations 
with behavioral domains and paradigm classes provided by 
the BrainMap data base (http://www.brainmap.org) (80, 81), a 
data base of published functional neuroimaging experiments. 
Here, behavioral domains describe the mental process likely 
to be isolated by an experimental contrast. Tey are divided 
into main categories: action, cognition, emotion, interception 
and perception, and their related subcategories. Furthermore, 
paradigm classes representing speciﬁc and established tasks 
of the experiments were used to determine activation in 
deﬁned brain regions (for a detailed BrainMap taxonomy, see 
http://www.brainmap.org/taxonomy). Since it was our aim to 
characterize the physiological function of the identiﬁed brain 
regions, we only referred to studies on healthy subjects. Forward 
and reverse inference was performed. Te forward inference 
approach denotes the probability of a particular mental 
process activating a speciﬁc brain region [P(activation|task)] 
in comparison to the probability of (random) activation in this 
speciﬁc brain region at baseline [P(activation)]. In the interest 
of clarity, results for forward and reverse inference are displayed 
in one column. Signiﬁcance was assessed using a binominal 
test (p < .05), corrected for multiple comparisons using false 
discovery rate (FDR). Te reverse inference approach attempts 
to identify the most likely psychological process, described in 
the categories of behavioral domains and paradigm classes, 
being implemented given neural activation in a speciﬁc brain 
region or network [P(task|activation)]. Signiﬁcance was 
assessed here using a chi-square test (p < .05), FDR-corrected.

RESULTS
Correlation of Clinical Data and Gray 
Matter Volume With Nerve Growth  
Factor Serum Levels
In schizophrenia patients, serum NGF levels were found to be 
positively correlated with GMV in the pons (Table 2, Table S1, and  
Figure 1). Te cluster was signiﬁcantly associated with the 
paradigm class of pain monitoring and pain discrimination. Two 
clusters were negatively correlated between NGF serum levels and 
GMV, one cluster located in the lef mid orbital gyrus extending 
into the right hemisphere, and the other in the lef MCC (Table 2, 
Figure 1). Both clusters were found to be associated with reward 
related tasks.
We did not ﬁnd any cluster to be signiﬁcantly negatively or 
positively correlated with NGF in either the healthy control or 
the combined group.
NGF serum levels did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly between 
schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (z = −1.401, p = .169). 
However, NGF levels tended to be reduced in schizophrenia 
patients. NGF was found to be symmetrically distributed 
in healthy controls (p = .076), however, not symmetrically 
distributed in patients (p = .007).
In our study sample, no signiﬁcant correlation was found 
between BMI and NGF serum levels in patients, as well as in 
healthy controls (SZ: rs = 0.251, p = 0.316, HC: rs = −0.418, p = 
0.075). In schizophrenia patients, no signiﬁcant correlation was 
found between daily olanzapine (equivalent) dose and NGF 
serum levels (rs = 0.87, p = 0.732). In our study sample, signiﬁcant 
correlation was not found between sex, BMI, years of education, 
and pack-years nor between the amount of weekly physical 
exercise and NGF serum levels in patients as well as in healthy 
controls. No correlation between age and NGF in patients was 
found, however, in healthy controls (rs = −.507, p = .027). Years 
of education were signiﬁcantly correlated to NGF serum levels in 
controls (rs = −.697, p = .001), but not in schizophrenia patients. 
In schizophrenia patients, no correlation between neither 
duration of disease, daily olanzapine (equivalent) dose, or neither 
the results of PANSS test (positive, negative, general, and total 
scale) and NGF serum levels were found.

Group Comparison and Conjunction 
Analysis
We found signiﬁcant reduction of GMV in schizophrenia 
patients in 11 clusters. Clusters were located in the cingulate [lef 
midcingulate cortex (MCC), right anterior cingulate cortex], 
bilaterally parietal lobes, bilateral insula, bilateral auditory 
cortex superior temporal lobe, lef frontal lobe, and the bilateral 
occipital lobe (Table 3, Figure 2).
Te clusters showing reduced GMV in schizophrenia patients 
were associated with social cognition, reasoning, action execution 
and language-related processes (see Table 5 for an overview).
We did not ﬁnd any increase in GMV in schizophrenia 
patients compared to healthy controls.
Subsequent conjunction analysis revealed an overlap 
(k = 60) between the NGF serum level to GMV correlation and 
the GMV group comparison in the left MCC in schizophrenia 
patients.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we found evidence for a correlation between NGF 
serum levels and GMV in the lef prefrontal lobe, the lef MCC, 
FIGURE 2 | Gray matter volume (GMV) reductions in schizophrenia patients compared to healthy controls. Note: Clusters of reduced GMV in schizophrenia patients 
(shown in yellow) compared to healthy controls were located inter alia the bilateral insula, the left Rolandic operculum, the left area TE 1.2 and the right area TE 
1.0, the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC; extending over the midline), left posterior–medial frontal gyrus, the left midcingulate cortex (MCC; extending over the 
midline), the right precuneus (extending over the midline), and the visual areas hOc1 and hOc2 (both extending over the midline; coronal view, p < .001, cluster-level

and the brainstem in schizophrenia patients. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study to investigate a putative inﬂuence 
of NGF levels on structural neuroanatomy in schizophrenia.
Remarkably, the GMV in the lef MCC was reduced in 
our group comparison of schizophrenia patients and healthy 
controls and additionally was shown to be negatively correlated 
to NGF serum levels in schizophrenia patients, but not in healthy 
controls. A conjunction analysis identiﬁed an overlap between 
the results of the correlation and the group comparison analysis 
in the lef MCC.
Reduction in cingulate gyrus volume has been found in 
several studies in schizophrenia patients. Signiﬁcant reductions 
were found also in ﬁrst-episode patients and were shown to be 
progressive in longitudinal examinations (8, 16, 87). Finding the 
cingulate gyrus volume additionally correlated to NGF serum 
levels indicates an exceptional sensitivity for structural changes

and supports the hypothesis of NGF signaling playing a central 
role in the pathogenesis of brain structural diﬀerences in a core 
region of schizophrenia.
Also, the lef orbital gyrus volume was found to be negatively 
correlated with serum NGF in the patient’s group. Volume 
reductions in the orbital gyrus have been reported previously in 
schizophrenia patients (17, 88). In these studies, the volume of 
the lef orbital gyrus was found inversely correlated with lower 
socioeconomic status and longer illness duration, suggesting a 
relation to social functioning impairment even during the ﬁrst-
episode of schizophrenia (88, 89). Psychopathologically, reduced 
GMV in the lef mid orbital gyrus has been associated with more 
severe positive formal thought disorders (88).
Both the MCC and orbital cortex play a decisive role in social 
interaction (90–93). NGF is also thought to play a mechanistic 
role in human social interaction (94, 95). In acute psychosocial 
stress, NGF in saliva was found elevated (96). Interestingly, 
subjects reporting lower negative emotion when confronting the 
stressor also showed greater NGF reactivity in saliva, suggesting 
that this neurotrophic response might have evolved as a resilience 
mechanism to protect the brain against the eﬀects of stress 
hormones release. Tese ﬁndings suggest that both salivary 
NGF reactivity and recovery are markers of psychiatric health 
(96). A recent study reported an association between functional 
impairment and serum NGF levels in mental disorders. NGF levels 
were negatively associated with social and ﬁnancial autonomy and 
cognition (97). Given the ﬁndings of our functional decoding, 
MCC and orbital cortex are plausible regions mediating these 
functions, as being associated with emotion, cognition as well as 
reward-related tasks. Finding a negative correlation between the 
GMV in the MCC and orbital cortex with NGF serum levels can 
indicate an increased vulnerability for neurostructural alternations, 
reﬂecting in diﬃculties in social interaction and functioning (98).
In schizophrenia patients, serum NGF levels were found 
to be positively correlated with GMV in the pons. Functional 
characterization has revealed that the pontine region is linked 
to tasks involving pain monitoring and pain discrimination. 
Abnormal pain sensitivity in schizophrenia was previously 
reported in clinical and experimental studies, showing that 
schizophrenia patients appear to have diminished pain 
perception (99–101).
NGF, as a key regulator of nociceptive pain and an important 
mediator of the initiation and maintenance of diﬀerent pain 
stages (102, 103), has an important role in pain perception. NGF 
antagonists have been investigated in the treatment of nociceptive 
and neuropathic pain conditions (102–104). Tus, the pontine 
cluster that was positively correlated with NGF serum levels 
might be a neuroanatomical correlate of NGF-mediated altered 
pain sensitivity in schizophrenia patients. Finding a positive 
correlation of serum NGF to a neuroanatomical area involved 
in pain management may conversely suggest an inﬂuence 
of altered, more precisely in terms of reduced, NGF serum 
levels in diminished pain perception that can be observed in 
schizophrenia patients.
Te observation that the correlations between NGF and brain 
structure were exclusively present in schizophrenia patients 
suggests an altered eﬀect of NGF signaling in the brains of 
schizophrenia patients compared to controls. Tere is mounting 
evidence for this hypothesis (50, 58, 70, 105), hinting at NGF 
signaling acting via diﬀerent mechanisms in schizophrenia. 
Changes due to altered signaling mechanisms might be intensiﬁed 
through per se decreased NGF levels in patients. Another 
possibility may be a dysfunctional NGF signaling cascade, e.g., 
because of a higher burden of genetic lesions in patients (56).
As NGF is mainly involved in the maintenance of neurons 
and neuronal circuits, a positive correlation between NGF serum 
levels and GMV would appear as most proximate hypothesis. 
Two aspects, however, challenge such a straightforward model. 
First, while NGF might indeed lead to decreased eﬃciency of 
neural networks, this does not have to manifest necessarily 
FIGURE 3 | Conjunction analysis of correlation and group comparison analysis. Note: Conjunction analysis revealed an overlap (k = 60) between the NGF serum 
level to GMV correlation and the GMV group comparison in the left MCC in schizophrenia patients (coronal view, p < .001, cluster-level threshold p < .05, FWE-
corrected, k > 60).

in brain atrophy detectable by MRI. Contrariwise, (failed) 
compensatory reactions might lead to increased regional GMV. 
Second, as the molecular architecture of the human brain 
arguably diﬀers across regions (106), reactions of complex neural 
tissues toward reduced NGF levels do not necessarily have to 
be uniform across all brain regions. While these considerations 
might provide some explanation for detection of both positive 
and negative correlations between GMV and NGF levels across 
brain regions, we, though, have to acknowledge that such 
interpretations remain highly speculative. Future studies will 
have to corroborate these ﬁndings and follow up further on their 
mechanistic underpinnings.
In our cross-sectional comparison to healthy controls, we 
found a signiﬁcant reduction of GMV in schizophrenia patients 
in the visual system, the limbic system, parietal lobe, bilateral 
insula, primary auditory cortex, and frontal lobe. Structural 
alterations particularly for fronto-temporal and limbic gray 
matter in schizophrenia patients have been described before 
(5, 8, 17, 26). Functional characterization revealed a prominent 
functional conjunction between clusters showing reductions in 
GMV with social cognition, reasoning, action execution, and 
language-related processes, which are domains related to core 
symptoms of schizophrenia (107–114). Previous study hints 
that some of these regions are related to severity of symptoms, 
so, for instance, there are indications that reduced GMV in the 
primary visual areas is associated with increased severity of 
visual hallucinations in schizophrenia patients (115).
Both BMI (69) as well as antipsychotics (24) have been shown 
to exert an inﬂuence on NGF serum levels, and have also been 
discussed as being correlated with brain structural changes (21, 
116). For our sample, we did not ﬁnd a correlation between these 
two parameters and NGF levels. Consequently, we would assume 
that our correlation analyses were not driven by these confounds.  
However, future studies on larger collectives will have to investigate 
these relationships further, to corroborate our ﬁndings.
Nerve Growth Factor Pathways 
in Schizophrenia
Neurotrophins, such as NGF, are known to pass the blood–brain 
barrier in both directions (46, 49). Kale et al. demonstrated a 
close relationship between CNS and peripheral NGF levels in 
healthy controls, but this correlation could not be found in drug-
naive psychotic patients (50).
NGF is expressed throughout the cortex and of unique 
importance for maintenance and function of cholinergic 
neurons (117). Te signaling pathways of NGF are still not 
fully understood. One pathway of survival, axonal growth, 
and diﬀerentiation of neural cells is mediated by NGF through 
binding to tropomyosine-related kinase (Trk)-receptor A (117, 
118). NGF induces a calcium-dependent release of dopamine 
and glutamine (119) in a dose-dependent fashion (120) through 
a p75 neurotrophin receptor-dependent pathway (120, 121). 
Glutamate-gated ion channels as N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors 
(NMDARs) are widely distributed throughout the cortex (122), 
playing key roles in excitatory synaptic transmission and having 
a central role in synaptic plasticity (123).
Tere is a strong indication that NMDARs may play an 
important role in schizophrenia and psychosis (123, 124). Proven 
changes in the glutamatergic metabolism and transmission may 
potentially aﬀect regional neuronal integrity and therefore be 
related to the morphological brain changes and symptoms in 
schizophrenia patients (122, 125). On the other hand, NMDA 
dysfunction may also aﬀect the impaired dopaminergic and 
GABAergic neurotransmission documented in schizophrenia 
(122). NMDA and dopamine dysfunction are widely recognized 
to play a central role in disturbed neurotransmission of 
schizophrenia patients (126).
Diﬀerent mechanisms in NGF signaling cascade, moreover 
enhanced through changes in NGF levels, may thereby lead to a 
less support on a trophic level and may in consequence contribute 
to changes in brain morphology (117, 127).
Limitations
Te presented study follows an exploratory approach and the 
results of this study should be interpreted in the context of 
certain limitations. Although NGF levels have shown to be stable 
in peripheral blood (128), a single measurement of NGF serum 
levels cannot reﬂect the inﬂuence of NGF on long-term brain 
structural changes.
Moreover, NGF levels in peripheral blood only partially reﬂect 
actual level and activities of NGF in the CNS, since NGF is mainly 
produced in the CNS, but also produced, stored, and released 
in several immune cells like monocytes and lymphocytes (129) 
and platelets (130–134). Recent evidence points to a suﬃcient 
correlation between peripheral and central nervous NGF levels, 
whereas this correlation was only shown in healthy controls but 
not in schizophrenia patients (51). A disturbed blood–brain 
barrier in schizophrenia patients is discussed to contribute to 
the development of neuromorphological changes, maybe thereby 
provoking the raising of NGF autoantibodies (59). However, 
intensiﬁed research on NGF as a proxy marker for NGF in brain 
tissue is needed.
Although our study showed no correlation between NGF 
serum level and olanzapine equivalent, NGF level has been shown 
to be aﬀected by medication in other studies, predominantly by 
adjusting the NGF serum level to levels of healthy subjects (24, 
135–140).
NGF serum levels were not symmetrically distributed in 
schizophrenia patients. While the small sample size did not allow 
to follow up on potential subgroups, this will be an important 
issue for future studies.
Several aspects support the actual biological relevance of our 
ﬁndings: ﬁrst, a variety of potentially relevant covariates did 
not show signiﬁcant correlations with NGF serum levels in the 
general sample or in any of the subgroups. Only for the healthy 
controls, we found signiﬁcant correlations of NGF serum levels 
with age and years of education. Both covariates might have an 
inﬂuence on brain structure. However, it should be noted that 
signiﬁcant correlations between NGF serum levels and brain 
structure were found only for schizophrenia patients and not in 
healthy controls. Second, none of the analyzed covariates were 
signiﬁcantly correlated with NGF serum levels in schizophrenia

patients. We would regard this as an argument that our ﬁndings 
were indeed associated with NGF serum levels and not driven 
by another covariate. Tird, the aﬃne transformation of our 
analysis approach will correct for overall brain volume. Tis 
should also help to correct for eﬀects associated with age and 
gender. While the use of more covariates should help to further 
correct against biases in larger samples, we would regard these 
aspects as good indicators that the results reported in this pilot 
study were not mainly driven by covariates.
Te comparatively small sample size is certainly an 
important limitation of our exploratory pilot study. While we 
certainly would like to caution the reader regarding premature 
conclusions drawn from our ﬁndings, we would see our results 
as an encouraging lead toward a relationship between NGF 
levels and brain structural changes in schizophrenia, and a 
strong urge for future studies enrolling larger samples. A larger 
sample size may consider covariates like sex, age, medication, or 
illness duration in a more solid way. Finally, a larger sample size 
may uncover more subtle alterations in the brain structure of 
schizophrenia patients and decrease the danger of false positive 
ﬁndings. As a follow-up to our study, analysis of the precursor 
protein of NGF and the interaction between the precursor and 
the mature form might indicate other signaling pathways and 
eﬀects (117). Extension of the study concept by DTI analysis of 
white matter as well as functional imaging via fMRI may be of 
great interest. Moreover, a longitudinal study may be desirable 
to investigate the potential eﬀect of NGF on brain structure 
changes in temporal course. Delineating the eﬀects of NGF levels 
on early brain development would be desirable in individuals 
that later present with schizophrenia. Such a correlation could 
be investigated, e.g., in larger longitudinal cohorts of at-risk 
individual at younger ages.
Conclusion
Our pilot study oﬀered hints about the inﬂuence of serum 
NGF on the brain structure of several regions in schizophrenia 
patients, while no comparable results had been found in healthy 
controls. Remarkably, changes correlated with NGF serum levels 
manifested also in the cingulate cortex, a region that also showed 
volume reductions our group comparison between patients and 
controls and has been repeatedly implicated in the literature as 
morphologically altered in schizophrenia. While our sample 
certainly was small, we regard these ﬁndings as an encouraging 
indication for further research. Te recruitment of larger samples 
will be an important goal for future studies.
