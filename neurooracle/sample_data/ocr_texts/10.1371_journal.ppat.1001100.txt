Abstract
The ability of the tubercle bacillus to arrest phagosome maturation is considered one major mechanism that allows its
survival within host macrophages. To identify mycobacterial genes involved in this process, we developed a high
throughput phenotypic cell-based assay enabling individual sub-cellular analysis of over 11,000 Mycobacterium tuberculosis
mutants. This very stringent assay makes use of fluorescent staining for intracellular acidic compartments, and automated
confocal microscopy to quantitatively determine the intracellular localization of M. tuberculosis. We characterised the ten
mutants that traffic most frequently into acidified compartments early after phagocytosis, suggesting that they had lost
their ability to arrest phagosomal maturation. Molecular analysis of these mutants revealed mainly disruptions in genes
involved in cell envelope biogenesis (fadD28), the ESX-1 secretion system (espL/Rv3880), molybdopterin biosynthesis
(moaC1 and moaD1), as well as in genes from a novel locus, Rv1503c-Rv1506c. Most interestingly, the mutants in Rv1503c
and Rv1506c were perturbed in the biosynthesis of acyltrehalose-containing glycolipids. Our results suggest that such
glycolipids indeed play a critical role in the early intracellular fate of the tubercle bacillus. The unbiased approach developed
here can be easily adapted for functional genomics study of intracellular pathogens, together with focused discovery of new
anti-microbials.

Introduction
Upon engulfment by host macrophages, M. tuberculosis, the
main etiological agent of tuberculosis in humans, localizes in
vacuoles or phagosomes that fail to fuse with host cell lysosomes
and to acidify [1,2]. This process, called phagosome maturation
arrest, may contribute to mycobacterial pathogenicity and to
mycobacterial evasion from host immune surveillance. Molecular
determinants for the specific features of this host-pathogen
interaction are starting to be elucidated, though no clear picture
has yet been established [1,2,3,4,5]. Several mycobacterial
products affecting phagosome maturation, such as cell wall
lipoglycans and glycolipids [6], or allowing resistance to the acidic
milieu of the phagosome [7] have been reported. Apart from
focused, candidate gene-based studies [8,9], large scale approach-
es have been performed using mutant libraries to obtain a
comprehensive picture of the process. Pethe et al. used a M.
tuberculosis CDC1551 transposon mutant library to identify
mutants that fail to prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion [10].
With the same aim, by use of flow cytometry, Stewart et al.

identified a series of Mycobacterium bovis BCG mutants that fail to
prevent phagosome acidification [11]. Both studies generated
comprehensive
lists
of
novel
mycobacterial
genes
possibly
involved in phagosome maturation arrest. However they were
performed by infecting cells with large pools of mutants and
necessitated several rounds of amplification, thereby introducing
a mutant selection bias. Indeed mutants that traffic into late
endosomal compartments are likely to be impaired in growth and
could be lost during the amplification process. Moreover, such
competitive infections may miss detection of mutants that can be
trans-complemented by other clones within the mixed infection.
This may occur when the interrupted gene encodes a secreted
virulence factor or a factor that interferes with processes involving
secretion of host factors.
This led us to develop a new type of screening system whereby
mutants would be individually investigated, in the absence of
other competitive strains. We took advantage of automated
confocal fluorescence microscopy and dedicated image analysis to
monitor sub-cellular mycobacterial localization of a large number
of samples. A transposon mutant library made in a virulent
clinical isolate of M. tuberculosis of the W/Beijing family and
containing over 11,000 individual mutants was used to infect
macrophages in vitro. Ten mutants with an impaired ability to
prevent phagosome acidification were isolated. Strikingly, out of
these ten mutants, two carried independent insertions in the
adjacent moaC1 and moaD1 genes, and two further mutants
carried independent insertions in Rv1503c and Rv1506c located
within the so-called losA locus that is involved in the synthesis of
lipooligosaccharides (LOS) in another mycobacterial species,
Mycobacterium marinum [12,13]. This prompted us to further
investigate the lipid content of the concerned transposon mutants,
which allowed us to identify novel lipids that are involved in the
acidification of phagosomes. The results of this study thus
strenghten the hypothesis that M. tuberculosis modulate the
biosynthesis of specific glycolipids to manipulate phagosome
maturation and shed new light on the genetic locus and the
synthesis pathways involved.
Results
Positive LysoTracker staining of macrophages correlates
with presence of M. tuberculosis in acidified phagosomes
In order to set-up the optimal conditions of M. tuberculosis
infection, mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages were infected
with mycobacteria that had previously been covalently labeled with
the red fluorescent dye CypHer5. M. tuberculosis reference strain
H37Rv, the W-Beijing strain GC1237 [14] and a GC1237 DphoP/R
attenuated mutant [15] as well as heat-killed bacteria were used.
After 2 h of infection, macrophages were pulsed with the
acidotropic green fluorescent dye LysoTracker DND-26 to label
the acidified compartments. After fixation and nuclei labeling,
sample images from four fields per well were acquired using an
automated confocal microscope. For each field, three images were
recorded: one for the cell nuclei (blue-channel), one for the
CypHer5 labeled mycobacterium-positive compartment (red-chan-
nel) and one for the LysoTracker-DND-26 positive compartment
(green-channel). The acquisition parameters were set so that the
LysoTracker signal was minimal in resting non-infected cells. In
these settings, cells infected with heat-killed bacteria exhibited a
strong LysoTracker signal, whereas cells infected with live bacilli
showed a weak signal (Figure 1a). This first set of experiments led us
to investigate whether the sole LysoTracker signal could be used as a
positive indirect readout for the presence of mycobacteria in
acidified compartments. An image analysis script was then
developed to determine the parameters that best describe the
images and that would be a correlate of infected cells, bacterial load,
and LysoTracker-positive compartments. First, the nuclear stain
DAPI that was used enabled accurate macrophages number
quantification and their spatial positioning. Next, spots in either
the red-channel or the green-channel images were labeled as
bacterium- or LysoTracker-positive objects, respectively, if their size
surface was at least 3 pixels with intensity above a defined threshold.
Because the nuclear labeling of the macrophage did not allow us to
delineate the exact contour of the cell, a macrophage was
considered infected if labeled bacterium objects were distant of less
than 5 pixels from the DAPI signal surface. Similarly, LysoTracker-
positive objects were labeled as acidified compartments if they were
found distant of less than 5 pixels from the cell nucleus in our
acquisition conditions. Nearly 100% of the cells were found to be
infected after 2 h (Figure 1b). The fraction of bacteria co-localizing
with LysoTracker-positive staining (Figure 1c) was found to be less
than 10% in cells infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv (261%) or
GC1237 (761%). In contrast, upon infection with heat-killed
H37Rv or GC1237, more than 50% of the bacteria were found to
co-localize with acidified compartments (6163% and 5664%,
respectively). In addition, 2063% of the live attenuated DphoP/R
mutant showed a marked acidification of their vacuoles. Opposite
patterns were observed when infected cells were stained for the early
endosomal marker Rab5A (Figure S1a). Of particular interest,
quantification of the percentage of cells containing detectable
acidified compartments led to similar results between strains and
conditions (Figure 1d). In addition to this latter, another parameter
deduced from the images is the surface of acidified compartments
proximal to cell nuclei that refers to the total surface area of all the
Lysotracker positive objects that are distant of less than 5 pixels from
the DAPI signal surface in each field (Figure 2a).
The dynamic range of the assay was confirmed by monitoring
the dose-response of Zymosan A, a substance that is known to
rapidly traffic into lysosomes. With increasing concentrations of
Zymosan A, there was a subsequent linear increase in the
intracellular surface positive for LysoTracker staining (Figure
S1b,c). This further demonstrates that the acidified compartment
Author Summary
One of the major virulence mechanisms of the tuberculosis
bacillus, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is its ability to resist
killing by phagocytic cells of the host immune system,
namely the macrophages. Macrophages degrade invading
microbes by engulfment inside a vacuole, or phagosome,
that progressively acidifies and accumulates hydrolytic
properties. M. tuberculosis has the unique ability to block
phagosome maturation and acidification. To identify
mycobacterial genes involved in phagosome maturation
arrest, we developed a novel high-throughput technology
based on automated confocal microscopy. We screened a
library containing over 11,000 M. tuberculosis mutants, and
we could identify 10 mutants that had lost their ability to
resist phagosome acidification. Genetic characterization of
these mutants revealed that they carried lesions in genes
involved in various cell processes, including biogenesis of
the cell envelope. In particular, two independent mutants
in the same genetic locus showed altered production of
two lipids, namely diacyltrehalose (DAT) and sulfoglycoli-
pid (SGL). In vitro experiments showed that SGL can indeed
influence phagosome maturation. Our study unravels the
role of novel lipid molecules in mycobacterial intracellular
parasitism; our approach may be useful to identify
virulence genes in other intracellular pathogens, and to
identify novel antimicrobials.

surface parameter is directly proportional to the amount of
particles within acidic vacuoles and can be used as a correlate of
the localization of mycobacteria in acidified vacuoles without
additional staining and detection of the bacilli.
To simplify the protocol for high throughput screening (HTS),
macrophages were distributed into 384-well plates that had
previously been inoculated with mycobacteria. Infection was
carried out at 37uC for 2 h, a time-lapse sufficient for macrophage
adherence. The monolayer was then subjected to LysoTracker
and nuclei staining as described above. The day-to-day as well as
plate-to-plate reproducibility was ascertained by including live and
heat-killed M. tuberculosis H37Rv, GC1237 and DphoP/R mutant in
each plate. All samples corresponding to the various reference
strains contained a similar number of cell nuclei (Figure 2b). The

surface of acidified compartments proximal to cell nuclei in live
samples was significantly lower than in heat-killed samples with a
Z’ score value (live vs. heat-killed) above 0.2 (Figure 2c). Thus this
parameter was further chosen as a read-out for HTS.
Our screening assay therefore consisted in the search for
bacterial mutants that induce a positive LysoTracker staining
phenotype upon macrophage infection.
Identification of transposon mutants that fail to induce
phagosome maturation arrest
An 11,180-member mutant library was constructed by trans-
position of the IS1096-derived Tn5367 transposon in the M.
tuberculosis W-Beijing strain GC1237 as previously described [16].
Transposon site hybridization (TraSH) analysis of a 500-member
pool subset of the library showed that insertions occurred
uniformly in the chromosome (Figure S2). Given that the M.
tuberculosis genome spans around 4,000 open reading frame [17],
our library represents a 3X-coverage of the whole genome. The
mutant library was formated into fourty-four 384-well microplates,
which included 5 control wells for each of M. tuberculosis GC1237,
the DphoP/R mutant, or heat killed GC1237. In addition, all plates
included a set of wells with non-infected cells.
The validation of the screen (Z’ score value for live vs. heat-
killed .0.2) was first ascertained by control analysis on each
microplate. Mutants were selected using a stringent threshold, i.e.
for values of acidified compartment surface of 3 s.d. above the
average, and for nuclei numbers above 100, which corresponds to
low cytotoxicity. A typical plate is shown in Figure 2d, whereby
two mutants with aberrant trafficking are highlighted. From this
analysis,
a series of 10 mutants
was selected for
further
characterization. The trafficking phenotype of all selected mutants
was confirmed on the individual level in mouse and human
primary macrophages (Figure 3). The ability of the ten mutants to
survive and replicate inside mouse macrophages was investigated
to determine whether enhanced trafficking into acidified com-
partments
correlated
with
impaired
intracellular
growth
(Figure 3c). Strikingly, intracellular trafficking to acidified vacuoles
did not necessarily correlate with growth attenuation; indeed the
mutant in lppM (mutant P65B12) for instance, that largely
trafficked to an acidified vacuole, could actively multiply inside
host cells on the longer term.
As selected examples of individual confirmation of altered
trafficking, two mutants are displayed in Figure 4, where mouse
macrophages were infected with GFP-expressing strains, subse-
quently stained with LysoTracker red, and examined by confocal
microscopy (Figure 4a). Image analysis confirmed that the
percentages of acidified compartment-containing cells were higher
for the selected mutants than for the GC1237 parental wild-type
strain (Figure 4b), which correlated with higher percentages of
bacteria in acidic vacuoles (Figure 4c). Indeed more than 25% of
the mutant bacilli were found in acidic vacuoles, compared to less
than 10% for the control strain.
Genes disrupted by transposon insertion in the 10 selected
mutants were identified by ligation-mediated PCR and sequencing
(Table 1) [16]. Among others, genes involved in cell envelope
biogenesis (fadD28, ppe54, lppM), phosphate uptake (pstS3), ESX-1-
mediated secretion (espL/Rv3880) and molybdopterin biosynthesis
(moaC1/moaD1)
were
found.
The
maturation
stage
of
the
mycobacterial phagosome was further characterized for two
mutants (in Rv1503c and Rv1506c) by immunofluorescence and
confocal microscopy observation. Similarly to the phagosomes of
wild type M. tuberculosis, the phagosomes of mutant strains were
mostly negative for the lysosomal marker CD63 (Figure S3a). The
fraction of v-ATPase-positive (Figure S3b) and LAMP-1-positive
(data not shown) phagosomes was increased in cells infected with
the mutants, as compared to the wild-type strain, which is in
agreement with our results using LysoTracker. Genetic comple-
mentation of the ten mutants was achieved using pYUB412-
derived integrating cosmids [18]. The different cosmids carry large

(Table 1). Our results confirm that phagosome maturation arrest
and intracellular survival are multifactorial processes involving a
combination of mycobacterial genes [9,10]. In addition, we show
that

correlate with mycobacterial stasis or killing in the infected cells.
As none of the 10 trafficking mutants showed a growth defect in
culture broth (Figure S4), these processes seem to have evolved
during adaptation of tubercle bacilli to the mammalian host.
The finding that two genomic loci (moaC1/D1 and Rv1503/06c)
were each represented by two independent transposon mutants
suggests that the identified regions indeed play key roles in the
phagosome maturation arrest induced by M. tuberculosis. These
results highlight the power and stringency of our screening method
and prompted us to investigate one of the identified loci
(Rv1503c/06c) in more detail. Indeed this genomic region is
similar to a locus in the closely related fish pathogen Mycobacterium
marinum that is encoding enzymes involved in LOS synthesis
[12,13], which might play important roles in host-pathogen
interaction.
Acyltrehalose-containing glycolipids are involved in early
phagosome maturation arrest
We
further
characterized
the
mutants
in
Rv1503c
and
Rv1506c. These genes encode a putative TDP-4-oxo-6-deoxy-D-
glucose transaminase and a putative methyltransferase, respec-
tively, as evaluated by comparative bioinformatic analyses. They
are located in a locus that resembles the lipooligosaccharides
(LOS) locus of M. marinum [12,13], which is partially conserved
between the two species. Interestingly, the Rv1503c-to-Rv1507c
genes belong to a single operon, as assessed by RT-PCR
amplification of the gene junctions (data not shown). Rv1503c
and Rv1506c share 89% amino acid similarity with their M.
marinum orthologs MMAR2320/wecE and MMAR2322, respec-
tively. We first hypothesized that this locus may be involved in the
synthesis of LOS or LOS-related glycolipids in M. tuberculosis.
However with the exception of particular strains of the M. canetti
family [19,20] which represents rare and more distantly related
tubercle bacilli [21], LOS have not been identified in tubercle
bacilli. In agreement with these data, we did not detect any LOS
production in M. tuberculosis GC1237 (data not shown). Thus, we
next hypothesized that the gene cluster under study may be
involved in the synthesis of other forms of acyltrehaloses. Lipid
extracts from bacterial cells were examined by TLC upon
anthrone staining (Figure 5a) or metabolic labeling of methyl-
branched fatty acid-containing lipids with [1-14C]propionate
(Figure 5b,c). These analyses revealed that the Rv1503c::Tn and
Rv1506c::Tn mutants markedly overproduced a molecule (named
‘‘II’’ in Figure 5a-d), whereas they produce lower amounts of
another molecule (named ‘‘III’’ in Figure 5a–d), as compared to
the GC1237 strain. Genetic complementation of the two mutants
with the IE586 cosmid encompassing the region 1653–1697 kb in
the genome of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, which spans the Rv1503c-6c
cluster, restored production of lipids II and III to wild-type levels
(Figure 5d). Importantly, genetic complementation of the mutant

strains restored significantly their trafficking phenotype, as assessed
by LysoTracker staining of infected macrophages (Figure 5e,f).
Lipids named ‘‘I’’ to ‘‘IV’’ were purified (Figure 6a for lipid III,
Figure 6d for lipid II, not shown for lipids I and IV), and their
structure was analyzed by mass spectrometry and NMR. The I to
IV lipids were identified as trehalose dimycolates (TDM, data not
shown), tetracylated sulfoglycolipid (Ac4SGL, Figure 6d–f), 2,3-di-
O-acyltrehaloses (DAT, Figure 6a–c), and triacylated sulfoglyco-
lipid (Ac3SGL, data not shown), respectively. Identification of
molecule I as TDM thus explained the very low labelling with
[1-14C]propionate (Figure 5b,c), as propionate cannot be readily
incorporated
into
this
molecule.
Lipid
quantification
using
[1-14C]acetate did not reveal differences in the amount of TDM
produced by the wild-type and the two mutant strains (data not
shown). These results show that DAT synthesis is impaired and
sulfolipid (mostly Ac4SGL) synthesis is increased in the Rv1503c
and Rv1506c transposon mutants, as compared to in the wild-type
strain. Additional lipids, previously reported to interfere with
intracellular trafficking, such as lipoarabinomannan (LAM; [22])
and
phosphatidyl-myo-inositol
mannosides
(PIMs;
[2])
were
analyzed, and we found no difference in the amount and structure
of these molecules in the mutant strains, as compared to the wild
type strain (Figure S5). These data indicate that deletion of
Rv1503c or Rv1506c does not affect the structure and the
biosynthesis of M. tuberculosis lipoglycans.
The two mutants, in particular in Rv1503c (P117C08) grew
poorly inside host macrophages (Figure 3c). Interestingly, their
ability to colonize the lungs was strongly impaired as assessed in a
murine model of M. tuberculosis infection, and again the virulence
phenotype could be restored by cosmid-mediated complementa-
tion (Figure 7).
To further dissect the altered trafficking phenotype of the
Rv1503c/06c::Tn mutants we evaluated the potential of the DAT
and Ac4SGL (the major form of sulfolipid overproduced in the
mutants) in influencing phagosomal acidification. Using lipid-
coated silica beads and LysoTracker staining, we found that
phagosomes loaded with Ac4SGL-coated beads acidified more
than phagosomes containing non-coated beads. In contrast, DAT
coating did not influence intracellular trafficking of the particles as
compared to non-coated controls (Figure 8a,b). In addition, the
pH of the vacuoles containing the different particles was measured
using a flow cytometry-based technique [23]. Whereas the pH of
the DAT-coated beads and the control beads reached a value of
,5.2 after 60 min phagocytosis, the pH of the Ac4SGL-coated
beads was significantly lower (,4.7) at the same time-point
(Figure 8c). These results suggest that overproduction of Ac4SGL
in the Rv1503c::Tn and Rv1506c::Tn mutant strains may
account, at least in part, for their increased intracellular trafficking
phenotype.

phagosome acidification, which allowed us to exclude any bias due
to false co-localizations; ii/the possibility to distinguish between
tens of thousands of mutant strains at the single strain level; iii/the
possibility of a very stringent selection of the hits.
Many of the genes identified in our study are predicted to be
located within operons (pstS3, Rv1503c, Rv1506c, fadD28, moaC1,
moaD1, Rv3880c) [24]. Using RT-PCR amplification of gene
junctions we have confirmed this to be true for the genes Rv1503c-
to-Rv1507c on which we focus our detailed analysis (data not
shown). Although we could restore the lipid profile in the
Rv1506c::Tn mutant by complementing with a plasmid encoding
Rv1506c (data not shown), we have chosen as a general strategy to
complement
our
mutants
with
integrating
cosmids.
These
constructs integrate as single copy into the chromosome and
encode the target gene as well as surrounding genes and regulatory
elements. This strategy provides for a more realistic reproduction
of wild-type gene expression levels of the target gene and has been
successfully used in a number of previous studies (e.g. [25]).
However, cosmid complementation may complement polar effects
of transposon insertion on neighboring genes and does not
formally prove the involvement of a single mutated gene in an
observed phenotype. The discussion below should be put into this
context. The putative involvement of genomic loci is discussed
rather than the exact function of given genes.
Here we found only one gene (fadD28) that was already shown
to play a part in phagosome maturation arrest and has been
isolated in a previous similar global approach [10]. In addition,
Pethe et al. have also identified Rv1522c/mmpL12, encoding a
putative lipid transporter, as involved in phagosome maturation
arrest [10]. Interestingly, this gene belongs to the same genomic
locus as the Rv1503c and Rv1506c genes identified here. These
three genes may be functionally related. The only modest overlap
with datasets from other global screening studies examining
related phenotypes [10,11] may be due to the differences in
bacterial strains, host cells and selection techniques employed in
the different studies. Indeed, our study is the first to screen for
intracellular phenotypes in the GC1237 W-Beijing clinical isolate
of M. tuberculosis and the selection used was highly stringent,
isolating and sequencing only the 10 mutants that gave the
strongest LysoTracker signals, i.e. 3 s.d. above the mean. It is likely
that we have missed some borderline mutants in genes previously
reported.

The fatty acid-CoA ligase-encoding gene fadD28 is required
for the synthesis of phtiocerol dimycocerosates (PDIM). These
complex lipids have already been shown to be involved in
mycobacterial virulence [10,11,16,26,27], and a recent report
has suggested that PDIM may directly prevent phagosome
maturation through insertion into the phagosomal membrane
[28]. The lppM gene was identified as involved in phagosome
arrest and encodes a putative lipoprotein that may be anchored
in
the
bacterial
membrane.
In
favour
of
a
membrane
modification, the lppM::Tn mutant grows in clumps relative to
wild type (data not shown). The ppe54 gene encodes a protein
belonging to the large PE/PPE family whose members have
mostly been shown to be membrane bound and effective
immunogens. Such features have not been reported so far for
PPE54. Strikingly, its expression was found specifically upregu-
lated in IFN-c-activated macrophages [29] suggesting a role in
mycobacterial intracellular persistence in agreement with our
findings. We also isolated a mutant in Rv3880c, recently named
espL as part of the ESX-1 secretion system [30]. The exact
function of EspL is unknown, however studies in M. marinum
suggest that proteins encoded by neighboring genes might
interfere with phagosome maturation [31]. Other components
of the ESX-1 secretome might be involved in phagosome
maturation arrest as well [9]. More generally, the ESX-1
secretion system has been involved in mycobacterial virulence in
various in vivo and in vitro systems, including in macrophages
[32,33,34,35]. Secreted or membrane-anchored products such
as PDIM, lipoproteins, PE/PPE proteins and the ESX-1
secretome might interact with host cell endocytic machinery
components yet to be identified.
Additional genes identified here include pstS3 and genes
involved in molybdenum metabolism, namely moaC1 and moaD1.
The periplasmic phosphate binding lipoprotein-encoding gene
pstS3 belongs to a larger genetic locus, the pho regulon, involved in
inorganic phosphate uptake, and previously reported to play a part
in mycobacterial virulence [36]. The pstS3 gene itself has been
implicated in mycobacterial intracellular survival, possibly through
phagosome maturation arrest [37]. How phosphate uptake is
linked to buffering phagosome acidification is unclear and requires
further investigation.

The ability of some mutants for intracellular growth despite
vacuole acidification is striking and may be explained by several
reasons. The exact pH values of the mutants’ phagosomes have not
been precisely measured here, and it is possible that some mutants
reside in more acidic vacuoles than others. As M. tuberculosis is highly
resistant to very low pH [38], phagosomes of mutants in which
acidity is the only altered factor may still be permissive for
mycobacterial growth. In addition, as can be seen in Figure 4, a
fraction of the phagocytosed mycobacteria does not localize in

acidic compartments and thus can be the sub-population that
indeed replicates at later time points. It is important to explicitly
determine whether the bacterium being observed in a specific sub-
cellular compartment is really the one that will replicate, and latest
development of life time automated confocal imaging suggest that
this may become foreseeable in a near future.
One of the most striking findings of our study is the independent
isolation of two pairs of mutants in genes located within the same
genetic loci, namely Rv1503c/Rv1506c, and moaC1/moaD1.
Given the size and coverage of our library, it is unlikely that such
isolations happened by chance. The adjacent genes moaC1 and
moaD1 are part of a chromosomal region (Rv3108-20) presumably
involved in molybdopterin biosynthesis. We have recently shown
that this gene cluster actually forms a genomic island that arose in
the ancestor of the tubercle bacilli through horizontal transfer
from environmental proteobacteria [39]. Molybdopterin is a
precursor of the so-called molybdenum cofactor (MoCo), a
coenzyme for various oxidoreductases, including nitrate reductase
and sulfite oxidase for instance. Our results are reminiscent of a
recent study in which lesion in moeB1, another gene possibly
involved in MoCo biosynthesis and distant from the Rv3108-20
locus, was shown to affect mycobacterial phagosome biogenesis
[9]. The genome of the tubercle bacillus contains several loci
potentially involved in MoCo biosynthesis [17], and a few gene
products in M. tuberculosis harbour molybdopterin/MoCo-binding
sites and might use MoCo as a cofactor. This is the case of the
nitrate reductase subunit-encoding genes, narG and narX, of the
formate and aldehyde dehydrogenase-encoding genes fdhF and
nuoG, respectively, as well as of two other gene products, Rv0197,
an uncharacterized oxidoreductase, and Rv0218, a possible sulfite
oxidase. Although we can only speculate at this stage, we can
anticipate that MoCo-dependent redox reactions play a crucial
part in early intracellular fate of the tubercle bacillus, which should
deserve further attention in future studies.
We also isolated two independent mutants carrying genetic
disruptions in Rv1503c and Rv1506c. The homologues of these
genes in M. marinum belong to a locus involved in the synthesis of
LOS [13]. Here we showed that, like other M. tuberculosis strains
[19,20], our W-Beijing mother strain does not synthesize LOS.
However we showed that the Rv1503c::Tn and Rv1506c::Tn
mutants are impaired in the synthesis of other acyltrehalose-
containing lipids, namely DAT, and that they overproduce
sulfoglycolipids (SGL), Ac3SGL and more importantly Ac4SGL.
DAT and SGL are glycolipids based on trehaloses [40]. Although
some of the genes involved in DAT [40,41] and SGL [42,43,44]
synthesis have been identified, knowledge of the enzymes,
transporter and regulators involved in these pathways is still
incomplete. Transcriptional regulation of the genes involved in
synthesis of these molecules has been shown to be coordinated by
the PhoP regulator [15]. This suggests that Ac4SGL/Ac3SGL
overproduction
in
the
mutant
strains
may
be
due
to
a
compensation mechanism associated with impairment of DAT
production. However, the Rv1503c and Rv1506c proteins do not
carry the signature of enzymes such as acyltransferases and
polyketide synthases (Pks), and it is thus unclear what their exact
involvement in DAT synthesis could be. The Rv1505c gene

monocyte-derived macrophages were pulsed for 15 min with 3-mm
silica beads (3-5 beads per cell) coated with BSA-alexa Fluor 647
conjugate (red) and with Ac4SGL or DAT. Control beads (ctrl) are not
coated with lipids. Cells were chased for 70 min in bead-free medium
containing 250 nM LysoTracker Green DND-26 to follow phagosome
acidification (green). Cells were fixed and immediately examined under
the confocal microscope. (b) Phagosome acidification was measured by
recording colocalization between the red and the green signals in
about 100 phagosomes in 5 independent fields. Data are expressed as
mean % of colocalization (+/- s.d.) and are representative of two
independent experiments. Data were analyzed using the Student’s t-
test. (c) Dynamic pH measurement of phagosomes coated with DAT,

macrophages for various periods of time (up to one hour). Dual
fluorescence was recorded, and the ratio FLFITC/FL647 was used to
calculate the pH values of the phagosomes. A standard curve was
constructed after recording the fluorescence values of cells permeabi-
lized and incubated in buffers of defined pH values.

encodes a putative acyltransferase and the Rv1505c and Rv1506c
genes are predicted to form an operon; the possibility thus remains
that impairment of DAT synthesis in the Rv1506c mutants, and
eventually in the Rv1503c mutants, is actually due to inactivation
of Rv1505c because of operon disruption and/or of polar effects.
Interestingly, transcription of Rv1505c, as well as that of other
genes located in the same genomic region, namely Rv1517,
Rv1518, Rv1522c/mmpL12, Rv1525/wbbL2, Rv1527c/pks5 and
Rv1528c/papA4, has been proposed to be regulated by PhoP [45].
Whether and how these genes are involved in DAT synthesis will
require further investigation and is beyond the scope of the present
study.
Most importantly, our results suggest that Ac4SGL, but not
DAT, increase phagosome acidification. This is at variance with
conclusions from an early study suggesting that mycobacterial
sulfolipids (SL) tend to impair phagosome maturation [46].
However these authors incubated purified sulfolipids directly with
the cells, and the model systems used in this study and in ours are
barely comparable. Nevertheless, our results obtained with beads
suggest that SL increase phagosome maturation, which may
account, at least in part, for the increased trafficking of the
Rv1503c and Rv1506c mutants, although the exact mechanism
of increased acidification of these two mutants has not been
formally identified here. Furthermore, analysis of the production
of cytokines and chemokines using protein arrays upon infection
with Rv1503c and Rv1506c mutants did not reveal any
significant differences compared to the wild type strain (data
not shown). This suggests that the mutants altered trafficking
phenotypes were not caused by changes in their ability to induce
different inflammatory cytokine production [47,48] and indicates
that other mechanisms might account for the observed trafficking
behaviour. For instance, other possible explanations include an
overall altered cell wall, or a more generally reduced intracellular
fitness of the mutants, which both may impact intracellular
trafficking. In this regard, it is interesting to notice that the phoP
mutant shows a significant, though partial, relocation to an acidic
phagosome (Figure 1). The PhoP transcriptional regulator
controls the expression of many genes, some of which have been
involved in phagosome remodelling; this is the case of fadD28,
fadD26 and mmpL12 for instance [10,45]. It also regulates the
synthesis of important lipids, such as diacyltrehaloses and
sulfolipids [15], which may be involved in intracellular trafficking
according to our data. The partial inability of the phoP mutant to
arrest phagosome maturation may thus be due to a defect in
production of these factors. It may also be due to a broader defect
in fitness [49]. Further study of our mutants and other mutants
isolated in previous screens will help understand the general
relationship that may exist between mycobacterial fitness and
intracellular trafficking.
In summary, the unbiased approach developed here allowed us
to identify novel mycobacterial genes involved in M. tuberculosis
intracellular parasitism, and suggests the involvement of important
M. tuberculosis-specific glycolipids in this process. This approach
can easily be adapted for the comprehensive quantitative analysis
of mycobacterial vacuole sorting, as well as for the study of
intracellular parasitism by pathogenic microorganisms, and for
phenotypic drug screening [50].
Methods
Bacteria and mutant library
M. tuberculosis H37Rv, GC1237[14] and GC1237 DphoP/R [15]
strains were grown in Middlebrook 7H9 culture medium (Difco,
Sparks MD) supplemented with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-
catalase (OADC, Difco), glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80, and 25 mg/ml
kanamycin in the case of the DphoP/R mutant. A library of 11,180
members was constructed using M. tuberculosis Beijing GC1237 as a
host strain and the pCG113 plasmid that contains the IS1096-
derived Tn5367 as previously described [16]. After electropora-
tion, transformants were amplified in Middlebrook 7H9 culture
medium supplemented with 10% OADC, glycerol, 0.05% Tween
80 and 25 mg/ml kanamycin at 32uC, a temperature that allows
replication of circular pCG113. The mutants were selected on
Middlebrook 7H10-OADC agar medium supplemented with
25 mg/ml kanamycin and 2% sucrose at 39uC. This temperature,
and the presence of sucrose, allows to select mutants in which the
plasmid has been eliminated and the double cross over has
occurred. Eleven thousand one hundred and eighty individual
mutant clones were isolated and seeded into 96-well plates
containing 180 ml of Middlebrook 7H9 culture medium supple-
mented with 10% OADC, glycerol, 0.05% Tween 80 and 25 mg/
ml kanamycin. The plates were incubated at 37uC for three weeks
and then kept at 4uC. Three weeks before screening, a 10-fold
dilution of suspension from each of the M. tuberculosis transposon
mutants was performed. Selected strains were transformed with a
GFP-expressing integrative plasmid kindgly provided by Dr.
Winter (Institut Pasteur, Paris). Transformants were selected on
hygromycin.
TraSH analysis
Mapping of transposon insertion sites by microarray was carried
out essentially as described previously [11]. Genomic DNA was
prepared from a pool of 500 Tn5367 transposon mutants and
digested with BssHII and MluI. Approximately 100 ng of digested
genomic DNA was ligated to 100 pmol of Y-linker [11], and then
10 ng of ligated DNA was used as template for PCR amplification
of transposon-flanking regions using the transposon-specific primer
IS1
(59-GCACGTCGAGGTCTTTCAGATGGATGGCG-39)
and the Y-linker-specific primer TA4 (59-ACGCACGCGACGA-
GACGTAGC-39) in the presence of 8% DMSO. Following an
initial denaturation step for 2 minutes at 95uC, the reaction was
hot-started and cycled between 94.5uC (30 s) and 72uC (90 s) for
22 cycles. Amplification products were gel purified and used in a
second round of PCR amplification between the Y-linker-specific
primer TA4 and a nested transposon-specific primer IS2Nest (39-
TGGATGGCGTAGGAACCTCCATCATCGGA-59) to further
enrich for transposon-flanking products and to incorporate Cy3-
dCTP (Amersham). The reaction mix included 20 mM Cy3-
dCTP, 180 mM dCTP and 200 mM dGTP/dATP/dTTP and the
cycling conditions were as before, but for 14 cycles. The labelled
PCR products were cleaned up using a Qiagen MinElute kit,
eluting in water.
The fluorescently labelled transposon insertion sites were
hybridised to whole genome microarrays, prepared by spotting
the M. tuberculosis 70-mer oligonucleotide set (Operon, Qiagen)
onto Corning GAPS Coated Slides. Signal intensities of hybrid-
isation were collected using Genepix Pro 3.0 and an Axon 4000B
microarray scanner.
Controls preparation and mycobacteria staining
Bacteria were harvested, washed three times and resuspended in
phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The bacteria were then sonicated
and allowed to stand for 30 minutes to allow residual aggregates to
settle. The bacterial suspensions were then aliquoted and frozen at
280uC. A single defrosted aliquot was used to quantify the CFUs
prior to inoculation and typical stock concentrations ranged
between 2 and 56108 CFUs/ml. Dead bacteria were prepared by
heating one aliquot at 95uC for 20 minutes. Where appropriate,

mycobacteria were covalently labeled with CypHer5 mono ester
dye (Sigma Aldrich, Saint-Louis, MO) in 0.1 M sodium carbonate
buffer (pH 9) and washed three times before use [51]. Three mm
size-Zymosan A from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sigma Aldrich) was
titrated at 1.56106 particules/ml.
Macrophages, infection, and fluorescence assay set up
Mouse bone-marrow-derived macrophages were obtained by
seeding 107 bone marrow cells from C57BL/6 mice in 75 cm2
dishes in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
fetal calf serum (FCS) and 10% L-cell conditioned medium (all
from Gibco at Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Peripheral Blood
Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) were isolated from buffy coat from
healthy
volunteers.
15 ml
of
Ficoll-Paque
Plus
(Amersham
Biosciences, Sweden) were added to PBS diluted buffy coat
diluted and centrifuged at 25006g for 20 min. PBMC were
obtained by CD14+ beads separation (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany),
washed 3-times with PBS containing 1% FCS and transferred to
75 cm2 culture flask containing RPMI 1640 media, 10% FCS and
50 ng/ml of recombinant-human macrophage colony stimulating
factor (rh-MCSF, R & D systems, Minneapolis). After 6 days,
murine or human macrophages were harvested with Versene
(Gibco) and seeded at a density of 1.56105 cells per well in 384-
well plates (Evotec, Hambourg, Germany) in 50 ml RPMI 1640
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 10%
L-cell conditioned medium. Adherent cells were then infected with
bacterial suspensions at a MOI varying from 20 to 1 bacteria per
cell and incubated for 2 h. Cells were then washed three times
with PBS supplemented with 1% FCS and further incubated with
2 mM LysoTracker green DND-26 (Invitrogen) for 1.5 h. Finally,
cells were fixed with 1.5% formaldehyde BD Lyse solution (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA) for 10 min, washed twice and stained
with 5 mg/ml DAPI dilactate (Sigma) in 0.1% Triton X-100
(Sigma) in PBS. In some preparations, fixed cells were labelled
with an anti-Rab5A (Abcam, Ab13253, 1/500 dilution), -LAMP-1
(Cell Signaling, C54H11, 1/200), -v-ATPase (Synaptic Systems,
109002, 1/100 dilution), and -CD63 (Caltag Laboratories, 18-
7300, dilution 1/100) antibodies, subsequently detected using a
FITC-, Alexa 555-, or rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse
IgG or mouse anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma or Invitrogen).
Image acquisition by automated confocal microscopy
and data analysis for Lysotracker assay- set-up
Confocal images were recorded on an automated fluorescent
confocal microscope Opera (Evotec) using a 20X water objective
(NA 0.70), 405-nm, 488-nm and 635-nm lasers and a 510 primary
dichroic mirror with two sequential exposures. Each image was
then processed using dedicated in-house image analysis software
(IM). Each recorded field contained three images (three colors):
one for the cell nuclei (blue-channel), one for the LysoTracker-
DND-26 positive compartment (green-channel) and one for the
CypHer5 labeled mycobacterium-positive compartment (red-
channel). Cell nuclei, mycobacteria and LysoTracker-DND-26
positive compartment are then segmented in the ‘‘nuclei’’ band,
‘‘bacteria’’ and the ‘‘acidic compartment’’ band respectively using
in-house method [52]. Briefly, this method relies on a succession of
i) thresholding the histogram of the original image, the threshold
being taken as the maximum value between a manual threshold
and an automatic one (lowest value of a 3 classes K-means); ii)
Gaussian filtering the original image with a standard deviation that
is set equal to the nuclei (/mycobacterium and acidic compart-
ments) average radius; iii) searching for local maxima of the
filtered image that provides nuclei (/mycobacterium and acidic
compartments) centers as seeds for iv) region growing that defines
the individual surface of each nucleus (/mycobacterium and acidic
compartments) and finally v) removing extremely small nuclei (/
mycobacterium and acidic compartments) as potential artifacts or
noise. Once mycobacterium and acidic compartments and nuclei
are individually identified, final results are i) the nuclei number, ii)
the number of nuclei that are proximal to at least one
mycobacterium or acidic object, iii) the surface covered by acidic
or mycobacterium compartments in the vicinity of the nuclei.
Proximity is a parameter manually set-up by the user. Given the
fact that one cell has only one nucleus, these results can be
extrapolated to i) the number of cells, ii) the number of cells
containing at least one acidic object/one mycobacterium, and iii)
the surface of acidic compartments or bacterial load proximal to
cell nuclei. Final results are expressed as the average over all the
images of the well.
Mutant library screening
Frozen bone-marrow progenitors (66108 cells) were seeded in
three 500 cm2 dishes in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS
and 10% L-cell conditioned medium. At day 5, 50 ml of M.
tuberculosis Beijing GC1237 mutants were two-fold diluted in PBS
and seeded into a 96-well plate (Nunc), and 20 ml of the diluted
suspension were subsequently transferred into a 384-well assay
plate using the BioTek Precision XS sample processor. Before
infecting cells, the concentration of each mutant was determined
by OD600 measurement and the mean titer was within the range of
0.2 to 0.6 showing that the mycobacteria were in exponential
growth phase (data not shown). Plate titration was performed on
randomly selected mutants and the mean titer was 26107 colony
forming units (CFUs)/ml. 20 ml of heat-killed M. tuberculosis Beijing
GC1237 DphoP/R, M. tuberculosis Beijing GC1237 DphoP/R and
wild type strains were added manually in column 2, 3 and 22
respectively. The next day, after harvesting, 30 ml of the cell
suspension at 56105 cells/ml was distributed into the 384-well
assay plate that had been priory seeded with the mutants using the
AquaMax DW4 liquid handling device (Molecular Devices). After
a
2 h
incubation
at
37uC
under
5%
CO2,
extracellular
mycobacteria were removed by 3 washes in PBS and macrophages
were labeled with 2 mM LysoTracker red DND-99 (Invitrogen) for
1.5 h. Finally, cells were fixed with 1.5% formaldehyde BD Lyse
solution for 10 min, stained with 5 mg/ml DAPI in 0.1% Triton
X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 2 min and kept in 1% FCS in PBS at
4uC until image acquisition.
Image acquisition by automated confocal microscopy
and data analysis for high throughput screening (HTS)
Confocal images were recorded on an automated fluorescent
confocal microscope Opera (Evotec) using a 20X water objective
(NA 0.70), 405-nm and 561-nm lasers and a 580 primary dichroic
mirror. Each image was then processed using dedicated in-house
image analysis software (IM). Images contained two bands (two
colors): one for the LysoTracker-positive compartment (red-
channel) and one for the cell nuclei (blue-channel). The image
dynamics in both bands (both colors) was first checked through a
series of statistical tests including average intensity and standard
deviation designed to remove black or out of focus images. Cell
nuclei and acidic compartments are then segmented in the
‘‘nuclei’’ band, and the ‘‘acidic compartment’’ band respectively
using in-house method [52]. Briefly, this method relies on a
succession of i) thresholding the histogram of the original image,
the threshold being taken as the maximum value between a
manual threshold and an automatic one (lowest value of a 3 classes
K-means); ii) Gaussian filtering the original image with a standard
deviation that is set equal to the nuclei (/acidic compartments)

average radius; iii) searching for local maxima of the filtered image
that provides nuclei (/acidic compartments) centers as seeds for iv)
region growing that defines the individual surface of each nucleus
(/acidic compartments) and finally v) removing extremely small
nuclei (/acidic compartments) as potential artifacts or noise. Once
acidic compartments and nuclei are individually identified, final
results are i) the nuclei number ii) the number of nuclei that are
proximal to at least one acidic object iii) the surface covered by
acidic compartments in the vicinity of the nuclei. Proximity is a
parameter manually set-up by the user. Given the fact that one cell
has only one nucleus, these results can be extrapolated to i) the
number of cells) ii) the number of cells containing at least one
acidic object and iii) the surface of acidic compartments proximal
to cell nuclei. Final results are expressed as the average over four
fields recorded per 384-plate well.
Statistical analysis
The screen statistical data (Z’, CV etc. for the control plates) was
calculated using an in-house software. Additional analyses with
regards to quality control were performed with the Spotfire
software.
Genetic analysis of the mutants and complementation
The transposon insertion sites were identified by ligation
mediated PCR following a slightly modified version of a previously
described protocol [53]. Briefly, genomic DNA was digested with
BamH1, XhoI or BglII. DNA was then ligated to BamHI-linkers,
and amplified as described. The Rv1503c and Rv1506c mutants
were complemented as previously described [27], with the
pYUB412-derived cosmid [18] MTCI586, which carries a 38.7-
and 20.8-kb DNA fragment covering the 1653- to 1697-kb region
of the M. tuberculosis chromosome. This cosmid encompasses the
Rv1503c-6c gene cluster (1694.5 to 1696.4 kb, genomic coordi-
nates). A description of the other cosmids used in the study is
provided in Table 2.
Preparation, purification and analysis of lipids
Lipids were extracted from 21-day old M. tuberculosis cultures first
by adding 2 volumes of CH3OH and 1 volume of CHCl3 for 2 days,
then in 2:1 CHCl3/CH3OH (v/v). Pooled extracts were concen-
trated, washed with water and evaporated to dryness. For specific
radiolabeling, each strain was cultured to exponential phase and
labeled by incubation with [1-14C]propionate (54 Ci.mol21, ARC
Radiochemical, St Louis, MO) for 2 days. Lipids were first analyzed
on silica gel 60 TLC plates (E. Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in
various solvent systems (see the legend to figures). Radiolabeled
lipids were visualized with a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham,
Biosciences). For lipid purification, the chloroform phase was
applied to an anion exchange Sep-pak cartridge (Waters Accell Plus
QMA; Waters Corporation) eluted successively by 10 ml CHCl3,
10 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH 95/5 (v/v), 10 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH 9/
1 (v/v) to elute DAT, 10 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O 60/35/8 (v/
v) to elute residual neutral compounds, 10 ml of chloroform/
methanol 1/2 (v/v) containing 0.1 M ammonium acetate to elute
negatively charged compounds (phospholipids) and 10 ml of
chloroform/methanol 1/2 (v/v) containing 0.3 M ammonium
acetate for the elution of sulfolipids. PIMs were extracted from
bacterial cells and subjected to MALDI-MS analysis in the negative
ion mode as described previously [54].
MALDI-Tof-MS
MALDI-Tof-MS analysis were performed on a 4700 Proteomics
Analyser (with Tof-Tof Optics, Applied Biosystems) using the
reflectron mode. Ionization was effected by irradiation with pulsed
UV light (355 nm) from an Nd:YAG laser. Samples were analyzed
by the instrument operating at 20 kV in the positive ion mode
using an extraction delay time set at 20 ns. Typically, spectra from
1,000 to 2,500 laser shots were summed to obtain the final
spectrum. The HABA (2-[4-hydroxy-phenylazo]-benzoic acid)
matrix was used at a concentration of ,10 mg/ml in ethanol/
water (1:1, v/v). Then, 0.5 ml sample solution and 0.5 ml of the
matrix solution were deposited on the target, mixed with a
micropipette and dried under a gentle stream of warm air. The
measurements were externally calibrated at two points with
mycobacterial PIM.
Chemical analysis of the mannose cap on LAM
The presence of mannose caps in M. tuberculosis strains GC1237,
Rv1503c::Tn
and
Rv1506c::Tn
was
analyzed
by
capillary
electrophoresis (CE) as described earlier [55]. In short, partially
purified ManLAM is partially degradated by controlled acid
hydolysis (0.1 M HCl for 20 min. at 110uC), and the oligosac-
charides liberated tagged with the fluorescent label 8-aminopyr-
ene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (APTS). During CE, the labeled oligosac-
charides are separated and peaks are detected by laser-induced
fluorescence and elution times compared with the appropriate
standards.
NMR analysis
NMR spectra were recorded with an Avance DMX500
spectrometer (Bruker GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) equipped
with an Origin 200 SGI using Xwinnmr 2.6. Native molecules
were dissolved in CDCl3-CD3OD, 9:1, v/v and analyzed in
20065 mm 535-PP NMR tubes at 295 K. Proton chemical shifts
are expressed in ppm downfield from the signal of the chloroform
(dH/TMS
7.27).
All
the
details
concerning
used
COSY,
HOHAHA and
1H-13C HMQC sequences and experimental
procedures were as previously reported [56].
Trafficking study with silica beads
Silica beads (3 mM diameter; Kisker Biotech, Germany) were
washed two times with sterile PBS before incubation overnight at
4uC with 5% (w/v) BSA-Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen, Eugene,
OR). The beads were then washed two times with PBS to remove
unbound BSA. BSA coated beads were added in a glass tube
containing 100 mg of DAT or Ac4SGL and sonicated for 10
minutes. All coated beads were washed once again two times with
PBS before trafficking experiments. The efficiency of lipid coating
was evaluated by re-extracting the lipids from the coated beads
followed by TLC analysis, and was found to be nearly 100% (not
shown).
Lipid-coated beads suspended in RPMI (+10% human serum)
were added at a ratio of 3-5 beads/cell on human macrophages
differentiated from adherent mononuclear cells from healthy
donor in the presence of 5 UI/ml of hMCSF (Miltenyi Biotech,
Germany) for 6 days in 48-well plates. Plates were centrifuged for
1 minute at 1,000 rpm and incubated at 37uC under 5% CO2.
Fifteen minutes later, cells were washed with PBS and 200 ml
RPMI
containing
250 nM
of
LysoTracker
green
DND-26
(Invitrogen)
was
added
before
incubation
at
37uC
under
5%CO2. Cells were fixed 70 minutes later with 4% PFA and
the number of LysoTracker-positive phagosomes was immediately
estimated using a Leica confocal fluorescence microscope (SP2)
equipped with a Plan Apo 4061.4 Ph 6 objective (Olympus
Optical) and CoolSNAP-Pro CF digital camera in conjunction
with Image-Pro Plus version 4.5.1.3 software (Media Cybernetics).
At least 500 beads from at least 5 independent fields were counted

for each experiment. For phagosomal pH quantification, a flow
cytometry-based method of dual fluorescence measurement was
employed [23]. Briefly, beads were coated with 5% FITC- and
Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated BSA in PBS overnight at 4uC. Beads
were washed twice in PBS, and sonicated in PBS in the presence of
the different purified lipids (100 mg lipids/2.106 beads) at room
temperature for 15 min. Beads were washed twice in PBS, and
used to pulse the cells (2 beads/cell). Fluorescence recording (LSR
II apparatus, Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) and pH calculation
were done as previously and extensively detailed in [23].
In vivo experiments
6 week-old female Balb/C mice (ORIENTBIO Inc., South
Korea) were challenged with M. tuberculosis GC1237, Rv1503c::Tn,
Rv1506c::Tn and their corresponding complemented counterparts
via the intranasal route with 10 ml of a suspension containing
5.105 organisms/ml to obtain an inhaled dose of 100 CFU in lungs.
After 42 days, organs from killed mice were homogenized by use of
an MM300 apparatus (Qiagen) and 2.5-mm diameter glass beads.
Serial 10-fold dilutions in medium were plated on 7H11 agar and
colony forming unit counts were ascertained at 37uC after 3 weeks
of growth.
Ethics statement
Animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with the
recommendations from the Animal Protection Law in Korea. The
protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of Institut Pasteur Korea (Permit Number: IPK-
10003). All efforts were made to minimize suffering of the animals.
Human monocytes were purified from blood samples obtained
from healthy blood donors under strict anonymity (Etablissement
Franc¸ais du Sang, EFS, Toulouse). Written informed consents
were obtained from the donors under EFS contract nu21/PVNT/
TOU/IPBS01/2009-0052. With respect to Decree nu2007-1220
(articles L1243-4, R1243-61 and following) dated August 10th
2007 of the French Public Health Code (published in the Official
Journal of the French Republic of August 14th 2007), the contract
received formal approval by the French Ministry of Science and
Technology (decision nuAC 2009-921). As a ‘‘collection’’ is defined
by Decree 2007-1220 as ‘‘a collection, for scientific use, of
biological samples from a group of persons who have been
identified and selected on the basis of clinical or biological
characteristics of one or several members of the group’’, and as the
blood samples used in our study were not obtained from
individuals that have been ‘‘identified or selected on the basis of
clinical or biological characteristics’’, these samples do not
constitute a so-called ‘‘collection’’, which waives the need for
ethical approval by the ethical committee ‘‘Comite´ de Protection
des Personnes’’, in agreement with Decree 2007-1220, article
R1243-63.
