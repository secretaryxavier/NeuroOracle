Abstract: Aripiprazole has been reported to exert variable effects on cognitive function in patients
with schizophrenia. Therefore, in the present study, we evaluated biological markers, clinical data,
and psychiatric symptoms in order to identify factors that inﬂuence cognitive function in patients with
schizophrenia undergoing aripiprazole treatment. We evaluated cognitive function in 51 patients with
schizophrenia using Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS), as well as background
information, psychiatric symptoms, plasma catecholamine metabolites—homovanillic acid (HVA),
3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG)—, and serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
Multivariate analyses were performed in order to identify factors independently associated with
cognitive function.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, number of hospitalizations, and
MHPG levels were associated with verbal memory and learning. Total hospitalization period and
MHPG levels were associated with working memory. Age at ﬁrst hospitalization and education
were associated with motor speed. The number of hospital admissions, Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale negative subscale scores (PANSS-N), MHPG levels, BDNF levels, and Drug-Induced
Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS) scores were associated with verbal ﬂuency. Homovanillic
acid and MHPG levels, duration of illness, and PANSS-N scores were associated with attention and
processing speed. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and MHPG levels were associated with executive
function. These results suggest that treatment of psychiatric symptoms and cognitive dysfunction
may be improved in patients treated with aripiprazole by controlling for these contributing factors.
Keywords: brain-derived neurotrophic factor; schizophrenia; aripiprazole; cognitive function
1. Introduction
Aripiprazole has a unique pharmacology with partial agonist activity at dopamine D2/D3
receptors, associated with a low risk of hyperprolactinemia [1,2], and partial agonist activity at
serotonin (5-HT) 5-HT1A receptors and antagonist activity at 5-HT2A receptors. It has a low risk of
metabolic side effects, weight gain, increase in total cholesterol and blood pressure, hyperprolactinemia
and sedation [3,4].
Therefore, it has widely been recommended as a ﬁrst-line treatment for
schizophrenia [5,6].
The actions of antipsychotic drugs on the catecholamine system, particularly the dopamine
system, have led to many studies of catecholamine metabolites as possible markers for psychosis and
the antipsychotic response. Plasma homovanillic acid (HVA) was shown to reﬂect central or brain
dopamine activity based on studies in animals and humans [7–9]. Several studies of schizophrenia have
noted that the behavioral response to antipsychotic drugs, such as a decrease in psychosis, parallels a

decrease in plasma HVA levels in schizophrenic patients over time [10–20]. Atypical antipsychotics
increase the plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG) levels and are associated with negative
symptoms and cognitive functions [19,21,22]. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the most
widely distributed neurotrophic factor in the brain, the levels of which have been associated with
schizophrenia. The role of BDNF in cognition has also been shown for some animal and human
schizophrenia [23–26].
Recent trends in the treatment of schizophrenia include the provision of recovery-oriented care,
which highlights the need to improve cognitive and social functioning in order for each patient to
achieve his or her treatment goals. Research has demonstrated that, unlike with other antipsychotics,
the dose of aripiprazole has no signiﬁcant effect on cognitive function or subjective well-being in
patients with schizophrenia [27,28]. In addition, previous studies have reported that the dose of
atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and olanzapine is negatively correlated with cognitive
function in patients with schizophrenia [27], and that dose reduction results in cognitive improvement
in this patient population [29].
However, the effects of aripiprazole on cognitive function are reported to be variable when
compared with other atypical antipsychotics. In addition, we previously demonstrated that the effects
of aripiprazole on levels of catecholamine metabolites and plasma BDNF differed from those of other
atypical antipsychotics in patients with acute schizophrenia [19,30]. Thus, these ﬁndings indicate that,
unlike risperidone and olanzapine, aripiprazole does not exert dose-dependent effects on cognitive
function, although its overall effect on psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functioning is equivalent
to that of other atypical antipsychotics. Aripiprazole has been reported to sufﬁciently improve positive
and negative symptoms with low incidence of sedation, weight gain, and cardiovascular risk.
However, the factors contributing to cognitive preservation in patients with schizophrenia
undergoing long-term treatment with aripiprazole remain unknown. Therefore, in the present study,
we evaluated biological markers, clinical data, and psychiatric symptoms in order to identify factors
that inﬂuence cognitive function in this patient population.

Multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors independently associated with cognitive
function in patients with schizophrenia for each item on the brief assessment of cognition in
schizophrenia Japanese version (BACS-J) and for composite scores. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
levels, number of hospitalizations, and MHPG levels were associated with verbal memory and learning.
Total hospitalization period and MHPG levels were associated with working memory. Age at ﬁrst
hospitalization and education were associated with motor speed. The number of hospital admissions,
negative subscale of the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS-N) scores, MHPG levels,
BDNF levels, and drug-induced extrapyramidal symptoms scale (DIEPSS) scores were associated with
verbal ﬂuency. Homovanillic acid and MHPG levels, duration of illness, and PANSS-N scores were
associated with attention and processing speed. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor and MHPG levels
were associated with executive function (Table 2).

3. Discussion
The present study investigated the factors associated with preserved cognitive functioning in
psychiatrically stable patients with schizophrenia treated with aripiprazole monotherapy. Interestingly,
the factors affecting cognitive function differed across the various cognitive domains. The plasma
BDNF level was associated with verbal memory and learning ability, verbal ﬂuency, and executive
function, which may be partly explained by dysfunction of the hippocampal complex. Brain-derived
neurotrophic factor is abundant in the hippocampus, inﬂuencing memory function as well as other
aspects of cognition. According to previous reports [31–33], the serum BDNF level is most likely
associated with neurocognitive functions such as learning and memory. We also observed that plasma
MHPG levels were associated with cognitive domains such as verbal learning, working memory,
verbal ﬂuency, attention and processing speed, and executive function, suggesting that preserved
cognitive functioning in patients receiving aripiprazole may be partly related to activation of the
noradrenergic system activation. Indeed, a previous study [22] reported that the plasma MHPG level
was associated with attention and processing speed, and that eight weeks of aripiprazole treatment
signiﬁcantly increased plasma MHPG levels.
There are several limitations in the present study. First, it was an open-label trial rather than a
double-blind, ﬁxed-dose study. Second, the sample size was small. Third, there was no healthy control
group, and the follow-up period was short. Fourth, plasma MHPG and HVA levels are thought to
reﬂect only 30%–50% and 10%–20% of the dynamics of the brain, respectively. Fifth, the source of
circulating BDNF remains unknown. Platelets, brain, and vascular endothelial cells are considered
candidate sources. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that sampling characteristics, several
sociodemographic variables (such as urbanicity, age, sex), lifestyle factors (such as smoking status
and food and alcohol intake), and somatic diseases are relevant determinants of peripheral BDNF
levels. Thus, it is mandatory that the results presented are discussed with respect to these determinants.
Finally, we did not check for potential collinearity that may exist between the different predictors; that
will inﬂate the statistical signiﬁcance unduly. Therefore, further precise and well-controlled studies
considering above problems should be done to lead to robust results.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Patients and Procedure
The present study included 51 patients (Men/Female = 31/20) diagnosed with schizophrenia
based on Diagnostic Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)
criteria (30 men, 21 women; mean age ± standard deviation (SD): 30.4 ± 7.9 years). All patients were
treated with aripiprazole monotherapy in the acute stage of illness and the subsequent six months or
more without any tolerability concerns. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) comorbid central nervous
system disorder; (2) severe psychotic symptoms; (3) meeting DSM-IV criteria for alcohol or other
substance dependence; (4) meeting DSM-IV criteria for mental retardation; (5) use of antidepressants;
(6) treatment with electroconvulsive therapy in the six months preceding the study; and (7) inability to
understand the study protocol.
Psychiatric symptoms were assessed using the PANSS. Background information including gender,
age, dominant arm, age at onset, duration of untreated psychosis, number of hospitalizations, length of
hospitalization, years of education, concomitant medications, and smoking history was also collected.
In addition, blood levels of HVA, MHPG, and BDNF were measured.
All subjects gave their informed consent for inclusion before they participated in the study.
The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the protocol was
approved by the Ethics Committee of University of Occupational and Environmental Heatlh,
Kitakyushu, Japan (Project identiﬁcation code: 08-08).

4.2. Japanese Version of Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia
Cognitive function was assessed by trained psychiatrists using the Japanese version of the Brief
Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS-J) [34]. The BACS-J has established reliability
and validity and is designed to measure various aspects of cognitive function in patients with
schizophrenia [34,35]. The metric includes brief assessments of verbal memory, working memory,
motor speed, verbal ﬂuency, attention and processing speed, and executive function. The primary
measures from each subtest of the BACS-J were standardized by creating z-scores (the mean of healthy
controls was set to zero, and the standard deviation was set to one). All data from healthy controls
were obtained from a study by [36], and a composite score was calculated by averaging all z-scores for
the six primary measures. The inﬂuence of age was adjusted using age-matched cohorts of controls to
calculate the BACS-J z-scores for each patient in the present study.
4.3. Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, Plasma Homovanillic Acid, and
3-Methoxy-4-Hydroxyphenylglycol Level Measurements
Serum BDNF levels were measured using a BDNF Emax Immunoassay Kit (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The standard curve was linear from 5 pg/mL
to 5000 pg/mL. The lower limit of detection was 10 pg/mL. The recovery rate was >90%.
Levels of plasma catecholamine metabolites (HVA and MHPG) were measured using
high-performance liquid chromatography. The standard curves of plasma HVA and MHPG were linear
from 0.5 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL. The lower limit of detection was 0.5 ng/mL. The intra and inter-assay
coefﬁcients of variation were 7% and 6%, respectively. The recovery rate was >80%.
All fasting blood samples were obtained between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. Two glass tube were prepared
for blood sampling. One plain tube for serum, and another tube with ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid disodium salt (EDTA-2Na) for plasma. Twenty milliliter venous blood was drawn from the
participants while they were in a supine position and after they had been lying at rest overnight.
4.4. Statistical Analysis
Multiple linear regression analysis was performed using STATA software (Stata Corp. Ltd.,
College Station, TX, USA). Data were expressed as the mean ± SD on the parametric distribution of
the variable. To determine variables potentially predictive aripiprazole cognitive effects, multiple
linear regressions (forward-stepwise selection) were performed. The BACS-J sub-scores were used as
the dependent variables, while the independent variables included gender, age at onset, duration of
untreated psychosis, concomitant medications, smoking history, PANSS scores, DIEPSS scores, and
levels of HVA, MHPG, and BDNF. All independent variables ﬁt a normal distribution. A p-value < 0.05
was considered signiﬁcant.
5. Conclusions
In the present study, we observed a tendency for negative psychotic symptoms to correlate with
cognitive dysfunction, and that certain background factors such as education, number of hospital
admissions, duration of illness, and age at ﬁrst hospitalization were associated with various aspects of
cognitive function in patients with schizophrenia undergoing aripiprazole monotherapy. These results
suggest that treatment of psychiatric symptoms and cognitive dysfunction may be improved in
patients treated with aripiprazole by controlling for these contributing factors, and that improved
understanding of the mechanisms underlying these associations may lead to improved functioning
and quality of life in this patient population.
