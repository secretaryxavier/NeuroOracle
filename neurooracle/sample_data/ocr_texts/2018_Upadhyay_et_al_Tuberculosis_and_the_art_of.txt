ABSTRACT
Macrophages are ﬁrst-line responders against microbes. The success of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) rests upon its ability
to convert these antimicrobial cells into a permissive cellular niche. This is a remarkable accomplishment, as the
antimicrobial arsenal of macrophages is extensive. Normally bacteria are delivered to an acidic, degradative lysosome
through one of several trafﬁcking pathways, including LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) and autophagy. Once
phagocytozed, the bacilli are subjected to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and they induce the expression of
proinﬂammatory cytokines, which serve to augment host responses. However, Mtb hijacks these host defense mechanisms,
manipulating host cellular trafﬁcking, innate immune responses, and cell death pathways to its beneﬁt. The complex series
of measures and countermeasures between host and pathogen ultimately determines the outcome of infection. In this
review, we focus on the diverse effectors that Mtb uses in its multipronged effort to subvert the innate immune responses of
macrophages. We highlight recent advances in understanding the molecular interface of the Mtb–macrophage interaction.

INTRODUCTION
In 1882, Robert Koch announced that Mycobacterium tuberculo-
sis (Mtb) causes tuberculosis (TB). In the same year, Metchnikoff
made the surprising ﬁnding that host phagocytes ingest and kill
bacteria. Thus, protagonist and antagonist were identiﬁed, and
more than 100 years later, the story continues to unfold. Work
from many investigators has provided a detailed, molecular un-
derstanding of the antimicrobial arsenal of Metchnikoff’s phago-
cytes. How Mtb is able to subvert these host defenses remains
an area of ongoing investigation. Here, we focus on the effectors
that enable Mtb to impair macrophage function, thereby under-
mining the innate and adaptive immune response. It has been
known for decades that one of the principle ways in which Mtb
does this is by preventing its own delivery to the lysosome (Arm-
strong and Hart 1971). Recent studies have revealed two dis-
tinct lysosomal trafﬁcking pathways that involve LC3-marked
organelles (Huang and Brumell 2014; Martinez et al. 2015). To
prevent its degradation, Mtb must be able to undermine these
distinct, lysosomal trafﬁcking pathways. In addition, Mtb en-
counters many cellular and subcellular host environments that
it has to navigate (Ehrt and Schnappinger 2009; Srivastava, Ernst
and Desvignes 2014). Here, we focus our discussion on how Mtb
directly manipulates host cellular trafﬁcking, innate immune re-
sponses, and cell death pathways in macrophages. There is con-
siderably less known about how Mtb directly manipulates other
myeloid cells, such as dendritic cells and neutrophils; therefore,
we concentrate on macrophages. There are already many excel-
lent reviews on these topics, so we speciﬁcally emphasize the
role of Mtb effectors and recent ﬁndings. Lastly, we have tried
to assimilate many studies into a cohesive picture. In doing so,
we have not been able to give all studies the attention they de-
serve, and we have glossed over details. We direct the inter-
ested reader to more comprehensive reviews and the primary
literature.

FIRST ENCOUNTERS
Once inhaled, Mtb is taken up by alveolar macrophages.
Macrophages are phenotypically diverse (Jakubzick, Randolph
and Henson 2017), and alveolar macrophages, the ﬁrst to en-
counter Mtb, are adapted to minimize lung injury. This may
make alveolar macrophages particularly poorly equipped to
control Mtb (Hussell and Bell 2014; Rajaram et al. 2014). More-
over, mycobacteria selectively recruit permissive monocytes
instead of more antimicrobial populations to the site of in-
fection (Cambier et al. 2014). Numerous phagocytic receptors
can mediate uptake of Mtb into macrophages (Philips and
Ernst 2012; Stamm, Collins and Shiloh 2015). The particular
phagocytic receptors that Mtb engages may inﬂuence the sub-
sequent ability of macrophages to control infection. In fact,
shortly after D’Arcy Hart demonstrated that Mtb can evade
lysosomal degradation (Armstrong and Hart 1971), he showed
that antibody opsonized bacteria, which bind the Fc-γ recep-
tor, trafﬁc to the lysosome (Armstrong and Hart 1975). Con-
versely, mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) in the
mycobacterial envelop binds mannose receptor (MR), which can
impair phagosome maturation (Kang et al. 2005). Recent work
demonstrates that human MR activates the protein tyrosine
phosphatase SHP-1, which blocks phagosome maturation by
limiting the activity of class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) on Mtb phagosomes (Rajaram et al. 2017). Thus, even be-
fore entering the phagocyte, Mtb may set itself up for success
by selectively parasitizing more permissive cells and interact-
ing with cell surface receptors that promote its intracellular
survival.
MTB’S INTRACELLULAR LIFESTYLE
Normally after uptake, a phagosome immediately matures
from a comparatively inert compartment to an antimicrobial
phagolysosome (Flannagan, Cos´ıo and Grinstein 2009). The
phagosome acidiﬁes, acquires lysosomal hydrolases and antimi-
crobial peptides, and restricts essential nutrients such as iron,
while generating a toxic burst of zinc (Botella et al. 2011). In ad-
dition, microorganisms activate pattern recognition receptors
(PRRs), which augment the antimicrobial capacity of the phago-
some by promoting NADPH oxidase recruitment (Nunes, De-
maurex and Dinauer 2013). The NADPH oxidase generates reac-
tive oxygen species (ROS) to kill microorganisms and promotes a
distinct phagosome maturation pathway called LC3-associated
phagocytosis (Martinez et al. 2015). Mtb and related species such
as M. marinum prevent these normal maturation events. Multi-
ple effectors enable Mtb to modulate phagosome maturation,
undermining the normal antimicrobial capacity of lysosomal
trafﬁcking. The mycobacterial vacuole is characterized by the
prolonged retention of early endosomal markers that are nor-
mally cleared from the maturing phagosomal surface, while the
NADPH oxidase and numerous late endosomal and lysosomal
markers are diminished or absent, including the vacuolar-H(+ )-
ATPase (V-ATPase) (Sturgill-Koszycki et al. 1994) (Fig. 1). This early
endosome-like arrest allows the bacteria to acquire iron via re-
cycling endosomes, while avoiding the degradative environment
of the lysosome.
MTB PERFORATES THE PHAGOSOME
One of the most critical determinants of bacterial fate in
the macrophage is the Mtb ESX-1 type VII secretion system
(recently reviewed in Wong 2017). Disruption of this secretion
system in the vaccine strain BCG is the major reason that BCG
is attenuated. ESX-1 secretes a number of effectors, including a
heterodimer composed of EsxA/ESAT-6 and EsxB/CFP-10 (Cham-
pion et al. 2006). EsxA is implicated in rupturing the phagosome.
Whether the EsxA protein itself has direct membranolytic activ-
ity is controversial (de Jonge et al. 2007; Conrad et al. 2017), but
numerous studies demonstrate that mycobacterial mutants de-
fective in esxA do not perforate the phagosome, and they have
less membrane lytic activity (Hsu et al. 2003; Gao et al. 2004;
van der Wel et al. 2007; Simeone et al. 2012; Watson, Manzanillo
and Cox 2012) (Fig. 1B). The nature of the membranolytic activ-
ity is not entirely clear, but it appears that mycobacteria cause
gross membrane disruption in a contact-dependent manner
(Myrvik, Leake and Wright 1984; Conrad et al. 2017; Schnettger
et al. 2017). Recent work shows that the mycobacterial lipid ph-
thicerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) works in concert with EsxA in
mediating phagosomal damage (Augenstreich et al. 2017; Bar-
czak et al. 2017; Quigley et al. 2017). Like mutants defective in
esxA, PDIM mutants are attenuated, and they fail to promote
host cell death or induce type I interferon, both of which are cor-
related with phagosomal damage. It is possible that additional
bacterial factors also promote phagosomal damage, such as the
sphingomyelinase SpmT/Rv0888, which, like ESX-1, contributes
to the hemolytic activity of Mtb (Speer et al. 2015).
Damage to the Mtb phagosome is central to the pathogens’
success and also provokes a host response. ESX-1-dependent
membrane damage happens early after bacterial uptake, and
host cytosolic sensors detect bacterial products and respond
within the ﬁrst hours of infection (Stanley et al. 2007; Wong and
Jacobs 2011; Manzanillo et al. 2012; Subbian et al. 2013; Collins
et al. 2015; Simeone et al. 2015; Wassermann et al. 2015; Watson
et al. 2015). Presumably the ability of Mtb to perforate the phago-
some is so critical to its success because that is how Mtb deliv-
ers the majority of its effectors to the cytosol (Fig. 1C). For ex-
ample, recent work showed that the TB necrotizing toxin, TNT,
is trapped in esx-1 mutant phagosomes, whereas it gains ac-
cess to the cytoplasm during wild-type infection. Once in the
cytosol, TNT can hydrolyze host nicotinamide adenine dinu-
cleotide (NAD+) and causes necrosis (Sun et al. 2015). Thus, the
role of EsxA in host cell death or other cellular phenotypes
might be quite indirect, reﬂecting a failure to deliver effectors
to the cytoplasm or a secondary consequence of endomem-
brane damage. Phagosomal damage may also provide access
to important nutrients to the bacilli, and over time, increasing
membrane damage eventually allows bacilli translocate to the
cytosol (van der Wel et al. 2007; Houben et al. 2012; Simeone
et al. 2012). What determines whether the bacteria lightly perfo-
rate the phagosome to ‘access’ the cytosol versus fully rupture
the organelle and translocate into the cytosol is unclear. The
degree of damage depends not only upon the bacterial strain,
but also host cell type. Thus, host determinants that inﬂuence
phagosome acidiﬁcation, NRAMP (natural resistance associated
macrophage proteins) function, and phospholipase A2 activity
might inﬂuence the degree of membrane damage (Simeone et al.
2015; Jamwal et al. 2016). Interestingly, recent work suggests that
host RAB20, by promoting formation of a spacious vacuole, an-
tagonizes ESX-1 mediated-membrane damage (Schnettger et al.
2017). While the nature of the damage itself and the host fac-
tors that modulate it are not well elucidated, what is clear is
that the consequences of perforating the phagosome are dra-
matic: bacterial effectors are set loose, and the host responds
to the damage by altering cellular trafﬁcking and activating in-
ﬂammatory signaling. Bacterial effectors undoubtedly modulate
this ensuing host response. Thus, a complex series of measures

Figure 1. Mtb effectors manipulate host lysosomal trafﬁcking. (A) Mtb and BCG impair lysosomal trafﬁcking. Complex glycolipids in the mycobacterial cell wall such as
PIM and ManLAM can impair acquisition of PI3P and alter RAB protein dynamics. Early endosomal RAB proteins (RAB5, RAB22A, RAB14) are retained, and recruitment
of activated RAB7 is impaired. (B) Mtb permeabilizes the phagosome, which depends upon EsxA and PDIM. This promotes host defense by activating cytosolic sensors
and autophagy, and also allows bacterial effectors to gain access to the cytosol. (C) Once bacterial effectors enter the cytoplasm, they further inhibit host pathways.
SapM hydrolyzes PI3P, and PtpA, NdkA, CpsA and EsxG-EsxH target proteins involved in lysosomal trafﬁcking, including the V-ATPase, VPS33B, RAB7, NADPH oxidase
and HRS/ESCRT. Addition effectors manipulate inﬂammasome signaling and IL-1β production. Host proteins are shown in grey, whereas bacterial protein effectors are
in red and bacterial lipids are magenta. The action (activating or inhibitory arrow) of the bacterial or host factor is also shown in red or blue, respectively.
and countermeasures are set in motion that will ultimately de-
termine the outcome of infection.
MTB BLOCKS PHAGOSOME MATURATION
Mtb has a multipronged approach to subvert lysosomal traf-
ﬁcking pathways, undermining the functions of RAB proteins,
PI3K, the vacuolar-H(+ )-ATPase (V-ATPase) and the NADPH ox-
idase (Fig. 1). Small GTP-binding RAB proteins control vesicular
transport between organelles (Prashar et al. 2017), with RAB5 and
RAB7 serving as master regulators of transport along the endo-
cytic and phagocytic pathways. Normally, nascent phagosomes
recruit RAB5, which is subsequently replaced by late endocytic
RAB7 during the maturation process (an event termed Rab con-
version) (Rink et al. 2005). RAB7 recruits downstream effectors
to confer fusion competence with lysosomes. In contrast, the
mycobacterial phagosome is characterized by altered RAB dy-
namics (Via et al. 1997; Fratti et al. 2001; Vergne et al. 2004; Seto,
Tsujimura and Koide 2011).
At least two bacterial effectors interfere with RAB conversion.
Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) possesses GTPase activat-
ing protein (GAP) activity toward RAB5 and RAB7 in vitro (Sun
et al. 2010). In addition, the Mtb secreted tyrosine phosphatase
PtpA dephosphorylates Vps33B (Bach et al. 2008). Based upon
its homology to yeast Vps33p, VPS33B was initially thought to
be a part of the endosomal tethering complexes, CORVET/HOPS
(class C core vacuole/endosome tethering and homotypic fu-
sion and protein sorting). These complexes are recruited to
RAB5 and RAB7 containing membranes, where they function in
endosome-endosome and endosome-lysosome fusion, respec-
tively (Balderhaar and Ungermann 2013). In mammals there
are two VPS33 proteins, and VPS33B may not be a member of
CORVET/HOPS, but rather a mammalian-speciﬁc endosomal-
targeting complex involved in lysosomal trafﬁcking (van der
Kant et al. 2015). Remarkably, when absorbed on latex beads,
both recombinant NdkA and PtpA were shown to impair lysoso-
mal trafﬁcking of the beads (Bach et al. 2008; Sun et al. 2010). This
is hard to reconcile with the cytosolic location of their targets.
In the case of PtpA, when adsorbed on beads, the recombinant
protein was able to enter the cytosol, although it is not yet clear
how this happens. For NdkA, the protein is required for intra-
cellular survival of BCG, suggesting that either NdkA acts inside
the phagosome or it also has some way to access the cytosol in
the absence of ESX-1.
Mtb manipulates RAB proteins so that the mycobacterial
phagosome maintains its interaction with early endosomes. For

example, phagosomes containing live BCG retain RAB14 and
RAB22A, which are cleared from phagosomes that contain heat
killed BCG. The retention of RAB14 and RAB22A may be impor-
tant in allowing the mycobacterial phagosome to maintain its
early endosome-like state (Kyei et al. 2006; Roberts et al. 2006;
Seto, Tsujimura and Koide 2011). Since these studies were done
with BCG, which does not perforate the phagosome, the ob-
served alterations in RAB trafﬁcking do not depend upon de-
livery of ESX-1-delivered cytosolic effectors. Perhaps select pro-
teins are still able to access the cytosol in BCG infections, which
is also suggested by the PtpA and NdkA experiments mentioned
above. In addition, the secreted protein TlyA, which may have
membrane destabilizing activity of its own, has been shown to
recruit RAB14 (Mittal et al. 2014). Moreover, mycobacterial cell
envelope glycolipids intercalate into host membranes (Beatty
et al. 2000), where they modulate trafﬁcking irrespective of ESX-
1 or phagosomal damage. For example, the mycobacterial cell
envelope glycolipid phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM) has
been shown to promote phagosome-early endosome fusion by
altering RAB programing (Vergne et al. 2004). At the same time,
ManLAM can disrupt a calcium-dependent calmodulin signaling
pathway, thereby impairing phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate
(PI3P) production and phagosome maturation (Fratti et al. 2003).
In fact, ManLAM coated beads were shown to preferentially re-
tain RAB14 (Shui et al. 2011). Thus, ESX-1-independent effectors,
such as PIM and ManLAM, likely work in concert with cytosolic
effectors during Mtb infection.
The class III PI3K VPS34 also plays an essential role in phago-
some maturation. VPS34 generates PI3P on early endosomes,
which is critical in recruiting early endosomal proteins involved
in protein sorting, membrane trafﬁcking and multiprotein com-
plex assembly. PI3P is also important in autophagy initiation,
as discussed below. The mycobacterial phagosome accumu-
lates less PI3P than phagosomes containing latex beads or dead
mycobacteria (Chua and Deretic 2004; Vieira et al. 2004; Purdy
et al. 2005; Vergne et al. 2005). In addition to ManLAM, dis-
cussed above, which can impair PI3P production, secreted SapM
is thought to remove it, by acting as a PI3P phosphatase (Vergne
et al. 2005). Mtb requires SapM to arrest phagosome maturation.
Consistent with the idea that SapM acts in the cytosol, when it
is deleted in BCG, there is no effect (Festjens et al. 2011; Saiko-
lappan et al. 2012; Puri, Reddy and Tyagi 2013).
One important PI3P binding protein is hepatocyte growth
factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (HGS/HRS). Normally,
HRS is localized to early endosomes, where it recruits the en-
dosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT), which
directs receptors to multivesicular bodies for lysosomal degra-
dation. Mtb phagosomes do not efﬁciently recruit HRS. The fail-
ure to recruit HRS is not explained just by the diminished PI3P
found on Mtb phagosomes (Mittal, unpublished); Mtb takes ad-
ditional measures to impair ESCRT. We found that the Mtb se-
creted effector EsxH binds HRS and inhibits ESCRT activity. EsxH
is secreted as a heterodimer with EsxG by the ESX-3 type VII
secretion system. We found that EsxG-EsxH is critical for viru-
lence, and it impairs phagosome maturation and inhibits MHC
II antigen presentation likely by targeting ESCRT (Mehra et al.
2013; Portal-Celhay et al. 2016; Tufariello et al. 2016). Given the
variety of cell biological processes that ESCRT is involved in, in-
cluding exosome secretion (Hanson and Cashikar 2012), it seems
likely that EsxG-EsxH also perturbs additional cellular functions
to promote virulence.
Recent work shows that Mtb disrupts the vacuolar-H(+)-
ATPase (V-ATPase) both directly and by co-opting a host degrada-
tive pathway. In the later mechanism, Mtb infection induces the
expression of host cytokine-induced SRC homology 2 (SH2) do-
main protein (CISH), a member of the suppressor of cytokine sig-
naling (SOCS) family. CISH localizes to Mtb phagosomes and se-
lectively targets subunit A of the V-ATPase for ubiquitination and
degradation (Queval et al. 2017). In addition, PtpA binds subunit
H of the V-ATPase. By directly binding both VPS33B, as discussed
above, and the V-ATPase, PtpA may prevent delivery of V-ATPase-
containing vesicles to Mtb phagosomes (Wong et al. 2011, 2018).
The NADPH oxidase generates ROS that have important an-
timicrobial activities, but also can be toxic to the host. Therefore,
this multiprotein complex is selectively targeted to phagosomes
containing microorganisms and its activity is tightly regulated.
NADPH oxidase is composed of two integral membrane subunits
that form ﬂavocytochrome b558 and a trimeric cytosolic complex
(composed of p40phox, p47phox and p67phox). PRRs promote recruit-
ment of ﬂavocytochrome b558 to the maturing phagosome from
recycling endosomes (Casbon et al. 2009). The cytosolic subunits
subsequently assemble with the membrane components, and
the catalytic activity of the assembled complex depends upon
recruitment of GTP-bound RAC1/2 (Nunes, Demaurex and Din-
auer 2013). Mtb appears to have taken advantage of the mul-
tiple levels of NADPH oxidase regulation to undermine each
step. We recently found that the Mtb protein CpsA, a LytR-CpsA-
Psr (LCP) domain-containing protein, inhibits recruitment of the
ﬂavocytochrome b558 complex and downstream cytosolic com-
ponents to mycobacterial phagosomes (K¨oster et al. 2017). The
p40phoxsubunit of the cytosolic complex binds PI3P through its
PX domains (Ellson et al. 2001; Kanai et al. 2001). Therefore, SapM
and ManLAM, by blocking PI3P, would also be predicted to impair
recruitment of the trimeric cytosolic complex, although this re-
quires experimental validation. Lastly, in addition to acting on
RAB5 and RAB7 as discussed above, NdkA can serves as GAP to
inactivate RAC1, thereby disrupting the ﬁnal activation step re-
quired for ROS (Sun et al. 2013). Thus, the concerted activity of
at least four Mtb effectors likely undermines the highly regu-
lated trafﬁcking, assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase. In
addition, Mtb express ROS detoxifying enzymes such as super-
oxide dismutase (SodA) and the catalase KatG. Mtb’s success-
ful evasion of the NADPH oxidase may explain why NADPH ox-
idase plays a limited role in host defense against Mtb, at least
in mice (Ng et al. 2004). In people, mutations in NADPH oxi-
dase cause chronic granulomatous disease, which results in in-
creased susceptibility to mycobacterial diseases, including Mtb
(Deffert, Cachat and Krause 2014). Therefore, even though Mtb
has enzymes that detoxify ROS as well as multiple strategies to
inhibit the NADPH oxidase, it must do so imperfectly. Thus, the
battle over ROS appears to be at the crux of a fragile detente.
Recent work has shown that in addition to direct antimicro-
bial activity, the NADPH oxidase plays an important role in lyso-
somal trafﬁcking by promoting a non-canonical LC3 trafﬁcking
pathway called LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP). This path-
way is different than autophagy (discussed below). While both
use a common set of autophagy-related (ATG) proteins and re-
sult in LC3 deposition into the vacuolar membrane, LAP involves
a single-membrane organelle and depends upon the NADPH ox-
idase (Mehta et al. 2014; Martinez et al. 2015), whereas canoni-
cal autophagy generates a double membrane compartment and
does not depend upon NADPH oxidase. We showed that CpsA, by
interrupting the recruitment of NADPH oxidase on mycobacte-
ria containing phagosome, blocks lysosomal delivery by the LAP
pathway (K¨oster et al. 2017, 2018). It is likely that other molecules
also block LAP. We speculate that NdkA might block LAP by in-
terfering with NADPH oxidase assembly and activation, as dis-
cussed above, and Eis and NuoG, discussed below, may also block

Upadhyay et al.
5
LAP by interfering with host ROS (Kim et al. 2012; Gengenbacher
et al. 2016), although the role of these effectors in LAP has not
yet been experimentally tested.
There are numerous other Mtb proteins that have been im-
plicated as effectors that block phagosome maturation, notably
PknG (Walburger et al. 2004) and LpdC (Deghmane et al. 2007). It
is possible that in some of these cases, their role in virulence is
related to an intrinsic function in bacterial metabolism (Venu-
gopal et al. 2011; Khan et al. 2017; Rieck et al. 2017). Bacterial mu-
tants that cannot survive in the intracellular environment will
not be able to maintain their intracellular niche and will secon-
darily be delivered to a lysosome. This has made it hard to dis-
tinguish proteins that have a direct role in disrupting lysosomal
trafﬁcking from those that play some other role in intracellu-
lar survival; it is quite possible that in some cases, one protein
does both. This probably reﬂects the manner in which Mtb has
had to engineer virulence factors given a lack of horizontal gene
transfer. It appears to be a recurring theme that Mtb virulence
factors have evolved from proteins that play a basic role in bac-
terial physiology in non-pathogenic, environmental mycobacte-
ria. A prominent example is EsxA-EsxB, which plays a role in
conjugation in non-pathogenic mycobacteria (Flint et al. 2004).
Similarly, while EsxG-EsxH is required for iron uptake in both M.
smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, only the Mtb protein has the abil-
ity to interact with HRS and inhibit ESCRT (Mehra et al. 2013).
Accordingly, in vivo EsxG-EsxH plays a critical role in virulence
that cannot be provided by the M. smegmatis protein and which is
separable from its function in metal homeostasis (Portal-Celhay
et al. 2016; Tufariello et al. 2016). In the case of CpsA, it belongs
to a protein family involved in cell envelope homeostasis, but
CpsA itself is found in pathogenic mycobacteria and appears to
play a distinct role in virulence (K¨oster et al. 2017). Thus, Mtb ef-
fectors may have multiple functions, which can be difﬁcult to
unravel. One way to distinguish whether the primary defect of
a mutant is in arresting phagosome maturation is to determine
whether the intracellular growth defect can be rescued by ex-
perimentally blocking phagosome maturation (for example, by
silencing Rab7).
It is also worth keeping in mind that mutations that alter
the mycobacterial envelop may also indirectly affect trafﬁck-
ing by altering bacterial interactions with pathogen recognition
receptors such as MR, Toll-like receptors and C-type lectin re-
ceptors, which inﬂuence subsequent trafﬁcking (Stamm, Collins
and Shiloh 2015). This may explain some of the differences seen
when heat killed bacilli have been used as a comparator to live
mycobacteria, as heat killed Mtb might drive different trafﬁck-
ing pathways, such as LAP (see above), by virtue of exposing
pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are nor-
mally masked by the mycobacterial envelop. In addition, sev-
eral Mtb effectors seem to only work in human cells, which has
contributed to contradictory ﬁndings (Grundner, Cox and Alber
2008; Rajaram et al. 2017). Thus, Mtb uses multiple, overlapping,
partially redundant mechanisms to impair phagosome matura-
tion. While we have highlighted a handful of the Mtb effectors
that are likely to do so, there are undoubtedly many more and
how they work in concert to promote the intracellular niche of
Mtb remains to be elucidated.
MTB EVADES AUTOPHAGY
Perforating the phagosome is essential for Mtb virulence, but
it comes with signiﬁcant consequences, including activating
autophagy, another degradative pathway that the bacilli have
to evade to survive intracellularly. When Mtb gains access to
host cytosol, it activates a cytosolic surveillance pathway, which
results in induction of Type1 interferon and autophagy (Wat-
son, Manzanillo and Cox 2012; Collins et al. 2015; Wassermann
et al. 2015; Watson et al. 2015). Autophagy is a homeostatic pro-
cess that generates double membrane compartments to turn
over cytoplasmic contents, clearing damaged organelles and
protein aggregates in the lysosome; it can also be activated to
clear invading microorganisms. When the double membrane
autophagosome sequesters a microbe, the process is called
xenophagy (recently reviewed Mitchell and Isberg 2017). Dam-
aged phagosomes expose host glycans located in phagosomal
lumen to the cytosol, which are detected by cytosolic galectins
(Thurston et al. 2012; Chauhan et al. 2016). At the same time,
bacterial DNA is detected in the cytosol and activates the cGAS-
STING pathway (Watson, Manzanillo and Cox 2012; Collins et al.
2015; Wassermann et al. 2015; Watson et al. 2015). The bacte-
ria that are marked for destruction recruit E3 ligases, Parkin,
SMURF1 and TRIM16 (Manzanillo et al. 2013; Franco et al. 2017;
Kumar et al. 2017). Galectins and ubiquitin serve to recruit selec-
tive autophagy adaptors, such as NBR1, NDP52 and p62, which
in turn recruit LC3. ATG proteins coordinate the formation of
a double membrane compartment, the autophagosome, which
fuses with the lysosome. Thus, by damaging the phagosome,
Mtb makes itself vulnerable to a distinct degradative, lysosomal
pathway.
However, under basal conditions in vitro, LC3 trafﬁcking
makes a very limited contribution to clearing Mtb (Gutierrez
et al. 2004; Watson, Manzanillo and Cox 2012; Sakowski et al.
2015), and in mice, it fails to control bacterial replication (Kim-
mey et al. 2015). The limited efﬁcacy of xenophagy in clearing
Mtb points to evasion mechanisms on the part of the bacilli.
Although our understanding is incomplete, it appears that Mtb
impairs both autophagy initiation and the ability of autophago-
somes to fuse with lysosomes (referred to as autophagy ﬂux).
Since autophagosome-lysosome fusion depends upon some of
the same machinery as late endosome-lysosome fusion, such
as Rab7, certain Mtb effectors should be able to block both.
In fact, careful analysis of Mtb xenophagy showed that viru-
lent Mtb impairs autophagy ﬂux in macrophages and dendritic
cells (Romagnoli et al. 2012; Chandra et al. 2015). The ability of
Mtb to block autophagy ﬂux depends upon ESX-1, suggesting
that cytosolic effectors are responsible. In addition, as is seen
during phagosome-lysosome arrest imposed by Mtb, the block
to autophagosome-lysosome fusion occurs at the level of Rab7
(Chandra et al. 2015), consistent with the idea that there are com-
mon effectors undermining both.
Mtb also seems to impair autophagy initiation, since the ma-
jority of invading bacilli do not recruit LC3. How exactly they
do this is not completely clear. One strategy exploited by Mtb
is to modulate the expression of ATG genes. For example, we
found that Mtb induces miR-33, which inhibits autophagy, lyso-
somal function and host lipid metabolism, thereby facilitating
intracellular bacterial survival (Ouimet et al. 2016). In addition,
Mtb upregulates expression of miR-155 in dendritic cells, which
dramatically reduces ATG3 protein levels and autophagosome
formation (Etna et al. 2018). Since autophagy initiation depends
upon PI3P, the effectors discussed above that impair PI3P accu-
mulation would also be predicted to impair autophagy. Consis-
tent with this idea, ManLAM coated beads block LC3 trafﬁcking
(Shui et al. 2011). In addition, there are two Mtb secreted proteins
that are implicated as more direct anti-autophagy effectors,
PE PGRS47 and enhanced intracellular survival (Eis). PE PGRS47
was identiﬁed in a genome wide screen for loci that modulate

6
Pathogens and Disease, 2018, Vol. 76, No. 4
antigen presentation. Subsequent analysis revealed that Mtb
mutants lacking PE PGRS47 have a reduced capacity to inhibit
autophagy (Saini et al. 2016). Eis has an N-acetyltransferase ac-
tivity that has been shown to modulate macrophage autophagy
(Shin et al. 2010), as well as host cell death pathways as discussed
below. Among other targets, Eis can acetylate DUSP16/MKP-7, a
JNK-speciﬁc phosphatase (Kim et al. 2012). JNK is required for ac-
tivation of Beclin1 (BECN1), so Eis may suppress autophagy ini-
tiation by blocking BECN1 activation. It has also been suggested
that Eis blocks autophagy by upregulating IL-10, a cytokine pre-
viously shown to block autophagy (Harris et al. 2007; Duan et al.
2016). Thus, several potential players have been identiﬁed, but
we lack a clear understanding of how Mtb directly manipulate
autophagy; the mechanism of action of PE PGRS47 may shed
further light on this matter. LC3 is routinely used as a marker
of autophagy, but LC3 is conjugated to phagosomes during LAP,
and autophagy and LAP require overlapping cellular machinery;
therefore, it will be important for future studies to distinguish
these related processes.
MTB MANIPULATES THE INFLAMMASOME
Interleukin-1β (Il-1β) and interleukin 18 (IL-18) are important
cytokines for host immune defense against Mtb (McElvania
Tekippe et al. 2010; Mayer-Barber et al. 2010, 2011). They also
have to be appropriately regulated to prevent overly exuber-
ant inﬂammation and tissue damage (Hernandez-Cuellar et al.
2012; Mishra et al. 2013). Production of these cytokines depends
upon the inﬂammasome. The inﬂammasome is a multimeric
complex that detects pathogens and activates an inﬂamma-
tory cascade, producing mature IL-1β and IL-18 and triggering
a distinct cell death pathway termed pyroptosis. The inﬂam-
masome is composed of NOD-like receptors (NLRs), apoptosis-
associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruiting
domain (ASC/PYCARD) and the caspase-1 protease. NLRs are in-
tracellular cytosolic PRRs that recognize PAMPs and host-derived
danger-associated molecular patterns. ASC/PYCARD acts as a
scaffold to bridge the NLR with caspase-1, which proteolyti-
cally processes the pro-Il1-β and pro-IL-18 into their mature
forms. There are many NLRs that are activated by different
bacterial products, including the NLRP3-inﬂammasome, which
is activated by a variety of cellular insults, and the AIM2-
inﬂammasome, which detects cytosolic DNA. Only the NLRP3-
inﬂammasome responds to Mtb in macrophages. Membrane
damage alone is sufﬁcient to trigger the NLRP3-inﬂammasome,
and in the case of Mtb infection, IL-1β production depends upon
ESX-1, so this is another consequence of ESX-1 that the bacilli
need to manage (Carlsson et al. 2010; McElvania Tekippe et al.
2010; Mayer-Barber et al. 2010, 2011; Mishra et al. 2010; Wong and
Jacobs 2011; Dorhoi et al. 2012).
AIM2 detects cytosolic DNA. It is surprising that the AIM2 in-
ﬂammasome does not respond to Mtb because Mtb DNA is able
to trigger the cGAS-STING pathway, as discussed above. This
suggests that there are Mtb effectors that block the AIM2 in-
ﬂammasome. Consistent with this idea, Mtb was shown to in-
hibit the AIM2 inﬂammasome in a manner that depended upon
the ESX-1 system (Briken, Ahlbrand and Shah 2013; Shah et al.
2013); the effector and target remain to be identiﬁed. One bac-
terial factor that has been implicated in modulating the inﬂam-
masome is the Zn2+ metalloprotease Zmp1 (Master et al. 2008),
although there are also conﬂicting ﬁndings (Wong and Jacobs
2011). Rv3364c may also impair IL-1β production. This protein
translocates to the macrophage cytosol and inhibits caspase-1,
possibly through cathepsin G inactivation (Danelishvili et al.
2011). Taken together, it seems likely that by damaging the
phagosome, Mtb triggers the inﬂammasome, an innate defense
mechanism to restrict growth of invading pathogens. However,
it only provides partial protection against Mtb, which likely ﬁne-
tunes the system to its advantage.
MTB IMPAIRS APOPTOSIS
There is considerable complexity and cross talk between cell
death pathways during Mtb infection. One idea that has
emerged is that apoptosis is host-protective, while necrosis fa-
vors the bacilli (Molloy, Laochumroonvorapong and Kaplan 1994;
Balcewicz-Sablinska et al. 1998; Oddo et al. 1998; Keane, Re-
mold and Kornfeld 2000; Keane, Shurtleff and Kornfeld 2002; Sly
et al. 2003). Necrosis depends upon the ESX-1 secretion system
and the NAD+ glycohydrolase TNT, which induces necrotic cell
death by depleting NAD+ (Sun et al. 2015). Mtb also potentiates
necrosis by causing mitochondrial inner membrane disruption
(Chen, Gan and Remold 2006) and inhibiting plasma membrane
repair (Divangahi et al. 2009). Unlike necrosis, apoptosis mini-
mizes inﬂammation, and Mtb-infected macrophages that un-
dergo apoptosis can be rapidly ingested by neighboring unin-
fected macrophages through a process called efferocytosis (Mar-
tin et al. 2012). Mtb released during necrosis can infect and pro-
liferate in a subsequent round of macrophage infections. In con-
trast, when a macrophage ingests apoptotic bodies harboring
Mtb bacilli, the bacilli cannot manipulate macrophage trafﬁck-
ing, and they are delivered to the lysosome, leading to bacte-
rial control. In addition, efferocytosis by dendritic cells promotes
priming and cross presentation (Schaible et al. 2003; Winau et al.
2006; Divangahi et al. 2010; Blomgran et al. 2012). Thus, overall, an
anti-apoptotic, pro-necrotic program appears to favor the bacilli.
However, the cell death pathways that are elicited and the con-
sequences are likely to be context speciﬁc, and Mtb may modu-
late these pathways to its advantage (Moraco and Kornfeld 2014).
One way in which Mtb inhibits apoptosis is by limiting host
ROS, as revealed in the studies of NuoG, SodA and Eis. NuoG
was identiﬁed as a virulence determinant in Mtb using a gain-
of-function genetic screen in M. smegmatis for suppressors of
apoptosis. NuoG is a subunit of the type I NADH dehydro-
genase, and it suppresses apoptosis in infected host cells by
neutralizing ROS generated by macrophage NADPH oxidase (Vel-
murugan et al. 2007; Miller et al. 2010). The apoptosis path-
way induced by the nuoG mutant is dependent upon TNF-
α signaling and caspase-8 activation. Similarly, bacterial mu-
tants defective in superoxide dismutase (SodA) or its secretion
(SecA2) enhance caspase-dependent apoptosis (Edwards et al.
2001; Hinchey et al. 2007). Mtb Eis is a secreted protein with
an N-acetyltransferase activity that can inactivate aminoglyco-
side antibiotics (Chen et al. 2011). As discussed above, Eis im-
pairs autophagy. It was also reported to inhibit apoptosis in in-
fected cells. Although eis mutants induce more host cellular
ROS, suggesting that they induce apoptosis in a similar manner
to the nuoG and sodA mutants, the cell death pathway ap-
pears to be distinct and is caspase-independent (Shin et al. 2010).
Eis has pleiotropic effects, altering cell death, autophagy, phago-
some maturation and cytokine production, reﬂecting several
host and bacterial targets for acetylation, including the dual-
speciﬁcity protein phosphatase 16 (DUSP16/MKP-7) (Kim et al.
2012), histone H3 (Duan et al. 2016) and the bacterial nucleoid-
associated protein HU (Ghosh et al. 2016). Similarly, PtpA dis-
cussed above for its role in trafﬁcking can impair apoptosis by
dephosphorylating GSK3-α
and TRIM27 (Poirier, Bach and

Upadhyay et al.
7
Av-Gay 2014; Wang et al. 2016). There are a number of addi-
tional bacterial genes shown to be anti-apoptotic, including
PknE, SigH, MPT64 and Rv3654c (Mustafa et al. 2007; Jayakumar,
Jacobs and Narayanan 2008; Danelishvili et al. 2011; Dutta et al.
2012; Wang et al. 2014), and how they all work together remains
to be determined.
ADAPTIVE IMMUNITY IMPOSES A DETENTE
The majority of studies examining the activity of Mtb effec-
tors have focused exclusively on na¨ıve macrophages. However,
the antimycobacterial activity of macrophages is modulated by
a variety of inﬂammatory cytokines and other exogenous sig-
nals, such as vitamin D (MacMicking, Taylor and McKinney 2003;
Gutierrez et al. 2004; Singh et al. 2006; Yuk et al. 2009). Once
an adaptive immune response develops and effector T cells ar-
rive at the site of infection, they secrete cytokines which make
macrophages better able to control bacterial replication. In fact,
when antigen-speciﬁc T cells are experimentally elicited in the
lungs prior to infection, animals are protected (Grifﬁths et al.
2016). IFN-γ , TNF-α and IL-1β enhance bacterial clearance by ac-
tivating autophagy, promoting the production of antimicrobial
peptides, enhancing the production of reactive oxygen and re-
active nitrogen species, and forcing phagosome maturation (re-
viewed in MacMicking 2014). Therefore, the adaptive immune
response insures that the majority of infected individuals will
contain the bacilli and never develop active disease.
However, not to be outdone, Mtb undermines these host re-
sponses, preventing sterilizing immunity. There is a long delay
in T-cell priming, creating a large window of opportunity for
Mtb to grow prior to the arrival of antigen-speciﬁc T cells (Wolf
et al. 2008). Moreover, prolonged Toll-like receptor 2 activation
by Mtb can downregulate expression of major histocompatibil-
ity complex (MHC) class II molecules that would normally be in-
duced by IFN-γ signaling in macrophages (Harding and Boom
2010). Even in cells that already express MHC class II, by tar-
geting ESCRT, EsxG-EsxH impairs antigen processing and load-
ing onto MHCII (Portal-Celhay et al. 2016). Moreover, PE PGRS47,
mentioned above, also inhibits antigen presentation (Saini et al.
2016), and Hip1, a serine protease, impairs dendritic cell function
by cleaving GroEL2 (Madan-Lala et al. 2014; Georgieva et al. 2018).
Lastly, physical access of T cells to infected macrophages is im-
paired by the granuloma structure and macrophage production
of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (Cronan et al. 2016; Gautam et al.
2017). There are certain to be other mechanisms that Mtb uses
to undermine the adaptive immune response and persist in the
face of robust T-cell responses.
CONCLUSION
The outcome of Mtb infection depends on the struggle between
the host antimicrobial defense arsenal and sophisticated bacte-
rial countermeasures. Mtb and humans have evolved with each
other for millennia (Gagneux 2012), and they are well matched
in this battle. Most often, the struggle ends in d´etente; the tu-
bercle bacilli is contained, but not eradicated. To cause infec-
tion and persist in the host, Mtb relies upon numerous effec-
tors that facilitate its survival in the hostile host environment.
These effectors enable Mtb to interfere with cellular trafﬁcking
and immune recognition, inhibit phagosome acidiﬁcation, block
phagosomal–lysosomal fusion, impair apoptosis and autophagy,
delay antigen presentation and modulate inﬂammasome acti-
vation. Even for the effectors that have been identiﬁed, we are
far from understanding how they coordinate this assault. There
are undoubtedly numerous yet to be identiﬁed effectors and cel-
lular targets. For example, recent work has revealed that Mtb
effectors may reprogram host gene expression by direct epige-
netic modiﬁcation (Sharma et al. 2015; Yaseen et al. 2015), a new
area that warrants further study. We are gaining an increasing
appreciation for how Mtb inﬂuences host cellular metabolism
and its link with immune function (Shi, Eugenin and Subbian
2016), but understand little about how Mtb modulates these re-
sponses (Ouimet et al. 2016). How Mtb manipulates dendritic and
neutrophil function is poorly understood. The role of bacterial
and host extracellular vesicles in immune evasion remains to
be fully explored (Prados-Rosales et al. 2014; Athman et al. 2015).
By understanding the molecular basis of the host–pathogen in-
terface, we can fulﬁll the legacy of Koch and Metchnikoff, and in
doing so, we will open up new therapeutic opportunities. By dis-
rupting critical Mtb effectors, we should be able to restore the
natural antimicrobial capacity of the host to clear Mtb. Such
treatments would not depend on bacterial replication like
most conventional antibiotics; therefore, they might effectively
shorten therapy by clearing slow growing and non-replicating
persisters. Given the alarming increase in multidrug-resistant
TB, it is imperative to develop these new opportunities for inter-
vention.
