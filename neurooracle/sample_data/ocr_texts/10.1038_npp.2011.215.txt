The purpose of this study was to examine measures of anatomical connectivity between the thalamus and lateral prefrontal cortex
(LPFC) in schizophrenia and to assess their functional implications. We measured thalamocortical connectivity with diffusion tensor
imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography in 15 patients with schizophrenia and 22 age- and sex-matched controls. The relationship
between thalamocortical connectivity and prefrontal cortical blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional activity as well as
behavioral performance during working memory was examined in a subsample of 9 patients and 18 controls. Compared with controls,
schizophrenia patients showed reduced total connectivity of the thalamus to only one of six cortical regions, the LPFC. The size of the
thalamic region with at least 25% of model fibers reaching the LPFC was also reduced in patients compared with controls. The total
thalamocortical connectivity to the LPFC predicted working memory task performance and also correlated with LPFC BOLD activation.
Notably, the correlation with BOLD activation was accentuated in patients as compared with controls in the ventral LPFC. These results
suggest that thalamocortical connectivity to the LPFC is altered in schizophrenia with functional consequences on working memory
processing in LPFC.

INTRODUCTION
The thalamus features prominently in major hypotheses
about the neural circuitry implicated in schizophrenia
(Andreasen et al, 1996), and evidence for its involvement
derives from multiple fields of investigation but remains
controversial (reviewed in Byne et al, 2009). Abnormalities
in the medio-dorsal, pulvinar, and centromedian nuclei of
the thalamus, all connected to the lateral prefrontal cortex
(LPFC), a site of well-documented abnormalities in schizo-
phrenia (Weinberger et al, 2001), have been reported with
several methods (eg, Andrews et al, 2006; Byne et al, 2002;
Byne et al, 2007; Harms et al, 2007; Hazlett et al, 1999;
Kemether et al, 2003; Kessler et al, 2009; Kumari et al, 2010;
Lehrer et al, 2005; Popken et al, 2000; Rose et al, 2006, but
see, for example, Danos et al, 2005; Dorph-Petersen et al,
2004; Kreczmanski et al, 2007 for negative findings). Some
functional MRI (fMRI) studies found abnormalities in the
correlation between the activity in the thalamus and the PFC
in schizophrenia (eg, Meda et al, 2010; Schlosser et al, 2003;
Welsh et al, 2010; Zhou et al, 2007), which may reflect
alterations in anatomical connectivity. Thus, the changes in
the coordinated functioning of the PFC and the thalamus
might be relevant to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
Whether there is an abnormality in anatomical connec-
tivity between the thalamus and the prefrontal cortex in
schizophrenia is an important knowledge gap that might be
addressed with the latest advances in probabilistic tracto-
graphy via diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). This technique
has allowed researchers to segment the thalamus in
functionally relevant connectivity-defined regions (CDRs)
based on their preferential connectivity to particular
cortical areas (Behrens et al, 2003a, b; Johansen-Berg et al,
2005; Klein et al, 2010). Here, we used this methodology to
test the following hypotheses: (1) that the degree of
connectivity from the thalamus to the LPFC defined via
probabilistic tractography is reduced in schizophrenia,

(2) that thalamocortical connectivity would predict perfor-
mance during a working memory task and (3) associated
prefrontal blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) acti-
vation during fMRI. Both working memory performance
and prefrontal activation have been found to index cortical
dysfunction and to be related to genetic risk for schizo-
phrenia (Callicott et al, 2003a; Egan et al, 2001; Meyer-
Lindenberg and Weinberger, 2006).
PATIENTS AND METHODS
In all, 19 patients with schizophrenia and 26 healthy
volunteers participated in the study. Participants were
assessed as detailed in (Egan et al, 2001). Exclusions based
on the history of other axis I disorders (including substance
abuse), significant medical history, or excessive movement
in the scanner (corrupting a substantial portion of the
acquired images) resulted in the final group of 15 patients
and 22 controls reported here. All participants had taken
part in the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch ‘Sibling Study’
(NCT00001486). Five patients with schizophrenia were
recruited as outpatients, whereas the rest were recruited
from our inpatient ward (NCT00001247). No T2 hyper-
intensities
were
observed
on
the
MRI
scans
of the
participants. At the time of study, all patients were treated
with
second-generation
antipsychotics
and
adjunctive
medications.
DTI sessions were conducted using a GE 1.5T Signa
scanner (GE, Milwaukee, WI) with an axial single shot echo
planar imaging (EPI) sequence (TE 83.7 ms, 80 slices with
isotropic voxel size 2  2  2 mm, NEX ¼ 1, 80  110 matrix,
field of view: 22 cm) with cardiac gating of each individual
slice (TR 410 000 ms). In all, 107 volumes were acquired for
each participant (bmax ¼ 1200 s/mm2; see Supplementary
Table S1), with 42 directions acquired with b values 4850 s/
mm2. The directions of diffusion-weighted scans were
distributed uniformly in space for each b value acquired.
In order to assess the reproducibility of our measures, ten
controls repeated one DTI session twice, with an average
time between scans of 61±32 (SD) days.
In separate sessions, three-dimensional structural MRI
and fMRI scans were acquired. A T1-weighted spoiled
gradient (SPGR) sequence (TR/TE ¼ 2400/5 ms, flip angle ¼
451, with 124 sagittal slices, 256  256 matrix, FOV 24 cm,
0.94  0.94  1.5 mm3 voxel size) at 1.5T (GE) was used for
the structural acquisition whereas a 3T system (GE) was
used for fMRI EPI acquisition with TR/TE ¼ 2000/30 ms, flip
angle ¼ 901, FOV 24 cm, 64  64 matrix, 3.75  3.75  6 mm
voxel size, 24 contiguous slices. The task paradigm used
during fMRI was the 2-back working memory task (30
epochs of 0-back alternating with 2-back as previously
described in Callicott et al (2003b)).
The Freesurfer software package (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.
harvard.edu) was used to generate eight bilateral cortical
(Figure 1) and one thalamic region of interest (ROIs) from
the T1-weighted structural images. ROIs were then trans-
formed into DTI space for tractography. Affine registration
(Jenkinson and Smith, 2001) using a normalized mutual
information cost function with 12 degrees of freedom was
used for each participant to derive transformation matrices
from the non-diffusion-weighted image of the DTI series to
the structural T1-weighted image. The inverse of those
transformation matrices was then applied to convert the
binary cortical ROIs to diffusion space with trilinear
interpolation.
Cortical
ROIs
in
diffusion
space
were
thresholded at 0.3, re-binarized, and corrected such that
there were no overlapping voxels among regions. To ensure
that no white matter voxels were included in the cortical
ROIs, all voxels with fractional anisotropy 40.2 were
excluded from the cortical ROIs. Bilateral thalamic ROIs in
diffusion space were thresholded at 0.6 and re-binarized.
These thresholds were established after careful review of
overlayed masks and registered T1 and non-diffusion-
weighted images. We confirmed visually in each individual
that the thalamic mask did not grossly exceed the borders of
the thalamus after registration, while encompassing the
entire T1-weighted visible structure (the borders of the
thalamus are not easily detectable in the non-diffusion-
weighted image). For the cortex, a more liberal threshold for
binarization was chosen to retain cortical voxels while
preventing the extension of the mask into white matter.
All tools for DTI processing belonged to the FMRIB
Diffusion Toolbox in the FMRIB Software Library (FSL 4.0;
http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/). The DTI series was first
manually reviewed to eliminate artifacts. Volumes where

ROIs were used in the analysis, whereas unilateral ROIs are shown here for
visualization. The following original Freesurfer parcellations (Desikan et al,
2006) were combined to form the larger ROIs used here: orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC: pars orbitalis, medial orbitofrontal cortex, lateral orbitofrontal
cortex), medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC: caudal anterior cingulate, rostral
anterior cingulate, superior frontal gyrus), lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC:
pars triangularis, frontal pole, rostral middle frontal gyrus, pars opercularis),
sensorimotor cortex (SMC: precentral gyrus, caudal middle frontal gyrus,
post-central gyrus, paracentral lobule), parietal cortex (PC: inferior parietal
cortex, supramarginal gyrus, precuneus cortex, posterior cingulate cortex,
isthmus cingulate, superior parietal cortex), medial temporal cortex (MTC:
entorhinal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, fusiform gyrus), lateral temporal
cortex (LTC: transverse temporal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, banks of
the superior temporal sulcus, inferior temporal gyrus, middle temporal
gyrus, temporal pole), and occipital cortex (OCC: pericalcarine cortex,
lingual gyrus, lateral occipital cortex, cuneus cortex). Graphics were created
using SUMA, part of the AFNI package (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/suma).

sudden motion had occurred (resulting in slices with low
signal) were eliminated. We believe that the rejection of
these volumes did not influence our results because all
participants had at least seven volumes with b values o10 s/
mm2 and 42 directions with b4850 s/mm2. Images were
corrected for distortion caused by eddy currents and head
motion using an affine registration to the first non-
diffusion-weighted volume (Jenkinson and Smith, 2001).
The brain was extracted and the diffusion parameters
were estimated (Behrens et al, 2007), giving a probability
distribution function of two fibers in each voxel of the
brain. For each voxel in the thalamic mask, 5000 samples
were sent through the connectivity distribution using
probabilistic tractography. Probabilistic tractography was
run bilaterally as pilot studies showed that reproducibility
was somewhat improved over unilateral measures.
Total percent connectivity was calculated as the number
of samples from any thalamic voxel reaching the corre-
sponding cortical ROI divided by the total number of
samples from all thalamic voxels reaching any cortical ROI.
This is a measure of total tractography-defined connectivity
from the thalamus to a particular cortical area, independent
of where the tract originated from inside the thalamus.
When 425% of the total number of samples originating
in a thalamic voxel reached a cortical ROI, that voxel was
assigned to a CDR, considered to be connected to the
homonymous cortical ROI. The total number of voxels
belonging to a CDR divided by the total number of voxels in
the thalamus of that individual was the outcome measure.
This is a measure of the relative size of the thalamic CDR
connected via tractography to a particular cortical area.
The two dependent variables for each cortical ROI were
used as within effects in separate analyses of variance,
where diagnostic group was the between effect. Two ROIs
(medial temporal and orbito-frontal cortices) were dropped
from this analysis due to poor reproducibility across two
repeated scans of 10 normal controls (Supplementary
Methods a). In these analyses, main effects of the region
were of no interest, and will not be reported further,
although we focused on main effects of diagnosis or ROI-by-
diagnosis interactions. If the latter was significant, post-hoc
t-tests were run for each ROI. These were not corrected for
multiple comparisons as the overall significance protects
from type I error. The effect of possible confounding
variables on LPFC percent total connections was assessed
as detailed in the Supplementary Methods b. All statistics
of this kind were run with Statistica release 7 (StatSoft,
Tulsa, OK).
fMRI was analyzed for a subset of 27 individuals (18
healthy
subjects
and
9
patients
with
schizophrenia:
Supplementary Methods c, Table S3) during an n-back
working memory task. All fMRI data were preprocessed and
analyzed with SPM5 software (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/
spm). All fMRI data sets met the criteria for quality control
as described previously (Callicott et al, 2003b). All fMRI
data were pre-processed and spatially normalized to the
common stereotactic space provided by the Montreal
Neurologic Institute (MNI) and analyzed using a general
linear model. For each experimental condition, a box car
model convolved with the hemodynamic response function
at each voxel was modeled. Linear contrasts were computed
producing
voxel-wise
t-statistical
parameter
maps
for
2-back relative to 0-back and entered into second-level
analyses.
Two second-level multiple regression models were tested
on the contrast images (2-back–0-back), with the subject as
a random factor: one to detect voxels with a significant
relationship to LPFC connectivity where both groups were
assumed to have equal slopes; the other to detect voxels
with significantly different slopes between the diagnostic
groups. The first model had LPFC connectivity, diagnosis,
age, sex, and 2-back performance as covariates. The second
model was constructed including the following predictors:
two diagnostic group predictors, two LPFC connectivity
predictors (one per diagnostic group), age, sex, and n-back
accuracy. The contrast between the two LPFC connectivity
vectors (adjusted by group means, age, sex, and n-back
performance within each group) was then used to assess
group differences in the slope of the regression.
Levels of significance to detect associations between LPFC
connectivity and BOLD activation were set at p ¼ 0.005
uncorrected for multiple comparisons. Results are reported
in a ROI constructed by normalizing to the MNI template
and then averaging the bilateral LPFC ROIs used as
tractography targets. The resulting image was smoothed
with a 3  3  3 mm FWHM filter mimicking the fMRI
resolution and then thresholded at a value of 0.4 for
binarization. Corrections for multiple comparisons were
performed at the cluster extent level, using the cluster size
threshold computed via AlphaSim, a function available in
AFNI (http://afni.nimh.nih.gov/). This program was run for
each individual with 1000 iterations, within the ROI
described above, and a cluster connectivity radius of
3.1 mm. AlphaSim estimated the rate of false positive voxels
within a cluster that are expected given a threshold of
po0.005 uncorrected. For a specific a, any cluster size
larger than this number can be considered statistically
significant after correction for multiple comparisons. For
any group analysis, the critical cluster size is calculated
averaging this measure across all individuals. In our
analysis, for a ¼ 0.05 the average cluster extent threshold
was 621 ml (23 voxels).
The relationship between LPFC total percent connectivity
and number of correct responses on the 2-back was
assessed with Pearson’s r.
RESULTS
The
patients
(n ¼ 15)
and
controls
(n ¼ 22)
did
not
significantly differ in age, sex, or handedness (Table 1).
Overall quality of the tractography results was assessed in
several ways, as detailed in the Supplementary Results
(Figures S1, S2, S3, S4), and appeared to be consistent with
known anatomy.
A significant diagnosis-by-ROI interaction was found for
percent total connectivity (F5,175 ¼ 22.4, p ¼ 0.03) and for
CDR size (F5,175 ¼ 2.38, p ¼ 0.04: Figures 2 and 3, and
Supplementary Table S4). Patients with schizophrenia had
on average lower thalamocortical connectivity and CDR size
than controls in the LPFC, whereas they had elevated total
connectivity to the somato-motor cortex.

the whole group, or with chlorpromazine equivalents and
duration of illness in the patient group. There were no
significant differences between groups in total thalamic or
frontal cortical volumes (Supplementary Table S5: this was
true both for absolute volumetric measures and for those
normalized to intra-cranial volume), or in the average tract
properties connecting the thalamic CDR and the LPFC
(Supplementary Table S6).
In the fMRI study of working memory, patients and
controls had similar performance in terms of accuracy and
reaction time (p40.15) and performance was used as a
covariate in the analysis. Thalamic LPFC percent total
connectivity correlated with cortical activation in the LPFC
bilaterally (Figure 4a, maximum effect: r2 ¼ 0.33, p ¼ 0.0017
uncorrected, cluster size 648 ml) for the model with equal
slopes across groups, although patients with schizophrenia
had steeper slopes than controls in the right ventral LPFC
(Figure 4b, p ¼ 0.0007 uncorrected, cluster size 648 ml). Both
relationships occurred in clusters larger than 621 ml, thus
corrected for multiple comparisons. LPFC total percent
connectivity
was
significantly
correlated
with
2-back
performance in the whole group (Figure 4c, r2 ¼ 0.19,
p ¼ 0.02).

Given these results, we also investigated the relation-
ship between percent total connectivity from the thalamus
to two other cortical masks where significant BOLD
activation occurs during the n-back task: parietal and
medial
prefrontal
cortices
(Supplementary
Methods
d, Supplementary Results, and Supplementary Figures S5
and S6).
DISCUSSION
Based on suggestive but controversial findings from post-
mortem studies and on data acquired with structural and
functional neuroimaging, we had hypothesized that mea-
sures indexing thalamocortical connectivity to the LPFC
would be reduced in patients with schizophrenia as
compared with normal controls. Probabilistic tractography
data obtained in vivo support the central hypothesis of this
study. The measures derived with this method were
highly reproducible in two repeated scans of a subset of
the control subjects (ICC40.82); the effect size of the
differences
between
diagnostic
groups
appeared
robust (Cohen’s dB0.8), and unlikely to be due to several
possible confounding factors (eg, age and chlorpromazine
equivalents). Our data offer a possible anatomical substrate
for differences in functional connectivity between patients
with schizophrenia and controls previously described with
fMRI (Meda et al, 2010; Schlosser et al, 2003; Welsh et al,
2010; Zhou et al, 2007) and are consistent with a reduction
in connectivity from multiple sources in the thalamus to the
LPFC. Besides three studies showing that neurons specifi-
cally projecting to LPFC in the medio-dorsal nucleus of the
thalamus may be reduced in schizophrenia (Byne et al,
2002; Popken et al, 2000; Young et al, 2000), reduced sizes
of the pulvinar, of the centromedian nuclei (both projecting
in part to the LPFC: Byne et al, 2007; Kemether et al, 2003)
and reductions in oligodendrocyte number in the anterior
principal nucleus (Byne et al, 2006, 2008) were found in
schizophrenia. An unexpected increase in total connectivity
from the thalamus to the sensorimotor cortices was found,
but it is difficult to interpret this in the absence of a prior
hypothesis. One possibility is that this is an artifact of the
relative measures used here to assess thalamic connectivity:
a decrease in connectivity to the LPFC necessarily has to
correspond to a decrease somewhere else, however, it is
unclear why this
would
be more
prominent in the
sensorimotor cortices rather than distributed in a more
diffuse fashion.

at voxel coordinates 51 21 18) where both groups had similar positive slopes for the correlation between LPFC total percent connectivity and BOLD,
whereas the blue area corresponds to the cluster (maximum at voxel 54 24 24) where slopes differed significantly across groups. (b) Correlation between
LPFC total percent connectivity and BOLD parameter estimates for the cluster with the peak at voxel 51 21 18 (raw b values adjusted for the session mean

(648 ml). This exceeded the threshold of 23 voxels (621 ml) found by AlphaSim and can therefore be considered corrected for multiple comparisons. (c)

Thalamic connectivity and fMRI in schizophrenia

It should be stressed that the reproducibility over
repeated DTI sessions of the thalamo-LPFC connectivity
measures reported here was satisfactory, with ICCs 40.69, a
result consistent with another recent investigation where
spatial reproducibility of this method was studied in detail
(Traynor et al, 2010). The poor reproducibility in the OFC
and MTC (Supplementary Table S2) were most likely due to
EPI distortions for the orbitofrontal regions and the
presence of complex fiber architecture on the pathway
from the thalamus to the medial temporal cortex that is not
fully accounted for by the current probabilistic connectivity
models.
This is not the first study pointing to altered diffusion
parameters in the thalamus or thalamocortical pathways.
DTI findings supporting altered integrity of thalamocortical
connectivity in schizophrenia include controversial altera-
tions of fractional anisotropy in the anterior limb of the
internal capsule (ALIC) (Buchsbaum et al, 2006; Kubicki
et al, 2005; Mamah et al, 2010; Sprooten et al, 2009;
Sussmann et al, 2009; Zhang et al, 2010; Zhou et al, 2008,
but see Ashtari et al, 2007; Kito et al, 2009; Kyriakopoulos
et al, 2008; Szeszko et al, 2005; White et al, 2007 for negative
findings in younger individuals and Beasley et al, 2009 for
lack of evidence of myelin abnormalities post-mortem), of
the tracts connecting to the LPFC (Kim et al, 2008; Oh et al,
2009) and altered FA (Hashimoto et al, 2009) or mean
diffusivity in the thalamus itself (Agarwal et al, 2008; Rose
et al, 2006; Spoletini et al, 2011).
Kim et al (2007) have performed a similar DTI study, with
an identical a-priori hypothesis, but found only differences
in the thalamic CDR defined by connectivity to the
orbitofrontal, parietal, and medial prefrontal cortices. No
measure of reproducibility was reported in that paper and
several methodological issues might have prevented those
authors from finding similar results to ours: the more
limited number of directions used, maximal b values of
600 mm2/s (which will limit the accuracy of the determina-
tion of the direction of diffusion), the use of a larger
definition for the LPFC ROI that included cortical structures
not necessarily altered in schizophrenia, and the use of a
processing software limited to modeling one fiber per voxel.
It is possible that these alterations in thalamocortical
connectivity were due to alterations in diffusion properties
in the tract connecting the thalamus to the LPFC, as detailed
above. In this small sample, we could not detect a difference
in the average FA or mean diffusivity for the tract
connecting the thalamus to the LPFC (Supplementary Table
S6), however, more subtle local differences in diffusion
properties may exist along the tract that were not detected
in the analysis of average values (Oh et al, 2009).
Although the weight of the evidence points towards a
reduction in thalamic volume in schizophrenia (for meta-
analyses see Adriano et al, 2011; Konick and Friedman,
2001, and for a recent large study see Rimol et al, 2010), it is
possible that we did not detect significant differences in
thalamic or cortical volumes because of limited power due
to the sample size. Our findings, however, are consistent
with those collected in a much larger cohort of patients and
controls acquired and processed with identical methodol-
ogy (Goldman et al, 2008). These negative findings are of
interest because they make it more likely that the main
results of this study are primary and not secondary to
volumetric changes or generic alterations in white matter
integrity in the whole thalamus or in the ALIC and anterior
thalamic radiations mentioned above. At the very least,
though, in this small sample tractography-derived measures
were more sensitive than volumetric measures in detecting
anatomical differences in schizophrenia.
Using a multimodal approach, we also investigated
whether the observed thalamic connectivity measures were
biologically relevant for the activity of the LPFC during the
performance of working memory. Indeed, percent total
connectivity to the LPFC predicted both the degree of BOLD
activation during working memory and n-back perfor-
mance. This phenomenon was present especially in the
ventral portions of the LPFC bilaterally and was signifi-
cantly greater in patients as compared with controls in the
right ventral LPFC. Further post-hoc analyses revealed that
the latter finding was also true in the MPFC, whereas in the
parietal
cortex
patients
showed
a
significantly
more
negative slope for the correlation as compared with
controls. We speculate that during development subtle
alterations in the distribution of thalamo-cortical pathways
to
their
cortical
targets,
not
necessarily
manifest
in
anisotropy
alterations,
contribute
to
changes
in
the
compartmentalization of dorsal and ventrolateral PFC
function and to excessive VLPFC activation in schizophre-
nia (Tan et al, 2006). These changes may be compensatory
in nature given the positive relationship to performance in
both patients and controls. Moreover, also parietal and
medial prefrontal nodes of the working memory network
may be affected, although less severely.
From our data, it is impossible to say whether the
thalamic abnormality in patients is a cause of, a conse-
quence of, or a simultaneous occurrence with the LPFC
abnormality. However, the fact that thalamocortical tracts
form early in development suggests that this abnormality
could already be present at birth or in the first years of life
and would be consistent with the neurodevelopmental
nature of schizophrenia. Indeed, there is evidence for
altered interstitial prefrontal neurons, considered remnants
of the subplate (Kostovic et al, 2011), in schizophrenia
(Akbarian et al, 1993; Anderson et al, 1996; Eastwood and
Harrison, 2003, 2005; Kirkpatrick et al, 2003; Yang et al,
2011), supporting an early pathological process. Further-
more, as the PFC completes maturation well after the
thalamocortical fibers have reached the subplate (Kostovic
and Judas, 2010), it is conceivable that thalamic neuronal
activity might be a potential effector of PFC maturation and
developing function via its connectivity (Kanold, 2009). An
early presence of the abnormalities reported here is also
supported by the lack of a correlation between CDR size and
total percent connectivity with illness duration and other
possible confounding variables such as age and chlorpro-
mazine equivalents, although only studies in first-episode
patients will be able to confirm this hypothesis.
This structure–function relationship supports the biolo-
gical importance of our DTI findings when comparing
patients and controls. We have linked DTI-derived mea-
sures of probabilistic connectivity with cortical physiology
measured with fMRI and working memory performance,
which is critically affected in the developmental pathophy-
siology of schizophrenia. Others have shown a relationship
of FA and working memory performance in patients with

schizophrenia (eg, Karlsgodt et al, 2008; Lim et al, 2006),
and recent papers found correlations between working
memory performance and anisotropy of the ALIC (Mamah
et al, 2010) and of the left thalamus (Qiu et al, 2009) in
schizophrenia, and mean diffusivity of the medial thalamus
in healthy aging subjects (Charlton et al, 2010). Our
findings also indicate that bulk thalamocortical connectivity
is relevant to neurocognitive processes such as working
memory.
Limitations of this study are the small number of subjects,
inability to control for medication effects, and the fact that
diagnostic groups were not well matched for years of
education or premorbid IQ (although they did not differ in
terms of parental socio-economic status, see Table 1),
although this is commonly observed in naturalistic studies
of schizophrenia. As the fMRI portion of the study was
retrospective in nature, the demographics were not entirely
representative of the full group, as in the case of sex
distribution. Another limitation, especially in light of a
recent report (Zhang et al, 2010) showing additive effects of
smoking and schizophrenia on the FA of the ALIC, is the
fact that 45% of our patients were current smokers
compared with only one of our controls (5%); however,
this discrepancy was less marked when any history of
smoking was taken into account (41% of controls vs 60% of
patients). It should be noted, though that no group effect of
FA was found in the ALIC in the current investigation.
Finally, distortions of the diffusion-weighted images were
not fully corrected by our post-processing scheme and this
might have affected accurate registration with the T1-
weighted images. We are currently working on replicating
these
findings
with
a
more
rigorous
post-processing
scheme.
In conclusion, we have shown that putative measures of
thalamocortical connectivity to LPFC were reduced in
patients with schizophrenia and that there are functional
implications of this reduction indicating the potential utility
of DTI tractography measures in understanding white
matter pathophysiology in schizophrenia.
