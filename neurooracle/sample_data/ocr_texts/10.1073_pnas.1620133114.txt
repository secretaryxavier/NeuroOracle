Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium marinum are
thought to exert virulence, in part, through their ability to lyse
host cell membranes. The type VII secretion system ESX-1 [6-kDa
early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6) secretion system 1] is
required for both virulence and host cell membrane lysis. Both
activities are attributed to the pore-forming activity of the ESX-
1–secreted
substrate
ESAT-6
because
multiple
studies
have
reported that recombinant ESAT-6 lyses eukaryotic membranes.
We too find ESX-1 of M. tuberculosis and M. marinum lyses host
cell membranes. However, we find that recombinant ESAT-6 does
not lyse cell membranes. The lytic activity previously attributed to
ESAT-6 is due to residual detergent in the preparations. We report
here that ESX-1–dependent cell membrane lysis is contact depen-
dent and accompanied by gross membrane disruptions rather than
discrete pores. ESX-1–mediated lysis is also morphologically dis-
tinct from the contact-dependent lysis of other bacterial secretion
systems. Our findings suggest redirection of research to under-
stand the mechanism of ESX-1–mediated lysis.

T
uberculosis is an ancient human disease caused by Mycobacte-
rium tuberculosis (Mtb) that continues to be a leading infectious
human killer despite the availability of effective chemotherapeutic
regimens (1). There has been a decades-long search to better un-
derstand and identify the precise mechanisms by which Mtb causes
disease. One virulence determinant that has been identified is a
highly immunogenic secreted protein called ESAT-6 (6-kDa early
secretory antigenic target) (2, 3). ESAT-6 was first identified as a
secreted antigen that stimulated T cells (4). Humans and multiple
laboratory animal species infected with Mtb uniformly show ESAT-
6 reactivity (4–6). ESAT-6’s role in virulence received further sup-
port when its deletion in Mycobacterium bovis reduced virulence in
guinea pigs (7).
At the same time as ESAT-6 was being implicated in myco-
bacterial virulence, parallel work discovered and ascribed a role in
virulence to a specialized secretion system now called ESX-1.
Comparisons of the genomes of Mtb and of the attenuated vaccine
strain M. bovis bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) revealed a
chromosomal region called region of difference 1 (RD1) that was
missing in BCG (8, 9). RD1 was confirmed to play a role in vir-
ulence by complementary genetic experiments that showed in-
creased virulence when the region was expressed in BCG and
attenuated virulence when it was removed from Mtb (10–12). In
silico analysis revealed RD1 to encode ESAT-6 and also part of a
previously unidentified secretion system (8, 13). The presence of
this secretion system solved the conundrum of how ESAT-6 is
secreted despite lacking a canonical signal sequence (13). This
newly discovered secretion system was found to contain several
other potential secretion substrates, yet it was named ESAT-6
secretion system 1 (ESX-1) (13, 14), highlighting the primary role
ascribed to ESAT-6 in mycobacterial pathogenesis (2).
ESAT-6 was first hypothesized to exert virulence by lysing host
cell membranes when a transposon insertion mutant in ESAT-6’s
cotranscribed ESX-1 substrate 10 kDa culture filtrate antigen
(CFP-10) was found to have lost cytolytic activity for a cultured
pneumocyte cell line (15). When purified ESAT-6 and CFP-10
were examined for disruption of artificial lipid bilayers, it was
found that that ESAT-6 but not CFP-10 caused membrane lysis
(15). These results were confirmed in a series of reports, all
implicating eukaryotic cell membrane lytic activity as ESAT-6’s
virulence mechanism (16–18). When transposon mutants in the
closely related species, Mycobacterium marinum (Mm), were
screened to identify those defective for hemolysis, all attenuated
mutants were within the ESX-1 locus and were defective for
ESAT-6 secretion (16). Moreover, the mutants were avirulent
and failed to lyse infected macrophages, implicating secreted
Significance
Secreted pore-forming toxins are a common feature of bacte-
rial virulence. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the agent of human
tuberculosis, has been reported to possess a pore-forming
toxin called 6 kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6) that
is secreted through a specialized secretion system called ESX-1
(ESAT-6 secretion system 1). We report here experiments
showing that ESAT-6 does not lyse cells; the lytic activity pre-
viously attributed to this secreted protein is due to contami-
nating detergent in the recombinant protein preparations.
Whereas the ESX-1 secretion system does lyse host cell mem-
branes, we find this lysis is dependent on bacterial cell contact
with the host membrane and results in tears in the membrane
without any pore formation. Understanding the mechanism of
this lysis may provide clues to how mycobacteria cause disease.

ESAT-6 in mediating virulence through host cell cytolysis (16).
Meanwhile,
purified
recombinant
ESAT-6
(rESAT-6)
was
reported to be capable of disrupting liposome membranes (19),
lysing red blood cells (RBCs) (18), and killing cultured macro-
phages (17, 18). Thus, the experimental evidence from both
genetic and biochemical approaches firmly supported the idea
that ESAT-6 was responsible for ESX-1–mediated bacterial
pathogenicity and was due to its cytolytic activity.
The consensus of contemporary research ascribes a critical role
for ESX-1–mediated membrane lysis during TB pathogenesis via
permeabilization of the mycobacterial phagosome following bac-
terial entry into host macrophages (20–22). Phagosomal per-
meabilization has been found to activate host cytosolic sensing
pathways that are exploited by the bacteria for growth and viru-
lence (23, 24). By extension, ESAT-6 is held to be directly re-
sponsible for phagosomal permeabilization and its downstream
pathogenic effects (25, 26).
In this report, we confirm that a functional ESX-1 secretion
system is required for host cell membrane lytic activity and viru-
lence. However, we find that ESAT-6 is not sufficient for ESX-1’s
lysis of host cell membranes. Rather, we find that the various lytic
activities attributed to ESAT-6 at neutral pH are the result of a
widely used protocol to isolate ESAT-6, which leaves residual
detergent in the preparations. We find that detergent-free ESAT-
6 preparations can disrupt liposomes under acidic conditions, as
previously observed (25, 27, 28). However, this intrinsic low pH-
dependent activity of ESAT-6 is not responsible for mycobacterial
phagosomal permeabilization in host macrophages.
Results
Mtb ESX-1 Secretion Is Linked to Virulence and Hemolysis. We pre-
viously showed that deleting the Mm RD1 orthologous region
(MMAR_5446-MMAR_5455) results in similar attenuation phe-
notypes to those reported for Mtb. This strain, Mm−ΔRD1, is
attenuated for growth in cultured mammalian macrophages as
well as adult and larval zebrafish. The reduced bacterial burdens
in the zebrafish are accompanied by increased survival (29, 30).
To test whether the Mm and Mtb ESX-1 systems were func-
tionally equivalent, we complemented Mm−ΔRD1 with a cosmid
containing either the Mtb ESX-1 locus (Mm−ΔRD1::rv3861-
rv3885mt, referred to as Mm−ΔRD1::WTmt) (11) or the Mtb
ESX-1 locus bearing a point mutation in the gene encoding
ESAT-6 (Mm−ΔRD1::M93Tmt), which fails to restore virulence
in the mouse (31). Similar to the Mtb results, we found that
Mm−ΔRD1::WTmt
but
not
Mm−ΔRD1::M93Tmt
rescued
virulence (Fig. 1 A–C). We observed that Mm−ΔRD1::M93Tmt
had diminished secretion not only of ESAT-6, but also of CFP-10
(Fig. 1 D and E), which has been shown to be dependent on
ESAT-6 for its secretion in Mtb (32).
ESX-1 function in both Mtb and Mm has been associated with
RBC lysis (16, 33). After confirming that wild-type (WT) Mm
exhibited similar dose-dependent hemolytic activity for sheep,
rabbit, horse, and cow RBCs (Fig. S1), we used sheep RBCs for
subsequent experiments. We found that Mm−ΔRD1 was defective
for hemolysis (Fig. 1F) and furthermore that Mm−ΔRD1::WTmt
but not Mm−ΔRD1::M93Tmt rescued hemolytic activity (Fig. 1F).
These findings show the functional equivalence of Mtb and Mm
ESX-1 and confirm the requirement of ESX-1 secretion for both
virulence and cytolytic activity.
ESX-1–Mediated Hemolysis Is Contact Dependent. Prior work had
suggested that ESAT-6 mediated ESX-1 membrane lytic activity
through pore-forming activity (15, 18, 28, 34). If so, mycobacterial
culture supernatants should produce hemolysis. However, even
concentrated culture supernatants from WT bacteria are not he-
molytic (Fig. 2A). This finding raised the possibility that ESX-1–
mediated hemolysis is contact dependent as reported by King
et al. (35). Moreover, they showed that only the virulent Mtb
strain H37Rv conferred hemolysis; both its avirulent counterpart
Mtb H37Ra and BCG were nonhemolytic. At the time of the King
et al. (35) publication, it was not known that BCG has the RD1
deletion, which ablates ESX-1 function (8, 9), or that Mtb H37Ra
is defective for ESX-1 secretion (36, 37). Reinterpreting the King
et al. (35) paper in this new light, our finding that mycobacterial
supernatants did not confer lysis strongly suggested to us that
ESX-1 mediates exclusively contact-dependent hemolysis with-
out any contact-independent lysis. We tested our hypothesis of
contact-dependent hemolysis by placing Mm in direct contact
with RBCs or by separating bacteria from RBCs, using the 0.4-
μm cell barrier present in commercially available Transwell.
Both WT Mm and Mm−ΔRD1::WTmt were capable of hemolysis
only when in direct contact with RBCs (Fig. 2B). In contrast,
Staphylococcus aureus retained substantial hemolytic activity when
separated by the Transwell barrier, consistent with its known ability
to secrete hemolytic pore-forming toxins (38) (Fig. 2B). These results
demonstrated that the hemolytic activity mediated by both Mtb and
Mm ESX-1 requires direct bacterial cell contact with host mem-
branes and accounts for essentially all mycobacterial hemolytic ac-
tivity (Fig. 2B).

ESX-1–Dependent Hemolysis Is Accompanied by Membrane Disruptions
at Points of Bacterial Contact Without Apparent Pore Formation or Host
Membrane Penetrating Bacterial Structures. We assessed the mor-
phology of RBC lysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Consistent with our findings in the hemolysis assay, the total
number of RBCs was reduced and RBC ghosts were more abun-
dant following incubation with WT Mm (Fig. 3 A–C). Higher-
magnification views revealed gross RBC membrane disruptions
only in WT Mm samples; the few RBC ghosts seen in the Mm−
ΔRD1 condition did not have any membrane disruptions (Fig. 3
D–F). WT membrane disruptions were predominantly at regions of
bacterial contact with RBC membranes (11/12 or 91%) (Fig. 3D).
Significantly more disruptions were observed at the point of con-
tact with WT Mm (Fig. 3F). Mm did not induce discrete pores in
the RBCs in contrast to what has been observed for hemolysis
caused by classical pore-forming toxins, like S. aureus ⍺-hemolysin
(Hla) (39) and Clostridium perfringens necrotic enteritis B-like toxin
(NetB) (40) (Fig. S2).
These findings corroborate the hypothesis that ESX-1 me-
diates contact-dependent membrane disruption and show that
host cell lysis is accompanied by gross cell membrane disrup-
tions at points of bacterial contact rather than by pore forma-
tion. Accordingly, we looked for morphological similarities to
contact-dependent cell lysis mediated by specialized bacterial
secretion systems of other bacteria. We did not observe any
structures mediating contact between Mm and host cells such
as the needle structures or pili that have been observed for
the type III secretion-mediated contact-dependent hemolytic
activity of Yersinia enterocolitica (41) or Escherichia coli (42).
Moreover, the gross membrane disruptions we observed are in
stark contrast to the normal morphology observed for RBC lysis
upon contact with Shigella (43). Thus, the mycobacterial ESX-1
secretion system appears to mediate lysis through another
distinct mechanism.
Most Membrane Lytic Activities Attributed to ESAT-6 Are Due to
Residual Detergent in the Preparations. Our findings were contra-
dicted by prior work suggesting that ESAT-6 alone directly lyses
membranes by functioning as a secreted pore-forming protein
(15, 18, 28, 34). We were puzzled by this discrepancy particularly
because we too had previously found that the widely used,
commercially prepared recombinant ESAT-6 [from Biodefense
and Emerging Infections (BEI) Research Resources Repository]
mediated hemolysis and so did the rESAT-6 we prepared using
the published protocol (44). Further analysis of the purification
protocol revealed that rESAT-6 showed hemolytic activity only
when we included the endotoxin removal step—washing of the
column with the zwitterionic detergent, ASB-14. When we
omitted this wash step, we found the preparation had no he-
molytic activity. This result made us wonder whether the lytic
activity ascribed to ESAT-6 could be due to residual detergent.
We compared the hemolytic activity of rESAT-6 prepared side
by side with and without the detergent wash step and found that
omitting the detergent wash step consistently yielded non-
hemolytic rESAT-6 protein preparations (Fig. 4A). While our
experiments were in progress, a paper was published that also
found that rESAT-6 lysed RBCs only if the preparations were
treated with ASB-14 (34). These authors interpreted the data to
mean that detergent modifies the structure of ESAT-6, activating
its lytic activity. If true, the hemolytic activity should be de-
pendent on both ESAT-6 and detergent and should be abrogated
by proteolyzing detergent-treated ESAT-6. However, we found
no decrease in hemolytic activity of our rESAT-6 preparations
following Proteinase K treatment (Fig. 4A). Similarly, Proteinase
K treatment also failed to decrease the lytic activity of rESAT-6
obtained from BEI Resources (Fig. 4B). However, Proteinase K
treatment completely abrogated the lytic activity of the classic
secreted pore-forming toxins Hla and pneumolysin (PLY) (Fig. 4
C and D). In light of these results, we reviewed the ESAT-6
literature and found that publications reporting ESAT-6 cytolytic
activity included detergent in the purification as determined
from their described methods (Table 1). In contrast, those that
did not use the detergent step reported ESAT-6 to be devoid of
cytolytic activity (Table 1). Of note, both we and others (34) have
found that recombinant CFP-10 preparations (including from
BEI Resources) fail to lyse cells despite being subjected to the
identical detergent wash step to that for ESAT-6. This result
suggests that any residual detergent was removed during the
subsequent wash and dialysis steps in the case of CFP-10 but not
ESAT-6 because of tighter binding of detergent to the latter

protein. In summary, we conclude that the cytolytic activity at-
tributed to rESAT-6 is due to residual bound detergent.
ESAT-6 Can Disrupt Liposomes at Acidic pH. Whereas we had ruled
out that ESAT-6 functions as a lytic protein at neutral pH, de-
tergent-free rESAT-6 is reported to disrupt liposome membranes
at pH ≤5 (Table 1) (25). We too found that our detergent-free
ESAT-6 preparations lysed liposomes at acidic pH <4.5 (Fig. 5A).
Also consistent with the prior report (25), rCFP-10 and an rESAT-
6/CFP-10 heterodimer prepared from a bicistronic construct did
not lyse liposomes (Fig. 5A). These findings confirmed that de-
tergent-free ESAT-6 has intrinsic liposome-disrupting activity at
acidic pH (25).
ESAT-6’s pH-Dependent Membrane Lytic Activity Is Not Required for
ESX-1–Mediated Macrophage Phagosomal Permeabilization. ESAT-
6’s lytic activity at acidic pH is thought to be responsible for
ESX-1’s ability to permeabilize macrophage phagosomes and
allow mycobacteria to access the cytosol (25, 26). If so, then
blocking phagosomal acidification with the vacuolar ATPase
(vATPase) inhibitor, Bafilomycin (45), should decrease ESX-
1–mediated phagosomal permeabilization. To test this, we first
confirmed that Bafilomycin inhibited acidification of both WT
Mm and Mm−ΔRD1 containing phagosomes in the human
macrophage cell line THP1 by staining with LysoTracker, an
acidophilic dye that labels lysosomal compartments (46)(Fig. 5 B
and C). Next, we tested the effect of Bafilomycin on mycobac-
terial phagosomal membrane permeabilization with an assay that
uses the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based
dye, CCF4-AM (22). CCF4-AM is absorbed into the host cytosol
and produces a green fluorescent signal (525 nm) (22). If the
mycobacterial phagosome is permeabilized, then the dye is
cleaved by the endogenous Mm cell-surface–associated β-lacta-
mase BlaC, which is otherwise inaccessible to the dye. Cleavage
causes a loss of FRET and an increase in blue fluorescence
(450 nm). We observed similar loss of FRET for WT Mm and
Mm−ΔRD1, showing they had similar BlaC activity (Fig. S3).
Thus, phagosomal permeabilization can be measured by the shift
from green to blue fluorescence within an infected cell (22). We
used this dye to measure the phagosome-permeabilizing ability
of WT Mm and Mm−ΔRD1 following treatment with Bafilo-
mycin or vehicle. We confirmed prior findings that permeabiliza-
tion was increased in WT infection compared with Mm−ΔRD1
(22) (Fig. 5 D and E and Fig. S4). However, we found no re-
duction in permeabilization in Bafilomycin-treated macrophages
(Fig. 5E). Thus, acidification is not a prerequisite for per-
meabilization of the mycobacterial phagosome, suggesting that
ESX-1–mediated phagosomal permeabilization does not occur
through the acidic pH-dependent membrane lytic activity of
ESAT-6. Rather, it appears that ESX-1–mediated phagosomal
permeabilization proceeds through the same mechanism as RBC
lysis that either is independent of ESAT-6 or requires additional
mycobacterial determinants.
Discussion
We show that ESAT-6 does not function as a pore-forming
protein or possess intrinsic membrane lytic activity under
physiological conditions. We find, however, that ESX-1–medi-
ated cell lysis occurs through a contact-dependent mechanism
that causes gross disruptions at points of bacterial contact. Other
specialized bacterial secretion systems are known to mediate
contact-dependent cytolysis (41, 42). It is tempting to speculate
that this might be the case for mycobacteria as well, given a very
recent study suggesting that the ESX-1 substrate EspC may form
a surface-exposed filamentous structure spanning the mycobac-
terial cell envelope (47, 48). The ESX-1–mediated membrane
disruptions we observe in RBCs look similar to the ESX-1–
mediated phagosomal membrane degradation of infected myeloid
cells observed by cryoelectron microscopy (20, 21), suggesting
that it is relevant to mycobacterial pathogenesis. The intracel-
lular pathogen Rickettsia also disrupts phagosomal membranes,
and it does so via phospholipase A2 (49) in a manner that ap-
pears similar to these ESX-1–mediated membrane disruptions.
Whereas mycobacterial phospholipases are not involved in Mtb’s
phagosomal permeabilization (50), some hemolytic activity is
attributed to a mycobacterial sphingomyelinase (33). In addition,
a host phospholipase A2 may be involved in phagosomal per-
meabilization (51). Such findings leave open the possibility that
ESX-1 regulates the activities of bacterial and host lipolytic en-
zymes to disrupt membranes. Alternatively, ESX-1–mediated
lysis may occur through a secreted component (including ESAT-
6) that needs to be activated by a mycobacterial (or even host)
membrane component. Such a scenario would make lysis
through a secreted lysin contact dependent and is exemplified in
the case of Serratia marcescens hemolysin ShlA (52). ShlA is
secreted and activated by its partner ShlB only in the presence of

Papers that reported recombinant ESAT-6–mediated lysis or membrane
disruption were found through a PubMed Search. Whether detergent was
used in the ESAT-6 preparation was determined from the Materials and
Methods section in the case of ESAT-6 prepared in house or from the man-

phosphatidylethanolamine, a lipid commonly found in biological
membranes (52).
Our experiments raise the question of what precise role
ESAT-6 plays in mycobacterial virulence. Prior reports that
ESAT-6 secretion-defective mutants are defective for host cell
lysis (15, 16, 53) are confounded by the finding that several ESX-
1 substrates are mutually codependent for secretion (54, 55).
However, because it is an immunodominant antigen, it is likely to
have a role in virulence. Perhaps it acts downstream of ESX-1–
mediated membrane permeabilization to directly influence
pathogenesis by regulating immune determinants (56–58). The
finding that ESAT-6 binds to liposomal membranes may reflect
its ability to bind lipids and thereby eukaryotic cell membranes
(19, 59) to initiate or subvert the requisite cell signaling events.
In such a scenario, ESX-1–mediated phagosomal permeabiliza-
tion would enable ESAT-6 to gain contact with the cytosol of the
infected macrophage or even neighboring cells to influence their
immune program.
Our quest to confirm and expand the model of ESAT-6 as a
cytolytic, pore-forming toxin took an unexpected turn when a
serendipitous omission in a well-defined and widely used puri-
fication protocol led us to reexamine the biological function
that had been widely attributed to this mycobacterial virulence
determinant. Our experiments led us to reinterpret ESX-1’s
membrane lytic activity. We hope our findings will lead to a
better understanding of this and of ESAT-6’s biological function.
Materials and Methods
The materials and methods used are detailed at length in SI Materials and
Methods. Mycobacterial strains, plasmids, hemolysis and liposome lysis as-
says, zebrafish and macrophage infections, electron microscopy, production
of recombinant proteins and culture filtrates, and the phagosomal per-
meabilization assay are described therein. Plasmids and mycobacterial strains
used are listed in Table S1 and S2.
Zebrafish husbandry and experiments were in compliance with guidelines
from the UK Home Office and the US National Institutes of Health and
approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.
