Similarities between Mycobacterium tuberculosis phoP-phoR mutants and the attenuated laboratory strain M.
tuberculosis H37Ra in terms of morphological and cytochemical properties, lipid content, gene expression and
virulence attenuation prompted us to analyze the functionality of this two-component regulator in the latter
strain. Sequence analysis revealed a base substitution resulting in a one-amino-acid change in the likely
DNA-binding region of PhoP in H37Ra relative to H37Rv. Using gel-shift assays, we show that this mutation
abrogates the ability of the H37Ra PhoP protein to bind to a 40-bp segment of its own promoter. Consistent
with this result, the phoP gene from H37Rv but not that from H37Ra was able to restore the synthesis of
sulfolipids, diacyltrehaloses and polyacyltrehaloses in an isogenic phoP-phoR knock-out mutant of M. tuber-
culosis Moreover, complementation of H37Ra with phoP from H37Rv fully restored sulfolipid, diacyltrehalose
and polyacyltrehalose synthesis, clearly indicating that the lack of production of these lipids in H37Ra is solely
due to the point mutation in phoP. Using a pks2-3/4 knock-out mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, evidence is
further provided that the above-mentioned polyketide-derived acyltrehaloses do not signiﬁcantly contribute to
the virulence of the tubercle bacillus in a mouse model of infection. Reasons for the attenuation of H37Ra thus
most likely stand in other virulence factors, many of which are expected to belong to the PhoP regulon and
another of which, unrelated to PhoP, appears to be the lack of production of phthiocerol dimycocerosates in
this strain.
H37Rv and H37Ra are two variants of an Mycobacterium
tuberculosis strain named H37 that was originally isolated from
the sputum of a tuberculosis patient in 1905. Serial passaging
of H37 through different media led to the dissociation of this
isolate into two variants, a virulent one known as H37Rv and
an avirulent one known as H37Ra, which also differ in their
colonial morphology and cording properties (27, 39). With the
goal of identifying the molecular determinants underlying the
virulence attenuation of H37Ra, numerous approaches includ-
ing genetic complementation of H37Ra with H37Rv genomic
DNA (29), gene expression proﬁling (15, 28, 32), subtractive
RNA hybridization (22) and comparative genomics, proteom-
ics and lipidomics (4, 7, 10, 18, 26) have been undertaken.
Although these studies have led to the identiﬁcation of a num-
ber of genes or gene products the expression of which differs
between H37Rv and H37Ra, it is still at present unclear to
what extent these products account for the virulence attenua-
tion of H37Ra. Furthermore, as attempts to restore the viru-
lence of the H37Ra strain through genetic complementation
with H37Rv DNA have so far yielded negative results (4, 29),
it has been concluded that the virulence attenuation of H37Ra
was certainly the result of multiple mutations and/or rear-
rangements affecting multiple chromosomal loci.
With the recent study by different groups of the two-com-
ponent regulator PhoP-PhoR from M. tuberculosis (16, 24, 31,
37, 40), striking similarities between H37Ra and different M.
tuberculosis phoP-phoR knock-out mutants began to emerge.
PhoP-PhoR is a two-component regulator whose disruption
was shown to affect dramatically the ability of M. tuberculosis to
replicate in animal and cellular models (31, 40). Like the
H37Ra strain (14, 26, 27, 39), phoP-phoR mutants of M. tuber-
culosis form smaller colonies on agar plates (31), tend to lose
acid fastness (40), do not stain with neutral red (16) and fail to
grow as serpentine cords (16, 31). Most of these attenuation,
morphological and cytochemical properties have been pro-
posed to be a direct consequence of the inability of both
H37Ra and the phoP-phoR mutants to produce three classes of
polyketide-derived acyltrehaloses known as sulfolipids (SL),

diacyltrehaloses (DAT) and polyacyltrehaloses (PAT) (7, 10,
16, 26). Deﬁnitive proof for this assumption was, however,
lacking. With the more widespread use of microarrays, other
striking parallels between the two types of strains in terms of
gene expression became obvious as nine of the twenty-two
genes whose expression was found to be consistently lower in
H37Ra than in H37Rv were also among the most down-regu-
lated in a phoP-phoR mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (15, 40).
These observations led us to investigate whether the H37Ra
strain expressed a functional PhoP-PhoR two-component sys-
tem.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains. The M. tuberculosis strains used in this study were M. tuber-
culosis H37Rv (ATCC 25618), M. tuberculosis H37Ra (ATCC 25177), the phoPR
mutant of the M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1237, 1237phoPR::hyg (16) and the
msl3 strain (12).
Production and puriﬁcation of PhoP-Rv and PhoP-Ra. The PhoP proteins
from H37Rv and H37Ra (thereafter named PhoP-Rv and PhoP-Ra, respectively)
were produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS using the pET15b expres-
sion plasmid (Novagen) and puriﬁed using a HiTrap Chelating HP afﬁnity col-
umn on an A´KTA-prime FPLC (Amersham Biosciences). His tags were cleaved
using the Thrombin CleanCleavage kit from Sigma. PhoP-Ra was obtained by
producing a serine-to-leucine mutation at position 219 of PhoP-Rv using the
QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
Gel shift assays. The 40-bp fragment of the phoP promoter (phoP40) used in
the gel shift assay experiments was designed according to results of DNase I
protection assays (C. Martı´n, unpublished results) and encompassed region 31
to 70, relative to the translational start site of phoP. This DNA fragment was
labeled at the 5 end with IRD700 (InfraRed Dye 700, Li-Cor, Inc.). 25 nM
double-stranded labeled phoP promoter probe and an increasing concentration
of PhoP-Rv and PhoP-Ra proteins were mixed together in binding buffer [50 mM
Tris HCl, pH 7.0, 100 mM KCl, 5% glycerol, 5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA,
0.5% Tween, 50 g ml1 bovine serum albumin, 10 g ml1 poly(dI-dC)] and
applied to a 20-cm  20-cm 5% native polyacrylamide gel. PhoP-Rv and
PhoP-Ra were phosphorylated by incubation with 50 mM acetyl phosphate in a
buffer consisting of 100 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.0), 10 mM MgCl2 and 150 mM KCl.
Circular dichroism. Far-UV circular dichroism spectra were acquired at 25°C
with an Aviv 215 spectropolarimeter (Aviv Biomedical) using a cylindrical cell
with a 0.02-cm path-length. PhoP-Rv (0.7 mg ml1) and PhoP-Ra (0.22 mg
ml1), both in 20 mM phosphate, 500 mM NaF, pH 8.0, were scanned three
times from 260 to 190 nm (0.5-nm step) with an averaging time of 5 s per step.
The spectra, corrected using buffer baselines measured under the same condi-
tions, were normalized to the molar peptide bond concentration and path length
(1 cm) as mean molar differential extinction coefﬁcient per residue (ε). Sec-
ondary structure estimations were derived from the normalized spectra using the
CONTIN/LL method included in the CDPro software and the SP43 protein
reference set (38).
Complementation studies. Plasmid pSO5K was described earlier (16). The
same primers as were used to amplify phoP from M. tuberculosis H37Rv
in pSO5K were used to amplify phoP from M. tuberculosis H37Ra in
pOMKPhoP-Ra (19). In pSO5K and pOMKphoP-Ra, the phoP genes are
expressed from their own promoter. pVVphoP-Rv and pVVphoP-Ra were
constructed by PCR-amplifying the entire coding sequences of the phoP genes
from M. tuberculosis H37Rv and H37Ra using the primers PhoP.9 (5-gggcgc
ccatatgcggaaaggggttgatctcgtg-3) and PhoP.10 (5-gggaagctttcgaggctcccgcagtacg
tagc-3) and cloning these fragments into the NdeI and HindIII restriction sites
of the expression vector pVV16 (23).
Lipid analyses, neutral red staining and cording properties. Radiolabeling of
whole M. tuberculosis cells with [1-14C]propionate (speciﬁc activity, 56.7 Ci
mol1, MP Biomedicals Inc.), extraction and analyses of lipids were performed
as described (16). Neutral red staining of tubercle bacilli was performed as
described by Soto and collaborators (36). For the analysis of cording properties,
a drop of M. tuberculosis culture grown in Sauton’s medium was smeared onto a
glass slide, stained by the standard Kinyoun procedure and observed under a
light microscope at 1,000 magniﬁcation.
Generation of a pks2-pks3-4 mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The ts-sacB
method (30) was used to achieve allelic replacement at the pks2 locus of the
pks3/4 M. tuberculosis mutant, msl3 (12). The M. tuberculosis H37Rv pks2 gene
and ﬂanking regions were extracted from cosmid MTCY409 on a 6,576-bp EcoRI
restriction fragment and a disrupted allele, pks2::kan, was obtained by replacing
3,049 bp of the coding sequence of this gene bracketed between two NruI sites
with the kanamycin resistance cassette from pUC4K (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech). pks2::kan was then cloned into the BamHI-cut and blunt-ended pPR27
(30) to obtain pPR27pks2K, the construct used for allelic replacement in the
msl3 strain. Allelic replacement at the pks2 locus of the msl3 strain was con-
ﬁrmed by PCR using primers pks2.1 (5-gacggtgaccggatcctggcg-3) and pks2.2
(5-gacgtacatgcgcggcaccgc-3).
Virulence studies. 6- to 8-week-old female BALB/c mice were infected intra-
venously with 105 CFU of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, M. tuberculosis H37Ra and the
M. tuberculosis H37Rv pks2-3/4 mutant as described (20). Five mice were used
per experimental point and per strain.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Identiﬁcation of a point mutation in PhoP-Ra. Bacterial
response regulator transcription factors can be classed into
subfamilies based on structural similarity within their DNA-
binding effector domains. Sequence similarities of the C-ter-
minal effector domain identify PhoP from M. tuberculosis as a
member of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily, characterized by a
winged-helix DNA-binding domain (25). Sequencing of 2.9 kb
of the chromosomal DNA of M. tuberculosis H37Ra encom-
passing the entire coding sequences of phoP and phoR as well
as 600 bp of the promoter region of phoP and 80 bp of down-
stream DNA revealed only one single nucleotide polymor-
phism affecting codon 219 (TCG 3 TTG) in phoP and chang-
ing a serine to a leucine. S219 in PhoP of M. tuberculosis is
equivalent to R200 in PhoB of E. coli which is comprised in the
helix that penetrates the major groove of DNA and has been
shown to be implicated in DNA binding (3). Data thus sug-
gested that PhoP-Ra might be impaired in DNA binding.
PhoP-Ra is unable to bind its own promoter. PhoP from M.
tuberculosis has been proposed to repress its own expression
(17). The ability of PhoP-Ra to bind its own promoter was thus
investigated in vitro using gel shift assays. To this end, the
PhoP-Rv and PhoP-Ra proteins were overproduced in E. coli
as C-terminal His-tagged proteins and puriﬁed to homoge-
neity by Ni2-NTA afﬁnity chromatography. Sodium dode-
cyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
analysis
showed that they migrated with apparent molecular masses of
approximately 27.5 kDa, consistent with the calculated molec-
ular masses of PhoP-Rv (27,514 Da) and its S219L mutant
(27,539 Da) (data not shown). PhoP-Ra and PhoP-Rv DNA
binding experiments were carried out in the presence of 10 g
ml1 poly(dI-dC) to prevent non-speciﬁc binding, an excess of
recombinant proteins and a 40-bp DNA fragment (phoP40)
comprising the DR1 and DR2 direct repeats identiﬁed by
Gupta et al. (17). The ability of the recombinant proteins to
bind DNA was checked before and after phosphorylation with
acetyl phosphate. As shown in Fig. 1A, in this experimental
setting, the binding of PhoP-Rv to phoP40 was phosphoryla-
tion-dependent and resulted in the formation of two major
higher-order complexes, most likely reﬂecting the existence of
two PhoP-binding sites in phoP40. Under the same experimen-
tal conditions, neither PhoP-Ra nor its phosphorylated coun-
terpart P*PhoP-Ra bound to phoP40. The phosphorylation-
dependent binding of PhoP-Rv to phoP40 is in apparent
conﬂict with the recent report of Gupta and collaborators (17)
of a phosphorylation-independent assembly of PhoP-DNA
complexes at elevated concentrations of PhoP. Although both
studies were performed in the presence of an excess of PhoP

proteins, the fact that a non-His-tagged version of PhoP was
used in our assays and important differences in the sizes of the
DNA probes used in the gel shift experiments—a 40-bp frag-
ment encompassing two direct repeats of the promoter region
of phoP in our study, 160- to 410-bp DNA probes encompass-
ing all three direct repeats and more than 100 bp of upstream
region in the Gupta et al. study (17)—most likely account for
this discrepancy.
To ensure that the overall folding of the PhoP-Ra recombi-
nant protein had not been compromised and that the point
mutation alone accounted for the lack of binding of this pro-
tein to phoP40, circular dichroism tests were carried out on
PhoP-Rv and PhoP-Ra. Far-UV circular dichroism analysis of
PhoP-Rv and PhoP-Ra revealed virtually identical spectral
properties (Fig. 1B), indicating that the global secondary struc-
ture of the two variants was very close. The double trough
shape around 208 and 222 nm is characteristic of proteins with
high -helix content. Estimations of the secondary structure
content of PhoP-Rv and PhoP-Ra by single-value decomposi-
tion showed in both cases that about 40% of the residues were
involved in -helices, 15% in -strands, and 20% in turns,
while 25% remained unordered.
PhoP-Ra is unable to restore polyketide-derived acyltreha-
lose synthesis in a phoP-phoR knock-out mutant of M. tuber-
culosis. Because PhoP was shown to be a positive regulator of
the synthesis of SL, DAT and PAT in M. tuberculosis (16, 40),
we then set out to determine whether PhoP-Ra was able to
restore
the
synthesis
of
these
complex
lipids
in
1237phoPR::hyg, a phoP-null mutant generated earlier in
the M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1237 (16). Two types of
constructs were used in the complementation studies. In
pOMKphoP-Ra and pSO5K, the phoP genes from H37Ra and
H37Rv, respectively, are expressed from their own promoters.
As the inability of PhoP-Ra to bind its promoter might have
resulted in poor expression from this plasmid, other constructs
in which the phoP genes from H37Ra and H37Rv were placed
under control of the phsp60 promoter were also generated,
resulting in pVVphoP-Ra and pVVphoP-Rv. All of these plas-
mids were electroporated into 1237phoPR::hyg and the pro-
duction of PhoP-Ra and PhoP-Rv from pVVphoP-Ra and
pVVphoP-Rv was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting with mono-
clonal anti-His antibodies (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material). As reported earlier, complementation of the mutant
with phoP-Rv expressed from either plasmid (pSO5K and
pVVphoP-Rv) restored the production of SL, DAT and PAT
in 1237phoPR::hyg (Fig. 2) (16). In contrast, the expression of
phoP-Ra in 1237phoPR::hyg had no effect on the production
of these lipids (Fig. 2), suggesting that PhoP-Ra is unable to
activate the promoters of the genes governing their synthesis.
PhoP-Ra is responsible for the absence of SL, DAT and PAT
but not PDIM in the H37Ra strain. The introduction of
pSO5K and pVVphoP-Rv in H37Ra induced the synthesis of
SL, DAT and PAT (Fig. 3), indicating that the S219L mutation
in PhoP-Ra is the sole reason for the absence of these lipids in
the attenuated laboratory strain. Interestingly, lipid analyses
also revealed that H37Ra is deﬁcient in the production of
phthiocerol
dimycocerosates
(PDIM),
another
family
of
polyketide-derived lipids implicated in the virulence of M. tu-
berculosis (5, 9, 21, 35) (Fig. 3). In contrast to the production
of SL, DAT and PAT, the synthesis of PDIM was not restored
upon complementation with phoP-Rv, consistent with our ear-
lier observation that this family of lipids is apparently not
under the regulatory control of PhoP-PhoR (16).
Complementation of H37Ra with phoP-Rv also resulted in
the partial restoration of the cording properties of H37Ra and
in a colonial morphology resembling that of M. tuberculosis
H37Rv (data not shown). Complementation, however, did not
signiﬁcantly enhance the growth rate of H37Ra on agar plates

and did not confer to it the ability to stain with neutral red
(data not shown).
Effect of the combined loss of SL, DAT and PAT on the
virulence of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. Because of their likely
involvement in the neutral red staining and cording properties
of the tubercle bacillus, SL, DAT and PAT have often been
proposed to be one of the major causes of the virulence atten-
uation of the H37Ra strain. This was further supported by the
important decrease in virulence of phoP mutants of M. tuber-
culosis lacking the same families of lipids and the decreased
pathogenicity of mmpL8 mutants of M. tuberculosis deﬁcient in
the production of mature forms of SL (8, 11, 16, 31, 40).
Arguing against this assumption, however, isogenic pks3/4 and
pks2 mutants of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, speciﬁcally deﬁcient in
the production of DAT and PAT or all forms of SL, respec-
tively, were reported to be as virulent as their wild-type parent
in the mouse or guinea pig models of infection (33, 34). Given
that the synthesis of SL, DAT and PAT is coordinately regu-
lated by PhoP (16, 40), it was thus proposed that these families
of lipids might be able to compensate for one another and that
their roles in virulence might only become clearly visible when
their synthesis is abolished simultaneously (21).
In order to investigate this hypothesis and address the ques-
tion of the contribution of these lipids to the virulence atten-
uation of H37Ra, we undertook to generate an SL/DAT/PAT
mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv and to compare its virulence
to that of the wild-type H37Rv and H37Ra strains in a murine
model. A pks2-3/4 knock-out mutant was constructed by allelic
replacement at the pks2 locus of the msl3 (pks3/4) mutant of
H37Rv (12) using the ts-sacB method (see Fig. S2 in the sup-
plemental material) (30). As expected, the msl3pks2 mutant
was totally devoid of SL, DAT and PAT (see Fig. S3 in the
supplemental material). It was also partially impaired in its
ability to grow as serpentine cords in liquid medium and dis-
played an intermediate phenotype between H37Rv and H37Ra
in this respect (data not shown). However, it grew similarly to
wild-type H37Rv and displayed a normal morphology on 7H11
agar plates. The mutant was used, along with the H37Rv and
H37Ra strains, to infect BALB/c mice. As shown in Fig. 4, the
ability of the mutant to multiply and persist in mice over a
90-day period was comparable to that of wild-type H37Rv,
indicating that the combined loss of the three families of acyl-
trehaloses had no impact on the virulence of M. tuberculosis
H37Rv in this model. Interestingly, while the H37Ra strain
failed to ﬁx neutral red, the mutants were as proﬁcient as M.
tuberculosis H37Rv at staining with the dye (data not shown).
It can thus be concluded from these studies that the loss of SL,
DAT and PAT per se is unlikely to be a major cause of the
inability of M. tuberculosis H37Ra to produce progressive dis-
ease in animal models. Moreover, the simultaneous loss of
these three families of lipids does not appear to have any
signiﬁcant impact on the growth rate and neutral red staining
properties of the tubercle bacillus.

Conclusions. Evidence is provided in this study that a point
mutation in the DNA-binding region of the PhoP response
regulator from M. tuberculosis H37Ra is responsible for the
inability of this strain to produce SL, DAT and PAT. This
mutation also partially accounts for the particular morphology
of H37Ra.
Observations made on an msl3pks2 knock-out mutant of
M. tuberculosis H37Rv further allowed us to conclude that
while SL, DAT and PAT are likely to account, at least in part,
for the inability of H37Ra to grow as serpentine cords, they
have by themselves no signiﬁcant impact on the growth rate,
virulence and ability of the tubercle bacillus to stain with neu-
tral red. A recent study on the neutral red staining properties
of lipid-deﬁcient mutants of M. tuberculosis (6) suggests, how-
ever, that the loss of PDIM in addition to SL, DAT and PAT
is the likely cause of the inability of H37Ra to ﬁx the dye.
Given the central role of PhoP-PhoR in M. tuberculosis
virulence (31, 40), it is most likely that the identiﬁed muta-
tion, along with the absence of PDIM, whose roles in patho-
genicity have been well documented (5, 9, 21, 35), is respon-
sible for much of the virulence attenuation of H37Ra. A
study aimed at evaluating the virulence and immunological
properties of H37Ra complemented with phoP-Rv has been
undertaken by some of us to verify this hypothesis and will
be reported elsewhere (R. Brosch and S. T. Cole, unpub-
lished results). It is expected that the characterization of the

tography with chloroform:methanol:water (60:30:6, by vol.) as the solvent. The minor compound(s) displaying similar migration properties as DAT
in the H37Ra strain might correspond to minor forms of diacyltrehaloses esteriﬁed with hydroxylated long-chain methyl-branched fatty acids or
short-chain unsaturated mono-methyl-branched fatty acids (2, 13). PDIM were analyzed with petroleum ether (60/80°C):ethyl acetate (98:2, by vol.,
three developments) as the solvent. The solvent systems used for the analysis of PAT were identical to those described in Fig. 2. Only the lipid

PhoP regulon will allow other molecular determinants con-
tributing to the attenuation phenotype of M. tuberculosis
H37Ra to be identiﬁed. Possible such members of this regu-
lon include the lipF, fbpA and mmpL8 genes (40), the dis-
ruption of all of which has been reported to affect M. tuber-
culosis virulence and/or pathogenicity (1, 5, 8, 11).
