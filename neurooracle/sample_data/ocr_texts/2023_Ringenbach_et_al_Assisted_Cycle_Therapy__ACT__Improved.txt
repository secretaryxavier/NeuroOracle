Abstract: Alzheimer’s disease is prevalent in persons with Down syndrome (DS) as early as their 30s
and presents as decreased social interaction, coordination, and physical activity. Therefore, changing
attitudes and beliefs about exercise is key to increasing motivation for physical activity especially
in middle-age adults with DS. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of Assisted Cycle
Therapy (ACT) on self-efﬁcacy and exercise perception in middle-age adults with Down syndrome
(DS) following an exercise intervention three times a week for 8 weeks. Twelve participants were
in the ACT group in which a motor assisted their cycling to be performed at least 30% faster than
voluntary cycling (VC), 10 participants were in the voluntary cycling group, and two participants
were in the no cycling (NC) group. The results showed that both exercise groups (i.e., ACT and
VC) improved in their self-efﬁcacy after the 8-week intervention. In addition, exercise perception
improved following ACT, but not VC or NC. Our results are discussed with respect to their fu-
ture implications for exercise in the DS population. The results can be attributed to differences
in effort required by each intervention group as well as the neurotrophic factors that occur when
muscle contractions create synaptic connections resulting in improvement in cognition and feelings
of satisfaction.

1. Introduction
The cardinal characteristics of persons with Down syndrome (DS) typically include
physical factors such as joint hypermobility, hypotonia [1], low VO2max [2], chronotropic
incompetence [3], low exercise tolerance [4], and mental health and cognitive factors such
as depression and lower IQ [5]. Cognitive deﬁcits are the cornerstone of persons with DS
and have been associated with smaller brain volumes in the cerebellum, hippocampus,
frontal and temporal areas [6].
These physical and mental characteristics of individuals with DS play a role in their
reduced levels of physical activity. It is suggested that all adults should be engaging in
150 min of moderate to high intensity exercise every week to gain health beneﬁts from
exercise [7]. Concerning the DS population, who already possesses a physical and mental
propensity towards sedentary activity, this is a particularly relevant situation [8]. A study
conducted involving adolescents found that only 58% of teens with DS are meeting the
proper exercise standards; this is relatively low compared to the typical population of
adolescents in which 75–85% are meeting these recommendations [9,10]. To our knowledge,
there is no data concerning the amount of physical activity in middle-age adults with DS,

although it is reasonable to assume that it is lower than in adolescents with DS due to
the common decline in physical and mental activity and negative health consequences
that are a result of physical inactivity. One of the many chronic diseases to have a high
prevalence in sedentary adults is cardiovascular disease. It has been found that a dose-
response relationship exists between high amounts of time spent doing sedentary activities
(e.g., playing video games) and mortality from cardiovascular disease [11]. Furthermore,
individuals with DS have an increased incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as they age.
This increased prevalence appears to be accelerated in populations with DS by almost
30 to 40 years [12]. It is estimated that 10–25% of adults with DS have AD at age 40–49
and 20–50% have AD at age 50–59. Additionally, autopsy studies show that by age 40,
the brains of almost all individuals with DS have signiﬁcant levels of plaques and tangles,
and abnormal protein deposits which are considered hallmarks of AD [13]. Therefore, it is
extremely important that more research be done on methods of motivation and maintenance
of physical activity in middle-age adults with DS.
AD presents itself differently in adults with DS and can manifest in several ways:
decreased social interactions, decreased cooperativeness, change in coordination, decrease
in physical activity, and changes in gait. Thus, we believe that studying the inﬂuence
of an exercise program on self-efﬁcacy and exercise perception is crucial. Changing at-
titudes and beliefs about exercise is key to increasing motivation for physical activity,
improving cooperativeness, and enhancing social interactions. In a study by Heller and
colleagues [14], 53 adults with DS completed a physical activity regimen for three days
a week for twelve weeks. The most common inhibitors of exercise were found to be lack
of energy, ﬁnding exercise to be boring or difﬁcult, feelings of laziness, or having health
concerns related to physical activity. The intervention group yielded signiﬁcant positive
changes in their perception of exercise and attitudes about getting physically active. This in-
cluded increased self-efﬁcacy, more positive-expected outcomes, fewer cognitive-emotional
barriers, improved life satisfaction, and marginally decreased depression [14]. In the typical
population, self-efﬁcacy is a strong predictor of engagement in exercise [14–16].
Self-efﬁcacy is deﬁned by a person’s conﬁdence in their ability to perform a task or
skill successfully [15]. Individuals possessing a high self-efﬁcacy for exercise are more
likely to become and remain active throughout their life. If one believes that they can
engage in or complete an exercise skill, they are more likely to do so. When an individual’s
self-efﬁcacy is initially low for physical activity, having positive experiences during exercise
can consequently increase their conﬁdence in their ability to exercise in the future, thus
increasing their self-efﬁcacy [15]. It has been found that when an individual has high
self-efﬁcacy for a task, they will attribute their failures to lack of effort and believe that they
will succeed if they put in more effort on the next attempt [15]. Equally, those with lower
self-efﬁcacy for a task will attribute failures to their perceived inability to perform the skill.
This causes a loss in motivation and a tendency to give up more easily [15].
One’s self-efﬁcacy has more to do with their perception of their capabilities and
less to do with the reality of their competency [15]. Furthermore, an increase of positive
experiences in exercise will most often increase self-efﬁcacy for that task. In contrast, if
the individual’s initial self-efﬁcacy was low for that task and negative experiences occur,
self-efﬁcacy will often decrease [15]. Because of the linear relationship between type of
experience and self-efﬁcacy, giving individuals positive experiences will prospectively
increase their self-efﬁcacy for that experience in the future, while providing negative
experiences will probably yield a decrease in an individual’s self-efﬁcacy for that task, thus
conﬁrming their initially low competency [15,17,18]. Self-efﬁcacy has been suggested as a
means for the anxiety reducing and anti-depressive factors of exercise [19–21]. However, the
evidence that self-efﬁcacy is the mechanism in which exercise is associated with depression
and anxiety is currently correlational. More research would be required to provide a more
concrete supporting argument for typical and atypical populations [19–21].
Wood & Bandura [22] conducted a study on motivation and self-efﬁcacy by testing
participants in two different mindsets. In the “ﬁxed” mindset group, the participants

Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 1719
3 of 13
were informed that they would perform a task and that their score was a direct reﬂection
of their abilities to succeed in that speciﬁc type of test. In the “growth” mindset group,
the participants were informed that for the same test, they would be assessed on “an
acquirable skill” [22]. Those who were told they could acquire the skill performed much
better, had a higher self-efﬁcacy score, and set more difﬁcult goals for performing the skill
than those in the ﬁxed mindset group. This might demonstrate that people will put in
more effort and yield better results in a task when they believe that they have the capacity
for improvement [22,23]. This relates to middle-age adults with DS because they may be
more apt to participate in physical activity if they believe that they can perform the tasks
involved successfully despite their physical and mental limitations. Accommodations such
as assisted exercise can be made to make exercise tasks more approachable for middle-age
adults with DS. Assisted Cycling Therapy (ACT) is completed on a stationary exercise
bicycle in which a motor assists in moving the pedals at a faster rate than they can on their
own and is one way that may motivate middle-age adults with DS in believing a task,
such as cycling or any other exercise skill, can be achievable. This belief may increase an
individual’s self-efﬁcacy and enthusiasm about exercise.
In other populations, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), assisted exercise (AE) has
shown promising results [24–26] and has been recently applied to a population of adoles-
cents with DS [27]. AE requires a participant to exercise at a higher rate than they would
during voluntary exercise (VE) usually through the use of a motor or other mechanism
that increases either speed, resistance, or intensity. VE represents the pace or intensity
that the participant would naturally select [25]. AE has shown improved neuroprotective
properties, motor function, and increased cerebral blood ﬂow in participants with PD.
These factors improved performance in cognitive skills and had a trend in decreasing
depression [24–26]. Speciﬁcally, ACT is a form of AE which utilizes a stationary bicycle
with a motor. During ACT, an individual will pedal on the bike and the motor will increase
the RPM automatically, thus allowing faster pedaling with no extra effort [27]. This study
demonstrated that ACT may be a promising method of AE in the DS population. The
2014 study utilized an acute ACT intervention that analyzed whether participants with DS
could improve their motor control, cognition, exercise perception, and self-efﬁcacy after
one bout of 30-min exercise of ACT. The results demonstrated that information processing,
cognitive planning, and exercise perception were all improved following one session of
ACT but not following Voluntary Cycling (VC) on the stationary bike or no exercise at all.
Self-efﬁcacy did not change signiﬁcantly after one session; however, this is not to say that a
more chronic regimen might yield different results. In fact, it was later discovered that SE
could be improved following ACT after an 8-week intervention in adolescents with DS [28].
To our knowledge, no studies have utilized a long-term (i.e., 8-week) between-group
intervention using ACT in middle-age adults with DS and measured changes in self-efﬁcacy
and exercise perception. Thus, this paper aims to further analyze the effects of ACT and
voluntary cycling (VC) on self-efﬁcacy as well as exercise perception, assessed using subsets
of the Physical Activity and Self Efﬁcacy Survey [29], in middle-age adults with DS. Based
on preliminary data from our lab with adolescents with DS [28], it was hypothesized that
ACT would improve self-efﬁcacy and exercise perception after 8 weeks, more so than VC,
and no improvements were predicted following the no cycling (NC).
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants
As can be seen in Table 1, participants consisted of 24 adults with Down syndrome
(DS), with a mean age of 36.4 years and a mean mental age of 6.1 years. Participants were
recruited through ﬂyers, word of mouth in the community, phone call connections, and
email announcements. First, parents or legal guardians completed a “Physical Activity
Readiness Questionnaire” on behalf of the participant where seven answers of “no” de-
termined the participant’s eligibility and readiness for exercise. All protocols used in this

Twelve participants were randomized into the Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT) group,
ten were randomized into the Voluntary Cycling (VC) group, and two were placed in the
No Cycling (NC) control group via convenience sampling.
2.2. Exercise Interventions
Participants in both exercise groups participated in a supervised exercise protocol
for eight weeks, for at least three 30-min sessions per week. Exercise intensity, from an
aerobic perspective, was matched for both exercise groups. Intensity was determined
on an individual patient basis based on the formula speciﬁc for persons with intellectual
disabilities. Fernhall and colleagues [30] developed a formula for predicting maximal HR
for persons with DS (i.e., MaxHR = 210 −(0.56 × age) −(15.5 × DS)), with DS coded as
2. Training heart rate (Thr) zone for each participant, based on ACSM recommendations
of exercise management for persons with chronic diseases and disabilities, was 60–80%
peak HR range [31]. The participants were instructed to exercise within their Thr during
the 30-min main exercise set. The main exercise set occurred after a 5-min warm-up phase.
2.3. Apparatus
Participants utilized a stationary recumbent bicycle that contained a mechanical motor
that would assist them in pedaling at a preset rate during each exercise intervention. The
pedals included strap and cage devices to hold the participants’ feet in place for comfort.
Participants wore athletic shoes and clothing for all interventions. For each intervention,
the participants were asked to sit on the bike and pedal either voluntarily or to the motor
set pace. The pedaling cadence was set by a CycleOps Cervo 2.4 cycle computer that was
wired to a magnetic cadence sensor hooked up to the bike. Participants wore Bontrager
ANT+ Softstrap Heart Rate belts that synchronized with the cycling sensor computer to
determine Heart Rate.
2.4. Experimental Groups
1. Assisted Cycle Therapy (ACT): Training pedaling rate was set at 35 percent greater
than the participant’s preferred pedaling rate, determined during the warm-up of each
exercise session. A 35% increase is consistent with previous research using this method-
ology [26,27]. During exercise, the participant’s HR was displayed relative to their THR
zone on the cycle monitor. Participants were instructed to maintain their HR within their
THR zone through active pedaling of the cycle and adjust (increase or decrease) their con-
tribution to the pedaling action in order to maintain their HR within THR. The algorithm
controlling the motor is responsive to pedaling rate, patient work, and HR; these data were
used to determine the level of assistance or resistance provided by the motor.
2. Voluntary Cycling (VC): The exercise cycle was operated in its standard mode
in which the motor does not provide any assistance with pedaling. Participants were
instructed to maintain HR within their individualized THR zone. No instructions were
given regarding the maintenance of a particular cadence. Cadence and resistance level were
voluntarily selected by the participant. The researcher ensured the participants maintained
their HR within THR during the main exercise set.

3. No Cycling (NC) Control Group: Participants in the no-exercise group were asked
to maintain their current level of activity throughout the study period.
2.5. Dependent Measures
Self-Efﬁcacy and Exercise Perception Questionnaires: Participants completed two
questionnaires at the beginning and end of their 8-week session. These questionnaires were
designed to evaluate their beliefs in their ability to perform exercise and how exercise could
help them.
2.5.1. Self-Efﬁcacy Questionnaire
This questionnaire was specially developed for individuals with intellectual disabilities
and it is a subdivision of the Physical Activity and Self-Efﬁcacy Survey [29]. The purpose of
the survey is to evaluate the participant’s belief in his or her ability to perform the exercise
protocol for the given intervention time, despite varying circumstances. Participants were
asked to respond “yes”, “no”, or “maybe” to the following questions: “Do you think you
can make time for this activity almost everyday?”, “Do you think you can do this activity
even when you are very busy?”, “Do you think you can do this activity even when you are
feeling sad?”, “Do you think you can do this activity even after a long, hard day at school?”,
“Do you think you can do this activity on days when you are tired?”, “Do you think you
can do this activity when you feel lazy?”. “Yes” was scored as a 3, “maybe” was scored as
2, and “no” was scored as 1. The higher the individual’s score, the more the participant
believed in his or her ability to bicycle every day.
2.5.2. Exercise Perception
This questionnaire measured the participant’s perception of how exercise would affect
him or her. It was a part of the Physical Activity and Self Efﬁcacy Survey that was developed
speciﬁcally for individuals with an intellectual disability [29]. Participants were asked if
exercise would “help”, “not help”, or “neither or both” to the following conditions: lose or
control their weight, make them feel tired, make them happier, make them hurt less, help
them to meet new people, help them to get in shape, make them look better, and improve
their health. “Help” was scored as a 3, “neither or both” was a 2, and “not help” was 1.
The higher the individual’s score, the higher the participant’s belief that exercise would
help them.
2.6. Data Analysis
The ACT, VC, and NC groups were analyzed independently to look for differences in
data from pretest to posttest. Separate one-tailed paired sample t-tests were conducted for
each dependent measure (i.e., self-efﬁcacy, exercise perception) pre and post intervention
with SPSS version 21.
3. Results
3.1. Self-Efﬁcacy
For self-efﬁcacy, there was a signiﬁcant difference in the VC intervention t(9) = −3.25,
p = 0.005 in which self-efﬁcacy improved from pre to post. As can be seen in Figure 1,
For the ACT intervention, there was a trend toward conventional levels of signiﬁcance
t(11) = −1.40, p = 0.095 in which self-efﬁcacy improved from pre to post. There were no
differences in the NC intervention.

4. Discussion
This is the ﬁrst study, to our knowledge, that has utilized a long-term (i.e., eight-week)
between-group intervention using Assisted Cycling Therapy (ACT) in middle-age adults
with DS and measured changes in self-efﬁcacy and exercise perception as measured by the
PASE survey [29]. This is important because when people with Down syndrome are more
conﬁdent and believe that exercise is beneﬁcial, they will be more physically active which
will ultimately improve their overall quality of life.
4.1. Self-Efﬁcacy
Our results are somewhat consistent with our hypotheses that the ACT and VC groups
improved their self-efﬁcacy after an 8-week exercise intervention. Our results showed that
this was signiﬁcant in the VC group and approached conventional levels of signiﬁcance
in the ACT group. The ACT results, however, are consistent with preliminary data from
our lab on adolescents with DS [28]. In our previous study, there were 39 adolescents
with DS between the ages of 9 and 26, and they found more improvements in self-efﬁcacy
following ACT than VC; however, in our study we found larger differences following
VC than ACT. Similarly, a pilot study with seven middle-age adults with DS in our lab
found that self-efﬁcacy improved following an 8-week intervention with ACT, but did
not improve following VC or NC [32]. These results are also consistent with a study
investigating self-esteem following 60 min of a supervised walking program 3x/week,
90 min of yoga 2x/week, or no exercise in low-active older women which found that
both exercise interventions increased the subdomain self-esteem, which after 12 weeks
improved global self-esteem and self-efﬁcacy as it relates to physical activity and body
attractiveness [33]. The Elavsky study demonstrated how an exercise intervention could
positively affect the physical self-esteem of typical low-active older women. In a study
with 174 typical older adults (Mage = 66.7 years), there was indirect support for physical
activity to increase self-efﬁcacy on the physical self-worth and global esteem through the
subdomain of esteem. Furthermore, these positive correlations continued over a 4 year
period [34].
Unlike in the hypothesis, it was found that VC produced a greater increase in self-
efﬁcacy than ACT. One explanation is that when a participant is putting in physical work,
there is effort and energy invested in the process so their belief in their abilities to be
physically active are higher than an ACT participant who had much of the work done for
them by the bike motor. A study conducted by David and colleagues [35] measured the
overall trait self-efﬁcacy, daily state self-efﬁcacy, and daily pedometer measurement from
71 post-menopausal women over 84 days and found that state self-efﬁcacy was a robust
predictor of future physical activity regardless of trait self-efﬁcacy and total steps. This
demonstrates the direct relationship that exerting voluntary effort can contribute to one’s
overall feelings of self-efﬁcacy at the end of a bout of exercise.
4.2. Mechanisms of ACT
Neural plasticity and repair and their effects on cognitive and motor behaviors have
been studied as they relate to ACT exercise. In a study conducted by Alberts and col-
leagues [24], Parkinson’s patients were found to pedal at a faster and a more steady pace
through ACT than through VC. This increased the quality and amount of intrinsic neural
feedback from the muscles to the brain causing neurotrophic factors BDNF, GDNF, and
IGF3 to be released in the brain. These factors relate to neural plasticity and neurogenesis,
both of which would further synaptic connections, thus training muscle habits in partic-
ipants giving us the belief that improvements in cognition are possible. As can be seen
in Figure 3, it has been suggested that these factors of neural plasticity and neurogenesis
may increase learning memory, motor control, and behavioral adaptations [24]. By creating
more nervous tissue and nervous tissue connections, the brain is able to operate at an
increased level of connection.

Figure 3. Model of structure and function responsible for ACT and changes in behaviors.
These connections that are made reach the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (PFC)
in the brain which are predominately responsible for emotion [36]. Consequently, in the
correlation of neurotrophic factors and muscle nerve connection due to assisted cycling,
these factors improve emotion by constructing developments on the amygdala and PFC [24].
Thus, feelings associated with depression and anxiety may be reduced thus resulting in an
increased positive affect and overall emotions of satisfaction or afﬁrmation [24,36]. Positive
affect has been found to be related to increased self-efﬁcacy [15,17,37]. If the neurotrophic
factors discussed in relation to muscle contractions during ACT and VC are acting on the
emotion and affect centers of the brain, this mechanism of increasing positive affect could
explain our resulting improvements in self-efﬁcacy following exercise intervention [15,24].
4.3. Exercise Perception
As previously discussed, the ACT intervention yielded conventional signiﬁcance for
an increase in exercise perception while VC improved with no signiﬁcance and NC yielded
no improvements. It is possible that because the participants in the ACT intervention were
pedaling at such a high cadence from the motor, this caused them to feel as if they were
innately better at exercising. It also caused less fatigue because of the lack of effort in
comparison to those participants who had to voluntarily pedal in the VC group. Exercise
perception improves when one feels that they have feasible accessibility, enough energy
to complete activities, and positive motivation to do so. A study conducted by Sowers
and colleagues [38] measuring the exercise perception and behaviors of individuals with
primary immunodeﬁciency disease (PID) found that participants found exercise to be
feasible and better for mental and physical well-being post intervention. Highly functioning
participants possessed the perception that exercise could not worsen their health or mental
conditions but only improve them. One explanation as to why none of the intervention
groups reached signiﬁcance for this variable could be that the participants came in with
a generally positive attitude and tend to have a positive outlook on opportunities and
situations in other areas of their lives already. This mindset most likely caused high initial
scorings on exercise perception as well as a possible lack of understanding of what exercise
entails and its overall beneﬁts. The positive encouragement, consistency of interaction with
researchers, and community socialization aspects of the intervention could have caused the

Brain Sci. 2023, 13, 1719
9 of 13
improvements in exercise perception that were found post intervention, however, these
improvements were not statistically signiﬁcant.
A possible explanation for lesser improvements in VC than ACT for exercise percep-
tion is that the task might have felt too difﬁcult, making exercise feel less feasible. ACT
participants had to put in minimal effort, making exercise seem more “doable” and pro-
ducing an overall more positive outlook on physical activity while VC participants had
to put on all of the work making their physical ability obstacles more demanding to over-
come. This challenge could be the reason that the VC participants reported lower exercise
perception than ACT participants. Previous research has shown that it is common in more
sedentary individuals for their exercise perception and even self-efﬁcacy to lower after a dif-
ﬁcult bout of exercise of high intensity or longer amount of time [17]. In a study conducted
by Woo and colleagues [18], college students with no intellectual disabilities participated in
low, moderate, and high intensities of exercise protocols. The study measured resulting
positive affect for all exercises compared to baseline. The positive affect was measured by
comparing activation levels of the left and right frontal hemispheres of the brain. Positive
affect as measured by left frontal activity has been found to be correlated with greater
motivation to be physically active [39,40], therefore when the left frontal hemisphere is
greater in activation compared to the right, more feelings of motivation (associated with
the left hemisphere) are present as opposed to avoidance or negativity (associated with the
right hemisphere) [18]. As previously discussed with self-efﬁcacy, the overall activation
of the frontal cortex has shown to improve positive affect, thus improving both exercise
perception associated with the intervention and overall self-efﬁcacy [15,17,37].
Another approach suggests that improvements in self-efﬁcacy for certain tasks could
also play a role in the improvement of exercise perception. This correlation proposes that
positive experiences with exercise might not only increase one’s conﬁdence in their abilities
for that skill (SE), but also help them to perceive the physical task as something doable and
even possibly enjoyable (EP). Self-efﬁcacy is a suggested mechanism for contribution to the
anti-depressive and anxiolytic effects of exercise, thus supporting the idea of this reverse
effect connection [19–21]. A suggested hypothesis could be that an increase in SE after
ACT and VC was not only caused by new brain synaptic connections due to neurotrophic
factors, but also by continuing to gain positive experiences during intervention. These
positive experiences could have been formed by the encouraging environment created by
the researchers. It has been found that people will have higher self-efﬁcacy and perform
better on a task if they are told that the skill is “acquirable” instead of “innate”. Having
researchers involved in the sessions encouraging participants to work their hardest and
commending their improvements likely increased their self-efﬁcacy for cycling as well as
their perception of exercise itself. This overall experience, combining positive encourage-
ment, improvement, and motivation is analogous to telling participants that exercise is
“acquirable” by giving them the skills to feel that progress is attainable and can even be
enjoyable. Researchers provided the same encouragement and support for all participants,
regardless of intervention group. This consistency supports the idea that the encourage-
ment is not a confounding factor that inﬂuenced the participants’ self-efﬁcacy. If it were
a factor, self-efﬁcacy and exercise perception would have improved similarly across ACT
and VC following intervention, however this was not the case.
It has been discovered that sedentary individual’s affect during exercise can predict
their efﬁcacy post-exercise and thus give an indication of their overall likelihood to return to
exercise in the future (exercise perception) [37]. Each time participants came into the inter-
vention lab, their predisposed perception and overall efﬁcacy for the task pre-intervention
was most likely based off of how they felt during and after intervention the previous time.
As this intervention was 8 weeks long, it gave participants the privilege of expectations for
sessions and consistency of growth. If they had positive experiences, regardless of inter-
vention, it is logical that they will come in expecting their experience to be similar to before,
thus increasing exercise perception. Low levels of physical exhaustion during exercise
have been found to be associated with more positive affect produced during exercise, thus

yielding higher levels of post-exercise self-efﬁcacy and future perception of exercise itself
as it pertains to speciﬁc tasks [17]. This even further relates to our gap in improvement
from ACT to VC because the participants in ACT were less physically exhausted than
participants in VC, making it reasonable that their perception of exercise improved slightly
more than the VC intervention group.
4.4. Exercise Intensity
It is important to acknowledge that overall, the difﬁculty and intensity of exercise had
an effect on the participants’ self-efﬁcacy and exercise perception post exercise. A study con-
ducted in our lab by Chen and colleagues [41] researched how 20 min of treadmill affected
different groups with Intellectual disabilities (IDs) including one group of individuals with
DS. The participants rated their exhaustion and contrary to typical people without ID, the
results displayed that populations with ID did not experience the same level of positive
affect following exercise due to the length of time and intensity increase throughout the
exercise. This could be because the exercise was too challenging or physically demanding
to experience increased positive affect, as it has been found that individuals with IDs can
have an increased positive affect after exercise as long as the bout is not too high of a
difﬁculty [18]. Other studies have demonstrated that positive affect can be attained from
exercise in individuals with IDs as long as they are exercising below ventilatory threshold
(VT) which in this population tends to be about 60–70% of their VO2 max [42]. Because the
VC intervention group was pushing themselves to pedal and work hard, they tended to
become more physically fatigued during exercise than the ACT group who did not have
to output much energy due to the motor. As the VC participants experienced exhaustion,
this created negative affect in the brain which could potentially result in a more negative
experience for those individuals and therefore less of an increase in exercise perception than
in ACT. Overall, there seems to be a trend in the research identifying intensity and duration
of exercise as the most prominent variable involved with positive affect ﬂuctuation during
and after exercise.
It has been established that low to moderate intensity of exercise increases affect
in individuals with IDs, and positive affect predicts more positive exercise perception,
thus, this makes ACT a valuable and reliable option for persons with Down
syndrome [15,17,18,37,41,42]. This light intensity solution can continue to improve overall
self-efﬁcacy and exercise perception in individuals with DS and other intellectually dis-
abled individuals. This approach could be used in future studies to determine if there are
similar affects in individuals with other IDs or other chronic illnesses. ACT could also
be used as an alternate track for sedentary individuals or already obese individuals to
introduce exercise as a positive and beneﬁcial experience. Having participants who have
negative past experiences with exercise and low conﬁdence to exercise could beneﬁt from
the encouragement and the lack of effort required to participate in ACT. This may not be a
viable solution for overall lifetime ﬁtness; however, it is a way to build personal self-efﬁcacy
for exercise and to hopefully create new positive experiences that will develop an overall
more positive exercise perception that encourages more motivation within any individual
who participates.
ACT is a universal exercise that can be implemented in a plethora of populations, ages
and ability levels. In the future, aside from solely changing the population, other factors
can be included to improve the overall experience. Previous studies have shown that social
accountability and peer interaction can improve motivation and overall experience with
exercise. Barr & Shields [43] conducted a study with adolescents with Down syndrome that
found that a major contributing factor to their physical activity was engaging in positive
peer interaction during their exercise. A parent from this study shared that this type of
comradery has been shown to encourage her son in the past and is very common within
the DS population. This psychological component as well as other motivating factors could
be added into the program to hopefully heighten self-efﬁcacy and overall perception of
health and physical activity. It is necessary to make adaptations to ﬁt the speciﬁc needs of

those with IDs when it comes to exercise because without them, the individuals will lose
interest and not be consistent enough or even at all to gain the health beneﬁts of exercise.
Improving self-efﬁcacy and exercise perception will not only introduce many opportunities
for physical activity that many people may not have been aware of, but it will encourage
them to be more active, more social, and lead overall healthier lifestyles.
4.5. Limitations
Individuals with DS have several different levels of functionality physically, devel-
opmentally, and mentally. Within the ACT intervention group, the mental age of the
participants ranged from 2.75 to 12.75 years old. This limitation caused a high level of
variance upon pre/post responsiveness and overall intervention participation. These vari-
ances cannot be eliminated from the study, but this is a common occurrence in research
with special populations and maybe in further research there will be a more accurate
way of measuring responses. In addition, the control group was a convenience sample
of participants that could not travel to do the study and while it was a small group, they
had a higher chronological age and a lower mental age. For the purposes of this study,
this group demonstrated that if you do nothing, you gain nothing which was important to
demonstrate. However, future research should have a larger, age-matched control group.
Furthermore, survey results are self-reported causing variability in certainty and com-
prehension between each individual, which can limit the validity of the results. However,
these surveys were designed and validated on persons with DS making them the most
appropriate dependent measures at this time.
5. Conclusions
The results were mostly consistent with the hypothesis that self-efﬁcacy and exercise
perception would improve more after ACT than VC and not at all after NC. For self-efﬁcacy,
ACT trended towards conventional signiﬁcance while VC was statistically signiﬁcant. For
exercise perception, ACT trended towards conventional signiﬁcance while VC was not
signiﬁcant. With these results, eight weeks of moderate exercise via ACT may yield higher
self-efﬁcacy and exercise perception in middle-age adults with DS. For the application
of these results, it is suggested that persons with DS participate in initially easy physical
activity to gain positive experience to encourage them to perceive exercise in an enjoyable
manner and have the conﬁdence in their abilities to complete exercise in the future. This
will only further increase self-efﬁcacy, and will lead these individuals to live more healthy
and autonomous lives. This constant conditioning of positive association with exercise will
motivate them to continue to be more active, seek out opportunities to be more active, and
to believe in themselves to do so. It is important to acknowledge the overall importance
that giving positive experiences and increasing the tendency to exercise for middle-age
individuals with DS who are in desperate need of improving their health is a success even
if it is the slightest amount. Insigniﬁcant statistical results do not mean signiﬁcant positive
changes did not occur in the lives of these people and we ﬁrmly believe that middle-age
adults with DS beneﬁted because of this intervention to exercise alone and to continue
exercises for an overall healthier lifestyle.
