Abstract
Acute demyelinating inflammatory polyneuropathy (AIDP) is the most common type
of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in Europe, following several viral and bacterial
infections. Data on AIDP-patients associated with SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus-2) infec-
tion are scarce. We describe the case of a 54-years-old Caucasian female patient
with typical clinical and electrophysiological manifestations of AIDP, who was
reported positive with PCR for SARS-CoV-2, 3 weeks prior to onset of the neurologi-
cal symptoms. She did not experience a preceding fever or respiratory symptoms, but
a transient loss of smell and taste. At the admission to our neurological department, a
progressive proximally pronounced paraparesis, areflexia, and sensory loss with tin-
gling of all extremities were found, which began 10 days before. The modified Eras-
mus Giullain-Barré Syndrome outcome score (mEGOS) was 3/9 at admission and
1/12 at day 7 of hospitalization. The electrophysiological assessment proved a seg-
mental demyelinating polyneuropathy and cerebrospinal fluid examination showed
an albuminocytologic dissociation. The neurological symptoms improved significantly
during treatment with immunoglobulins. Our case draws attention to the occurrence
of GBS also in patients with COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), who did not
experience respiratory or general symptoms. It emphasizes that SARS-CoV-2 induces
immunological processes, regardless from the lack of prodromic symptoms. However,
it is likely that there is a connection between the severity of the respiratory syn-
drome and further neurological consequences.

BACKGROUND AND AIMS
There is an emerging evidence that SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus-2)
infection could be associated with neurological complications, includ-
ing febril seizures, headache, dizziness, myalgia, as well with encepha-
lopathy, encephalitis, stroke, and acute peripheral nerve diseases.1,2
Neurotropic characteristics of coronavirus have been described in
humans. It enters the CNS through the olfactory bulb due to a nasal
infection, causing inflammation and demyelination which may lead to
transitory loss of smell and taste, occasionally without fever and typi-
cal respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms in infected patients.1
According to Helms et al., 58 of 64 patients with acute respiratory dis-
tress syndrome (ARDS) due to Covid-19 (coronavirus disease 2019),
had neurological symptoms caused by encephalopathy with agitation,
confusion, dysexecutive syndrome, ataxia, and corticospinal tract
signs. MRI of two patients showed single acute ischemic strokes.2

ascending flaccid symmetrical limb paralysis with areflexia, sensory
symptoms and often involvement of the cranial nerves. Typical elec-
trodiagnostic features include signs of segmental demyelination as
temporal dispersion of the compound muscle action potentials
(CMAP) and sensory potentials, prolonged distal motor latencies and
reduced conduction velocity in the demyelinative range as well as
conduction blocks and absent or prolonged F-waves.3
A few patients with demyelinating and axonal type of Guillain-
Barré syndrome have been reported recently, the onset of neurologi-
cal symptoms occurred 5 to 10 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19
with respiratory symptoms.4-8

CASE REPORT
The 54-year-old, Caucasian female patient with an uneventful medical
history was admitted to our neurological department in April 2020 with
an acute, proximally pronounced, moderate, symmetric paraparesis
(Medical Research Council/MRC/scale was 3/5 proximal and 4/5 distal
in the lower extremities). Areflexia, numbness, and tingling of all
extremities were also found, with initial maintained gain ability. These
symptoms began 3 weeks following a positive reverse-transcriptase-
polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) oropharyngeal test for COVID-19 and
were progressing already for 10 days at admission. The test was per-
formed because of her contact to a coronavirus-positive person. She
did not experience fever, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, but
reported about a transient loss of smell and taste 2 weeks before the
GBS
symptoms
occurred.
The
modified
Erasmus
Guillain-Barré
Syndrome outcome score (mEGOS) was 3/9 at admission and 1/12 at
day 7 of hospitalization pointing to a favorable outcome. The general
physical examination was normal, she had no fever and a new PCR-
oropharyngeal test was negative. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assessment
showed an albuminocytologic dissociation with increased protein level
(140 g/L) and normal cell count, immunoassay, and Lyme-serology were
negative. SARS-Cov-2 RNA was not tested in CSF. Standard laboratory
tests (complete blood count, CRP, serum glucose, creatinin, sodium and
potassium level, TSH, creatine kinase, and urine test) and special blood
tests (Campylobacter jejuni serology, HbA1c, ANA, anti-DNA, c-ANCA,
p-ANCA, HIV, serum vitamin B12-level, and serum protein electropho-
resis) were also within the normal range. MRI of the cervical spine and
the chest x-ray examination did not show pathological findings.
Electrophysiological studies were performed using a Nicolet Viking
EMG device. The first electrophysiological evaluation (at admission)
showed significantly prolonged distal motor latencies and temporal dis-
persion of the CMAP of the common peroneal nerve bilaterally
(recorded from the extensor digitorum brevis muscle; Figure 1). Stimu-
lation of the tibial nerves at the ankle elicited normal F-wave latencies
with pathological intermediate latency responses (complex A-waves) on
both sides (Figure 2). Motor nerve conduction studies of the tibial,
median and ulnar nerves and sensory nerve conduction studies of the
median, ulnar, and sural nerves were normal on both sides. Electromy-
ography (EMG) showed no denervation signs. An acute inflammatory
demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy was diagnosed.
Two days after the admission the patient showed a deterioration
of the paraparesis and complained about dysphagia. She received
intravenous immunoglobulin at the dose of 0.4 g/kg/day given over
the course of 5 days which was followed by an almost complete
recovery.
Follow-up
electrophysiological
study
was
performed
14 days after admission, without significant changes in comparison to
previous findings.

INTERPRETATION
Guillain-Barré syndrome is caused by an aberrant autoimmune
response to a preceding infection which evokes a cross-reaction
against gangliosid-components of the peripheral nerves (“molecular
mimicry”) targeting different antigens in the demyelinating and axonal
subtypes of GBS. The most commonly identified precipitants are Cam-
pylobacter
jejuni,
cytomegalovirus
(CMV),
Epstein-Barr
virus,
influenza-A
virus,
Mycoplasma
pneumoniae,
and
Haemophilus
influenzae. Earlier discovered coronavirus-types (SARS-severe acute
respiratory syndrome and MERS-middle east respiratory syndrome)
and Zika virus have been associated with GBS as well.3
SARS-CoV-2 infection causes mostly fever and a severe respira-
tory syndrome, but other organ manifestations (heart, kidney, and gas-
trointestinal
system)
and
neurological
complications
were
also
reported. The actual data indicate that SARS-CoV-2 is capable of
causing an excessive immune reaction with an increased level of cyto-
kines as Interleukin-6 (IL-6), which are produced by activated leuko-
cytes and stimulate the inflammatory cascade leading to extensive
tissue damage. IL-6 plays an important role in multiple organ dysfunc-
tions, which is often fatal for patients with COVID-19.1,2,4,5 It is likely,
that these immunological processes are responsible for the major part
of the organ manifestations, including the neurological complications.
According to the literature it is likely that patients with severe symp-
toms of COVID-19 and rapid clinical deterioration have more risk to
develop serious neurological events.
Nine cases of GBS in patients with COVID-19 have been recently
reported.4-8 All patients had fever and respiratory symptoms 5 to
10 days before the onset of the neurological symptoms, one of them
had ongoing fever and poor general condition. The electrodiagnostic
findings were consistent with an axonal variant of GBS in four out of
nine patients. In four other cases, a demyelinating subtype was found
and in one patient the pathophysiology was not clear. All of them were
treated with immunoglobulins. Toscano et al.4 analyzed the data of five
GBS-patients with COVID-19, admitted to three northern Italian hospi-
tals. Three of them had a preceding anosmia or ageusia. Four patients
still had a positive nasopharyngeal test for SARS-CoV-2 at the onset of
the neurological symptoms. Antiganglioside antibodies were absent in
the three patients who were tested for it. In all the cases, a real-time
polymerase-chain-reaction assay was negative for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF.
Four of five patients had facial weakness and three of them developed
respiratory failure in the course of the GBS, leading to a poor outcome.
Four weeks after treatment, two patients remained in the intensive
care unit and were receiving mechanical ventilation, two were undergo-
ing physical therapy because of severe quadriparesis and only one
could be discharged and was able to walk independently. Regarding to
all nine reported patients in the literature, six had a respiratory failure
and needed mechanical ventilation. It was not clear if the cause of the
respiratory failure was the neuromuscular dysfunction due to GBS or
the preceding severe respiratory infection. Furthermore, Gutiérrez et al.
reported two cases of Miller-Fisher syndrome in COVID-19 patients,
3 to 5 days after onset of fever and general symptoms. Both patients
had ageusia and one of them anosmia. PCR for coronavirus was posi-
tive in oropharyngeal sampling and negative in CSF in these cases. Both
patients recovered completely.9
The clinical and electrophysiological findings of our patient were
consistent with AIDP, however, in contrast to the previously reported
cases, she did not suffer from preceding fever or respiratory

symptoms. Nevertheless, she did suffer from transient anosmia and
ageusia. The clinical course of the GBS in this case was benign as well.
Seemingly, more serious respiratory symptoms in the acute phase
of COVID-19 are associated with a more severe form of GBS, as an
indicator of the intensity of pathological immune response. On the
other hand, the previous respiratory syndrome might aggravate the
GBS-symptoms leading to a worse outcome.
We conclude that GBS occurs also in patients with COVID-19,
who did not experience preceding respiratory symptoms or fever. Fur-
ther studies should be conducted about the connection between early
neurological symptoms as anosmia and ageusia and further neurologi-
cal consequences of COVID-19.
