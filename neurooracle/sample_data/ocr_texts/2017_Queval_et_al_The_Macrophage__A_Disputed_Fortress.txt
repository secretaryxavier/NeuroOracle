Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the etiological agent of human tuberculosis (TB),
has plagued humans for thousands of years. TB still remains a major public health
problem in our era, causing more than 4,400 deaths worldwide every day and killing
more people than HIV. After inhaling Mtb-contaminated aerosols, TB primo-infection
starts in the terminal lung airways, where Mtb is taken up by alveolar macrophages.
Although macrophages are known as professional killers for pathogens, Mtb has
adopted remarkable strategies to circumvent host defenses, building suitable conditions
to survive and proliferate. Within macrophages, Mtb initially resides inside phagosomes,
where its survival mostly depends on its ability to take control of phagosomal processing,
through inhibition of phagolysosome biogenesis and acidiﬁcation processes, and by
progressively getting access to the cytosol. Bacterial access to the cytosolic space is
determinant for speciﬁc immune responses and cell death programs, both required for
the replication and the dissemination of Mtb. Comprehension of the molecular events
governing Mtb survival within macrophages is fundamental for the improvement of
vaccine-based and therapeutic strategies in order to help the host to better defend
itself in the battle against the ﬁerce invader Mtb. In this mini-review, we discuss recent
research exploring how Mtb conquers and transforms the macrophage into a strategic
base for its survival and dissemination as well as the associated defense strategies
mounted by host.

INTRODUCTION
With over a billion deaths in the past 200 years, tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb) likely killed more people than any other infectious disease in the history of
humanity (Paulson, 2013) and remains a major cause of death also in our era. Mtb is responsible
for about 10 millions of new TB cases and 1.8 million deaths in 2015 (WHO, 2016). Estimations
based on immunological tests suggest that about 2 billion people might be latently infected by
Mtb. Statistically, 5–10% of latently infected individuals might then further develop active TB
during their lifetime (Barry et al., 2009). TB primary infection occurs through inhalation of
Mtb-containing aerosol droplets released by contagious individuals. After inhalation, Mtb rapidly
reaches the lung’s alveolar space where it is preferentially taken up by alveolar macrophages
(Armstrong and Hart, 1971; Warner and Mizrahi, 2007). Following macrophage phagocytosis,

mycobacterial invaders deploy an army of factors, which
circumvent macrophage defenses, to escape from macrophage
killing and to replicate within these phagocytes (Ehrt and
Schnappinger, 2009; Cambier et al., 2014). Manipulation of
intracellular macrophage signaling also impacts the cytokine
environment modifying the potency of protective immune
response, setting up a Mtb tolerance by the host and favoring
the intracellular survival of Mtb over time (BoseDasgupta and
Pieters, 2014; Orme et al., 2015). Innate immune responses are
essential for the outcome of TB infection as well as for the
establishment of adaptive immunity (Torrado and Cooper, 2013;
Orme et al., 2015). In lungs, the progressive establishment of
an immune response during Mtb infection notably contributes
to the aggregation of immune cells, forming an organized
structure harboring macrophages at the center, surrounded
by giant cells, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, ﬁbroblast, which is
called a granuloma. A hallmark feature of the bacillus is its
ability to remain concealed within host cells or/and within the
granulomatous caseous necrotic centers, where it can persist
during the long phase of TB latency (Barry et al., 2009).
Establishment of an immune balance, orchestrated by both
mycobacteria and host cells, is decisive for the outcome of the
granuloma, which may either constrain the infection or promote
its systemic dissemination (Ulrichs and Kaufmann, 2006; Davis
and Ramakrishnan, 2009). The development of active pulmonary
TB is tightly linked with a disordered immune balance, resulting
in host’s inability to keep the infection under control (O’Garra
et al., 2013).
The current TB drug regimen generally requires 2-months
of treatment with four ﬁrst-line drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin,
ethambutol, and pyrazinamide followed by 4 months of
treatment with isoniazid and rifampicin (WHO, 2016). However,
the protracted nature of the TB treatment and an inappropriate
patient compliance favor the selection of multidrug resistant
strains (MDR-TB). The more recent emergence of extensively
drug resistant strains (XDR-TB) represents, nowadays, a major
threat (Van Rie and Enarson, 2006; WHO, 2016). Therefore,
new and alternative means to control Mtb are urgently needed.
A better understanding of the fundamental biology of this
complex interaction of the bacterium and the host cell represents
a challenge for the design of new strategies to improve
control of TB.
This mini-review focuses on selected aspects of this host-
pathogen interaction, which shows quite some resemblance to
medieval battlegrounds, where ﬁerce warriors tried to invade
well-equipped fortresses with their weapons and ruses.
MYCOBACTERIAL ARTILLERY
Mycobacterium
tuberculosis
belongs
to
the
phylum
Actinobacteria and is coated by a unique cell envelope, which
represents a remarkably impermeable and hydrophobic armor
(Brennan and Nikaido, 1995) that is composed of a capsule, an
outer membrane, also termed mycomembrane, a peptidoglycan
layer, an arabinogalactan layer, and an inner plasma membrane.
The mycomembrane consists of mycolic acids and selected
extractible
lipids,
including
phthiocerol
dimycocerosates
(abbreviated DIM or PDIM), diacyltrehalose (DAT), and
polyacyltrehalose (PAT) (Chalut, 2016). Additionally, Mannosyl-
phosphatidyl-myo-inositol-based glycolipids (PIM) and related
lipoglycans such as lipomannan (LM) and lipoarabinomannan
(LAM) are also abundantly present in the Mtb cell envelope as
well as in the inner and outer membranes (Daﬀe et al., 2014). To
ensure protein transport across this unusual cell envelope Mtb
uses diﬀerent secretion systems, some of which are also widely
present in other bacteria, such as the general Sec systems and
the Twin Arginine Translocation (TAT) pathway, whereas others
are exclusively present in mycobacteria and in some distantly
related versions in other species within the phyla Actinobacteria
and Firmicutes. These latter systems are called ESX secretion
systems (Gröschel et al., 2016) and are also known as Type
VII secretion (T7S) systems (Abdallah et al., 2007). The Mtb
genome carries 5 esx loci, which encode for 5 distinct systems
(ESX-1-ESX-5). The molecular architecture of a representative
ESX model (ESX-5 of Mycobacterium xenopi) was recently
determined at 13Å resolution by electron microscopy (Beckham
et al., 2017). This work showed four core proteins of the ESX-5
complex (EccB5, EccC5, EccD5, and EccE5), which assembled
with equimolar stoichiometry into an oligomeric complex that
displays sixfold symmetry (Beckham et al., 2017). Among the
ESX systems, the esx-1 locus is probably the most studied as it
encodes the 6 kDa Early Secretory Antigenic Target (ESAT-6;
EsxA) and the 10 kDa Culture Filtrate Protein (CFP-10; EsxB),
considered as key virulence determinants of Mtb as well as strong
T-cell antigens (Gröschel et al., 2016). Recent work has shown
a concerted action of the ESX-1 secretion system of Mtb with
DIM/PDIM in phagosomal rupture, leading to access of Mtb to
the cytosol of the host macrophage (Augenstreich et al., 2017),
a phenomenon recently discussed from diﬀerent perspectives
(Russell, 2016; Simeone et al., 2016) and described further below.
DOORWAYS OF Mtb TO ENTER INTO
MACROPHAGES
Interaction of Mtb with phagocytic cells mostly occurs through
the recognition of Pathogen-Associated Molecular Patterns
(PAMP) present at the bacterial surface by Pattern Recognition
Receptors (PRRs) of the host cell such as Toll-Like Receptors
(TLR), C-type Lectin Receptors (abbreviated as CLR or CTL),
Fc Receptors (FcR), Scavenger Receptors (SR), and cytosolic
DNA sensors (Satoh and Akira, 2016). Stimulation of PRRs leads
to bacterial phagocytosis, the initiation of immune responses
as well as the activation of numerous cellular processes such
as apoptosis, antigen processing/presentation, inﬂammasome
activation, phagosome maturation, and autophagy (Lugo-
Villarino et al., 2011; Mortaz et al., 2015). The interaction
between TLR and Mtb leads to phagocyte activation without
immediate ingestion of mycobacteria. Recognition of speciﬁc
mycobacterial structures, such as lipoproteins 19 kDa, LM,
LAM, and PIM was reported to be established by TLR2
(Quesniaux et al., 2004), which is consistent with observations
that TLR2-mediated recognition is diminished by the presence

M. tuberculosis and the Macrophage
of Lipooligosaccharide (LOS) in Mycobacterium canettii, the
smooth variant of tubercle bacilli (Boritsch et al., 2016). It is
noteworthy that loss of LOS production during the evolution
of tuberculosis-causing mycobacteria has resulted in the rough
colony morphology of Mtb strains, which apparently contributed
to stronger recognition of Mtb by TLR2 (Boritsch et al., 2016).
Moreover, unmethylated CpG motifs in bacterial DNA were
reported to be recognized by TLR9 (Baﬁca et al., 2005). These
events induce a signaling cascade by stimulation of Myeloid
Diﬀerentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) leading to
activation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors, such
as the Nuclear transcription Factor NF-κB and activation of the
innate host defense such as the production of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines.
CLR/CTL
are
a
family
of
membrane-bound
calcium-
dependent receptors that recognize carbohydrate-rich molecules.
Among the CLR family, one of the most well-known receptors
is the Mannose Receptor (MR), which recognizes mannose
molecules/glycolipids
present
on
Mtb’s
surface
such
as
LAM, ManLAM, and PIM. Stimulation through MR induces
production of anti-inﬂammatory cytokines and fails to activate
oxidative responses (Nigou et al., 2001). Previous studies have
shown that phagocytosis of mannosylated beads and/or MR-
ManLAM interferes with phagosome maturation, highlighting
the potential role of glycolipids in the intracellular survival of
mycobacteria (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 1999; Kang et al., 2005).
A recent analysis of SNPs in the MRC1 gene within a Chinese
population has suggested a possible association of selected SNPs
and the susceptibility of individuals to pulmonary TB (Zhang
et al., 2012). Moreover, Mincle, Dectin-1 and -2, and Dendritic
Cell immunoActivating Receptor (DCAR) also belong to the
CLR sub-family and represent probably the most well-known
CLR expressed on macrophages. The Mincle receptor speciﬁcally
recognizes mycobacterial cord factor Trehalose-6,6-dimycolate
(TDM), which likely represents the most abundant glycolipid
in the mycobacterial cell wall (Ishikawa et al., 2009). Ligation of
TDM to Mincle induces several responses such as production of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, generation of Th1/Th17 immune
responses and induction of granuloma-genesis (Ishikawa et al.,
2009; Mishra et al., 2017). It is known that Dectin-1 recognizes
β-glucans in fungal pathogens but the precise Mtb’s PAMP is
not known (Dinadayala et al., 2004). It has been showed that
Dectin-1 is important for the innate immunity recognition of
Mtb and for inducing Th1 and Th17 responses, independently
of TLR2 recognition (van de Veerdonk et al., 2010). Dectin-2
has been recently shown to induce host immune responses
against Mtb infection through the recognition of ManLAM
(Yonekawa et al., 2014). DCAR recognizes PIM to induce Th1
responses during Mtb infection (Toyonaga et al., 2016). One
other particular CRL/CTL, named DCSIGN/CD209, expressed
by dendritic cells and macrophages recognizes conserved sugar
motifs in a number of viruses, parasites, and bacteria, including
Mtb (Tailleux et al., 2003; Tanne and Neyrolles, 2010).
Fc receptors and Complement Receptor (CR) are strongly
expressed on surface of macrophages. CR3 plays a key role in
the phagocytosis of Mtb by macrophages with recognition of Mtb
polysaccharides or PIM (Villeneuve et al., 2005).
Scavenger Receptors are expressed on the cell surface
of mammalian monocytes and macrophages and recognized
oxidized or acetylated lipoproteins. During Mtb infections, the
Macrophage Receptor with Collagenous (MARCO) structure is
the most studied. MARCO recognizes TDM and cooperates with
TLR2 to induce the activation of the transcriptional factor NF-κB
and secretion of pro-inﬂammatory cytokines (Bowdish et al.,
2009).
Finally, cytosolic DNA sensors have also been described as
PRR, which can recognize the presence of mycobacterial DNA
in the cytosol (Manzanillo et al., 2012). This process is dependent
on phagosomal rupture induced by ESX-1 and is mediated via
the cytosolic sensors cGAS or AIM2 (Collins et al., 2015; Majlessi
and Brosch, 2015; Wassermann et al., 2015; Watson et al., 2015;
Figure 1).
Mtb STRATEGIES TO CONQUER
MACROPHAGES
Strategy 1: Interference with Phagosome
Maturation
Macrophages are acting as the ﬁrst line of defense against
pathogenic invaders. After internalization, pathogens are trapped
in a vacuole called phagosome, which immediately undergoes
sequential fusion events to acquire microbicidal and degrading
characteristics by a process called maturation. The dynamic of
phagosome maturation is actively regulated by the network of
Rab GTPases, proteins that sequentially drive the phagosome
progression from early to later stages of maturation. Rab GTPases
(Rab) contribute to the identity of the endosomal organelle
(e.g., Rab5, early endosomes; Rab7, late endosome), regulating
membrane-fusion events but also the sorting of protein and lipids
through the recycling pathway (Gruenberg and van der Goot,
2006; Gutierrez, 2013; Prashar et al., 2017). Thus, all along the
usual maturation process, biological changes of the phagosome
are characterized by the speciﬁc recruitment of Rab GTPase until
the ﬁnal fusion with lysosomes, which carry a set of hydrolytic
enzymes that contribute to pathogen clearance. Recently other
regulators of the phagosomal maturation, Rab34, Rab20, and
the proneurotropin receptor sortilin, have been described as
important for control and elimination of intracellular Mtb
(Kasmapour et al., 2012; Vazquez et al., 2016; Schnettger et al.,
2017). Concurrently with the maturation process, the pH of
phagosomes quickly drops from neutral to 5, through a high
activity of a vesicular proton-pump ATPase (H+ V-ATPase)
(Russell et al., 2009). Phagosomal acidiﬁcation is a prerequisite
for intracellular bacterial clearance, as acidic pH is essential
for the optimal activity of lysosomal digestive enzymes and for
reactive oxygen species production (Vieira et al., 2002; Sun-
Wada et al., 2009). All along common traﬃcking pathways
within macrophages, pathogens have to face multiple dangers
such as exposure to cytosolic pattern recognition or danger
receptors. The cytosolic lectin, Galectin8, notably recognizes
damaged pathogen-containing vacuoles (including Mtb damaged
phagosomes), and promotes their elimination by activating

M. tuberculosis and the Macrophage
FIGURE 1 | Working model for selected components intervening in the immune subversion strategies of Mtb as well as macrophage factors that contribute to host
defense. In green: bacterial factors; in black: macrophage factors. Interaction of Mtb with macrophage PRRs triggers bacteria internalization. The ﬁrst strategy of Mtb
to conquer macrophages is to inhibit phagosome maturation and acidiﬁcation through the expression or secretion of bacterial factors (LAM, SapM, PtpA) or by
subverting host pathways such as TACO or CISH signaling. Bacteria then progressively access to the cytosol through the action of the ESX-1 secretion system and
DIM/PDIM. When in contact with the cytosol, bacteria get targeted by ubiquitin ligases (Parkin, Smurf1) and/or activate speciﬁc cytosolic recognition pathways (gal8,
cGAS, or AIM2). This latter step induces expression of type I IFN, activation of the NRLP3 inﬂammasome and initiation of autophagy. Lastly, cytosolic Mtb induces
host cell death programs (apoptosis and necrosis) to enhance its dissemination.
anti-bacterial autophagy (Thurston et al., 2012; Figure 1).
Additionally, Ubiquitin ligases Parkin, Ubiquilin1, and Smurf1
recognize intracellular Mtb and enhance its clearance through an
ubiquitin-mediated autophagy pathway (Manzanillo et al., 2013;
Sakowski et al., 2015; Figure 1).
To survive in this harsh environment, Mtb developed a wide
range of strategies to counteract macrophages defenses. Mtb
indeed triggers rapid interferences in phagosome functions by
inhibiting the phagolysosome biogenesis. Unless the macrophage
is activated by inﬂammatory cytokines, the mycobacterial
vacuole fails to mature along the normal endocytic pathway,
and retains features typical of an immature endosome. Just
after macrophage uptake, mycobacterial phagosome transitory
recruits early endosomal markers Rab5 and remains accessible to
the marker of recycling endosome Rab11 (Via et al., 1997; Tailleux
et al., 2003; Vergne et al., 2004). In addition, Coronin1, also called
TACO, is reported to be recruited and retained at the phagosomal
surface where it activates calcium–calcineurin signaling to
block the fusion of lysosomes with mycobacterial phagosomes
(Jayachandran et al., 2007; Figure 1). Consistent with these
immature characteristics, this organelle lacks the late endosomal
and lysosomal markers Rab7 and CD63, as well as mature
and active forms of various lysosomal hydrolases, including
cathepsin D (Clemens and Horwitz, 1995; Via et al., 1997;
Ullrich et al., 1999). Both bacterial ManLAM and the secreted
phosphatase SapM have been shown to inhibit the activity of
membrane traﬃcking regulatory lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-
phosphate (PI3P), impairing the phagosomal acquisition of the
lysosomal cargo and the delivery of hydrolytic enzyme from the
Golgi network (Fratti et al., 2001, 2003; Vergne et al., 2005;
Figure 1).
Blockade of phagosomal acidiﬁcation is also a key feature
for the intracellular survival of pathogens. Consistently, Mtb has
developed at least three diﬀerent strategies aiming to inhibit H+
V-ATPase complex assembly and its subsequent fusion with the
phagosomal membrane in order to stabilize the phagosomal pH
between 6.2 and 6.5 (Sturgill-Koszycki et al., 1994). Indeed, the
phosphatase PtpA secreted by Mtb inhibits the assembly of H+
V-ATPase machinery by direct interaction with the subunits H
of this complex (Wong et al., 2011). Additionally, interaction
of TDM with C-type lectin receptor Mincle has been shown to
delay phagosomal maturation and acidiﬁcation (Axelrod et al.,
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org

Queval et al.
M. tuberculosis and the Macrophage
2008; Patin et al., 2017). As parallel mechanism, we recently
reported that Mtb depletes H+ V-ATPase from its phagosome by
co-opting the function of a host immune regulator, i.e., cytokine-
inducible SH2 containing protein (CISH), which selectively
targets the H+ V-ATPase subunit A for ubiquitination and
degradation by the proteasome (Queval et al., 2017; Figure 1).
The control of the pH is decisive not only for the survival of
Mtb but also for the further processing of the mycobacterial
phagosome. Indeed, early blockade of the acidiﬁcation process is
a pre-requisite for the ESX-1 dependent phagosomal rupture and
the access of Mtb to the cytosol of the macrophage (Simeone et al.,
2015).
Strategy 2: Getting Access to the Cytosol
The intracellular localization of Mtb inside host cells has been
studied since the 1970s. The seminal work of Armstrong and
Hart (1971) showed in mouse peritoneal macrophages that were
infected with viable or non-viable Mtb and BCG strains that
mycobacteria can be observed by electron microscopy (EM)
inside phagosomes that have blocked the phagosome–lysosome
fusion (Armstrong and Hart, 1971). In following years, further
EM studies also observed Mtb outside the phagosome under
certain conditions (Leake et al., 1984; Myrvik et al., 1984;
McDonough et al., 1993), whereas others could not observe
mycobacteria in the cytosol by EM (Xu et al., 1994). Some of
these disparities were thought to have been caused by diﬀerences
in the EM conditions and protocols used. More recently,
using sophisticated cryo-immunogold EM, van der Wel et al.
(2007) have challenged the dogma of the exclusive intracellular
localization of Mtb and have described the existence of cytosolic
Mtb in THP-1 human macrophage-like cells at 4 days post-
infection whereas the BCG strain did not show such a distribution
(van der Wel et al., 2007; Houben et al., 2012). This result
has been correlated with the function of the ESX/T7S system
in Mtb, which is absent from BCG due to the ESX-1 deletion.
However, given the situation that the suggested paradigm shift
was entirely based on ultrastructural observations generated by
electron microscopy, the presence of Mtb in the cytosol has
remained controversial for some time. The development of a
Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) for detection
of mycobacteria that have ruptured the phagosome and have
established cytosolic contact has been an important advance to
study this delicate and fascinating question (Simeone et al., 2012,
2015). For that purpose, host cells are loaded with a chemical
probe that is sensitive to FRET changes based on β-lactamase
activity present on the surface of bacteria. The use of this
FRET-based technology combined with automated ﬂuorescent
microscopy (Simeone et al., 2012) and multicolor quantitative
cytoﬂuorometry allowed to explore the role of ESX-1 in the
induction of phagosomal rupture and more recently to show that
Mtb induces phagosomal rupture in vivo (Simeone et al., 2015;
Figure 1).
Based on the results from diﬀerent groups using independent
techniques, it thus became clear that the ESX-1/T7S system
plays a primordial role for establishing cytosolic access of
selected mycobacteria in host cells (van der Wel et al., 2007;
Houben et al., 2012; Simeone et al., 2012, 2015). However,
very recently, in independent studies, additional mycobacterial
factors have been identiﬁed that favor the access of Mtb to
the cytosol. Indeed, it was found that cytosolic access of
Mtb only occurs when the production and the export of the
outer membrane lipids (DIM/PDIM) are intact (Augenstreich
et al., 2017). DIM/PDIM are key virulent lipids and play
important roles in host-pathogen interaction. Their presence
favors intracellular bacterial replication through arrest of
phagosomal acidiﬁcation by excluding the vacuolar proton-
ATPase from the phagosomal membrane (Astarie-Dequeker
et al., 2009) and they are also involved in the death of
macrophages (Passemar et al., 2014). The use of monoclonal
antibodies against Galectin-3 and ubiquitinated proteins for
identiﬁcation of damaged phagosomal-membranes (Wong and
Jacobs, 2011), in parallel to a FRET-based cytoﬂuorometric
approach for detection of phagosomal rupture, demonstrated the
implication of DIM/PDIM in phagosomal rupture (Figure 1).
This study showed that both the ESX-1 system and a functional
DIM/PDIM production were required to cause phagosomal
damage and rupture, which ultimately leads to host cell death
(Augenstreich et al., 2017). The implication of DIM/PDIM
in this phenomenon has independently been conﬁrmed by a
study that investigated the DNA interaction and the regulon
of a transcriptional repressor (Rv3167c), which was found to
control the DIM/PDIM operon and to impact phagosomal
escape (Quigley et al., 2017). Additional conﬁrmation came
from a third study that carried out a multiparametric analysis,
combining pathogen and host phenotypes, and found similar
proﬁles for ESX-1 and DIM/PDIM loss-of-function mutants
(Barczak et al., 2017). Phospholipases have been described to
play a role in the escape of the bacteria from phagosome to
cytosol by acting together with pore-forming proteins such as
listeriolysin from Listeria monocytogenes (Cossart, 2011). The
Mtb genome presents four phospholipases PlcA-D, whereby
in the reference strain Mtb H37Rv PlcD has already been
naturally inactivated by an IS6110-mediated deletion (Cole
et al., 1998). The use of FRET-based cytoﬂuorometry, however,
showed that Plcs of Mtb do not seem to play a role in the
phagosomal rupture as triple/quadruple Plc deletion mutants
continued to generate positive signals in the phagosomal
rupture assay, similar to wild-type strains (Le Chevalier et al.,
2015).
Few studies report data on the implication of host factors
involved in the induction of phagosomal rupture. A ﬁrst result
was obtained by the use of the FRET-cytoﬂuorometry approach
for the study of Mtb infection in macrophages carrying a
non-functional nramp gene, encoding the Natural Resistance-
Associated Macrophage Protein (Nramp-1), a phagosomal
bivalent
cation
transporter
implicated
in
phagosomal
acidiﬁcation and pH regulation (Simeone et al., 2015). This
approach showed that initial blockage of the acidiﬁcation of
the phagosome is necessary to allow bacteria to survive and
to induce phagosomal rupture (Simeone et al., 2015). Another
host element that has been suggested in this context is the
cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2). This enzyme plays a critical
role in both phagosomal traﬃcking and export of cargo from
the various endocytic comportments and permeabilizes the

M. tuberculosis and the Macrophage
endosomal membrane in Mtb-infected macrophages (Lee et al.,
2011). Treatment of Mtb-infected macrophages with an inhibitor
of this enzyme induces a marked reduction of cytosolic bacteria
as observed by EM (Jamwal et al., 2016).
Cytosolic contact of Mtb thus seems to be fundamental in
mycobacterial host-pathogen interaction, inﬂuencing both the
fate of the host cell and the bacteria. Indeed, the recognition
of mycobacteria-associated patterns by the cytosolic receptors of
the innate immunity determines innate and adaptive immune
responses (Gröschel et al., 2016). Following steps exist: (i) DNA
is sensed by cGAS, which synthesizes the second messenger
cGAMP from ATP and GTP. cGAMP activates the Endoplasmic
Reticulum (ER) associates Stimulator of IFN Genes (STING)
and downstream TBK-1-IRF-3-IFN-β signaling axis (Figure 1).
This eﬀect leads to the expression of type I IFNs, such as
IFN-α/β, which are thought to be disadvantageous to the host
during Mtb infection, (ii) the cytosolic Mtb DNA may be
sensed by AIM-2, which contributes partially to the activation
of the NRLP3 inﬂammasome axis and release of mature IL-
1β and IL-18 (Collins et al., 2015; Wassermann et al., 2015;
Watson et al., 2015; Kupz et al., 2016), and (iii) the ESX-1-
mediated cytosolic translocation of mycobacterial DNA results
in the activation of TBK-1 which initiates the recruitment
of LC3-II involved in autophagic activity (Romagnoli et al.,
2012; Watson et al., 2012; Figure 1). The last two points,
in contrast to the ﬁrst one, might be considered as more
beneﬁcial for the host. Thus, during infection, diﬀerent and
sometimes opposite responses govern the balance between the
beneﬁt for the mycobacteria and for the host. Nonetheless,
during the infectious process mycobacteria are not necessarily
constrained within the host cells, and may escape from the
microbicidal environment of macrophages by disseminating
inside the organism. It has been notably reported in the Zebra
ﬁsh model that Mycobacterium marinum membrane Phenolic
Glycolipids (PGL) trigger a STING-dependent secretion of
monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1; also called CCL2)
by infected-resident macrophages, resulting in the recruitment of
circulating monocytes and a subsequent transfer of the bacteria
from tissue resident- to circulating macrophages (Cambier et al.,
2017).
Finally, in the context of vaccination, the induction of ESX-1-
mediated cytosolic responses seems to be beneﬁcial for increased
protective eﬃcacy provided by recombinant BCG strains over
parental BCG strains (Kupz et al., 2016; Groschel et al., 2017).
Strategy 3: The Control of Host Cell
Death
The control of host cell death allows Mtb to escape host defenses
and to take the power on the pathogenesis control. For decades,
host cell death upon Mtb-infection has been controversial and
apoptosis cell death was considered as the only programmed cell
death. Two main types of cell death are known for elimination
of infected cells: (i) apoptosis or programmed cell death and (ii)
necrosis.
(i) From a morphological point of view, apoptosis is deﬁned
by plasma membrane bleeding, cell body shrinkage,
nuclear condensation and fragmentation, and formation
of apoptotic bodies, which are membrane-bound cell
fragments rapidly phagocytosed by neighboring cells
and resident phagocytes (Lamkanﬁand Dixit, 2010).
From a biochemical point of view, apoptosis induces a
decrease in mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential,
activation of selective proteases, cleavage of chromosomal
DNA, and various cellular proteins and translocation of
phosphatidylserine from the inner to the outer plasma
membrane (Behar et al., 2011). Apoptosis does occur
via TNF-α activation and caspase 3 and 8 activation.
Suppression of inﬂammation allows to limit tissue damage.
Apoptosis of infected cells is considered as a beneﬁt for
the host. Indeed, it allows elimination of a favorable
environment for replication of the pathogen, and provides
an important source of bacterial antigens that can
stimulate Mtb-speciﬁc T-cell immunity (Behar et al., 2011).
Apoptosis has been directly linked to an increase CD8+
T-cell response via cross-presentation and enhances class II
MHC-restricted antigen presentation (Behar et al., 2011).
Some Mtb genes have been reported to play a role
in the inhibition or induction of host cell death, as
for example sodA, encoding superoxide dismutase A, or
nuoG, encoding the NADH dehydrogenase 1 subunit G
(Velmurugan et al., 2007; Gengenbacher et al., 2016). An
Mtb gene well known for inducing host cell death is
esxA, encoding EsxA, which has been described as a pro-
apoptotic (Aguilo et al., 2013). The exact role of EsxA in
this process remains unclear, but most probably it is the
contribution to the access of Mtb to the host cytosol, which
plays a main role. However, while the biological role of
the ESX-1 system in the process remains fully valid, the
function of recombinant EsxA as a putative membranolytic
molecule was recently questioned, as the lytic activity of
EsxA preparations expressed and puriﬁed from Escherichia
coli lysates on red blood cells continued even after digestion
with proteinase K, suggesting that some of the previously
described pore-forming activity might be simply caused by
a selected detergent used during the protein puriﬁcation
process (Conrad et al., 2017). Further studies are needed
to clarify the role of EsxA in the process.
(ii) In contrast to apoptosis, necrosis is characterized by loss
of plasma membrane integrity, cytoplasmic organelles
swelling such as mitochondria and cell nuclei, release
of cytoplasmic and nuclear contents to the extracellular
space, hydrolysis of chromatin and DNA and is caspase-
independent cell death (Lamkanﬁand Dixit, 2010). It was
previously thought that virulent Mtb inhibits apoptosis and
triggers necrosis to evade innate immunity and thus to
delay the initiation of adaptive immunity. On the contrary,
attenuated Mtb induces macrophage apoptosis, which
reduces bacterial viability (Behar et al., 2010). However,
from diﬀerent recent studies, it can be hypothesized that
apoptosis induced by virulent Mtb favors dissemination of
bacilli (Aguilo et al., 2013; Augenstreich et al., 2017), while
necrosis tends to enhance bacterial replication (Dallenga
et al., 2017; Lerner et al., 2017).

Queval et al.
M. tuberculosis and the Macrophage
Colonization of macrophages by Mtb is a highly disputed
process that depends on the ability of the pathogen to escape
from macrophage killing and the capacity of the macrophages to
control the bacterial proliferation.
PERSPECTIVES
It is clear that the interaction of Mtb with the macrophage
has major impact on the outcome of infection, whereby both
mycobacterial and host factors play important roles. The
accumulated vast knowledge in recent years on this process
might also turn out as important for developing potential new
strategies in the ﬁght against TB, concerning vaccines and host-
directed therapies. For example, BCG complemented with the
functional ESX-1 system of Mtb showed better eﬃcacy to protect
against disseminated TB in mice and guinea pigs (Pym et al.,
2003; Kupz et al., 2016). However, this recombinant strain named
BCG::RD1 has also been shown to be more virulent than the wild-
type BCG strain (Pym et al., 2002). As one possibility to reduce
this enhanced virulence, introduction of selected mutations in
the esxA gene of the cloned ESX-1 locus have shown some
eﬀect (Bottai et al., 2015). Alternatively, the use of an ESX-1
secretion system taken from a less virulent mycobacterium than
Mtb for the complementation of BCG seems also promising.
Indeed, recombinant BCG expressing the ESX-1 system from
Mycobacterium marinum, BCG::ESX-1Mmar, has been recently
shown to be low virulent and more protective than parental BCG
strains in diﬀerent murine models of infection (Groschel et al.,
2017). This strain enhances NLRP3 inﬂammasome activation and
induces type I IFN production and stronger CD8+ and CD4+
T-cell responses (Groschel et al., 2017).
Using attenuated live Mtb strains as vaccines is another
alternative approach, presenting the advantage that these
strains naturally carry genetic regions encoding for important
immunodominant antigens that might be absent from BCG in
combination with suﬃcient safety, provided by the introduction
of deletions in virulence genes. The live-attenuated MTBVAC is a
good example (Aguilo et al., 2017). MTBVAC attenuation is based
on two independent stable genetic deletions, without antibiotic
resistance markers, introduced into phoP and fadD26, aﬀecting
the production and secretion of selected lipidic and proteic
virulence factors of Mtb. MTBVAC presents promising features
in preclinical animal models and is presently being evaluated in
a phase I clinical trial in newborns in South Africa (Marinova
et al., 2017). Other attenuated Mtb strain, presently in preclinical
development with promising results in murine infection models,
is the Mtb1ppe25-pe19 strain, in which selected PE and PPE
proteins of the ESX-5 secretion system have been deleted, but
which retains an intact ESX-1 secretion system (Bottai et al., 2012;
Sayes et al., 2012, 2016).
Concerning drug treatment of TB, most of the drugs used
today date from the 1950s to 1960s, with a few exceptions, such
as bedaquiline, a recently discovered ATP synthase inhibitor
(Andries et al., 2005) that is currently used successfully
in drug regimens against MDR-TB (Diacon et al., 2009).
However, additional identiﬁcation of new active anti-TB drugs
is urgently needed. In this perspective, it should be mentioned
that remarkable progress has been made in developing new
screening approaches that can simultaneously evaluate the anti-
bacterial potency and the non-cytotoxic properties of small
molecule inhibitors in the intracellular environment of Mtb-
infected macrophages (Christophe et al., 2009; Pethe et al., 2013;
VanderVen et al., 2015). Moreover, targeting of mycobacterial
virulence factors might also be a possibility to ﬁnd alternative
treatment approaches (Chen et al., 2010; Bottai et al., 2014). As
one example, screening of a compound library recently allowed
molecules to be identiﬁed that target the ESX-1 secretion system
of Mtb (Rybniker et al., 2014) and/or the global two-component
regulator PhoP/R which among many other virulence factors also
regulates ESX-1-mediated secretion (Johnson et al., 2015).
Host-directed therapy (HDT) to treat TB is a relatively new
and promising concept that starts to arouse a great interest from
the scientiﬁc community. Instead of targeting Mtb compounds
directly, HDT targets the host response, such as the modulation
of host inﬂammatory pathways to reduce inﬂammation and lungs
tissue damages, augmenting cellular anti-microbial mechanisms.
In the case of TB-HIV co-infection, HDT may reduce the risk
of interaction with antiretroviral drugs. In the case of MDR or
XDR-TB, HDT could be added to anti-TB treatment to increase
the capacity of the host system to eliminate mycobacteria or
to limit tissue damage due to the infection (Wallis and Hafner,
2015; Zumla et al., 2015). For instance, in association with
anti-TB drugs, statins, a family of inhibitors of HMG-CoA
reductase, originally used to lower cholesterol levels in patients,
drastically enhance the eﬃcacy of ﬁrst-line TB treatments in
macrophages and in vivo models (Lobato et al., 2014; Parihar
et al., 2014; Skerry et al., 2014). Moreover, Vitamin D treatment
has been suggested to promote the expression anti-microbial
peptide Cathelicidin by macrophages, and thus lowering of the
intracellular survival of Mtb (Liu et al., 2006; Wheelwright et al.,
2014).
Some HDTs are in clinical human trials or preclinical
animal studies, such as anti-inﬂammatory therapies, modulation
of inﬂammation by phosphodiesterase inhibitors, eicosanoid
modulation, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs, high-dose
vitamin D application, alteration of lipid metabolism, as well
as new HDT that targets autophagy (Tobin, 2015). Autophagy
appears to be a promising pathway to target for the development
of drugs. Interestingly, anti-mycobacterial activities of both
statins and Cathelicidin have been correlated with their ability to
enhance the autophagy pathway (Yuk et al., 2009; Hoyer-Hansen
et al., 2010; Parihar et al., 2014). As such, HDT opens new avenues
for individualized TB therapies.
CONCLUSION
We have discussed a selection of amazing strategies of Mtb
and host cells in their battle about survival and death in host-
pathogen interaction that remains a highly interesting research
domain. Driven by an advancing technical progress, many new
insights were obtained in recent years and have often led to
changes in long-lasting hypotheses and theories, a ﬁnding which
