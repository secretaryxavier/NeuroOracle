Abstract
Borrelia burgdorferi, the agent of Lyme disease, has cholesterol and cholesterol-glycolipids that are essential for bacterial
fitness, are antigenic, and could be important in mediating interactions with cells of the eukaryotic host. We show that the
spirochetes can acquire cholesterol from plasma membranes of epithelial cells. In addition, through fluorescent and
confocal microscopy combined with biochemical approaches, we demonstrated that B. burgdorferi labeled with the
fluorescent cholesterol analog BODIPY-cholesterol or 3H-labeled cholesterol transfer both cholesterol and cholesterol-
glycolipids to HeLa cells. The transfer occurs through two different mechanisms, by direct contact between the bacteria and
eukaryotic cell and/or through release of outer membrane vesicles. Thus, two-way lipid exchange between spirochetes and
host cells can occur. This lipid exchange could be an important process that contributes to the pathogenesis of Lyme
disease.

Introduction
Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease [1,2], is
unusual among prokaryotes in that in addition to phosphatidyl-
choline, phosphatidylglycerol [3–7] and many different lipopro-
teins [4,5,8–10], it has free cholesterol and cholesterol-glycolipids
in its outer membrane (OM). The glycolipids of B. burgdorferi are
mono-a-galactosyl-diacylglycerol (MGalD), which does not con-
tain cholesterol; cholesteryl-b-D-galacto-pyranoside (CGal); and
cholesteryl 6-O-acyl-b-D-galactopyranoside, or cholesteryl 6-O-
palmitoyl-b-D-galactopyranoside (ACGal/Bb-GL-1), which con-
tain cholesterol [3,11–14]. The cholesterol-glycolipids constitute a
significant
portion,
45%
[11],
of
the
total
lipid
content
[3,5,12,13,15–18]. B. burgdorferi does not have the biosynthetic
ability to synthesize cholesterol or any long-chain-saturated and
unsaturated fatty acids that are required for growth [6]. As a
result, the lipid composition of B. burgdorferi reflects that of the
culture medium or host animal fluids or tissues [6]. Furthermore, it
has been hypothesized that in addition to the activity of
galactosyltransferase bb0454, other uncharacterized spirochetal
transferases could be responsible for constructing the cholesterol-
glycolipids [18]. Important to the pathogenesis of B. burgdorferi,
ACGal, and to a lesser extent MGalD and CGal, are antigenic
[13,15–17,19].
These
glycolipids
induce
antibody
responses
throughout all stages of Lyme disease, being most prominent in
the late stages [9,11,12,20,21]. Additionally, we demonstrated that
antibodies to the cholesterol-glycolipids cross-react with host
gangliosides and antibodies to the gangliosides cross-react with
the glycolipids [22,23]. Borrelia lipid antigens can also be presented
in the context of CD1d on NKT cells [24–29].
Using ultrastructural, biochemical, and biophysical analysis, we
previously determined that the cholesterol-glycolipids in the OM
of B. burgdorferi are constituents of eukaryotic-like lipid raft domains
[30]. In eukaryotic cell membranes, lipid rafts are microdomains
that are rich in sterols, sphingolipids, and phospholipids with
saturated acyl tails that allow for tight packing of these lipids into
ordered domains [31,32]. These cholesterol-rich domains segre-
gate from the disordered membrane domains that contain mostly
unsaturated lipids [31,33]. In addition to the enrichment of
specific lipids, lipid-anchored proteins such as glycosyl phospha-
tidylinositol (GPI) proteins and proteins covalently linked to
saturated acyl chains are targeted to lipid rafts [34]. Lipid rafts are
important for the segregation of plasma membrane proteins [31–
33,35–38], and contribute to endocytosis, exocytosis, vesicle
formation, and budding [39–43]. Furthermore, lipid rafts have
been identified as important platforms in cell signaling [33].
The presence of free cholesterol and cholesterol-glycolipids with
saturated acyl chains in B. burgdorferi creates an opportunity for
lipid-lipid interactions with constituents of the lipid rafts in
eukaryotic cells. This is of particular interest since B. burgdorferi
adheres to many different cell types [44,45]. Lipid-lipid interac-
tions could also facilitate the ability of the spirochete to adhere to
many different types of cells [46–49] and to cellular and matrix
proteins [50–52]. Furthermore, exchange of lipids between
spirochetes and host cells could be important for cholesterol
acquisition by the spirochetes, acting as an important nutritional

source. Additionally, acquisition of spirochetal antigens by the cells
could result in presentation of these antigens in a manner that
would be recognized by the immune response leading to a
potential mechanism for cellular damage.
The requirement for cholesterol is important for other bacteria.
The presence of a cholesterol glucoside in spirochetes was first
identified in B. hermsii [53], an agent of relapsing fever. In addition,
cholesterol has been documented in the membranes of Helicobacter,
Mycoplasma, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Brachyspira [54–60]. It is
unknown whether raft-like structures similar to that in B. burgdorferi
form in these other bacteria. However, acquisition of cholesterol
from the plasma membrane of host cells has been documented
with H. pylori, another prokaryote that has cholesterol in its OM
[61], and this organism associates with cholesterol rich areas of the
eukaryotic cells [61,62].
We show here that there is a two-way exchange of lipids
between B. burgdorferi and eukaryotic cells and that this exchange is
accomplished through direct contact with the spirochete as well as
contact with outer membrane vesicles (OMV).
Results
B. burgdorferi attach to HeLa cells and acquire cholesterol
We first investigated whether B. burgdorferi acquires cholesterol
through direct contact with HeLa cells using BODIPY-cholesterol.
BODIPY-cholesterol is an environment sensitive, lipophilic probe
that only fluoresces in hydrophobic, but not aqueous environments
[63–65]. When B. burgdorferi were incubated with HeLa cells
labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 40:1, we observed colocalization (yellow) between the
BODIPY-cholesterol and B. burgdorferi outer membrane protein
OspB on the spirochete and at the point of attachment with the
HeLa cell (Figure 1, S1 for additional images). Colocalization of
BODIPY-cholesterol and the spirochetes was demonstrated in
single 0.5 mm Z-slices and showed the uptake of cholesterol by
adherent B. burgdorferi (Figure 1, S1). Furthermore, BODIPY-
cholesterol labeling extended outward from the point of attach-
ment along the length of the spirochete (Figure 1, S1). Acquisition
of BODIPY-cholesterol is not detected at the start of the
experiment (Figure 1, 0 min panels). HeLa cells do not release
BODIPY-cholesterol into the supernatant over the course of the
1 hr coincubation (data not shown); therefore, B. burgdorferi most
likely acquired BODIPY-cholesterol directly from the labeled
HeLa cells and not the supernatant.
B. burgdorferi incorporate the fluorescent cholesterol
analog, BODIPY-cholesterol into its outer membrane
An important question is whether BODIPY-cholesterol behaves
like unlabeled cholesterol in B. burgdorferi. To investigate this, we
first determined the incorporation of BODIPY-cholesterol onto
the membrane of B. burgdorferi and its toxicity for the spirochete.
To grow B. burgdorferi under laboratory conditions, it is necessary to
supplement the BSK-II medium with 6% rabbit serum which
provides a source of cholesterol (approximately 0.78 mg/L final
concentration) bound to apolipoproteins to form lipoprotein
complexes [66]. The free cholesterol (0.2 mg/L), and the most
accessible to B. burgdorferi in BSK-II medium, comes from the
CMRL-1066 supplement. Removal of cholesterol from the
CMRL-1066 eliminated the free cholesterol found in BSK-II.
Two of the three concentrations of BODIPY-cholesterol used in
the experiments (2.0 mg/L and 4.0 mg/L) are greater than the
0.78 mg/L of cholesterol derived from rabbit serum in BSK-II
and are not bound to apolipoproteins. This suggests that the
primary and most readily available source of cholesterol to the
spirochetes is the fluorescent cholesterol analog. While B. burgdorferi
can grow in serum-free formulations [67–69], the use of serum
remains the most used supplement. Acquisition of the fluorescent
probe by the spirochetes was demonstrated by spectrophotometry,
by flow cytometry, and by fluorescent microscopy. The spirochetes
incorporated BODIPY-cholesterol in a dose and time dependent
manner
(Figure
2A).
At
all
concentrations
measured,
the
BODIPY-cholesterol was quickly introduced to the membranes
of the spirochetes. At 6 hrs of incubation with the fluorescent
cholesterol analog, the variability in the levels of incorporation
increased. It is possible that at this time, there may be some self-
quenching of the BODIPY fluorophore. For this reason, we
determined that the most reproducible fluorescence incorporation
level was derived from growing the spirochetes for 4 hrs in the
presence of 4.0 mg/L BODIPY-cholesterol. It is important to
point out that all our incorporation experiments were done at,
maximally, 4 hr time periods. Using these optimized conditions,
we measured the mean geometric fluorescence of B. burgdorferi
labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol compared to unlabeled B.
burgdorferi by flow cytometry. B. burgdorferi grown in the presence
of BODIPY-cholesterol were significantly more fluorescent when
compared to unlabeled bacteria (Figure 2B). Spirochetes grown in
DMSO (which is the diluent for BODIPY-cholesterol) do not
autofluoresce.
At the concentrations and time periods used, BODIPY-
cholesterol was not cytotoxic as there was no decrease in the
numbers of B. burgdorferi during the 6 hr incubation period.
Labeled spirochetes did not exhibit any morphological or motility
defects in that they maintained their spiral shape and wave-like
motion which was demonstrated by several blurry bacteria in the
static image (Figure 2C). Furthermore, viability of labeled
spirochetes
was
measured
using
fluorescent
microscopy
(Figure 2C). Following incubation of B. burgdorferi with 4.0 mg/L
BODIPY-cholesterol, spirochetes were reintroduced into BSK-II.
The BODIPY-cholesterol did not cause a significant delay in the
growth of the spirochetes when compared to controls (Figure 2D).
Given that BODIPY-cholesterol can be incorporated by B.
burgdorferi, we tested whether the fluorescent cholesterol analog
could serve as a substrate for synthesis of cholesterol-glycolipids.
The lipids from B. burgdorferi incubated with 4.0 mg/L of
BODIPY-cholesterol for 4 hrs in BSK-II media lacking free
Author Summary
Lyme disease, the most prevalent arthropod-borne disease
in North America, is caused by the spirochete Borrelia
burgdorferi. Cholesterol is a significant component of the B.
burgdorferi membrane lipids, and is processed to make
cholesterol-glycolipids. Our interest in the presence of
cholesterol in B. burgdorferi recently led to the identifica-
tion and characterization of eukaryotic-like lipid rafts in the
spirochete. The presence of free cholesterol and choles-
terol-glycolipids in B. burgdorferi creates an opportunity for
lipid-lipid interactions with constituents of the lipid rafts in
eukaryotic cells. We present evidence that there is a two-
way exchange of lipids between B. burgdorferi and
epithelial cells. Spirochetes are unable to synthesize
cholesterol, but can acquire it from the plasma membrane
of
epithelial
cells.
In
addition,
free
cholesterol
and
cholesterol-glycolipids from B. burgdorferi are transferred
to epithelial cells through direct contact and through outer
membrane vesicles. The exchange of cholesterol between
spirochete and host could be an important aspect of the
pathogenesis of Lyme disease.

cholesterol were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer solvent
extraction method [70] and resolved by chloroform-methanol (85/
15) solvent phase on a High Performance Thin Layer Chroma-
tography (HPTLC) plate. Staining of the HPTLC plate with
iodine demonstrated that these spirochetes maintain their typical
profile (Figure 2E) [11,12,30]. UV excitation of the same
chloroform-methanol HPTLC plate showed that the BODIPY-
cholesterol is incorporated into the cholesterol glycolipids of B.
burgdorferi (Figure 2E). Free cholesterol and cholesterol-glycolipids
(ACGal and CGal) on the plate are visible, but glycolipids that do
not contain cholesterol, MGalD and the phospholipids, are not.
Furthermore, incubation of BODIPY-cholesterol with B. burgdorferi
at the beginning of the experiment (no incubation) indicates that
the fluorescent cholesterol probe has the same migration profile as
cholesterol in our experimental conditions and is not incorporated
into the cholesterol-glycolipids as was observed after 4 hrs of
incubation with the probe (Figure 2E). We did observe increased
levels of CGal labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol when compared
to ACGal labeled with the fluorescent probe. It is possible that
CGal could serve as a building block or an intermediate species in
the synthesis of ACGal and that over the length of these
experiments complete synthesis of ACGal is not achieved.
Nonetheless, this shows that B. burgdorferi used the BODIPY-
cholesterol as a substrate for cholesterol-glycolipid synthesis, thus
making the individual cholesterol-glycolipids fluorescent when
excited by UV light. Because B. burgdorferi can incorporate the
BODIPY-cholesterol into its cholesterol-glycolipids, we assessed
the long term growth and cytotoxicity of the fluorescent cholesterol
in BSK-II (Figure 2F). Furthermore, in BSK-II without free
cholesterol and without the rabbit serum, the spirochetes with
BODIPY-cholesterol do not replicate, but are still alive when
viewed using dark field microscopy for up to 96 hrs. This same
result
is
observed
when
using
non-fluorescent
cholesterol
(Figure 2F). Therefore, BODIPY-cholesterol is similar to non-
fluorescent cholesterol in that long-term incubation with the sterols
is not cytotoxic to the spirochetes. Furthermore, this experiment
indicates that the sterol source does not matter for survival because
spirochetes only grow in BSK-II that has to be supplemented with
6% rabbit serum (Figure 2F). We conclude that BODIPY-
cholesterol is a useful cholesterol analog in B. burgdorferi, and so
its behavior is very likely to reflect that of unlabeled cholesterol.
Exchange of lipids from B. burgdorferi to eukaryotic cells
The clustering of cholesterol into lipid rafts is a characteristic
that is shared by both the eukaryotic host and B. burgdorferi. We
hypothesized that the presence of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in
both the host and pathogen could serve as an ideal platform for
lipid-lipid interactions. There is evidence that H. pylori attaches to
and partitions in detergent-resistant regions (lipid rafts) of the host
cell membrane [62]. To determine whether a direct molecular
interaction exists between B. burgdorferi and host cells, we
performed experiments to observe and quantify if there is any
exchange of lipids. HeLa cells were selected for these experiments
because B. burgdorferi come into contact with epithelial cells during
dissemination and infection, and because they are not phagocytic.
HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips and exposed to B.
burgdorferi labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol at a MOI of 20:1 at
four time intervals at 37uC. In addition to the labeled spirochetes,
we incubated the HeLa cells with conditioned medium (after
removal of spirochetes labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol) and cell
free wash supernatant (as negative control) for the time intervals.
Images of HeLa cells incubated with labeled B. burgdorferi and the
conditioned medium from BODIPY-cholesterol labeled B. burg-
dorferi captured by confocal microscopy show that the lowest levels
of transfer occur in the shorter incubation times of 15 min
(Figure 3A,E) and 30 min (Figure 3B,F). There appears to be a
time dependent threshold between the 30 min and 1 hr incuba-
tion times because the labeling is most robust and highest at the
longer incubation times of 1 hr (Figure 3C,G) and 2 hrs
(Figure 3D,H). In the tested incubation times, we observed little
or no transfer in the negative control, the cell free wash
supernatant (Figure 3I, J). Time dependency and differences in
transfer between labeled spirochetes and conditioned medium
were confirmed by RFI analysis (Figure 3K) and flow cytometry
(Figure 3L). Furthermore at the 2 hr incubation time the images
show that B. burgdorferi also come into direct contact with the HeLa
cells (Figure 3M–P). This further indicates that the spirochetes
make direct contact with the HeLa cells and that this interaction
contributes to transfer. These experiments together show that the
transfer of B. burgdorferi derived lipids occurs through a combina-
tion of contact dependent and contact independent mechanisms.
Likewise, transfer is time-dependent because the longer the
spirochetes interact with the HeLa cells, the more transfer occurs.
To follow the trafficking of BODIPY-cholesterol after incorpo-
ration, we used the cis-Golgi marker, GM130 (Figure 3Q–T).
Labeled cholesterol trafficked to the Golgi-apparatus within 2 hrs
indicating that the cells processed the B. burgdorferi derived
cholesterol in the same manner as cholesterol from other sources.
To characterize further and understand the process of lipid
exchange, we conducted transfer assays using a coincubation time
of 2 hrs at different temperatures between 4uC and 37uC.
Confocal microscopy demonstrated that at 4uC (Figure S2 A,D)
there was significantly less transfer of bacterial derived lipids from
labeled spirochetes and conditioned medium when compared to
images taken at 25uC (Figure S2 B,E) and 37uC (Figure S2 C,F).
The negative control, the cell free wash supernatant, did not show
any visible transfer at any temperature (Figure S2 G, H). For RFI
measurements (Figure S2 I) and the flow cytometry analysis

(Figure S2 J), we observed the same trend when comparing data
for two different temperatures where the levels of transferred lipids
were significantly higher at the higher temperatures.
To confirm that the transfer of B. burgdorferi lipids to HeLa cells
was linked to a specific process and not an artifact created by the
addition of the BODIPY fluorophore to the cholesterol molecule,
we performed lipid transfer experiments using 3H-cholesterol. The
increased sensitivity of radiolabeling relative to fluorescence also
allowed us to investigate whether cholesterol-glycolipids were
transferred to HeLa cells. Lipids from B. burgdorferi labeled with
3H-cholesterol were extracted using the Bligh and Dyer solvent
method
[70],
and
analyzed
by HPTLC. The
silica from
cholesterol lipid spots identified with iodine was scraped from
the HPTLC plate and analyzed by liquid scintillation to quantify
the amount of 3H-cholesterol incorporated into B. burgdorferi. As an
additional control, silica between the observed bands of free
cholesterol and ACGal was also scraped to confirm that each band
was distinct. When incubated with 3H-cholesterol, B. burgdorferi
incorporated the radioactive cholesterol into their membrane
fraction (Figure 4A). Similar to the incorporation of BODIPY-
cholesterol, we found that the spirochetes also utilized the 3H-
cholesterol as a substrate for synthesis of the cholesterol-glycolipids
(Figure 4A). The ratio of 3H-cholesterol, 3H-cholesterol labeled
ACGal, and 3H-cholesterol labeled CGal in the spirochete was
between 53.5:1:1 and 42.6:1.25:1 (Figure 4A). We did not observe
incorporated radioactivity above background in unlabeled controls
or in lipids that do not contain cholesterol, MGalD, phosphati-
dylcholine, or phosphatidylglycerol (Figure 4A). These data
support the fluorescence data already presented in Figure 2E in
that the cholesterol is incorporated into the bacterial cholesterol
glycolipid fractions because we detected significant incorporation
of
3H-cholesterol into all cholesterol-glycolipids by HPTLC
(Figure 4B).
To demonstrate transfer of lipids from spirochetes to HeLa cells,
B. burgdorferi labeled with 3H-cholesterol were incubated with the
cells at a MOI of 40:1, 20:1, 10:1, and 1:1 for 2 hrs. The HeLa
cells were washed three times and lifted from the tissue culture
wells. Each condition was measured by liquid scintillation counting
to quantify the levels of transfer (Figure 4C). We observed
significant disintegrations per minute (DPM) in the higher MOI in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 4C). This agrees with data
obtained using BODIPY-cholesterol that there is a transfer of B.
burgdorferi lipids to the host eukaryotic cells. Additionally, lipids
were extracted from HeLa cells following removal of spirochetes
and analyzed for their lipid profile by HPTLC (Figure 4D).
Evidence that the cholesterol-glycolipids are transferred to the
membrane of the HeLa cells comes from identification of the
individual cholesterol-glycolipids in the HeLa cell lipid extracts on
the HPTLC plate (Figure 4D). Experimental HeLa cell lipid
extracts were run on an HPTLC plate in parallel with a reference
control B. burgdorferi lipid extract. The HPTLC plate was stained
with iodine and the bands on the HeLa cell extract samples that
corresponded to the known glycolipid bands from the B. burgdorferi
control lipid extract were scraped for liquid scintillation analysis.
The ratio of transferred 3H-cholesterol, 3H-cholesterol labeled
ACGal, and 3H-cholesterol labeled CGal was between 56:4:1 and
54.67:5.33:1 (Figure 4D). It is noteworthy that the ratio of ACGal
to free cholesterol in the HeLa cells was higher than that in the
spirochetes. This suggests that it transfers more efficiently than
cholesterol, and would not be expected if the HeLa cell-associated
radioactivity was an artifact of spirochetes attached to the HeLa
cells. As an additional control to account for the contribution of
spirochetes that remain attached to the cells after washing to the
total DPMs, we utilized a GFP-labeled B. burgdorferi strain [71] to
quantify the percentage of bacteria that did not dissociate from the
cells. The HeLa cells were analyzed by the SpectraMaxM2 to
calculate GFP fluorescence levels. This control disclosed that
2.260.4% (,61% of the total signal of 3.560.9%) could be
derived from spirochetes that remained attached. Despite this,
however, ,39% of the signal of 3H cholesterol and cholesterol-
glycolipid was associated with cells. Furthermore, the observation
above that the fraction of radioactive ACGal in HeLa cells after
transfer (between 56:4:1 and 54.67:5.33:1 [cholesterol:ACGal:C-
Gal]) was 3 to 5-fold times higher than ACGal derived from
radioactively labeled B. burgdorferi alone (between 53.5:1:1 and
42.6:1.25:1 [cholesterol:ACGal:CGal]) the amount of ACGal
bound to the HeLa cells is 6-fold times higher than that expected
if it was just derived from B. burgdorferi that had not washed off the
HeLa cells. In this study, we have used four different methodol-
ogies (fluorescence confocal microscopy, single cell RFI analyses,
flow cytometry, and isotope incorporation) to demonstrate lipid
exchange from B. burgdorferi to cells. Of these four, isotope
incorporation was the least robust, but it also provided evidence
for lipid exchange through differential incorporation of label and
through HPTLC. Thus, using all four experimental approaches,
we conclude that there is a transfer or uptake of both cholesterol
and the antigenic cholesterol-glycolipids by eukaryotic host cells in
vitro, and this could be important implications for the pathogenesis
of Lyme disease.
B. burgdorferi labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol
specifically release fluorescent cholesterol probe in the
form of OMV
Given that HeLa cells acquired BODIPY fluorescence from
conditioned medium (Figure 3 E–H), we sought to determine
whether free BODIPY-cholesterol was being released nonspecif-
ically or was associated with OMV. To identify released OMV in
the supernatants, we used a lipophilic probe, 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-
hexatriene (DPH). DPH fluoresces in hydrophobic environments
such as membranes, but not in aqueous environments and has a

linear response with membrane bilayer concentration [72]. By
probing the supernatants from BODIPY-cholesterol labeled and
unlabeled spirochetes with 1 mg/mL of DPH, we were able to
determine if fragments of membrane were being released from the
labeled spirochetes and how it compared to release by unlabeled
B. burgdorferi. Labeled B. burgdorferi released intact membrane, in
amounts similar to unlabeled B. burgdorferi (Figure 5A), suggesting
that the membrane release is a natural process and not the result of
BODIPY-cholesterol labeling. However, DPH labeling cannot
distinguish if membrane release is in the form of an intact OMV.
Therefore we analyzed the collected OMV by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM). The negative-stain TEM micrographs
of isolated vesicles show spherical structures from both labeled and
unlabeled B. burgdorferi OMV (Figure 5B). In both OMV
preparations, we used double immunogold labeling for OspB
(18 nm colloidal gold) and the cholesterol-glycolipids (6 nm
colloidal gold). Both labeled and unlabeled B. burgdorferi release
OMV that are similar in morphology and glycolipid content.

The release of OMV from the spirochetes (Figure 5B) led us to
test whether the OMV play a role in the transfer of lipids to HeLa
cells. To confirm that the membranes released from labeled B.
burgdorferi are OMV and similar in protein content to the unlabeled
controls, we purified OMV from labeled and unlabeled B.
burgdorferi using an Optiprep density gradient. To compare protein
content, we performed SDS-PAGE using 11 purified OMV
fractions from the supernatants of labeled and unlabeled B.
burgdorferi and observed similar protein content in the fractions
where OMV partition (20–25%). Both preparations had similar
distributions of protein across the 11 gradient fractions. Even with
the addition of BODIPY-cholesterol to the spirochetes, the OMV
are representative of naturally forming vesicles. We further
determined by SDS-PAGE and western blot that OspA, OspB,
and lp6.6, some of the most abundant lipoproteins in the OMV,
are found in both labeled and unlabeled B. burgdorferi (Figure 6A
and 6B). These electrophoretic and immunoblot data were also
supported by previous mass spectrometry data from our laboratory
that showed OM proteins were the most abundant in the OMV
[73].
B. burgdorferi release OMV that are partially responsible
for the transfer of bacterial derived lipids to HeLa cells
In addition to analyzing the protein content of labeled and
unlabeled OMV, we also determined their lipid content. To
examine the lipids found in B. burgdorferi OMV, we pooled
fractions 15–25% of both the labeled and unlabeled vesicles. We
determined BODIPY-cholesterol labeled and unlabeled OMV
have both phospholipids and cholesterol, ACGal, and CGal. The
cholesterol-glycolipids are significant lipid components of the
vesicles (Figure 6C). To identify fluorescent lipids, the same
HPTLC plate was exposed to UV light which demonstrated that
the vesicles derived from BODIPY-cholesterol labeled B. burgdorferi
contain the fluorescent cholesterol analog BODIPY-cholesterol,
although in this preparation we were not able to demonstrate
BODIPY-cholesterol
incorporation
into
ACGal
and
CGal
(Figure 6C). Detection of fluorescently labeled ACGal and CGal
was most likely not observed in the isolated vesicles due to the
small amount of material collected and analyzed and the low
sensitivity of UV light excitation of the BODIPY-cholesterol probe
on the TLC plate. However, the cholesterol-glycolipids were
visualized as components of the OMV at the single molecule level
using the 6 nm colloidal gold anti-rabbit secondary antibody and
TEM (Figure 5B).
To test for the possibility that the OMV released by B. burgdorferi
could be responsible for transfer of bacterial antigens to the HeLa
cells, we isolated vesicles from B. burgdorferi labeled with BODIPY-
cholesterol. The HeLa cells were washed with PBS and incubated
with Vybrant Cell-Labeling Solution DiI to label their plasma
membranes (Figure 7A). We observed that when isolated OMV
labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol are incubated with HeLa cells in
the transfer assay, there is a colocalization between the BODIPY-
cholesterol probe and the Vybrant Cell Labeling Solution DiI
probe on the surface of the HeLa cells. We observed this
colocalization at the single cell level (merged cross section,
Figure 7B) and in merged 3D composite image of multiple cells
on the cover slip (Figure 7C). Similar to the transfer assays
conducted with the whole bacteria, we observed internalization in
the form of free BODIPY-cholesterol fluorescence inside of the
HeLa cell. This was represented by diffuse staining inside the
plasma membrane of the composite images. These confocal
micrographs show that there is an exchange of bacterial derived
lipids from B. burgdorferi to eukaryotic cells and that this transfer
can be executed by OMV.
Discussion
Through the use of fluorescent and radiolabeled cholesterol, we
showed that a lipid exchange between spirochetes and host cells
can occur. Two main conclusions can be derived from our studies.
First, we show that when B. burgdorferi come in direct contact with
epithelial cells the spirochetes can extract cholesterol from
epithelial cell membranes. Second, both cholesterol and the
antigenic cholesterol-glycolipids of B. burgdorferi are transferred to
epithelial cells through direct contact between the spirochete and
the plasma membrane and through released OMV.
As an extracellular pathogen, nutrient acquisition from the
immediate environment is an essential process for B. burgdorferi to
be able to persist in the host. Here we provide evidence that B.
burgdorferi can extract cholesterol, an essential membrane lipid,
from eukaryotic cells. We demonstrated that B. burgdorferi attach to
epithelial cells and can incorporate cholesterol directly from the
plasma membrane. Using fluorescence microscopy, B. burgdorferi
were shown to attach to epithelial cells and associate with
BODIPY-cholesterol labeled regions of the plasma membrane.
Evidence that the spirochetes extract cholesterol from epithelial
cells comes from confocal microscopy images which showed
colocalization of the BODIPY-cholesterol from the HeLa cells and
the lipoprotein OspB at the point of attachment, and also the
presence of BODIPY-cholesterol throughout the spirochete which
extended away from the cell. Cholesterol acquisition has been
shown to also be an important process for extracellular pathogens.
Cholesterol and cholesterol-glycolipids comprise a significant
portion of the bacterial membrane of H. pylori. Using similar
techniques to ours, H. pylori was shown to attach to cholesterol-rich
domains and acquire cholesterol from eukaryotic membranes
[61,62]. For some obligate intracellular pathogens, such as Coxiella
burnetii and the Chlamydia species, lipid acquisition is also essential
to establish and maintain an active infection [74,75] and an
exogenous source of lipids is necessary for their growth [6,74,75].
In intracellular bacteria, phospholipids and cholesterol along with
machinery to synthesize these lipids are trafficked to the inclusion
vacuole containing these bacteria [76–79]. Understanding how
bacteria use or alter these lipids is an area of active research [80].
Together,
these
findings
represent
diverse
mechanisms
for
cholesterol acquisition.
The host antibody response to B. burgdorferi has been studied
extensively, but the understanding of the role of the unique
cholesterol-glycolipids in pathogenesis is limited. Antibody re-
sponses to these glycolipids have been detected throughout the
course of Lyme disease [9,11,12,20]. To observe the role of

oped
methods
to
incorporate
labeled
cholesterol
into
the
spirochetal membranes and showed that the labeled cholesterol
is used as a substrate for synthesis of the cholesterol-glycolipids.
This allowed us to track the cholesterol-glycolipids through several
experimental approaches.
In addition to the ability of B. burgdorferi to tolerate and use
labeled
cholesterol
as
a
substrate
for
cholesterol-glycolipid
synthesis, we also demonstrated that the cholesterol and choles-
terol-glycolipids are transferred to the epithelial cells. After
incubation with epithelial cells, evidence from confocal microscopy
showed that fluorescently labeled cholesterol and cholesterol-
glycolipids were observed in the plasma membrane as well as
Golgi apparatus. The presence of the fluorescent cholesterol in the
Golgi apparatus indicated that the eukaryotic cells are processing
and trafficking all or part of the exogenous BODIPY-cholesterol in
unlabeled B. burgdorferi. Vesicles in fractions 2–4 contain OspB, OspA, and lp6.6. C. Left: Chloroform-methanol (85/15) HPTLC of isolated B.

a manner similar to that used for cholesterol derived from other
sources [64]. To bolster the results from the fluorescence
experiments, we also used radioactive cholesterol to demonstrate
lipid exchange. With the higher sensitivity of radiolabeled
cholesterol, we were able to establish that not just labeled
cholesterol, but also labeled ACGal and CGal, the two antigenic
cholesterol glycolipids, can be transferred to epithelial cells and are
present in the eukaryotic membrane. Because of the increased
sensitivity of the experiments using radiolabeled spirochetes, we
were able to detect low but significant DPM values in the epithelial
lipid extracts, suggesting that there is an exchange of the antigenic
cholesterol-glycolipids into the HeLa cells. Because the values
obtained from the transfer experiments are generally low, we used
several different approaches to demonstrate lipid exchange,
including spectrophotometry, flow cytometry, quantifiable fluo-
rescence microscopy (RFI), and liquid scintillation. Further
documentation of transfer was obtained at the level of the single
cell using fluorescent and confocal microscopy. Regardless of the
amount of transfer, together, our results demonstrated that a
spirochetal cholesterol based antigen is transferred to and present
in the membrane of the epithelial cells.
We
showed
that
length
of
coincubation
time
and
the
temperature of the coincubation between the spirochetes and the
epithelial cells can change the amount of overall transferred lipid.
In addition, we investigated how OMV can contribute to the
transfer of lipids between the spirochetes and host cells. Borrelia
OMV have been isolated [81–83] and extensively studied [84–89].
Our method to collect and isolate OMV from Borrelia sought to
collect OMV in BSK-II from live organisms, thus replicating the
same
experimental
conditions
would
be
found
in
as
the
conditioned medium. We demonstrated that transfer can occur
through released OMV from the spirochete, and the vesicles can
attach to or be incorporated into the epithelial plasma membrane.
Furthermore, we determined that the cholesterol-glycolipids were
significant components of the OMV, and similar to other species
of Borrelia [81], the isolated OMV were also rich in OM proteins.
We have shown that B. burgdorferi extract cholesterol from the
plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells and that cholesterol-
glycolipids can be transferred to epithelial cell membranes by a
contact dependent mechanism through direct attachment. These
two events, cholesterol acquisition and transfer of antigenic lipids,
might not be mutually exclusive. One possible explanation for the
contact dependent transfer could be that the spirochetes are
required to attach to the eukaryotic plasma membrane to acquire
cholesterol. Uncharacterized spirochetal transferases [18] poten-
tially associated with the OM could also extract cholesterol from
the host cells for synthesis of the cholesterol-glycolipids. During
this event, it is possible that the cholesterol-glycolipids are left
behind in the plasma membrane of the epithelial cell. There may
also be the mechanism in which cells acquire these spirochetal
lipids via released OMV that are rich in cholesterol-glycolipids
[30,73]. The ability of OMV from pathogenic bacteria to
participate in host-pathogen interactions as virulence factors has
been well documented [90]. Furthermore, there is evidence that
OMV from other bacteria can fuse with the cell membrane [91–
93]. We demonstrated that OMV derived from fluorescently
labeled B. burgdorferi can transfer the fluorescent cholesterol to the
epithelial cells. Therefore, the OMV of B. burgdorferi could serve as
a vehicle to transfer the cholesterol-glycolipids, fuse with the cell
membrane, and act as virulence factors that influence and
modulate the host immune response.
In summary, using fluorescent and radiolabeled cholesterol, we
have documented that B. burgdorferi extract cholesterol from the
plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells and that prokaryotic
cholesterol-glycolipids can be transferred to epithelial cell mem-
branes by two mechanisms (i) a contact dependent mechanism
through direct attachment and (ii) a contact independent method
through released OMV. The B. burgdorferi membrane is unique in
that it contains lipid rafts, with cholesterol and cholesterol-
glycolipids with physical properties that are similar to those of
eukaryotic membranes. Transfer of antigenic cholesterol-glycolip-
ids could play a major role in the pathogenesis of the spirochetoses.
Given the limited biosynthetic capabilities of B. burgdorferi to make
cholesterol and other important lipids, the process of cholesterol
extraction from host cells is likely to be more biologically
significant for the nutrition of the spirochetes early in infection
as nutrient acquisition is crucial for the replication of the bacteria.
Once the bacteria have disseminated and an infection has been
established, it is likely that even at low levels, the transfer of
antigenic lipids from the spirochete to host cells becomes more
significant. Whether inserted directly into the plasma membrane
of eukaryotic cells, or attached to the surface of these cells, the
presence of foreign antigens with similar composition and
structural characteristics could have multiple consequences for
the host immune response. It is also possible that these transferred
lipids could contribute to heightened inflammation and arthritis.
Furthermore, if the immune response were to recognize cells with
transferred lipid antigens, the cells themselves become targets of
immune effectors.
Materials and Methods
Bacteria, cultures, and loading of fluorescent and
radioactive cholesterol analogs
B.

strain
B31
were
grown
in
microareophilic
conditions in BSK-II medium [94] supplemented with 6% rabbit
serum (Sigma) at 33uC. For the incorporation experiments, a
BSK-II without free cholesterol was made by using cholesterol free
CMRL-1066 (Invitrogen). Removal of cholesterol from the
CMRL-1066 eliminated the free cholesterol found in BSK-II
(0.2 mg/mL. When the BSK-II is supplemented with 6% rabbit
serum, the final concentration of cholesterol in the cholesterol-free
BSK-II was 0.78 mg/mL. The environment sensitive fluorescent
cholesterol
analog,
23-(dipyrrometheneboron
difluoride)-24-
norcholesterol (TopFlour Cholesterol or BODIPY-cholesterol,
Avanti Polar Lipids), was added to BSK-II without free cholesterol
medium for 6 hrs at a concentration of 0.2 mg/L, 2.0 mg/L, and
4.0 mg/L of BODIPY-cholesterol. After the 6 hr incubations, the
bacteria were washed three times with Hank’s balanced salt
solution (HBSS, Gibco). Fluorescence readings were calculated
using a SpectraMaxM2 (ex/em - 490/504). The fluorescently
labeled B. burgdorferi were used immediately for all assays.
B. burgdorferi were also labeled with 3H-cholesterol (American
Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.). Spirochetes were washed three
times with HBSS and the endogenous cholesterol was depleted
using 10 mM MbCD. After depletion, the cholesterol was
replaced
by
incubating
the
spirochetes
with
4.0 mg/L
of
cholesterol and 10.0 mCi of 3H-cholesterol in HBSS. B. burgdorferi
were washed three times with HBSS and were immediately used
for all assays.
Lipid extraction, purification, and analysis
B. burgdorferi were washed three times in large volumes of HBSS,
before lipid extraction using the Bligh and Dyer method [70]. The
lipid extracts were concentrated under constant nitrogen gas
stream. Lipid extracts were separated by thin-layer chromatogra-
phy on Si250 HPTLC silica plates (J.T. Baker) with chloroform/
methanol (85/15) and visualized with iodine vapor staining or

exposure to UV light. Lipid extracts from samples containing 3H-
cholesterol were separated by HPTLC and stained with iodine
vapor. The spots on the plate were scraped and the silica
containing the radioactive cholesterol was analyzed by liquid
scintillation counting. For direct visualization of the HPTLC plate,
the plate was first sprayed with EN3HANCE Spray (DuPont) and
exposed using BioMax MR Film (Kodak) for 4 and 14 days at
280uC and developed using a Medical Film Processor Model
SRX-101A (Konica).
Optimization for fluorescent labeling of B. burgdorferi
membrane
B. burgdorferi labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol were analyzed by
the
SpectraMax M2 plate reader
(ex/em -
490/504) for
incorporation of fluorescence. The viability, morphology, and
motility of the BODIPY-cholesterol treated B. burgdorferi were
assessed by dark-field enumeration and fluorescence microscopy.
The lipids of B. burgdorferi labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol were
isolated and resolved on an HPTLC Si250 silica plate with
chloroform-methanol (85/15) and exposed with UV light and
stained with iodine vapor for visualization of the lipids. Standards
were known Rf values from identical solvent systems [11,12,30]. B.
burgdorferi incubated with BODIPY-cholesterol were also analyzed
for their ability to grow or recover following incorporation of the
fluorescent label. Labeled B. burgdorferi were washed in HBSS, and
resuspended in BSK-II medium, and growth was assessed by dark-
field enumeration.
B. burgdorferi lipid transfer assay
HeLa cells were maintained in DMEM medium (Gibco) with
10% fetal calf serum (Pel-Freez). The HeLa cells were grown on
glass coverslips in T175 tissue culture flasks (Falcon). Cells were
infected with B. burgdorferi labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol at a
multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 20:1 for 2 hrs. Conditioned
medium and negative control cell free wash supernatant were also
added to the coverslips for 2 hrs. Conditioned medium superna-
tants were generated by incubating B. burgdorferi labeled with
BODIPY-cholesterol in BSK-II for 2 hrs. The spirochetes were
pelleted by centrifugation at high speed for 15 min and the
supernatants (cell-free) were examined by dark field and fluores-
cent microscopy to ensure that intact organisms were not present.
The supernatants were added directly to the HeLa cells for 2 hrs.
The cell free wash supernatant was included as a negative control
to ensure that the BODIPY-cholesterol is not loosely associated
with the OM or released nonspecifically from B. burgdorferi as there
was no observable transfer of label. The negative control or cell
free wash supernatant was generated by resuspension of the
labeled B. burgdorferi pellet after the final wash in BSK-II, to the
HeLa cells for 2 hrs. The coverslips were washed three times in
phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Gibco), fixed in 2.5% parafor-
maldehyde and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in
PBS for immunofluorescence staining. The remaining B. burgdorferi
that were attached to the HeLa cells were detected with CB2, a
murine monoclonal antibody to OspB [95] followed by an Alexa
Fluor 594 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen).
The samples analyzed for BODIPY-cholesterol colocalization
with the cis-Golgi complex were probed with a monoclonal rabbit
GM130 antibody (Abcam) followed by a Texas Red goat anti-
rabbit IgG (Abcam). Samples were imaged by confocal laser
microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO Two-Photon
Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope System.
Additional approaches were used to detect lipid exchange
between B. burgdorferi and cells. RFI of the HeLa cells from 10
microscope fields of vision were calculated using Zeiss LSM 510
META NLO Two-Photon Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope
System Software. The mean geometric fluorescence was calculated
from samples that were analyzed by a FACScan/Calibur for
BODIPY fluorescence.
For experiments using radiolabeled B. burgdorferi, HeLa cells
were incubated with B. burgdorferi labeled with 10.0 mCi
3H-
cholesterol 3H-cholesterol at a MOI of 40:1 for 2 hrs. The HeLa
cells were extensively washed to remove the spirochetes. HeLa
cells were lifted from the tissue culture flasks using 0.05%Trypsin/
EDTA (Gibco). Transferred radioactivity to the HeLa cells was
detected by extracting the lipids using the Bligh and Dyer solvent
extraction method. Lipids were separated on a HPTLC plate using
chloroform-methanol (85/15). The HPTLC plate was stained with
iodine and spots on the plate were scraped. In addition,
incorporation of isotope into the lipids was measured by scraping
the silica from the HPTLC plate, analyzed by liquid scintillation
using a Beckman LS 6500 Liquid Scintillation Counter and
reported as DPM.
To control for B. burgdorferi that remained attached to HeLa cells
after washing, B. burgdorferi that constitutively expressed GFP [71]
was utilized. The GFP expressing B. burgdorferi were incubated with
HeLa cells at a MOI of 40:1 for 2 hrs. The HeLa cells were
extensively washed to remove the spirochetes. HeLa cells were
lifted from the tissue culture flasks using 0.05%Trypsin/EDTA
(Gibco). Using the SpectraMaxM2, the amount of GFP fluores-
cence (B. burgdorferi still attached to HeLa cells) was measured in
the HeLa cell pellet.
Quantification of released BODIPY-cholesterol from B.
burgdorferi
For detection of released membrane material, labeled B and
unlabeled B. burgdorferi were incubated in HBSS for 2 hrs. The
supernatants were collected at 1 hr and 2 hrs. The supernatants
were labeled with 1 mg/ml of the hydrophobic-sensitive, fluores-
cent, lipophilic probe DPH (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 33uC. After
20 min, the supernatants were analyzed for fluorescence in a
SpectraMax M2 plate reader using an excitation of 360 nm and
emission of 430 nm.
Vesicle isolation and purification
B. burgdorferi labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol or unlabeled B.
burgdorferi in the late-log phase of growth were pelleted by
centrifugation, and resuspended in fresh BSK-II media. To keep
similar incubation times as the transfer assay, the labeled and
unlabeled spirochetes were incubated for 2 hrs at 37uC to collect
released vesicles. Following the removal of spirochetes, the
supernatants were filtered twice using 0.22 mm-pore-size Steriflip
filters (Millipore). Crude membrane and outer membrane vesicles
(OMV) in the filtered supernatant were concentrated by ultracen-
trifugation for 1 hr at 100,0006 g. To purify the OMV, the
membrane pellet was resuspended in 60% OptiPrep (Axis Shield).
A discontinuous gradient was made following the manufacturer’s
instructions. The discontinuous gradient was centrifuged for
16 hrs at 100,0006 g. The OMV were concentrated to form a
white band that floated to the interface between the 20% layer and
the 25% layer of the gradient. The gradient fractions were
collected in 1 mL volumes (two 1 mL fractions for each OptiPrep
gradient percentage) from the top of the tube with the least dense
faction being collected first. The OMV from fraction 15%, 20%,
and 25% were pooled based on similar protein contents to
maximize the amount of OMV collected [73]. The isolated OMV
were concentrated and removed from the OptiPrep solution by
centrifugation for 1 hr at 100,0006 g. The pelleted, purified

were immediately used for vesicle transfer assays.
B. burgdorferi outer membrane vesicle transfer assay
HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips in 24 well tissue
culture plates. Cells were incubated with 40 mg (based on protein
content) of vesicles purified from BODIPY-cholesterol labeled B.
burgdorferi for 2 hrs. Protein content was determined by BCA Assay
and a Coomassie Plus Assay (Pierce). The HeLa cells were washed
with HBSS to remove the vesicles. To label the plasma membrane
of the HeLa cells, the coverslips were then incubated with Vybrant
Cell Labeling Solution DiI (Invitrogen) following the manufactur-
er’s instructions. The coverslips were fixed with 2.5% paraformal-
dehyde and were imaged by confocal laser microscopy using a
Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO Two-Photon Laser Scanning
Confocal Microscope System.
B. burgdorferi cholesterol extraction from epithelial
membranes
HeLa cells were grown on glass coverslips in 24 well tissue
culture plates. The HeLa cells were preloaded with 5 mg/mL of
BODIPY-cholesterol for 2 hrs. To remove excess BODIPY-
cholesterol, the cells were washed twice with 5 mg/mL of
methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD, Sigma) and one final time with
BSK-II. HeLa cells labeled with BODIPY-cholesterol were
incubated in BSK-II for 1 hr, before the supernatants and cells
were measured for BODIPY-cholesterol fluorescence using the
SpectraMax M2.
To observe the cholesterol extraction from HeLa cell mem-
branes, the cells were infected at an MOI of 40:1 for 1 hr washed
3 times with PBS and fixed with 2.5% paraformaldehyde for
15 min. B. burgdorferi were detected by incubation with CB2
hybridoma supernatants [95] followed by an Alexa Fluor 594 goat
anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). The cells were imaged by confocal
laser microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 META NLO Two-
Photon Laser Scanning Confocal Microscope System.
Statistics
Statistics were calculated using GraphPad InStat 3 (GraphPad
Software).
