Abstract
Since January 2020, after Chinese health authorities identified a new type of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), the virus has
spread throughout China and consecutively throughout the whole world. The most common symptoms include
fever and respiratory tract symptoms. Nevertheless, some patients show less common symptoms such as
gastrointestinal or neurological manifestations. This article presents the case of a 65-years old man who was
presumptively infected with SARS-CoV-2 during his ski vacation in Austria in March 2020 and acutely presented
with typical symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome.
Keywords: Guillain-Barré syndrome, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2
Introduction
In December 2019 multiple cases of atypical pneumonia
were reported in Wuhan, China. A few weeks later the
unkown pathogen was identified as a new type of corona-
virus (SARS-CoV-2) by Chinese health authorities. The
disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has spread rapidly from
Wuhan throughout the whole world.
SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus and be-
longs to the family of beta coronaviruses [1]. Corona-
viruses are capable of causing illnesses in humans ranging
from mild respiratory infections to more severe diseases
such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [2, 3].
The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever,
dry cough and abnormal fatigue [4]. Beyond that, SARS-
CoV-2 is not limited to the respiratory tract causing a wide
range of clinical manifestations. A growing body of evi-
dence shows that SARS-CoV-2 may also invade the central
nervous system, thus inducing neurological diseases [5].
For example, many patients report headache, anosmia and
ageusia [6]. There is an ongoing debate whether respiratory
distress is not exclusively the result of a pulmonary inflam-
matory process, or whether a possible neuroinvasion by
SARS-CoV-2 into the brainstem may play a role [7].
Moreover, neurological complications caused by corona-
viruses were already reported during the outbreaks of
SARS-CoV in 2002 and MERS-CoV in 2012 [8, 9].
The range and pathogenesis of neurological manifesta-
tions of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown. We herein
report about a COVID-19 patient who was admitted to
the emergency department of our hospital with typical
symptoms of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).
Case presentation
On March 10th 2020, a 65-years old man presented with
a 2-day history of acute weakness of his right arm and
lower limbs, which caused recurrent falls. He had no
past medical history and was a nonsmoker. In mid-
February he had already suffered from mild respiratory
symptoms, which successfully resolved after an oral anti-
biotic treatment. After returning from his ski vacation in
Austria he developed fever (38.0 °C) and a dry cough on
March 7th 2020.
The neurological examination revealed a distally accen-
tuated paresis of the right arm and a slight paraparesis of
the lower limbs which was more pronounced on the right
side. He had no sensory deficits. Deep tendon reflexes
were reduced generally. The patient was afebrile (37.4 °C),
had no dyspnea and the oxygen saturation was 98%.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed a slight in-
crease in protein level (56 mg/dl) with a normal cell
count (2 cells/μl). The laboratory tests also showed a
slightly increased CRP of 1.92 mg/dl. In addition,

ganglioside
antibodies
(GM1,
GM2,
GM3,
GD1a,
GD1b, GT1b, GQ1b) were tested and found to be nega-
tive. Summarizing all symptoms, we diagnosed GBS and
initiated an intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) treat-
ment (0.4 g/kg bodyweight per day for 5 days).
On the following day a progression of the right arm par-
esis and areflexia were recognized. In addition, the blood
tests showed a slight leukopenia (3.0 /nl). Electrophysio-
logic tests revealed prolonged distal motor latencies of the
right median and tibial nerves as well as increased F-wave
latencies of the median and tibial nerves on both sides,
consistent with a demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy.
Because of persistent cough and fever, a chest x-ray
was performed, which showed no conspicuous findings.
Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus infection were
excluded by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Due to an
increasing number of SARS-CoV-2 infections in ski
resorts in Austria were reported and Tyrol was officially
declared a high-risk area on March 14th 2020, we
performed a throat swab test and subsequent PCR for
SARS-CoV-2 which was positive. In consequence, a
pathogen-suitable isolation was initiated.
Treatment with IVIG for a total of 5 days in combin-
ation with physiotherapy quickly led to a significant im-
provement in GBS symptoms. Hence, the patient could be
discharged from the hospital 12 days after admission. At
the time of discharge, there was no residual paresis while
the deep tendon reflexes were still absent except for the
left biceps reflex. The patient was also free of fever and
the cough had significantly decreased. Fortunately, no in-
fections occurred in the medical staff as a result of strict
isolation measures in accordance with the most recent
recommendations of the Robert Koch Institute.
Discussion
The symptoms of COVID-19 range from mild unspecific
symptoms to severe lower respiratory tract symptoms
with pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS) and multiple organ failure [10]. There are
numerous reports about the neuroinvasive potential of
coronaviruses and an association between GBS and cor-
onavirus infections [9, 11, 12].
GBS is an acute immune-mediated, demyelinating polyra-
diculoneuropathy characterized by ascending flaccid paraly-
sis and reduced or absent muscle reflexes. GBS usually
occurs 2 to 4 weeks after a respiratory or digestive tract in-
fection. Typical pathogens include Campylobacter jejuni,
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Epstein-Barr-Virus, Cytomegalo-
virus and Zika virus [13]. The interval between the onset of
symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and first symptoms of
GBS was only 1 day in the case presented here. Due to the
chronological
sequence,
a
causal
relationship
can
be
assumed. Nevertheless, it cannot be ruled out that GBS may
have been caused by the respiratory infection 4 weeks
earlier, which had been successfully treated with antibiotics.
A case study of 5 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and
GBS was published a few weeks ago [14]. In this series the
first neurological symptoms also appeared already 5 to 10
days after the onset of the virus infection. Another case
report indicates a simultaneous occurrence of COVID-19
and GBS. Based on this observation, the authors discussed a
coincidence as well as a parainfectious pattern as already ob-
served in GBS associated with Zika virus [15, 16]. This is in
contrast with the typical postinfectious pathogenesis of GBS.
Possible explanations are that direct viral neuropathogenic
mechanisms may play a role or that an autoimmunological
process is induced before clinical symptoms of COVID-19
occur. The latter is supported by a mean incubation period
of 5 days up to a maximum of 14 days and the early onset of
infectivity (2.5 days before onset of symptoms) [17, 18].
In our case, a decrease in leukocytes was noted as
described for COVID-19 [4]. GBS is an immune-
mediated disease in which cross-reactions with myelin
and ganglioside antigens may play a central role in the
context of molecular mimicry [13]. Ganglioside anti-
bodies were not detectable in our patient. It is not yet
known whether SARS-CoV-2 may induce the formation
of specific antibodies against gangliosides.
Overall, both diseases, GBS and COVID-19, were mild
in the patient presented here. There was no loss of walk-
ing ability, no impairment of the autonomic nervous
system or a reduction of pulmonary vital capacity. Fur-
thermore, rapid recovery was achieved under therapy with
IVIG. At present, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral
therapy for COVID-19. Therefore, this immunotherapy,
which has been established in the treatment of auto-
immune and inflammatory diseases for many years, is cur-
rently evaluated as an adjuvant treatment of COVID-19.
First results suggest that IVIG and especially IVIG
collected from recovered COVID-19 patients have the
potential to neutralize SARS-CoV-2, thus posing a thera-
peutic option for critically ill patients [19, 20].
One important limitation of this case report is the
delayed testing for SARS-CoV-2 on the 5th day after
admission to hospital due to recommendations of the
Robert Koch Institute at that time. Another limitation is
the lack of PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in CSF.
There are still only a few reports of the neurological com-
plications of SARS-CoV-2 since the global outbreak a few
months ago. The present case underlines the importance to
be
aware
of
possible
neurological
manifestations
of
COVID-19. Moreover, it substantiates the evidence of a po-
tential association between SARS-CoV-2 and GBS. It is also
consistent with other publications which demonstrated
similar chronological patterns of neurologic symptoms
which differ from the classical postinfectious presentation
of GBS. However, additional studies are necessary to fur-
ther analyse and confirm these findings.
