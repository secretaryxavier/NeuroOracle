Abstract 
Objectives: This study investigated the effects of several conditioning methods on shear bond strength (SBS) and 
microleakage of orthodontic brackets bonded to demineralized enamel. 
Study Design: One hundred premolars were selected and immersed in a cariogenic solution for 12 weeks. The teeth 
were randomly assigned into 5 groups. In groups 1 and 2, the teeth underwent acid etching for 30 and 120 seconds, 
respectively. In group 3, a combination of laser and acid etching was employed. A self-etch primer (SEP) was 
applied in group 4 and in group 5, the teeth were exposed to acidulated phosphate Àuoride (APF) for 4 minutes be-
fore etching. After bracket bonding, the teeth were immersed in methylen blue for 12 hours and then were mounted 
in acrylic resin. SBS was determined with an Instron Universal Testing Machine and the amount of microleakage 
under the brackets was assessed under a stereomicroscope.
Results: The lowest SBS was related to the SEP group and the highest one was observed in the specimens prepared 
by APF+acid etching. There was a signi¿cant difference in SBS (p=0.009), but not in microleakage (p=0.971) of 
the study groups. The SBS of the specimens treated with SEP was signi¿cantly Lower than the other groups, which 
were not signi¿cantly different from each other. The SEP group displayed a higher frequency of bond failure at the 
enamel-adhesive interface. 
Conclusions: Enamel preparation with SEP provided the lowest SBS among the groups. All groups showed some 
degree of microleakage. There was no signi¿cant correlation between SBS and microleakage.
Key words: Bond strength, microleakage, bonding, self-etch primer, Er:YAG laser.

Microleakage and bond strength of brackets to hypomineralized enamel
Introduction
The success of the bracket bonding procedure depends 
on the surface characteristics of the enamel. Sometimes, 
patients seeking orthodontic treatment show hypomine-
ralized enamel because of environmental factors such 
as white spot lesions or due to a systemic condition ca-
lled molar-incisor hypomineralization (MIH). MIH has 
been de¿ned as hypomineralization of systemic origin in 
one to four permanent ¿rst molars, which is frequently 
accompanied with affected incisors (1). The teeth with 
hypomineralized defects usually show high failure rates 
of adhesives because the surface characteristics of the 
involved enamel prevent from achieving the etching pat-
terns observed in sound enamel (2,3). A previous study 
found that brackets bonded to teeth with demineralized 
enamel indicated signi¿cantly lower bond strength com-
pared to those attached to normal enamel (2). William 
et al. (3) reported that the enamel-adhesive interface 
in hypomineralized teeth was porous and with cracks, 
causing structural weakness. Therefore, searching for a 
supplementary surface preparation technique for rein-
forcing adhesion to hypomineralized enamel has been 
considered as an issue of interest. 
Previous studies demonstrated the occurrence of mi-
croleakage under orthodontic brackets bonded to sound 
enamel (4-6). This has been attributed to the polymeriza-
tion shrinkage of adhesive resins and also to the different 
rates of expansion and contraction of adhesive, teeth and 
brackets following exposure to the temperature changes 
in the mouth, which allows penetration of oral Àuids and 
bacteria within the gap created at the enamel-adhesive-
bracket complex (4,5). The risk of microleakage may be 
higher in patients with hypomineralized teeth because of 
the decreased adhesion to affected enamel. 
Different techniques have been suggested to improve 
the bonding interface of hypomineralized enamel. Some 
reports extended the etching time over the 30 seconds 
in order to increase bond strength of adhesives to affec-
ted enamel (7,8). William et al. (3) demonstrated better 
bonding of a self-etch adhesive than a total-etch system 
to teeth with molar incisor hypomineralization. Laser 
etching is another method of surface conditioning that 
can provide microporosities on the surface (9,10), and 
in combination with acid etching, it can provide bond 
strength values that are comparable or even higher than 
the conventional acid etching technique (11,12). It has 
also been demonstrated that Àuoride treatment followed 
by acid etching of enamel caries or hypomineralized 
enamel can produce etching patterns similar to those 
observed in etched sound enamel, while restoring the 
mineral lost during lesion formation (13,14).
There are controversial reports regarding the relations-
hip between microleakage and bond strength. In theory, 
the quality and strength of the bond should prevent from 
penetration of Àuids and bacteria under orthodontic 
brackets and thus decrease microleakage, but such a re-
lationship has not been con¿rmed by some authors (6). 
The purpose of the present study was to investigate the 
effects of several surface preparation methods on shear 
bond strength (SBS), mode of bond failure and micro-
leakage of brackets bonded to teeth with demineralized 
enamel and to assess any signi¿cant relationship bet-
ween SBS and microleakage.
Material and Methods 
One hundred premolar teeth extracted for orthodontic 
reasons were gathered and stored in saline solution until 
the time of the experiment. Teeth with caries, cracks, and 
developmental defects were excluded from the sample. 
All the teeth were immersed for 12 weeks in a cariogenic 
solution consisting of 2.2 mM CaCl2, 2.2 mM NaH2PO4, 
and 50 mM acetic acid (PH 4.8) to create demineralized 
enamel (15). This solution was replaced weekly. After 
that, the demineralized teeth were rinsed with tap water 
and randomly divided into ¿ve groups of 20 each. The 
buccal surfaces of the teeth in the experimental groups 
were cleaned with water slurry of pumice and rubber 
prophylactic cups for 5 seconds and then underwent the 
following surface preparation procedures:
Group 1 (control): The buccal surfaces of the deminera-
lized teeth were covered with a 37% phosphoric acid gel 
for 30 seconds, thoroughly rinsed with water and dried 
with an oil-free air source. The chalky-white appearance 
was observed after drying.
Group 2: The enamel surfaces were exposed to a 37% 
acid phosphoric gel which was applied for an extended 
period of 2 minutes. The teeth were then rinsed with a 
copious amount of water and air-dried.
Group 3:  An Er:YAG laser (wavelength 2940 nm; Smart 
2940 D, Deka Laser, Firenze, Italy) was used for condi-
tioning the enamel surface before the conventional acid 
etching process. The laser operated at 10 Hz, 150 mJ of 
energy, very short pulse and the bonding area was etched 
for 10 seconds using scanning movements. Procedures 
after laser conditioning were the same as that used in the 
control group.
Group 4: A mild self-etch primer (Clear¿l SE Bond, Ku-
raray Co. Ltd., Osaka, Japan) was applied for enamel 
preparation, according to the manufacturer’s recommen-
dations. 
Group 5: The demineralized enamel was covered with a 
suf¿cient thickness of acidulated phosphate Àuoride gel 
(Sultan Healthcare Inc., Englewood, New Jersey, USA) 
for 4 minutes, and then was rinsed for two consecutive 
periods of 5 minutes each to remove any readily-soluble 
reaction products (14). Conventional acid etching was 
later applied similar to the control group. 
After surface preparation, a thin coat of Transbond XT 
primer (3M Unitek, Monrovia, California, USA) was 
painted on the enamel surface. Stainless steel pre-adjus-

Microleakage and bond strength of brackets to hypomineralized enamel
ted edgewise upper premolar brackets (0.022-inch slot; 
Dentsply GAC International, Bohemia, NY, USA) with 
an average base area of 13.1 mm2 were used in this study. 
Each bracket was ¿rmly pressed at the middle of the cli-
nical crown using Transbond XT adhesive (3M Unitek), 
and the excess material was removed from around the 
base with a sharp explorer. The adhesive was polymeri-
zed from each of the occlusal, gingival, mesial and distal 
directions (10 seconds each) for a total of 40 seconds 
using a light-emitting diode (LED) device (Bluephase 
C8; Ivoclar Vivadent, Schaan, Liechtenstein) at power 
density of 650 mW/cm2.
After bonding, the specimens were stored in distilled 
water for at least 48 hours at 37oC and then subjected to 
a thermocycling process which was performed between 
5ºC to 55ºC for 500 cycles, with  dwell time of 30 se-
conds per bath. Microleakage was assessed by the dye 
penetration technique. For this purpose, the teeth apices 
were sealed with sticky wax and the entire surfaces of 
the teeth were covered by two consecutive layers of nail 
varnish up to 1 mm around the bracket margins. The spe-
cimens were then immersed in a solution of 1 per cent 
methylene blue dye for 12 hours at room temperature. 
After removing from the solution, the teeth were tho-
roughly rinsed, and then were mounted in plastic rings 
poured with self-curing acrylic resin, so that the buccal 
surfaces of the teeth were parallel to the direction of the 
debonding force. 
Shear bond strength (SBS) testing was performed in 
an Instron Universal Testing machine (Santam, model 
STM-20, Iran) using cross head speed of 1 mm per mi-
nute until failure. The force required to detach the bond 
was recorded in newtons and then was divided by the 
surface area of the bracket base to provide bond strength 
value in megapascals (N/mm2). 
After debonding, the teeth were examined by one ca-
librated examiner under a stereomicroscope (Dino-Lite 
Pro, Anmo Electronics Corp, Taiwan) at 20X magni¿-
cation and the deepest penetration of the dye under the 
brackets was measured in millimeter perpendicular to 
the bracket margin. To examine the measurement error, 
20% of the specimens were randomly selected and re-
examined with an interval of one week. The measure-
ment error was determined using the Dahlberg formula 
and the systemic error of the two measurements was as-
sessed by the Wilcoxon signed rank test.
The bonding interface was also examined with the ste-
reomicroscope at 10X magni¿cation to assess the mode 
of bond failure. This was determined on the basis of the 
amount of adhesive adhered to the enamel surface accor-
ding to the adhesive remnant index (ARI) of Artun and 
Bergland (16):
Score 0: no adhesive remained on the tooth, Score 1: less 
than 50% of the adhesive remained on the tooth, Score 
2: more than 50% of the adhesive was left on the tooth, 
Score 3: the entire adhesive remained on the tooth with 
distinct impression of the bracket base.
- Statistical analysis
The normality of the SBS data was con¿rmed by the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. One way analysis of varian-
ce was used to determine any signi¿cant difference in 
SBS values among the study groups, followed by Tukey 
multiple range test for pairwise comparisons. The ARI 
scores were analyzed with Fisher’s exact test and the di-
fference in microleakage values of the study groups was 
detected by Kruskal-Wallis test. Spearman’s rank corre-
lation test was used to assess any signi¿cant relationship 
between bond strength and microleakage. The data were 
analyzed by SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Scien-
ces, Version 16.0, Chicago, Illinois, USA) software and 
the level of signi¿cance was predetermined at p<0.05.
Results
The intra-examiner systemic error was not signi¿cant 
between the two microleakage assessments (p=0.217) 
with a measurement error of 0.37 mm. 
Table 1 displays the mean, standard deviation (SD) and 
range of the SBS values (MPa) and the results of statisti-
cal analysis for between-group comparison. The lowest 
SBS was related to the specimens prepared with the SEP 
and the highest one belonged to those treated with APF 
before conditioning. ANOVA displayed a signi¿cant di-
fference in bond strength of the study groups (p=0.009). 
Multiple comparisons by Turkey test revealed that the 
SBS of the specimens treated with the SEP was signi¿-
cantly lower than the other study groups, which were not 
signi¿cantly different from each other (Table 1).
The results for the ARI scores are demonstrated in table 
2. The Fisher’s exact test exhibited a signi¿cant diffe-
rence in the distribution of ARI scores among the stu-
dy groups (p<0.001). The specimens in the SEP group 
showed a higher frequency of bond failure at the enamel-
adhesive interface (no adhesive remained on the enamel) 
compared to the other study groups.
Table 3 indicates the descriptive statistics relating to the 
microleakage values of the study groups. All groups dis-
played some degree of microleakage beneath the brac-
kets. An example of microleakage has been illustrated 
in ¿gure 1. The statistical comparison by Kruskal-Wallis 
test exhibited no signi¿cant difference in microleakage 
among the study groups (Table 3).
The Spearman’s rank correlation coef¿cient revealed no 
signi¿cant relationship between bond strength and mi-
croleakage (r=-0.018, P=0.749).
Discussion
The present study investigated some methods to improve 
bond strength of brackets bonded to caries-like lesions of 
enamel. The bond strength of demineralized teeth treated 
with conventional acid etching was lower than those ob-

Microleakage and bond strength of brackets to hypomineralized enamel
tained after 2 minutes acid etching, laser + acid etching 
or APF treatment followed by acid etching, although 
the differences were not statistically signi¿cant. Laser 
etching followed by acid etching increased the bond 
strength of orthodontic brackets to some degree, but the 
bene¿t was negligible. We used laser etching in combi-
nation with acid etching because the ef¿cacy of laser et-
ching alone for enamel conditioning may be lower than 
the conventional acid etching technique. Laser etching 
can have bene¿ts in reducing decalci¿cation and future 
caries attack resulted from preparing enamel with phos-
phoric acid (17-19), although its caries-resistant bene¿t 
has been questioned by some authors (20).
The increased etching time can be a useful strategy to 
provide enough adhesion in teeth with enamel defects. 
In the present study, after increasing the etching time to 
2 minutes, the bond strength improved from 12.09 MPa 
to 13.36 MPa, but the difference was not statistically 
signi¿cant. Therefore, the bene¿t achieved from increa-
sed etching time in teeth with demineralized enamel is 
little, but this technique may be suitable in cases with 
other physicochemical alterations in the enamel struc-
ture. The disadvantages are the increased working time, 
which may be burdensome for the clinician as well as 
for the patients, and the risk of increased surface loss 
and further decalci¿cation of enamel around orthodontic 
attachments.
Self etch primers (SEP) are being popular in orthodontic 
treatments because they reduce chair time and simplify 
the bonding technique. Considering that the deminera-
lized teeth show lower mineral content than the sound 
enamel, creating a more conservative etching pattern 
and less enamel demineralization by using a SEP may be 
advantageous. William et al. (3) reported that the SBS of 
composite to hypomineralized enamel was higher when

Microleakage and bond strength of brackets to hypomineralized enamel
a self-etch adhesive was used instead of a total-etch sys-
tem. They proposed that SEP prevents from water trap 
in the porous lattice of hypomineralized enamel by omit-
ting the rinsing step, and it may also provide chemical 
adhesion in addition to the micromechanical retention to 
hydroxyapatite (3). In this study we used a mild self-etch 
primer commonly used in restorative treatments and 
although the resultant bond strength was signi¿cantly 
lower than that of the other study groups, it was conside-
red clinically acceptable.
In the present study, Àuoride treatment followed by 
acid etching of demineraized enamel produced the hig-
hest SBS in teeth with demineralized enamel. Previous 
studies found that Àuoride treatment followed by acid 
etching of caries-like lesions provided etching patterns 
that were suitable for adhesive placement, while creating 
a rapid supply of Àuoride for remineralization (13,14). 
Although Àuoride therapy prior to acid etching of de-
mineralized enamel enhanced the bond strength from 
12.09 to 14.24 MPa, but this increase was not statistica-
lly signi¿cant. This is in contrast to the ¿ndings of Sha-
habi et al. (2) who found that application of 2% sodium 
Àuoride (NaF) prior to acid etching of demineralized 
enamel caused a signi¿cant increase in bond strength of 
orthodontic brackets. This controversy may be related 
to the application of APF gel in this steady instead of a 
neutral Àuoride agent in the study of Shahabi et al. (2). 
The ¿ndings of the present study advocate the use of 
Àuoride agents before the bonding procedure in cases of 
enamel caries in order to reharden the enamel and create 
a hypermineralized surface layer which would be more 
resistant to caries progression (14). This may have great 
clinical implications when one considers the high pre-
valence (21) and the rapid development (22) of enamel 
caries in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment.
In the current study, all groups showed some degree of 
microleakage under orthodontic brackets with amounts 
ranging from 0.68 mm to 0.80 mm. Microleakage may 
result in clinical consequences such as formation of whi-
te spot lesions, enamel discoloration, corrosion and de-
creased bond strength of brackets. Microleakage under 
brackets bonded to demineralized enamel can aggravate 
the caries process initiated beforehand. A previous study 
found that microleakage at the enamel-adhesive interfa-
ce was greater in demineralized teeth compared to tho-
se with sound enamel, although the difference was not 
signi¿cant (23). In this study, the lowest microleakage 
value (0.68 mm) was observed in the standard acid et-
ching group and the highest one (0.80 mm) occurred in 
the laser + acid etching and APF + acid etching groups. 
However, the differences between groups were small 
and not statistically signi¿cant, indicating that none of 
the surface preparation techniques were able to cause 
a signi¿cant decrease in microleakage. This is in con-
trast to the ¿ndings of Moosavi et al. (23) who found 
that microleakage was signi¿cantly reduced after NaF 
treatment followed by acid etching of demineralized 
enamel. However, the method of sample preparation 
for microleakage assessment and the type of Àuoride 
agents they employed were different from those used in 
this study. The outcomes of this study are also in con-
trast with those of Hamamci et al. (24) who reported 
that enamel preparation with Er:YAG and Er,Cr:YSGG 
lasers resulted in signi¿cantly higher microleakage than 
when the standard acid-etching was used. Several au-
thors demonstrated signi¿cantly higher microleakage af-
ter application of a self etch primer for bonding brackets 
(23-25), but the results of this study using Clear¿l SE 
Bond did not agree with these authors.
The present study did not report a signi¿cant relations-
hip between SBS and microleakage. This may be becau-
se the SBS and microleakage values of the most study 
groups were close to each other and a wide range of va-
lues was not observed either in SBS or in microleaka-
ge. Although application of a self-etch primer caused a 
signi¿cant decrease in SBS, the microleakage value of 
this group was not statistically different from the other 
groups, indicating that microleakage is also inÀuenced 
by other factors than only the adequacy of adhesion to 
enamel structure. The ¿ndings of this study corroborate 
the results of James et al. (6) who demonstrated no sig-
ni¿cant correlation between SBS and microleakage of 
orthodontic brackets bonded with various adhesives and 
curing systems. In contrast, Abdelnaby et al. (26) found 
a signi¿cant reverse relationship between SBS and mi-
croleakage, although the correlation coef¿cient was re-
latively low (r=-0.318).
The ARI scores provide some insight into the bond fa-
ilure interface (27). In the present study, the ARI scores 
were signi¿cantly different among the study groups, in-
dicating the differences in the distribution of bond failu-
re interface. There was a higher percentage of ARI score 
0 (bond failure at the enamel-adhesive interface) in the 
specimens prepared by SEP compared to the other study 
groups. This can be ascribed to the inadequate adhesion 
of composite to enamel prepared by by the SEP, as re-
presented by the signi¿cantly lower bond strength. The 
bond failure in other study groups occurred mainly at the 
bracket-adhesive interface or within the adhesive itself.
In the present study, the SBS values of the study groups 
were higher than the 6-7.8 MPa, which is considered as 
the minimum SBS required in orthodontic clinical prac-
tice (28). The occurrence of microleakage although was 
small but warrants further attention to take measures 
to prevent enamel caries under orthodontic brackets. It 
should be noted that intraoral environment is different 
from laboratory conditions, so further clinical studies 
are suggested in this ¿eld.

Microleakage and bond strength of brackets to hypomineralized enamel
Conclusions
Some degree of microleakage occurred beneath brac-
kets in all groups, with no signi¿cant difference to each 
other.
Conditioning of demineralized enamel with phosphoric 
acid for 120 seconds had no signi¿cant effect on SBS 
and microleakage of brackets bonded to demineralized 
enamel.
Laser etching in combination with standard acid etching 
neither inÀuenced the SBS nor microleakage of brackets 
bonded to demineralized teeth.
Application of acidulated phosphate Àuoride for 4 min 
before acid etching of demineralized enamel produced 
the highest SBS among the study groups, but the diffe-
rence with most of the other groups was not statistically 
signi¿cant. Microleakage beneath the brackets was not 
affected by this procedure.
The SBS of brackets prepared with a self-etch primer 
was signi¿cantly lower than the other groups. The bond 
failure occurred predominantly at the enamel-adhesive 
interface.
There was no signi¿cant correlation between SBS and 
microleakage.
