Abstract
Tuberculosis (TB) is responsible for nearly 1.4 million deaths globally every year and continues to remain a serious threat to
human health. The problem is further complicated by the growing incidence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and
extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), emphasizing the need for the development of new drugs against this disease.
Phagosomal maturation arrest is an important strategy employed by Mycobacterium tuberculosis to evade the host immune
system. Secretory acid phosphatase (SapM) of M.tuberculosis is known to dephosphorylate phosphotidylinositol 3-
phosphate (PI3P) present on phagosomes. However, there have been divergent reports on the involvement of SapM in
phagosomal maturation arrest in mycobacteria. This study was aimed at reascertaining the involvement of SapM in
phagosomal maturation arrest in M.tuberculosis. Further, for the first time, we have also studied whether SapM is essential
for the pathogenesis of M.tuberculosis. By deleting the sapM gene of M.tuberculosis, we demonstrate that MtbDsapM is
defective in the arrest of phagosomal maturation as well as for growth in human THP-1 macrophages. We further show that
MtbDsapM is severely attenuated for growth in the lungs and spleen of guinea pigs and has a significantly reduced ability to
cause pathological damage in the host when compared with the parental strain. Also, the guinea pigs infected with
MtbDsapM exhibited a significantly enhanced survival when compared with M.tuberculosis infected animals. The importance
of SapM in phagosomal maturation arrest as well as in the pathogenesis of M.tuberculosis establishes it as an attractive
target for the development of new therapeutic molecules against tuberculosis.

Introduction
Inspite of a rapid advancement in our understanding of the
biology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the success towards the control
of tuberculosis (TB) has been less than satisfactory as is evident
from ,9 million new cases of the disease that still occur globally
every year [1]. The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and
extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains of the pathogen and the
rising number of HIV-TB co-infections have made the situation
even more precarious. There are an estimated 440,000 new cases
of MDR-TB, 25,000 cases of XDR-TB and 1.1 million cases of
TB-HIV co-infection globally every year [1,2]. Despite the
multitude of immune defense mechanisms that the host deploys
against M.tuberculosis, the pathogen can continue to persist owing to
its subtle tactics [3]. M.tuberculosis is inhaled via the droplet nuclei
and then taken up by alveolar macrophages [3]. The outcome of
the infection largely depends on the interaction between the host
and the pathogen, especially within the macrophages [4]. There
are several ways in which M.tuberculosis modulates the macrophage
defenses to promote its own survival and the inhibition of
phagosomal maturation is one of the best characterized mecha-
nisms [4,5,6,7].
Phagolysosomal fusion requires the presence of phosphotidyli-
nositol 3-phosphate (PI3P) on the phagosomes [8]. This lipid
component is involved in the docking of rab effector proteins such
as early endosomal autoantigen 1 (EEA1) and hepatocyte growth
factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) that are important
for
phagosomal
maturation
[8,9,10].
SapM
is
a
secretory
phosphatase that has been demonstrated to dephosphorylate
PI3P [11,12]. However, several studies have presented divergent
observations regarding the involvement of SapM in arresting
phagosomal maturation in mycobacteria [11,13,14]. Based on a
study with BCG, it has been reported that phagosomes that
harbour killed BCG persistently carry PI3P, however, PI3P is
removed from the phagosomes that harbour live BCG [11]. An
in vitro fusion assay in the presence of purified SapM protein from
M.tuberculosis, which has been demonstrated to hydrolyse PI3P,
further suggested that SapM inhibits phagosome-late endosome
fusion in vitro [11]. Based on these observations SapM has been
implicated in phagosome maturation arrest in M.tuberculosis [11].
However, contradictory observations on the role of SapM in

phagosomal maturation arrest have also emanated from the
colocalization
experiments
which
employed
Mf4/4
murine
macrophages infected with either BCG or its sapM mutant and
led to the observation that SapM is not necessary for the arrest of
phagosome maturation in BCG [14]. Further, it has been reported
that BCG and its sapM mutant exhibit no significant difference in
the survival and replication in macrophages [14]. However, based
on the phagosomal maturation studies involving the infection of
THP-1 macrophages with wild-type M.tuberculosis and its fbpA
mutant (DfbpA), sapM mutant (DsapM) as well as double knock out
mutant (DsapMDfbpA), it has been reported that the double knock
out strain was extensively colocalized with the lysosomal markers
followed by DsapM, DfbpA and the parental strain, indicating
thereby the involvement of SapM in the phagosomal maturation
arrest [13]. Thus, the role of SapM in arresting the phagosomal
maturation still remains a question that has not been answered
beyond doubt. More importantly, there has been no study to
evaluate the role of SapM at genetic level by employing the sapM
mutant of M.tuberculosis and conducting animal experiments to
show the role of SapM in the pathogenesis of M.tuberculosis. To
demonstrate the function of a gene in the phenomena such as
phagosomal maturation and its consequential influence on the
host-pathogen interaction and pathogenesis of M.tuberculosis, it
would be desirable that the in vitro studies be supported by animal
experiments in a relevant model and Koch’s postulates be satisfied.
In this study, we have employed a sapM mutant of M.tuberculosis
along with the parental strain to reascertain the involvement of
SapM in phagosomal maturation arrest. Further, we have
evaluated the influence of sapM mutation on the growth and
pathogenesis of M.tuberculosis in guinea pigs.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Growth Conditions
Escherichia coli strains XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, Heidelberg,
Germany) and HB101 (Life Technologies, CA, USA) were used
for cloning and were grown in Luria-Berteni (LB) broth or on LB
agar. Mycobacterial strains were grown on Middlebrook (MB)
7H11 agar supplemented with 10% OADC (oleic-acid albumin
dextrose catalase) and 0.2% glycerol or in MB7H9 broth
supplemented with 10% ADC (albumin dextrose catalase), 0.2%
glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80 at 37uC with shaking at 200 rpm.
For the generation of mutants, M.tuberculosis Erdman transformed
with pJV53 and thereby overexpressing the recombineering
proteins that enhance the frequency of genetic recombination
was employed, as described previously [15]. Thus, for all the
experiments carried out in this study, we have used M.tuberculosis
Erdman/pJV53 as the parental strain. Kanamycin and chloram-
phenicol were used at concentrations of 25 mg/ml and 30 mg/ml,
respectively. Hygromycin was used at a concentration of 50 mg/ml
for mycobacteria or at 150 mg/ml for E.coli.
Disruption of sapM in M.tuberculosis and Genetic
Complementation of the Mutant
Primers SapM-F1 (59 aatattggggtaccaccatcgggtcaagcacc 39) and
SapM-R1 (59 ttaatatctagaatgatggcggcctgcgagc 39) were designed to
amplify Amplicon I (699 bp), comprising of 200 bp 59 proximal
region of sapM and 499 bp sequence immediately upstream to
sapM, while the primers SapM-F2 (59 aatattccgctcgagcttgtgacctgg-
gacgaag 39) and SapM-R2 (59 ttgatcgactagtctcgaattccagcgtttattg
39) were used for the amplification of Amplicon II (701 bp),
comprising of 200 bp 39 distal region of sapM and 501 bp
sequence immediately downstream to sapM. The amplicons I and
II were PCR amplified and cloned into the vector pYUB854
flanking the hygromycin resistance cassette at KpnI/XbaI and
XhoI/SpeI restriction sites, respectively, to generate pYUBDsapM
[16]. A 3.4 kb fragment (DsapM::hyg), was excised from pYUBD-
sapM by employing KpnI/SpeI and the resulting linear Allelic
Exchange Substrate (AES) was electroporated into M.tuberculosis as
described earlier to generate the sapM mutant of M.tuberculosis
(MtbDsapM) [15].
To facilitate genetic complementation of the MtbDsapM,
primers SapM-F3 (59 gatatcggatcccagcgctgcccggaagccggcgttgtc
39) and SapM-R (59 gatatcggatccctagtcgccccaaatatcggttattg 39)
were designed to amplify the sapM gene (900 bp) along with
200 bp region upstream of the SapM translational start site,
containing the sapM promoter. This region (1.1 kb) was PCR
amplified and cloned into the BamHI site of the mycobacterial
shuttle vector, pSD7 [17]. The resulting plasmid pSD7.SapM, was
introduced into MtbDsapM mutant by electroporation to generate
the complemented strain, MtbDsapMComp. For the confirmation
of disruption of sapM by PCR amplification, primers SapM-F (59
tcggcgctgtcccacaagtg 39) and SapM-R were employed.
Determination of Phosphatase Activity
Acid phosphatase activity of SapM was determined by using an
end point assay based on the detection of p-nitrophenol formed by
using
the
substrate
p-nitrophenyl
phosphate
(pNPP)
(Sisco
Research Laboratories Pvt. Ltd., Maharashtra, India) [12]. Briefly,
120 mg of mycobacterial culture filtrate (A600 nm of 0.8), were
separately incubated with 20 mM pNPP in 50 mM Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 7.0) at 37uC for 20 min in dark (in a reaction volume of
500 ml). The absorbance was measured at 405 nm after addition of
500 ml of 1 M NaOH. Enzyme activity (U) was calculated by using
the formula U (nmol/min/mg) = [E.Vtotal]/[t.e.d.mg of Culture
filtrate] [where E is the mean (OD) of sample minus mean (OD) of
blank (at 405 nm), Vtotal is the total sample volume (1000 ml), t is
incubation time (20 min), e is the extinction coefficient for pNPP
(17.8 nM21 cm21) and d is the pathlength of light (1 cm)] [12].
Infection of Human THP-1 Macrophages and Bacterial
Enumeration
Human monocytic THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI-
GlutaMAXTM medium [containing 10% heat inactivated fetal
bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic mix] (GIBCO
Invitrogen Life Technologies, NY, USA) at 37uC in 5% CO2 and
infected as described previously [18]. Briefly, THP-1 macrophages
were seeded at 56105 cells per well in 24-well tissue culture plates
and differentiated to macrophages by using 30 nM phorbol 12-
myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma, MO, USA) for 16 h at 37uC
in 5% CO2. Cells were washed with RPMI medium and rested for
2 h before infection in 1 ml RPMI medium supplemented with
10% FBS. The monolayers were infected with M.tuberculosis strains
separately, at a multiplicity of infection of 1 bacterium per 3 THP-
1 macrophages for 4 h at 37uC in triplicates, following which the
monolayers were washed twice with the medium. Subsequently,
extracellular bacteria were removed by treatment with 200 mg/ml
amikacin for 2 h at 37uC. On days 0 (6 h), 2, 4 and 6, the infected
macrophage monolayers (three wells per strain) were lysed with
1 ml of 0.025% SDS (Sigma, MO, USA) to release intracellular
mycobacteria, which were then enumerated by plating serial
dilutions on MB7H11 agar. Colonies were counted after 4 weeks
of incubation at 37uC and the data was expressed as CFU/ml.

Study of Phagosomal Maturation by using Confocal
Microscopy
M.tuberculosis strains were labeled with Fluorescein isothiocya-
nate (FITC) (Sigma, MO, USA) as described previously with
minor modifications [19,20,21]. Briefly, the M.tuberculosis cultures
were grown to A600 nm of 0.5. The culture was harvested, washed
twice with 0.5 M sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.5) and
resuspended in the same buffer supplemented with 100 mg/ml
FITC followed by an overnight incubation at 4uC. To evaluate the
effect of FITC labeling on bacterial viability, M.tuberculosis cultures
without the addition of FITC were subjected to similar treatments
as described above and used as control. Thereafter, the bacteria
were pelleted, washed twice with PBS (pH 7.4) and resuspended in
RPMI-GlutaMAXTM medium containing 10% FBS. At the time
of infection, the CFU was determined for FITC labeled and
unlabelled M.tuberculosis cultures. Macrophages were seeded on
poly-L-lysine (Sigma, MO, USA) coated glass coverslips within a
12-well plate at a density of 7.56105 macrophages per well,
activated by addition of PMA and infected separately with
7.56106 FITC labeled mycobacteria as described above. After a
4 h incubation, the THP-1 cells were washed twice with fresh
RPMI media and treated with 200 mg/ml amikacin for 2 h at
37uC to remove extracellular bacteria. Subsequently, the THP-1
cells were incubated with 50 nM Lysotracker red DND-99
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, CA, USA) in RPMI (supplemented
with 10% FBS) for 1 h. After this 7 h post infection period, the
THP-1
cells
were
once
washed
with
fresh
RPMI
media
(supplemented with 10% FBS) and fixed with 4% paraformalde-
hyde in PBS. Coverslips were mounted by using ProLongH Gold
antifade reagent (Invitrogen Life Technologies, CA, USA) and
analysed by using Leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning
microscope (Leica Microsystems, Mannheim, Germany). The
fraction of FITC labelled mycobacteria that colocalized with
LysoTracker was determined by analyzing ,100 phagosomes
(combined from at least five random fields) from three indepen-
dent experiments. At the time of proceeding for the fixation of
THP-1 cells infected with either M.tuberculosis or MtbDsapM or
MtbDsapMComp for evaluation under confocal microscope, the
cells from duplicate wells in each case were lysed and plated on
MB7H11 agar for bacterial enumeration.
In vivo Guinea Pig Experiments
Pathogen-free out-bred female guinea pigs of the Duncan-
Hartley strain (250 to 350 g) were obtained from the Disease Free
Small Animal House Facility, Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana
Agricultural University, Hisar, India. The animals were main-
tained in a biosafety level 3 facility at University of Delhi South
Campus. To study the influence of sapM mutation on the growth
and pathogenesis of M.tuberculosis, guinea pigs were infected by the
aerosol route with 10 to 30 bacilli of either M.tuberculosis,
MtbDsapM or MtbDsapMComp. Animals (n = 5) were euthanized
at 4, 10 and 16 weeks post-infection by CO2 asphyxiation for
bacterial enumeration in the lungs and spleen of infected animals.
After dissecting the animals, the pathological investigations were
carried out in the infected animals by: (i) visual scoring of gross
lesions in the lung, liver and spleen and (ii) measurement of
granulomatous inflammation in the histopathological sections of
lung and liver.
The gross pathological damage was assessed by employing a
scoring system as described previously [22]. Briefly, Mitchison’s
virulence scoring system was modified and equal emphasis was
given to every organ for visual scoring of lesions in lung, liver and
spleen of guinea pigs infected with different strains of M.tuberculosis
[22,23]. Based on the extent of involvement of the organ, number
and size of tubercles, areas of inflammation and damage due to
necrosis, gross pathological scores were graded from 1–4 [22]. The
organs displaying minimal, scanty, moderate or heavy involve-
ment were scored as 1, 2, 3 or 4, respectively and represented
graphically [22].
For histopathological evaluation, the right lung and a portion of
left dorsal lobe of liver from the infected animals were removed
and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. 5 mm thick sections from the
formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissues were stained with
haematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The tissues were coded and the
coded samples were evaluated under a light microscope by a
certified pathologist having no knowledge of the experimental
groups. Pulmonary and hepatic granuloma consolidations were
graphically represented as % granuloma as described earlier [22].
To study the influence of disruption of sapM on the survival of
infected animals, guinea pigs (n = 10) were infected as described
above with either M.tuberculosis, MtbDsapM or MtbDsapMComp.
During the time period for which the survival was monitored,
animals were regularly examined for change in body weight and
general body condition as an indicator of disease progression.
Ethics Statement
Protocols for all the animal experiments included in this
manuscript along with the requirement of guinea pigs were
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics
Committee of University of Delhi South Campus, New Delhi,
India (Ref. No. 1/IAEC/AKT/BIOCHEM/UDSC/14.10.2011).
All animals were routinely cared for according to the guidelines of
the CPCSEA (Committee for the Purpose of Control and
Supervision of Experiments on Animals). The guinea pigs were
euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation and all efforts were made to
minimize animal suffering.
Statistical Analyses
For the comparisons between the groups for the determination
of (i) phosphatase activity in the mycobacterial culture filtrates, (ii)
phagosomal maturation in the infected THP-1 cells and (iii)
bacillary load in the lungs or spleen of infected guinea pigs, one-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Tukey post test was
employed. For the comparison of growth of mycobacterial strains
in THP-1 cells, two-way ANOVA with the Bonferroni multiple
comparison test was employed. For comparisons between the
groups for the analyses of gross pathological and histopathological
damage, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the
Mann-Whitney U test was employed. Survival of guinea pigs was
analyzed by using the log-rank (Mantel-Cox) Test. Differences
were considered significant when P,0.05. For the statistical
analysis and generation of graphs, Prism 5 software (version 5.01;
GraphPad Software Inc., CA) was used.
Results
Construction and Characterization of sapM Mutant of
M.tuberculosis
To
evaluate
the
role
of
SapM
in
the
physiology
and
pathogenesis of M.tuberculosis, we constructed a sapM mutant of
M.tuberculosis (MtbDsapM). Disruption of sapM was confirmed by
three different approaches. Firstly, we carried out PCR amplifi-
cations by employing the primers SapM-F and SapM-R (Fig. 1A).
DNA from M.tuberculosis yielded a PCR product of 0.8 kb while
the DNA from MtbDsapM resulted in a PCR product of 2.2 kb
corresponding to replacement of a 500 bp region in the targeted
gene by hygromycin resistance cassette (,1.9 kb) (Fig. 1A).
Secondly, the above amplification products were subjected to

DNA sequencing that further confirmed the disruption of sapM in
MtbDsapM. Thirdly, the disruption of sapM was further confirmed
by immunoblot analysis by employing SapM specific polyclonal
antibodies (Fig. 1B). In the case of M.tuberculosis, the immunoblot
analysis by using the culture filtrate confirmed the presence of
SapM as a 28 kDa band. This 28 kDa band was absent in the
immunoblot analysis carried out with the culture filtrate from the
mutant
strain.
Complementation
of
sapM
in
the
case
of
MtbDsapMComp was confirmed by the restoration of 28 kDa
SapM band when the culture filtrate from this strain was subjected
to immunoblot analysis.
Further, we evaluated the phosphatase activity of SapM in
mycobacterial culture filtrates by measuring the conversion of p-
nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) into p-nitrophenol (pNP). We
detected the presence of phosphatase activity in the culture filtrate
of M.tuberculosis (9 pmol/min/mg), while the activity of SapM was
absent from the culture filtrate of MtbDsapM (Fig. 1C). However,
the activity was restored when the MtbDsapM was complemented
with sapM gene on a plasmid (35.9 pmol/min/mg) and was in fact,
4 fold higher than the parental strain. pSD7 plasmid used for the
complementation has an origin of replication from M.fortuitum and
is reported to maintain a copy number of 3 to 5 in mycobacteria
[17,24]. The higher activity of SapM in the culture filtrate of
MtbDsapMComp when compared with the activity observed in the
culture filtrate of the parental strain may be attributable to the
higher gene dosage due to copy number of the complementation
plasmid [17].
Figure 1. Characterization of MtbDsapM mutant. (A) Confirmation of sapM gene deletion in M.tuberculosis by PCR. PCR was carried out by
employing primers SapM-F and SapM-R to obtain 0.8 kb amplification in M.tuberculosis (lane 2) and 2.2 kb amplification in MtbDsapM (lane 3). 100 bp
and lHindIII markers were loaded in lanes 1 and 4, respectively. (B) Confirmation of sapM deletion in M.tuberculosis and complementation of sapM
gene in the mutant by immunoblot analysis. 10 mg of culture filtrate of M.tuberculosis (lane 1), MtbDsapM (lane 2) and MtbDsapMComp (lane 3) were
loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis. Anti-SapM polyclonal antibody was employed to detect SapM that migrated as
a protein band corresponding to a molecular mass of 28 kDa in the culture filtrate of M.tuberculosis (lane 1) and MtbDsapMComp (lane 3) while the
disruption of sapM in MtbDsapM (lane 2) was confirmed by the absence of protein expression. (C) Disruption of sapM results in the loss of
phosphatase activity. 120 mg of culture filtrate from M.tuberculosis, MtbDsapM and MtbDsapMComp were incubated with 20 mM pNPP and
absorbance was measured at 405 nm as described in the materials and methods. Phosphatase activity was detected in M.tuberculosis and
MtbDsapMComp. However, no activity was obtained in MtbDsapM. Data is the mean (6SE) of 3 independent experiments carried out in triplicates.

growth of any strain. The values of absorbance are represented as the mean (6SE) of two independent experiments carried out in duplicates.

In addition, when the growth characteristics of these M.tuber-
culosis strains were assessed under standard culture conditions in
MB7H9 media, MtbDsapM displayed no significant difference in
growth when compared with M.tuberculosis or MtbDsapMComp
(Fig. 1D). Thus, SapM was dispensable for in vitro growth of
M.tuberculosis in MB7H9 medium.
MtbDsapM Exhibits Attenuated Growth in Human THP-1
Macrophages
Intracellular
growth
of
M.tuberculosis,
MtbDsapM
and
MtbDsapMComp was compared in THP-1 macrophages. M.tuber-
culosis grew normally in THP-1 macrophages till 6 days post-
infection. A significant difference was observed in the growth of
MtbDsapM in comparison to the parental strain at 2 days post-
infection corresponding to a 3 fold reduction in CFU. Further, the
growth was followed up to 6 days and it was observed that the
difference in the growth between MtbDsapM and the parental
strain became wider with the passage of time. The growth of
MtbDsapMComp was similar to M.tuberculosis at 4 and 6 days post-
infection (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrate the importance of
sapM in the growth of the pathogen in the human THP-1
macrophages.
SapM is Indispensable for Phagosomal Maturation Arrest
in THP-1 Macrophages
We
investigated
the
involvement
of
SapM
in
arresting
phagosomal maturation by studying the colocalization of FITC
labelled M.tuberculosis strains with LysoTracker Red, an acidotropic
dye that freely permeates cell membranes and remains trapped in
acidic compartments such as late endosomal and lysosomal
organelles upon protonation [25,26]. The FITC labeling protocol
used in this study did not affect the survival of M.tuberculosis as
similar bacterial CFU were obtained on plating the samples from
FITC labeled and unlabelled bacteria (used as a control for
labeling) on MB7H11 agar, at the end of the overnight incubation
(data not shown). We observed that only 23.1% and 22.72% of
FITC labeled M.tuberculosis and MtbDsapMComp bacteria coloca-
lized with LysoTracker rich compartments in THP-1 cells,
respectively, indicating an efficient arrest of phagosomal matura-
tion
(Fig.

Influence of sapM deletion on the growth of M.tuberculosis in THP-1 cells. THP-1 cells were infected with M.tuberculosis, MtbDsapM and
MtbDsapMComp separately at an MOI of 1:3 (bacteria:macrophage). The number of intracellular viable bacteria were determined on each alternative
day for 6 days. A significant attenuation in the growth of MtbDsapM in comparison to M.tuberculosis and MtbDsapMComp was observed from second
day post-infection. The growth of MtbDsapMComp was comparable to M.tuberculosis. The values are represented as the mean (6SE) of three
independent infections and the experiment was repeated three times. ***, P,0.001 (Two way ANOVA). (B) Increased localization of MtbDsapM in
LysoTracker labeled compartments in THP-1 macrophages. Macrophages were infected with FITC labelled M.tuberculosis, MtbDsapM and
MtbDsapMComp (green) separately. After a 4 h incubation, the THP-1 cells were washed twice with fresh RPMI media and treated with 200 mg/ml
amikacin for 2 h at 37uC to remove extracellular bacteria. Subsequently, the THP-1 cells were incubated with 50 nM Lysotracker red in RPMI
(supplemented with 10% FBS) for 1 h. After this 7 h post infection period, the THP-1 cells were once washed with fresh RPMI media and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS and observed under confocal microscope as described in the materials and methods. Representative fluorescent images
depict that disruption of sapM lead to accumulation of MtbDsapM in acidified organelles (overlap of green and red images appears yellow) while the

LysoTracker red when compared with the phagosomes containing either M.tuberculosis (23.1%) or MtbDsapMComp (22.72%). Data is the mean (6SE)

colocalization of MtbDsapM (86.57%) was observed with Lyso-

ability of M.tuberculosis to arrest phagosomal maturation. The
possibility that the phagosomal maturation observed in the case of
MtbDsapM may be a result of attenuation in its growth was ruled
out by determination of CFU from various samples. For this, at the
time of proceeding for the fixation of THP-1 cells infected with
either M.tuberculosis or MtbDsapM or MtbDsapMComp with
paraformaldehyde for evaluation under confocal microscope, the
infected THP-1 cells from duplicate wells in each case were lysed
and plated on MB7H11 agar for bacterial enumeration. We
recovered a comparable number of CFU in all three cases. These
results indicate that the mutation of sapM gene did not affect the
growth of the pathogen after 7 h of infection and the inability of
MtbDsapM to arrest the phagosomal maturation was due to the
absence of SapM. These results demonstrate the importance of
SapM in M.tuberculosis for the arrest of phagosomal maturation.
Disruption of SapM Renders M.tuberculosis Severely
Attenuated for Growth in Guinea Pig Tissues
In order to elucidate the importance of SapM in the growth of
M.tuberculosis in the host, we have employed guinea pig model of
experimental tuberculosis. Guinea pigs were infected with 10–30
bacilli of M.tuberculosis, MtbDsapM or MtbDsapMComp separately
by using aerosol route of infection and euthanized at 4, 10 and 16
weeks post-infection. At 4 weeks post-infection, the bacillary load
in the lungs of M.tuberculosis infected guinea pigs and MtbDsapM-
Comp infected guinea pigs corresponded to 5.93 log10 CFU and
5.53 log10 CFU, respectively. However, the bacillary load in the
lungs of MtbDsapM infected guinea pigs was significantly lower
(5.0 log10 CFU) which was 0.93 log10 CFU and 0.53 log10 CFU
less than the bacillary load in the lungs of M.tuberculosis infected
animals
(P,0.001)
and
MtbDsapMComp
infected
animals
(P,0.05), respectively (Fig. 3A). At this time point, the spleen of
M.tuberculosis infected guinea pigs and MtbDsapMComp infected
guinea pigs exhibited a bacillary load of 5.06 log10 CFU and 4.37
log10 CFU, respectively. The splenic bacillary load in MtbDsapM
infected guinea pigs was significantly less (3.62 log10 CFU) when
compared with the splenic bacillary load in M.tuberculosis infected
guinea
pigs
(1.44
log10
CFU
fewer
bacilli,
P,0.001)
or
MtbDsapMComp infected guinea pigs (0.75 log10 CFU fewer
bacilli, P,0.05) (Fig. 3A).
At 10 weeks post-infection, the bacillary load in the lungs of
M.tuberculosis infected animals and MtbDsapMComp infected
animals corresponded to 5.75 log10 CFU and 4.7 log10 CFU,
respectively. However, the MtbDsapM infected animals exhibited a
significantly reduced pulmonary bacillary load (3.14 log10 CFU) as
compared to M.tuberculosis infected animals (2.61 log10 CFU fewer
bacilli, P,0.001) and MtbDsapMComp infected animals (1.56
log10 CFU fewer bacilli, P,0.001) (Fig. 3B). The infection of
guinea pigs with M.tuberculosis or MtbDsapMComp resulted in a
splenic bacillary load of 4.47 log10 CFU and 3.06 log10 CFU,
respectively. However, at this time point, we did not recover any
bacilli from the spleens of guinea pigs infected with MtbDsapM
(Fig. 3B).
When the post-challenge period was extended to 16 weeks, the
bacillary load in the lungs of M.tuberculosis infected animals and
MtbDsapMComp infected animals corresponded to 5.7 log10 CFU
and 4.69 log10 CFU, respectively. However, at this time point no
MtbDsapM bacilli were recovered from the lungs of the infected
animals (Fig. 3C). The animals infected with M.tuberculosis or with
MtbDsapMComp exhibited a splenic bacillary load of 4.72 log10
CFU and 3.14 log10 CFU, respectively. As observed at 10 weeks
time point, no bacilli were recovered from the spleens of the
guinea pigs infected with MtbDsapM (Fig. 3C). The complete
absence of bacilli from the lungs and spleens of the animals
infected with MtbDsapM at both 10 and 16 weeks post-infection
demonstrates that SapM plays an important role in the growth of
M.tuberculosis in the host.
Disruption of sapM Results in a Significantly Reduced
Gross Pathological Damage
We assessed the influence of disruption of sapM on the ability of
M.tuberculosis to cause disease and pathology. The trend observed
in pulmonary and splenic bacillary load was substantiated by the
gross pathological changes. At 4 weeks post-infection, the lungs of
the animals infected with either M.tuberculosis or MtbDsapMComp
displayed moderate involvement with occasional large tubercles.
The lungs of the animals infected with MtbDsapM were inflamed
and displayed small-sized tubercles. The gross pathological scores
for the lungs of MtbDsapM infected guinea pigs were significantly
less (P,0.05) than the corresponding scores in M.tuberculosis or
Figure 3. Disruption of sapM in M.tuberculosis leads to the

MtbDsapM exhibited a significantly reduced bacillary load in the lungs
as well as spleen when compared with the animals infected with either
M.tuberculosis or MtbDsapMComp. Each data point represents the Log10

MtbDsapM Comp infected animals. The hepatic and splenic
tissues of animals infected with any of the M.tuberculosis strains
exhibited moderate involvement with predominantly scanty and
extremely small necrotic lesions. No significant differences were
observed in the gross pathological scores for liver and spleen of
guinea pigs infected with M.tuberculosis, MtbDsapM or MtbDsapM-
Comp (data not shown).
At 10 weeks post-infection, the animals infected with either
M.tuberculosis or MtbDsapMComp exhibited enhanced pathological
damage in the organs than at 4 weeks post-infection (Fig. 4). The
guinea
pigs
infected
with
M.tuberculosis
exhibited
extensive
involvement of lungs with the presence of numerous large and
small tubercles. Numerous small-sized tubercles were observed in
the liver while the spleens were characterized by enlargement in
size with numerous large coalescing tubercles and occasional
attrition of capsular structure. The organs of MtbDsapMComp
infected
animals
also exhibited
extensive involvement
with
numerous large sized tubercles effacing the entire organs.
Noticeably, MtbDsapM infected guinea pigs exhibited a signifi-
cantly reduced pathological damage in comparison to the
M.tuberculosis or MtbDsapMComp infected guinea pigs. Predomi-
nantly scanty and small tubercles were observed in the lungs of
animals infected with MtbDsapM when compared with the lungs of
the animals infected with M.tuberculosis (P,0.01) or MtbDsapM-
Comp (P,0.05). Moreover, liver and spleen of MtbDsapM infected
animals also exhibited a significant reduction in the pathological
damage as compared to M.tuberculosis (P,0.05) or MtbDsapM-
Comp infected animals (P,0.01) (Fig. 4).
At 16 weeks post-infection, 1 out of 5 animals infected with
M.tuberculosis succumbed to the disease while the remaining
animals displayed extensive pathological damage (Fig. 5). The
lungs
of
these
animals
were
edematous,
characterized
by
numerous
large
sized
coalescing
and
suppurative
tubercles
distributed throughout the lungs. The M.tuberculosis infected
animals were characterized by extensive involvement of liver with
numerous large tubercles and splenomegaly. In addition, scattered
areas of necrosis were observed both in the liver and spleen. The
lungs, liver, and spleen of guinea pigs infected with MtbDsapM-
Comp
exhibited
heavy
involvement
with
the
presence
of
numerous large tubercles. Noticeably, the organs of MtbDsapM
infected guinea pigs displayed a minimal involvement in compar-
ison to the organs of M.tuberculosis infected guinea pigs (P,0.05)
with presence of only a few visible tubercles and no manifestation
of tissue damage. The gross pathological scores of organs from the
MtbDsapM infected animals were significantly less in comparison
to the corresponding scores from MtbDsapMComp infected
animals [lungs (P,0.05), liver (P,0.01) and spleen (P,0.05)]
(Fig. 5). Hence, the pathological damage observed in the organs of
animals infected with various strains was in agreement with the
bacillary load recovered from the organs.
MtbDsapM Displays a Diminution in Granulomatous
Inflammation
Histopathological analysis of lung and liver sections further
substantiated the gross pathological observations. At 4 weeks post-
infection, guinea pigs infected with M.tuberculosis or MtbDsapM-
Comp exhibited scattered areas of granulomatous inflammation
encompassing ,36% and ,28% of the lung section, respectively,
with no significant differences observed between these two groups.
However, the lungs of MtbDsapM infected animals exhibited a
significant decrease (P,0.05) in the pathological damage in
comparison to the lungs of the M.tuberculosis infected animals
encompassing ,17% of lung area. No significant differences were
observed amongst the livers of the infected animals belonging to
any of the groups (data not shown).
At 10 weeks post-infection, animals infected with M.tuberculosis
exhibited numerous coalescing granulomas, covering ,50% area
of the lung sections (Fig. 6). In the animals infected with
MtbDsapMComp, foci of numerous granulomatous lesions were
observed encompassing ,30% of the lung area. However, the
granulomatous inflammation in MtbDsapM infected animals was
significantly less (P,0.01), corresponding to only ,8% lung
consolidation due to the presence of few small and discrete
granulomas, when compared with M.tuberculosis or MtbDsapM-
Comp infected animals. The lungs of the MtbDsapM infected
animals, showed well-preserved alveolar spaces with only a few
scattered areas of diffused infiltration. The pathological changes in
the liver of animals infected with MtbDsapM displayed a
significantly reduced granulomatous infiltration (,5.2%) when
compared with M.tuberculosis (,39%, P,0.05) or MtbDsapMComp
(,28%, P,0.01) infected animals (Fig. 6).
At 16 weeks post-infection, the animals infected with M.tuber-
culosis exhibited multiple coalescing foci of necrotic granulomas
(,70%) effacing the pulmonary parenchyma (Fig. 7). Lungs of the
animals infected with MtbDsapMComp displayed ,46% lung
consolidation. In these groups, extensive necrosis resulted in the
loss of lung micro-architecture. In contrast, the pulmonary tissue
organization was restored in the animals infected with MtbDsapM
with negligible pathological damage in comparison to M.tuberculosis
or
MtbDsapMComp
infected
animals
(,2.4%
granuloma,
P,0.05). On comparing the pathological changes in liver,
extensive granulomatous infiltration in the hepatic lobules was
observed in guinea pigs infected with either M.tuberculosis (,66%)
or MtbDsapMComp (,46%). Negligible granulomatous infiltra-
tion (,1.2%) was observed in the case of MtbDsapM infected
animals, in comparison to the liver of guinea pigs infected with
M.tuberculosis (P,0.05) or MtbDsapMComp (P,0.001). Architec-
ture of hepatic lobules was completely preserved in the case of
MtbDsapM infected animals (Fig. 7). The negligible histopatho-
logical damage in the tissues of the animals infected with
MtbDsapM demonstrates that SapM is crucial for the pathogenesis
of M.tuberculosis in the host tissues.
Guinea Pigs Infected with sapM Mutant of M.tuberculosis
Exhibit a Longer Survival Time
In addition to the differences observed in the bacterial burden
and pathological damage in the tissues of infected guinea pigs, a
significant difference was observed in the survival of the infected
animals. All the guinea pigs infected with the parental strain
succumbed to death within 120 days of infection, with a median
survival time (MST) of 98.5 days (Fig. 8). In the case of infection
with MtbDsapMComp, 60% of the animals died during the course
of the experiment with a MST of 129 days. In contrast, no deaths
were observed in the case of animals infected with MtbDsapM up
to 210 days post-infection, after which the experiment was
terminated. Thus, the survival time of guinea pigs infected with
MtbDsapM mutant was significantly longer than the animals
infected
with
M.tuberculosis
(P,0.001)
or
MtbDsapMComp
(P,0.05).
Discussion
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is one of the most successful intracel-
lular parasitic bacteria. When aerosol containing M.tuberculosis is
inhaled by guinea pigs, the pathogen reaches lungs and is ingested
by the resident alveolar macrophages. Macrophages are equipped
with a plethora of antimicrobial mechanisms to kill pathogens

[27,28,29]. However, the success of M.tuberculosis as a highly
adapted human pathogen has largely been attributed to its ability
to survive successfully in the infected macrophages [4,30].
M.tuberculosis blocks the biogenesis of phagolysosome, the very
organelle responsible for the routine elimination of microorgan-
isms by phagocytic cells [31,32]. This strategy employed to arrest
phagosomal maturation helps M.tuberculosis prevent its killing
inside the host macrophage. In fact, by employing a genetic screen
it has been demonstrated that M.tuberculosis mutants that are
defective in the arrest of phagosome maturation show a reduced
intracellular survival [33]. Hence, M.tuberculosis proteins and lipids
involved in the phagosome maturation blockage hold great
promise as a target for the design of anti-tubercular molecules.
Previous studies have reported divergent observations with
respect to the role of SapM in phagosomal maturation arrest in
mycobacteria [11,13,14]. Hence, in this study, we first attempted
to reascertain the involvement of SapM in phagosomal maturation
arrest in M.tuberculosis and also evaluated the influence of sapM
mutation on the growth of the pathogen in macrophages. Further,
for the first time, we have also evaluated the importance of SapM
in the pathogenesis of M.tuberculosis by conducting animal studies
with a sapM mutant along with the parental strain.
Our results demonstrate that sapM is dispensable for the in vitro
growth of M.tuberculosis in the broth culture. However, the growth
kinetics of MtbDsapM in human THP-1 macrophages up to 6 days
post-infection revealed an attenuated growth phenotype when
compared with the parental strain. Further, to reascertain the
involvement of SapM in the arrest of phagosomal maturation in
M.tuberculosis, we carried out colocalization studies. On examining
the colocalization of FITC labeled M.tuberculosis containing
phagosomes with Lysotracker, we observed that while M.tuberculosis
primarily resides in non-acidified compartments of THP-1 cell
line, a mutation in sapM significantly increased the number of
M.tuberculosis in the acidified compartments. Thus, by clearly
demonstrating the inability of MtbDsapM to arrest phagosomal
maturation and its reversal by MtbDsapMComp, our studies

reconfirm the involvement of SapM in arresting the maturation of
phagosomes in M.tuberculosis and are in agreement with the
conclusion drawn by Vergne et al. and Saikolappan et al. who
reported that SapM is important for arresting phagosomal
maturation in M.tuberculosis [11,13]. However, Festjens et al., by
conducting colocalization experiments by employing Mf4/4
murine macrophages infected with either BCG or its sapM mutant
reported that SapM was not necessary for the arrest of phagosome
maturation in BCG [14]. We do not, at present, understand the
reason behind the different observations on the involvement of
SapM in arresting the phagosomal maturation in M.tuberculosis and
BCG, however, it is noteworthy that phagosomal maturation and
its arrest are complex processes with multifactorial requirement
[7]. A number of studies have implicated several mycobacterial
proteins in phagosomal maturation arrest such as lipoarabino-
mannan (LAM), trehalose dimycolate (TDM), a serine/threonine
kinase (PknG), a lipoamide dehydrogenase (LpdC), a Zn2+
metalloprotease (Zmp1), tyrosine phosphatase (PtpA) and Esx-1
secretion system [7,34,35,36,37,38,39,40]. More importantly, it is
becoming apparent that the requirement for these processes in all
mycobacterial species may not necessarily be identical [36,40]. By
employing an M.marinum mutant that was able to produce both,
early secretory antigenic 6 kDa (ESAT-6) and culture filtrate
protein 10 (CFP-10), but was unable to secrete these proteins, it
was shown by Tan et al. that on infecting the macrophages, a
much higher percentage of phagosomes containing mutant
bacteria (,72%) colocalized with LysoTracker when compared
with the phagosomes containing the parental M.marinum clearly
implicating ESAT-6 and CFP-10 in phagosomal maturation arrest
in this mycobacterial species [40]. ESAT-6/CFP-10 are encoded
by the RD1 locus [40]. However, BCG was able to arrest
phagosomal maturation inspite of the absence of RD1 locus,
meaning thereby that phagosomal maturation in the case of BCG
can be arrested without ESAT-6 and CFP-10 although these

proteins are necessary for this arrest in M.marinum [6,25,40]. Thus,
these observations suggest that phagosomal maturation arrest in
BCG, may involve the set of proteins which may not be identical
with that employed by M.tuberculosis or M.marinum [6,25]. SapM is
involved in phagosomal maturation arrest in M.tuberculosis as
shown by Vergne et al., Saikolappan et al. and reconfirmed by our
study [11,13]. However, it is possible that the absence of SapM,
like the absence of ESAT-6/CFP-10, may not influence the
phagosomal maturation arrest in BCG as observed by Festjens
et al. due to involvement of other proteins [14].
The most substantial evidence for the role of SapM in
M.tuberculosis pathogenesis emerged from our studies in the guinea
pig model of infection. Guinea pig model of experimental
tuberculosis has been considered as one of the most relevant
animal models [41]. It has been established that following the
pulmonary infection, the course of disease including bacillemia
and hematogenous reseeding of the lungs, in guinea pigs is similar
to that in humans [41]. After the pathogen disseminates from
lungs to the pulmonary lymph nodes via hematogenous spread, it
appears in spleens ,3 weeks post-infection [42]. The bacilli start
reseeding in the lung by ,4 weeks to form secondary granulomas.
Moreover, the extreme susceptibility of guinea pigs to M.tuberculosis
infection and high degree of similarity with humans in the
symptoms and pathophysiology, substantiate the use of this animal
model to illuminate the events in the pathogenesis of pulmonary
TB [43].
Our study demonstrated that while M.tuberculosis exhibited
normal growth in the organs of guinea pigs, the growth of
MtbDsapM in the organs of infected guinea pigs was highly

attenuated. In fact, at the end of 16 weeks, no mycobacteria were
recovered from the lungs or spleens of MtbDsapM infected
animals. M.tuberculosis and MtbDsapMComp exhibited normal
growth in the guinea pig organs although the growth of
MtbDsapMComp was a bit less than M.tuberculosis at the end of
16 weeks post-infection. Thus, for the first time our observations
demonstrate that SapM is indispensable for the growth of
M.tuberculosis in the host which is further substantiated by the
observations that guinea pigs infected with MtbDsapM exhibited a
significantly reduced pathological damage as compared to the
animals infected with M.tuberculosis.
Survival of infected animals is one of the best parameters to
evaluate the involvement of a gene in the pathogenesis of an
organism [44,45]. Hence, we evaluated the effect of the disruption
of sapM on the survival of the infected animals. The animals
infected with M.tuberculosis gradually succumbed to death within
120 days post-infection with a MST of 98.5 days. MtbDsapM-
Comp infected guinea pigs also exhibited comparable survival
time with a MST of 129 days. However, the influence of the
deletion of sapM gene on the survival of the animals was
unambiguous as during the total duration of the experiment
(210 days) not even a single MtbDsapM infected animal suc-
cumbed to death. This is the most substantial evidence for the role
of SapM in the pathogenesis of M.tuberculosis. Thus in the current
study, we have demonstrated the importance of SapM in arresting
the phagosomal maturation as well as in the pathogenesis of
M.tuberculosis, establishing it as an important target for the
development of new anti-tubercular molecules.
To summarize, we demonstrate that SapM mediates an
important role in the protection of M.tuberculosis against the host
defense by subverting the phagosomal maturation pathway.
Disruption of sapM in M.tuberculosis resulted in a highly attenuated
strain with an impaired ability to grow in the THP-1 macrophages
as well as in the guinea pig tissues. Thus, our studies establish
SapM as a potential drug target. The fact that there are no known
human analogues of SapM makes it even more important target
for the development of new therapeutic molecules against TB. In
addition, the secretory nature of SapM presents a unique
opportunity in order to avoid the drug permeability issue due to
thick hydrophobic cell envelope of M.tuberculosis [46].

on the survival of guinea pigs post-infection. Guinea pigs
aerogenically infected with 10–30 bacilli of either M.tuberculosis,
MtbDsapM or MtbDsapMComp were monitored for survival (n = 10)
up to 210 days post-infection. In case, the animals were infected with
MtbDsapM, 100% of the animals survived. While no animal survived in
the M.tuberculosis infected group, 40% survivors were observed in case
the animals were infected with MtbDsapMComp. The median survival
time for each infected group is mentioned in brackets. * represents the
significant difference in comparison to the MtbDsapM. **, P,0.01; ***,
