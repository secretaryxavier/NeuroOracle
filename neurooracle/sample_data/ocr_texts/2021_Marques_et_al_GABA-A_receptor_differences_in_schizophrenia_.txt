Abstract
A loss of GABA signaling is a prevailing hypothesis for the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Preclinical studies indicate that
blockade of the α5 subtype of the GABA receptor (α5-GABAARs) leads to behavioral phenotypes associated with
schizophrenia, and postmortem evidence indicates lower hippocampal α5-GABAARs protein and mRNA levels in
schizophrenia. However, it is unclear if α5-GABAARs are altered in vivo or related to symptoms. We investigated α5-
GABAARs availability in antipsychotic-free schizophrenia patients and antipsychotic-medicated schizophrenia patients
using [11C]Ro15-4513 PET imaging in a cross-sectional, case–control study design. Thirty-one schizophrenia patients (n =
10 antipsychotic free) and twenty-nine matched healthy controls underwent a [11C]Ro15-4513 PET scan and MRI. The
α5 subtype GABA-A receptor availability was indexed using [11C]Ro15-4513 PET imaging. Dynamic PET data were
analyzed using the two-tissue compartment model with an arterial plasma input function and total volume of distribution
(VT) as the outcome measure. Symptom severity was assessed using the PANSS scale. There was signiﬁcantly lower [11C]
Ro15-4513 VT in the hippocampus of antipsychotic-free patients, but not in medicated patients (p = 0.64), relative to healthy
controls (p < 0.05; effect size = 1.4). There was also a signiﬁcant positive correlation between [11C]Ro15-4513 VT and total
PANSS score in antipsychotic-free patients (r = 0.72; p = 0.044). The results suggest that antipsychotic-free patients with
schizophrenia have lower α5-GABAARs levels in the hippocampus, consistent with the hypothesis that GABA
hypofunction underlies the pathophysiology of the disorder.
Introduction
A leading hypothesis proposes that reduced gamma-
aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling in frontotemporal
brain regions underlies the pathogenesis of schizophrenia
[1–3]. This hypothesis is supported by the postmortem lit-
erature showing that schizophrenia patients relative to
controls show lower mRNA and protein levels of the syn-
thetic enzyme GAD67 [4], lower levels of the GABA
membrane transporter (GAT1) [5], and lower expression
and cell density of GABAergic interneurons relative to
controls [3, 6]. In vivo studies have reported a reduction in
concentrations of GABA in cerebrospinal ﬂuid concentra-
tions in ﬁrst-episode psychotic patients [7]. By contrast
proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) have
yielded discrepant ﬁndings, potentially due to the technical
difﬁculties in accurately resolving GABA on MRS spectra
and its complex relationship with synaptic GABA [8, 9].
GABA acts on two different subtypes of receptors, GABA-
A and GABA-B. The GABA-A receptor is responsible for

the majority of the physiological actions of GABA and it
includes receptor subtypes made of different combinations
of α, β, γ, δ, ε, r, π, and θ subunits, organized in a penta-
meric structure arranged around a central pore [10].
The diversity in subunit composition and region-speciﬁc
distribution allows GABA-A receptors to have distinct
functional and physiological roles [11]. Studies using [11C]
ﬂumazenil and [123I]iomazenil to index GABA receptor
levels have not found differences between schizophrenia
patients and healthy controls [12–15]. However, these
radiotracers are not GABA subtype selective and show
similar levels of uptake both in neocortex and limbic
regions, which means they may be unable to detect differ-
ences in speciﬁc GABA receptor subtypes [16, 17]. In
contrast, the inverse GABA-A receptor agonist [11C]Ro15-
4513 is a radioligand that binds with ten times higher afﬁ-
nity (~0.5 nM) to the α5 subunit of the GABA receptor (α5-
GABAARs) when compared with other subunits (~10 nM)
[16, 18, 19]. Although α5-GABAARs represents <5% of all
GABA-A receptors [20], they are particularly concentrated
in limbic regions [21]. In the hippocampus, a key brain
region implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia [22],
25%
of
GABA-A
receptors
are
α5-GABAARs
[21].
Importantly, changes in α5-GABAARs have been reported
in
schizophrenia
patients,
with
postmortem
studies
showing lower mRNA and protein levels of this receptor
[23, 24]. Moreover, an α5-GABAARs positive allosteric
modulator (PAM) has been shown to reverse dopaminergic
hyperactivation and behavioral sensitivity to psychostimu-
lants in methylazoxymethanol (MAM)-treated animals, a
preclinical model that reproduces many phenotypes seen in
schizophrenia [25]. In contrast, the blockade of the α5-
GABAARs impairs latent inhibition [26] and reduces pre-
pulse inhibition to startle [27], behavioral phenotypes
associated with schizophrenia. Whilst these converging
lines of evidence implicate the α5-GABAARs in schizo-
phrenia, the only previous PET study using [11C]Ro15-4513
to assess α5-GABAARs availability showed no differences
in binding potential (BP) between patients with schizo-
phrenia and controls [28]. However, this study used a
brain reference region approach, which is associated with an
underestimation of BPs, and the potential confound of
systematic
differences
in
GABA
availability
in
the
reference region as well [29]. Therefore, it remains unclear
if α5-GABAARs availability is altered in schizophrenia
patients in vivo when controlling for these methodological
issues.
In view of this, we sought to investigate α5-GABAARs
availability in patients with schizophrenia using [11C]Ro15-
4513 PET imaging with an arterial input function. We
hypothesized that both medicated and antipsychotic-free
schizophrenia patients would have lower GABA-A receptor
availability in the hippocampus when compared with heal-
thy controls, and that GABA-A receptor availability would
be associated with symptom severity.
Material and methods
Participants
The study protocol was approved by the local Research
Ethics Committee and the Administration of Radioactive
Substances Advisory Committee, United Kingdom. All
participants gave written informed consent prior to study
participation. To control for potential sex differences in α5-
GABAARs availability [30] we speciﬁcally investigated
male
volunteers. Since
antipsychotic
medication
may
inﬂuence GABA function [31, 32] we recruited two groups
of patients, one taking antipsychotic treatment and the other
antipsychotic free, and compared each group with matched
healthy controls. Patients on antipsychotics were on a stable
dose of antipsychotics for at least 4 weeks prior to the scan
day. A total of 25 medicated patients with schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder and 19 age-matched healthy con-
trols were recruited. A further group of ten antipsychotic-
free patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
and ten age-matched healthy controls were also recruited.
All patients had capacity to give informed written consent
and satisﬁed DSM-V diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia
or schizoaffective disorder as determined by the Structured
Clinical
Interview
for
DSM-V-TR
Axis
I
Disorders
(SCID) [33].
All subjects had a physical and psychiatric examination.
Urinalysis was done on the day of the scan to exclude the
use of illicit drugs. Exclusion criteria for all participants
included: female sex; history of head trauma or injury with
loss of consciousness longer than one hour; learning dis-
abilities or lack of English ﬂuency; current or lifetime his-
tory of alcohol dependence; current or lifetime history of
substance abuse or dependence; use of any recreational
substances within the last month; current use or within the
last month of psychotropic medication (other than an anti-
psychotic) with possible effects on the GABA system (such
as antiepileptic drugs, benzodiazepines and antidepressants)
[34] and contraindications to MRI or PET. Patients were
excluded if treated with clozapine, diagnosed with an
organic psychosis or had a history of neurological or psy-
chiatric disorders other than schizophrenia, as assessed by
the SCID [33]. Exclusion criteria for the antipsychotic-free
patients included current or recent use of antipsychotics
within the last 4 weeks or ﬁve half-lives of the drug
(whichever was longer). The antipsychotic-free status was
conﬁrmed by reviewing clinical notes and pharmacy

records. Healthy controls were administered the Psychosis
Screening Questionnaire (PSQ) [35] and were excluded if
they reported any psychotic symptom, history of psychotic
illness or family history of psychosis. None of the healthy
controls recruited to the study had a positive score in any of
the PSQ questions.
Four patients recruited into the study were excluded from
participation due to PET contraindications (N = 3) and
commencement of clozapine treatment (N = 1). Therefore,
the ﬁnal analyses include 21 patients on antipsychotic
mediation (medicated group) and 19 matched healthy con-
trols and 10 antipsychotic-free patients (antipsychotic-free
group) and 10 matched healthy controls.
Clinical assessment
Antipsychotic doses were converted into chlorpromazine
equivalent dose as previously described [36]. Symptoms
were evaluated using the Positive and Negative Syndrome
Scale (PANSS) [37]. Duration of untreated psychosis was
quantiﬁed as the interval between ﬁrst psychotic symptoms
and ﬁrst contact with psychiatric services [38].
Neuroimaging evaluation
Image acquisition
Participants were instructed to refrain from alcohol for at
least 12 h before scanning. Dynamic PET scans were
acquired over 90 min using a Siemens ECAT EXACT HR
(CTI/Siemens, model 962; Knoxville, TN, USA) scanner,
with 63 trans-axial image planes covering an axial ﬁeld of
view of 15.5 cm. PET emission data were corrected for
attenuation and scatter using a 10-min transmission scan
and reconstructed using Fourier rebinning and 2D ﬁltered
back projection with a 2.0 mm kernel Ramp ﬁlter, into 23
dynamic frames (4 × 15, 4 × 60, 2 × 150, 10 × 300, and 3 ×
600 s). The ﬁnal reconstructed volume had voxel dimen-
sions of 2.059 × 2.059 × 2.000 mm3.
During the PET acquisition, arterial blood data were
sampled via the radial artery using a combined automatic-
manual approach. A continuous sampling system (ABSS
Allogg, Mariefred, Sweden) was employed to measure
whole blood activity for ﬁrst 15 min of each scan at the
rate of one sample per second. Discrete blood samples
were manually withdrawn at 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40,
50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 min, centrifuged and used to
determine the plasma over blood activity ratio (POB).
Samples at 2, 5, and 10 min were used to calibrate the two
sampling modalities. Samples taken at 2, 5, 10, 20, 30,
50, 70, and 90 min were also analyzed using HPLC to
calculate the plasma fraction of tracer free of metabolites
(PPf). Both POB and PPf were ﬁtted with an extended
Hill model [39], while whole blood time–activity curves
(TACs) were ﬁtted using a multiexponential model [40]
using the Multiblood software [41]. For each scan, a time
delay was ﬁtted and applied to the input functions (both
parent and whole blood TACs) to account for the tem-
poral delay between blood sample measurement and the
target tissue data.
High resolution T1 weighted volumes were acquired
using a 3T MR scanner (Magnetom Trio Syngo MR B13
Siemens 3T; Siemens AG, Germany) and a magnetization
prepared rapid gradient echo sequence (TR = 2300 ms,
TE = 2.98 ms, TI = 900 ms, ﬂip angle = 9°, ﬁeld of view =
256 mm, image matrix = 240 × 256) with a resolution of
1 mm isotropic. For the volume, 160 abutting straight
sagittal slices were collected in an interleaved right to the
left manner, resulting in whole head coverage.
[11C]Ro15-4513 PET data processing
Dynamic PET data were corrected for interframe motion
and aligned with the individual’s structural T1 MR image
by minimizing a mutual information cost function (SPM8,
Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, http://www.ﬁl.
ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). A neuroanatomical atlas was also co-
registered to each subject’s image space (MIAKAT,
http://www.imanova.co.uk) and applied to the dynamic PET
data to derive regional TACs. The hippocampus was
selected as our a priori region of interest since it has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and has a
high expression of α5-GABA-A receptors relative to the
rest of the brain, representing ~25% of GABA-A receptors
in this region [36]. Moreover, the quantiﬁcation of the
α5 subunit using [11C]Ro15-4513 has been shown to be
particularly reliable in the hippocampus (intraclass corre-
lation coefﬁcients (ICC) ~0.9) [42]. GABA-A receptor
availability was indexed using the distribution volume (VT)
of [11C]Ro15-4513. In agreement with previous publica-
tions [43, 44], the VT was calculated using with the
metabolite-free arterial plasma input function and the two-
tissue compartmental model (2TCM) solved with a non-
linear least squares approach for the regional level and the
Logan graphical method at the voxel level [45].
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS version 20
(IBM, Armonk, NY) for MAC OS X. The data distribution
of all variables was tested using Kolmogorov–Smirnov
tests and Grubbs test was used to determine if there were
outlying data. Since all data were normally distributed,
parametric tests were used. To test our primary hypoth-
esis that GABA-A receptor availability would be altered
in patients, an independent samples t-test was used to

investigate if there were group differences in the VT of
[11C]Ro15-4513 in the hippocampus in (1) medicated
patients relative to age-matched healthy controls and (2)
antipsychotic-free patients relative to age-matched heal-
thy volunteers. Independent samples t-tests were also
used
to
investigate
group
differences
in
socio-
demographic and clinical data. There was an outlier in the
medicated patient group with high VT values in the hip-
pocampus (Grubbs test p < 0.05) and these data were
excluded from further analysis. To determine whether
there was an effect of group on VT values in our
exploratory analyses of other brain regions, we performed
a two-way ANOVA with VT as the dependent variable
and group (patient or control) and brain region as the
independent variables. Exploratory analyses were also
used to investigate the association between [11C]Ro15-
4513 and clinical data using Pearson’s product moment
correlation. All data are presented as mean ± SD, and
the α level was set for all comparisons at p < 0.05,
corrected.
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of study
participants
Four groups of participants were included in the study:
twenty-one patients taking antipsychotic mediation (medi-
cated group) and nineteen matched healthy controls and ten
antipsychotic-free patients (antipsychotic-free group) and
ten matched healthy controls. In the medicated group, 19
patients had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and 2 patients had
a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. No patient had any
comorbid psychiatric diagnosis as assessed by the SCID.
Only one patient was taking a ﬁrst-generation antipsychotic,
while the remaining 20 patients were taking a second-
generation
antipsychotic
drug
(Supplementary
Data,
Table S1). All of the patients in the antipsychotic-free group
had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and were antipsychotic-
free for a period of at least 4 weeks or ﬁve half-lives of the
drug (whichever was longer).
The demographic and clinical characteristics of the
subjects are presented in Table 1. There were no group
differences in any sociodemographic variables, or injected
dose, injected mass or speciﬁc activity in medicated and
antipsychotic-free patients and their respective healthy
control groups.
Hippocampus α5-GABAARs availability in patients
and controls
There was signiﬁcantly lower [11C]Ro15-4513 VT in the
hippocampus of antipsychotic-free patients when compared
with healthy controls (mean ± SD: 6.90 ± 0.56 vs. 7.68 ± 0.54,
respectively, p = 0.006, effect size = 1.4; Figs. 1 and 2).
In contrast there was no signiﬁcant group difference in
the [11C]Ro15-4513 VT between the medicated patients and
healthy controls (mean ± SD: 6.94 ± 0.62 vs. 7.06 ± 0.86,
p = 0.64) (Fig. 3). There was also no signiﬁcant difference
in α5-GABAARs availability between the medicated and
antipsychotic-free schizophrenia groups (p = 0.54).

Correlations between hippocampus α5-GABAARs
availability and clinical characteristics
We found no signiﬁcant correlation between [11C]Ro15-4513
VT and the exposure to antipsychotics, as measured in
chlorpromazine equivalents doses (r = 0.32; p = 0.22). There
was also no signiﬁcant correlation with VT and duration of
illness in either the antipsychotic-free (r = 0.105; p = 0.78) or
the
medicated
(r = −0.02;
p = 0.91)
groups.
In
the
antipsychotic-free patient group, there was a signiﬁcant
positive correlation between [11C]Ro15-4513 VT and severity
of symptoms, as assessed by the total PANSS score (r = 0.72;
p = 0.044) (Fig. 4), which was not signiﬁcant in the medi-
cated patient group (r = 0.22; p = 0.38). There was also no
signiﬁcant correlation between [11C]Ro15-4513 VT and age in
either
the
medicated
(r = −0.20;
p = 0.19)
or
the
antipsychotic-free (r = 0.16; p = 0.49) groups.
Hippocampus volume
There were no signiﬁcant differences in hippocampal
volumes between antipsychotic-free patients relative to
healthy controls and between medicated patients and heal-
thy controls (Table 1). There were also no signiﬁcant cor-
relations between hippocampal volumes and the [11C]Ro15-
4513 VT in the hippocampus in either antipsychotic-free
patients (r = −0.035; p = 0.92) or medicated patients (r =
1.99; p = 0.38)
Other brain regions
In antipsychotic-free patients relative to healthy controls,
there was a signiﬁcant main effect of group on VT measures
across all ROIs (F (1, 144) = 5.73, p = 0.01). There was
also a signiﬁcant main effect of region on VT measures
across all ROIs (F (7, 144) = 179, p < 0.001). However, the
group × region interaction was not signiﬁcant (F (7, 144) =
0.61, p = 0.74), and there were no signiﬁcant differences in
the posthoc pair-wise comparisons for individual regions
(Supplementary Data, Table S2). In the medicated patient
group, there was no signiﬁcant effect of group on VT
measures across all ROIs (F (1, 304) = 0.50, p = 0.47).
However, there was a signiﬁcant main effect of region on
VT across the brain (F (7, 304) = 161, p < 0.001) but the
group × region interaction was not signiﬁcant (F (7, 304) =
0.94, p = 0.47), and there were no signiﬁcant differences in

Discussion
Our results show that GABA-A receptor availability, mea-
sured with a tracer selective for the α5-GABA-A receptor
subunit, is signiﬁcantly lower in the hippocampi of
antipsychotic-free schizophrenia patients, and directly cor-
related with symptom severity. However, α5-GABAARs
availability is not signiﬁcantly altered in antipsychotic-
treated patients when compared with controls.
Our results extend postmortem ﬁndings showing lower
mRNA and protein levels of α5-GABAARs in schizo-
phrenia patients [23, 24] to show evidence for lower hip-
pocampal uptake of an α5-GABAARs selective tracer
in vivo in untreated patients with schizophrenia. However,
our results are not consistent with the only previous [11C]
Ro15-4513 PET study in schizophrenia patients [28], where
no differences in [11C]Ro15-4513 BP were observed
between antipsychotic-free patients and healthy controls.
The lack of group effects in this previous study may be due
to the use of simpliﬁed reference tissue model (SRTM) with
the pons as the reference tissue to quantify [11C]Ro15-4513
BP. This approach relies on a number of assumptions which
can easily lead to biased estimates if violated [46]. More-
over, the ICC across brain regions range between 0.35 and
0.80 when using SRTM, which indicates lower reliability
than the approach we used, where ICC values are >0.82
[42, 47]. The use of the pons as a reference region for [11C]
Ro15-4513 PET has also been subject to criticism, since it
may
lead
to
the
underestimation
of
target
binding
[19, 46, 47]. For these reasons, the SRTM approach used in
the Asai et al. study may have lacked sensitivity to detect
group differences.
Interestingly, our study showed no signiﬁcant differences
in [11C]Ro15-4513 VT in medicated schizophrenia patients
when compared with controls. Taken with our ﬁndings in
the antipsychotic-free patients and other ﬁndings of lower
GABA-A receptor prior to treatment [48], these results
could suggest that there has been a normalization of α5-
GABAARs levels with antipsychotic treatment. In addition,
reduced GABA release, as assessed using a tiagabine

challenge, was seen in antipsychotic-naive individuals but
not in antipsychotic-treated patients [15]. Previous literature
has also shown evidence of altered GABA levels using
1H-MRS in unmedicated patients but not in medicated
patients [32]. Moreover, 4 weeks of exposure to anti-
psychotic treatment has also been found to normalize
GABA levels in patients [32]. Post-mortem studies also ﬁnd
differences between treated and untreated patients with
schizophrenia, showing a positive correlation between the
density of GAD and antipsychotic dose and higher
expression levels of GAD67 and GABA-A protein subunits
in antipsychotic-treated patients relative to unmedicated
patients [49]. However, it is important to note that both in
our study and in these prior studies, the antipsychotic-
treated group had a longer duration of illness than the
untreated group. As such, it is not possible to disentangle
duration of illness from treatment effects. However, in
our study, we found no signiﬁcant associations between
α5-GABAARs availability and duration of illness, indicat-
ing that antipsychotic treatment could contribute to the lack
of group differences in the treated patients. This is sup-
ported
by
preclinical
ﬁndings
showing
an
increased
expression of GAD67 and increased GABA-A receptor
binding in rats exposed to a range of different anti-
psychotics [50] and by clinical studies showing that expo-
sure to 4 weeks of antipsychotic treatment normalizes
GABA levels in schizophrenia patients [32]. However,
longitudinal studies in patients are needed to test the
hypothesis that there are changes in GABA-A receptor
levels over time and if they are associated to exposure to
antipsychotic medication.
Strengths and limitations
A strength of the study was that we included a large sample
for a PET study and obtained arterial input functions [19]. In
our study, we used the 2TCM model, which has been shown
to have good reliability for [11C]Ro15-4513 quantiﬁcation
(ICC ranging from 0.83 to 0.88), and VT values derived from
this model show a close, linear relationship with α5-
GABAARs speciﬁc binding [19]. One potential limitation
on generalizability is that we only included males, as there are
sex differences in GABA-A receptor expression [30]. Future
studies are needed to test if our ﬁndings generalize to female
patients as well. Although both groups are matched for age,
there is a trend level difference in age between antipsychotic-
free patients and healthy controls (p = 0.06). Importantly, the
VT values in our healthy control cohorts are similar to the ones
reported in other studies using the [11C]Ro15-4513 PET
tracer [51, 43], indicating that our ﬁndings are not driven by
abnormal values in our controls. Furthermore, α5-GABAARs
show developmental reductions and, supporting this, in
healthy volunteers there is an inverse relationship between
age and [11C]Ro15-4513 VT values. The lack of group dif-
ferences in the chronic patients taken with the lower VT values
could suggest disruption of the normal age-related reductions
in α5-GABAARs. The antipsychotic-free period in the
antipsychotic-free group was 4 weeks or over ﬁve half-lives
(whichever was longer), and no antipsychotic taken in the
medicated group has signiﬁcant afﬁnity for GABA-A recep-
tors (all Ki values > 10,000) [52–55], indicating that direct
effects of antipsychotic drugs on GABA-A receptors are
unlikely to explain our ﬁndings. We did not ﬁnd any sig-
niﬁcant difference in hippocampal volume, suggesting that
partial volume effects are unlikely to account for our group
differences. Furthermore, although a reduction in hippo-
campus volume in schizophrenia is commonly reported [56],
in our study there were no signiﬁcant volumetric differences
in hippocampal volume between patients and controls. This
can be explained by the hippocampus being one of the brain
areas with greater structural variability [57]. Finally, [11C]
Ro15-4513 is a highly selective α5-GABAARs PET radio-
tracer, with α5 representing around 60–70% of the speciﬁc
binding in α5 rich regions [19], and its afﬁnity for this subunit
is ~10- to 20-fold greater than to other subtypes of the
GABA-A receptor [16, 17]. However, it also demonstrates
measurable in vivo binding for the α1 to α4 and α6 receptor
subtypes [16, 17]. Overall, although the [11C]Ro15-4513 VT
reﬂects the net effect of the availability of these different
GABA-A receptors, the 20-fold greater afﬁnity of [11C]Ro15-
4513 for α5-GABAARs and the enriched expression of α5-
GABAARs in the hippocampus indicates the lower [11C]
Ro15-4513
hippocampal
availability
is
likely
to
pre-
dominantly reﬂect lower α5-GABAAR levels.
The interpretation of the ﬁndings and their
implications for understanding schizophrenia
GABAergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus plays a
fundamental role in inhibiting the neuronal activity of pyr-
amidal glutamatergic cells, through the activation of post-
synaptic GABA receptors [58, 59]. The hippocampus has a
particularly high concentration of α5-GABAARs relative to
other brain regions, constituting up to 25% of all GABA-A
receptors in the hippocampus. Although other receptor sub-
types are also present [60], α5 represents around 60–70% of
the speciﬁc binding of [11C]Ro15-4513 in the hippocampus
[19, 61]. While α1 and α2-GABAARs are located synapti-
cally and involved in the phasic inhibition of pyramidal cells,
α5-GABAARs are located mainly at extrasynaptic sites
[19, 62]. At these sites, α5-GABAARs are predominantly
involved in generating a tonic inhibitory current [63–65] to
regulate the excitability of pyramidal neurons [66, 67] and
decrease network excitability. Interestingly, this tonic inhi-
bition has been shown to be at least equally important in the
regulation of pyramidal cells ﬁring as phasic inhibition [63].

T. R. Marques et al.

α5-GABAARs deﬁcient mice show reduced tonic inhibition
resulting in hippocampus hyperexcitability, which can be
reversed by pharmacologically increasing the tonic current
[67]. The lower α5-GABAA receptor levels we observe may
therefore contribute to reductions in tonic inhibition, leading
to an increase in hippocampal hyperexcitability. This inter-
pretation is supported by the previous literature implicating
the hippocampus in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia
including changes in hippocampal volume [68] as well as
changes in regional cerebral blood ﬂow [69] and blood
oxygen level-dependent signal [70]. Taken together these
suggest that lower α5-GABAARs levels could lead to a state
of excessive excitation [59, 62]. Our ﬁndings are therefore
consistent with hypotheses that a reduction in GABAergic
neurotransmission disinhibits glutamatergic pyramidal neu-
rons, resulting in the loss of synchronous cortical activity,
and subcortical dopamine dysregulation. Furthermore, the
activation of α5-GABAARs by a PAM has been shown to
reverse the dopaminergic and behavioral abnormalities
observed in the MAM model [25–27]. These ﬁndings high-
light the therapeutic potential of targeting GABA function in
schizophrenia [1, 59]. We found a signiﬁcant positive cor-
relation between α5-GABAARs availability and symptom
severity in antipsychotic-free patients. Whilst this supports a
link between α5-GABAARs dysregulation and the clinical
expression of the disorder, the direction of the association is
not consistent with a simple model of α5-GABAARs hypo-
function leading to hippocampal overactivity and symptoms.
It was recently shown, using a viral-mediated gene transfer,
that an increase in the expression of α5-GABAARs nor-
malizes VTA dopamine cell population activity [71]. Thus,
one explanation that could account for both the lower [11C]
Ro15-4513 binding in patients and a positive correlation with
symptoms is that low α5-GABAAR levels are a vulnerability
factor but that once the disorder develops there is a com-
pensatory increase in α5-GABAAR levels in response to
dysregulation of other systems. This is consistent with the
role of α5-GABAARs in providing tonic regulation of pyr-
amidal neurons [72]. A longitudinal study is needed to test
this model further. Finally, our exploratory analysis in other
brain regions also showed a signiﬁcant difference between
antipsychotic-free patients and controls in the omnibus test,
suggesting there may be GABA-A receptor alterations in
other brain regions in schizophrenia. However, no individual
region was signiﬁcantly different in the pair-wise compar-
isons, which could reﬂect the fact that the expression of α5-
GABAARs is lower in these regions [33].
Conclusions and future directions
This
study
provides
evidence
that
antipsychotic-free
patients with schizophrenia have lower GABA-A recep-
tors in the hippocampus, predominantly of the alpha-5
subtype, that is not seen in antipsychotic-treated patients.
These ﬁndings are consistent with the hypothesis that
GABA hypofunction underlies the pathophysiology of the
disorder, and highlights the potential of GABAergic mod-
ulators as therapeutic targets for schizophrenia [72].
