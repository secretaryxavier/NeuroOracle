Abstract. A new multiangle implementation of the at-
mospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm has been ap-
plied in the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiome-
ter (MODIS) sensor and has recently provided globally
high-spatial-resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) prod-
ucts at 1 km. Moreover, several improvements have been
modiﬁed in the classical Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue
(DB) aerosol retrieval algorithms in MODIS Collection 6.1
products. Thus, validation and comparison of the MAIAC,
DT, and DB algorithms are urgent in China. In this pa-
per, we present a comprehensive assessment and compar-
ison of AOD products at a 550 nm wavelength based on
three aerosol retrieval algorithms in the MODIS sensor us-
ing ground-truth measurements from AErosol RObotic NET-
work (AERONET) sites over China from 2000 to 2017. In
general, MAIAC products achieved better accuracy than DT
and DB products in the overall validation and accuracy im-
provement of DB products after the QA ﬁlter, demonstrating
the highest values among the three products. In addition, the
DT algorithms had higher aerosol retrievals in cropland, for-
est, and ocean land types than the other two products, and the
MAIAC algorithms were more accurate in grassland, built-
up, unoccupied, and mixed land types among the three prod-
ucts. In the geometry dependency analysis, the solar zenith
angle, scattering angle, and relative azimuth angle, exclud-
ing the view zenith angle, signiﬁcantly affected the perfor-
mance of the three aerosol retrieval algorithms. The three
products showed different accuracies with varying regions
and seasons. Similar spatial patterns were found for the three
products, but the MAIAC retrievals were smaller in the North
China Plain and higher in Yunnan Province compared with
the DT and DB retrievals before the QA ﬁlter. After the QA
ﬁlter, the DB retrievals were signiﬁcantly lower than the MA-
IAC retrievals in south China. Moreover, the spatiotemporal
completeness of the MAIAC product was also better than the
DT and DB products.

Introduction
Aerosols are a multi-compartment system consisting of sus-
pended solid and liquid particles in the atmosphere, which
play an important role in radiative forcing (Rajeev et al.,
2001), regional climate (Qian and Giorgi, 1999; Feng et al.,
2019), and urban air pollution (Dominici et al., 2014). The
aerosol optical depth (AOD) is the key aerosol optical pa-
rameter, deﬁned as the vertical integration of the aerosol
extinction coefﬁcient from the ground to the top of the at-
mosphere (TOA). Ground measurements from the AErosol
RObotic NETwork (AERONET) provide high-quality multi-
band aerosol optical and microphysical properties at 15 min
sampling frequencies on a global scale (Holben et al., 1998).
High-quality ground measurements are often employed to
validate satellite aerosol products (Chu et al., 2002) and to
provide a regional aerosol model for the satellite aerosol
retrieval algorithm (Levy et al., 2013). However, they can-
not grasp the high aerosol spatial variability due to the
sparse ground sites where spatial variability information is
still necessary. Though some active remote-sensing meth-

N. Liu et al.: MAIAC, DT, and DB aerosol products over China
ods, e.g., spaceborne lidar, can monitor vertical distribution
of aerosol, they still cannot observe high aerosol spatial vari-
ability (Huang et al., 2007; Jia et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015).
Although model-simulated AOD can obtain spatially contin-
uous data, its very coarse resolution and large uncertainties
limit its application (Sun et al., 2019; Cesnulyte et al., 2014).
In contrast, the satellite aerosol retrieval algorithm has the
ability to achieve continuous spatial measurements with high
spatial resolution (She et al., 2017).
The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) sensor with its multiband detection ability from the
visible band to thermal infrared spectrum band (Salomonson
et al., 1989) can readily detect aerosol properties. With the
Terra satellite and Aqua satellite carrying the MODIS sen-
sor successfully launched in 2000 and 2002, respectively,
MODIS has stored over 17 years of historical globally moni-
tored data. Recently, a new multiangle implementation of the
atmospheric correction (MAIAC) algorithm has been applied
in the MODIS sensor, which provides high-spatial-resolution
aerosol data at 1 km (Lyapustin et al., 2018). Moreover, some
important improvements in classical Dark Target (DT; Mat-
too, 2017) and Deep Blue (DB; Hsu, 2017) aerosol retrieval
algorithms have been revised in MODIS Collection 6.1 prod-
ucts. However, all satellite aerosol retrieval algorithms are
under some hypothesis and approximation assessments, and
the accuracy should be validated before applying a satellite
aerosol product in related studies.
China is experiencing severe aerosol pollution, and numer-
ous studies on aerosol pollution have utilized MODIS Col-
lection 6.0 aerosol retrievals to map aerosol pollution and to
analyze its spatiotemporal trends (Fang et al., 2016; Ma et
al., 2014; He and Huang, 2018a, b; Zou et al., 2016, 2019;
Zhai et al., 2018). Few studies have applied 1 km MAIAC
aerosol retrievals to map ﬁner aerosol concentrations in re-
gional China, e.g., the Yangtze River Delta (Xiao et al., 2017)
and Shandong Province (Li et al., 2018). Before widely ap-
plying MAIAC and C6.1 products in China, the accuracy dif-
ferences and applicable conditions of the three aerosol re-
trievals should ﬁrst be recognized to guide the utilization of
these products. Recently, the global validation (Lyapustin et
al., 2018) and regional validation in South America (Mar-
tins et al., 2017), North America (Superczynski et al., 2017),
and South Asia (Mhawish et al., 2019) for MAIAC products
has shown that more than 66 % of retrievals fall within the
expected error (EE = ±(0.05 + 0.05 × AOD)) limits, indi-
cating a good accuracy for MAIAC products. In China, a
comprehensive validation of the C6.1 product was initially
performed (Wang et al., 2019) and then the MAIAC product
was relatively simply evaluated against ground AERONET
measurement in different seasons and land cover types and
at different sites (Zhang et al., 2019). Thus, an urgent de-
mand persists for a detailed comparison of the three products
to guide user selection of these products.
In this context, we provide the ﬁrst comprehensive under-
standing and comparison of the aerosol retrieval uncertainties
for MAIAC, DT, and DB products in China based on spa-
tiotemporal accuracy differentiation patterns, spatiotemporal
completeness, land type dependence characteristics, view ge-
ometry dependence characteristic aspects, and other features.
The following paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 brieﬂy
introduces three satellite products with their retrieval algo-
rithm and ground AERONET data, the validation approach
is clariﬁed in Sect. 3, and Sect. 4 provides the detailed vali-
dation results and discussion. The conclusions are presented
in Sect. 5.

Data description
Three aerosol products, e.g., MAIAC, DT, and DB, are stored
in Hierarchical Data Format (*.hdf) ﬁles, and we obtain
corresponding *.hdf ﬁles in the China region from 2000
to 2017 from the NASA Earthdata Search website (https://
search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search/, last access: 28 May 2019).
Some ground surface types, e.g. snow, cloud, and desert,
will increase the retrieval uncertainty; thus three products
all provide a quality assurance (QA) ﬂag to indicate the re-
trieval quality. Ground measurement aerosol data obtained
from the AERONET website (https://aeronet.gsfc.nasa.gov/,
last access: 28 May 2019) were used to validate the accu-
racy of three satellite aerosol products. Additionally, land
cover data from the Geographical Information Monitoring
Cloud Platform (GIMCP, http://www.dsac.cn/, last access:
28 May 2019) were utilized to analyze the land cover de-
pendency for three satellite aerosol products.
2.1
DT products
The DT algorithm retrieves AOD parameters based on the
assumption that the surface reﬂectance in two visible bands,
e.g., 470 and 644 nm, presents a good linear relationship
with the surface reﬂectance in the shortwave infrared (SWIR)
band, e.g., 2119 nm, in dark, dense vegetated area, and the
measurement in the SWIR band is transparent with the
aerosol particle (Kaufman et al., 1997; Levy et al., 2013).
The surface and aerosol information can then be decoupled
from the TOA spectral reﬂectance. Compared with the DT
algorithm in Collection 6.0, the DT algorithm in Collection
6.1 mainly revises the surface characterization over the land
surface when the urban percentage is larger than 20 % (Gupta
et al., 2016).
The DT algorithm produces two aerosol resolution prod-
ucts in Collection 6.0 and 6.1, e.g., 3 km × 3 km and
10 km × 10 km. The two resolution products share the same
retrieval protocol except the use of different retrieval boxes.
For example, the 10 km product organizes 20×20 group pix-
els with the three aforementioned band measurements at 500
resolution into the retrieval box, whereas the 3 km product
combines three band measurements in the 6 × 6 pixel group
into a retrieval box (Remer et al., 2013). The comparison be-

tween the 10 km product and 3 km product from Collection
6.0 on the global scale (Remer et al., 2013) and the China
region (He et al., 2017) shows that the accuracy of the 10 km
product is superior to one of the 3 km product, even though
the 3 km product provides ﬁner-resolution aerosol retrievals.
In this study, we consider the 10 km product of the newest
Collection 6.1 version from the Terra satellite. In DT prod-
ucts, QA = 3 indicates high-conﬁdence data, and QA = 1
indicates marginal-conﬁdence data (Levy et al., 2013). In
this paper, the scientiﬁc datasets (SDSs), named the “Im-
age_Optical_Depth_Land_And_Ocean” without a QA ﬁl-
ter and “Optical_Depth_Land_And_Ocean” with a QA ﬁl-
ter (QA > 1 for ocean and QA = 3 for land), are extracted to
compare the accuracy with and without the QA ﬁlter.
2.2
DB products
The DB algorithm retrieves the AOD parameter under the hy-
pothesis that the surface reﬂectance in the Deep Blue band,
e.g., 412 nm, is much smaller than in longer bands over bright
surfaces, such as urban and desert regions (Hsu et al., 2004).
First, the DB algorithm retrieves 1 km aerosol properties us-
ing the global surface reﬂectance database in visible bands,
e.g., 412, 470, and 650 nm, and then aggregates 1 km pixels
into a 10 km scale. In Collection 6.0, the surface reﬂectance
database is improved using knowledge of the normalized dif-
ference vegetation index, scattering angle, and season (Hsu
et al., 2013). The ability to retrieve aerosol data over a bright
surface for the DB algorithm greatly expands the coverage
of aerosol retrieval. The general principles for collection of
the 6.1 DB products are still the same as those in the Collec-
tion 6.0 version. The major improvements for Collection 6.1
DB products are in the radiometric calibration, heavy smoke
detection, artifact reduction over heterogeneous terrain, sur-
face model in elevated terrain and regional/seasonal aerosol
optical models (Hsu, 2017).
The
same
as
the
DT
products,
SDSs
named
“Deep_Blue_Aerosol_Optical_Depth_550_Land”
without
the
QA
ﬁlter
and
“Deep_
Blue_Aerosol_Optical_Depth_550_Land_Best_Estimate”
with the QA ﬁlter (QA = 2, 3 for land) in Collection 6.1
from the Terra satellite were selected for our study to
validate the accuracy improvement by the QA ﬁlter. The
solar zenith angle in the “Solar_Zenith” SDSs, view zenith
angle in the “Sensor_Zenith” SDSs, solar azimuth angle
in the “Solar_Azimuth” SDSs, sensor azimuth angle in
the “Sensor_Azimuth” SDSs, and scattering angle in the
“Scattering_Angle” SDSs were also assessed to determine
the geometry dependence for DT and DB products.
2.3
MAIAC products
The MAIAC algorithm relies on the assumption that the sur-
face reﬂectance changes slowly over time and shows high
variability over space, whereas the aerosol loading changes
very fast over time and varies only on a limited space scale.
The main procedure of MAIAC is as follows: ﬁrst, MAIAC
resamples MODIS L1B measurements into a ﬁxed 1 km grid,
and then it adopts 4–16 d time series of resampled MODIS
measurements to retrieve the surface Ross–Thick Li–Sparse
(RTLS) bidirectional reﬂectance distribution function (Lucht
et al., 2000) using the measurements in the SWIR band. Sub-
sequently, the linear spectral regression coefﬁcient (SRC) be-
tween 470 and 2119 nm for each 1 km grid is retrieved in-
stead of using the empirical regression coefﬁcient in the DT
algorithm. Finally, the AOD parameter at 470 nm can be re-
trieved by searching the minimum spectral residual between
the theoretical TOA reﬂectance of the lookup table and the
measurements in the red and SWIR bands. The AOD is orig-
inally retrieved at 470 nm, and the AOD parameter at 550 nm
is computed using the AOD parameter at 470 nm based on
spectral properties, expressed by the regional aerosol model
from the MAIAC lookup table. The detailed MAIAC algo-
rithm has been described by Lyapustin et al. (2011).
Data
used
in
this
study
were
from
the
“Opti-
cal_Depth_055” and “AOD_QA” SDSs, and data were
collected from the Terra satellite. The data type of the
“AOD_QA” SDSs is a 16-bit unsigned integer, and the best
retrieved quality can be selected if 8–11 bytes of “AOD_QA”
SDS bits are “0000”, which indicates the retrieval pixel and
its adjacent pixel is clear (Lyapustin et al., 2018). The solar
zenith angle in the “cosSZA” SDSs, view zenith angle in
the “cosVZA” SDSs, relative azimuth angle in the “RelAZ”
SDSs, and scattering angle in the “Scattering_Angle” SDSs
were also selected to analyze the view geometry dependence
for MAIAC products.
2.4
AERONET data
AERONET is a global ground-based aerosol monitoring net-
work that provides continuous optical and microphysical
properties of aerosols at a 15 min sampling rate. The total
uncertainty for the AERONET AOD parameter under cloud-
free conditions is lower than ±0.01 for a wavelength longer
than 440 nm and less than ±0.02 for shorter wavelengths
(Holben et al., 1998). Some studies were also conducted to
examine the properties of these high-quality measurements
in China (Liu et al., 2011; Xia et al., 2007; Li et al., 2007;
Che et al., 2008, 2014; Bi et al., 2014). These high-accuracy
datasets support various satellite AOD product evaluation
studies in the China region (Tao et al., 2015; Tian et al.,
2018; He et al., 2017; Sogacheva et al., 2018). AERONET
provides three quality levels of data, e.g., level 1.0, level 1.5,
and level 2.0, in version 3. Here, we only selected quality-
assured level 2.0 data as ground-truth data to validate the

neighboring bands at 500 and 675 nm (Ångström et al., 1929;
Eck et al., 1999) which can be shown by
α500−675 = −ln(τ500/τ675)
ln(500/675)
(1)
τ550 = τ675(500/675)−α500−675,
where τ500 and τ675 are the AOD parameter at 500 and
675 nm, respectively, τ550 is the interpolated AOD parame-
ter at 550 nm, α500−675 is the corresponding Ångström expo-
nent, and ln(*) is the logarithmic operator.

Land cover data
One key difﬁculty in the aerosol retrieval algorithm is to
decouple surface and atmosphere information in the satel-
lite apparent reﬂectance. Land cover information greatly af-
fects atmosphere properties (Xu et al., 2018; Feng and Zou,
2019). Understanding the uncertainties in a satellite aerosol
retrieval algorithm for different land cover types is neces-
sary (W. Wang et al., 2019). GIMCP land cover data with
30 m resolution in the years 2000, 2005, 2008, 2010, and
2013 were used in this study. The ﬁrst level of GIMCP land
cover data includes cropland, forest, grassland, water, and
built-up and unoccupied land. Among them, unoccupied land
includes desert, saline–alkaline soil, swampland, bare land,
and bare rock gravel, which mainly includes bright surfaces.
The high spatial resolution and abundant land cover types
support our studies. Figure 1 shows the ﬁrst level land cover
type across the China mainland in 2013.

sites are located and ground measurement at the exact satel-
lite overpass time, due to large numbers of missing data in
AERONET or satellite data and the time delay between the
satellite overpass time and AERONET sampling time. There-
fore, under the assumption that aerosol information is homo-
geneous in a limited spatial and temporal lag, a suitable spa-
tiotemporal window is often adopted to increase the matchup
data number. Thus, satellite measurements in the spatial win-
dow around the AERONET sites are averaged, and ground
measurements in the temporal window centered on the satel-
lite overpass time are averaged.
For 10 km DT and DB products, the selected spatial
window is often 50 km × 50 km, and the temporal window
is ±30 min (Ichoku et al., 2002; He et al., 2017; Tao et
al., 2015). For MAIAC products, Matins et al. (2017) de-
scribed ﬁve different spatial windows, e.g., 3, 15, 25, 75,
and 125 km, and four temporal windows, e.g., 30, 60, 90,
and 120 min, to validate the MAIAC product over South
America (Matins et al., 2017). The results showed that
25 km × 25 km and ±60 min are reasonable for the Terra
satellite. For comparison with 10 km DT and DB products,
we selected 30 km × 30 km as the spatial window closest to
the best spatial window for the MAIAC product and em-
ployed the best temporal window ±30 min of the 10 km prod-
uct because we also noticed that the validation accuracy is
very close for the ±30 and ±60 min temporal windows in
the results of Matins et al. (2017), although the matchup data
number of the ±60 min temporal window is more than one
of the ±30 min temporal windows (Matins et al., 2017).
3.2
Land cover types for the AERONET sites
The ﬁrst level of GIMCP land cover data was used
to label the AERONET site group. Due to the selected
30 km × 30 km spatial window in Sect. 3.1, we labeled the
AERONET sites if the proportion of one land cover type ex-
ceeded 50 % in the spatial window around the AERONET
site. If there was no dominant land cover type, we deﬁned the
land cover type for this AERONET site as a mixed group. Ex-
cept for the deﬁned ﬁrst level type in the GIMCP land cover
data, we found some coastal AERONET sites in which the
dominant region was ocean, so we deﬁned the land cover
type for these sites as the ocean group.
Table 2 shows the land cover types for each AERONET
site in 2013. There were no land cover type changes for most
sites except Hangzhou_City, Muztagh_Ata, and NAM_CO.
For the Hangzhou_City site, the land cover type changed
from cropland to mixed group from 2005 to 2008, potentially
due to the process of urbanization. For the Muztagh_Ata site,
the land cover type changed from unoccupied land to grass-
land from 2008 to 2010, and the land cover type for the
NAM_CO site varied from grassland to the mixed group be-
tween 2008 and 2010. We labeled each matchup dataset for
the three sites using the land cover type in the nearest year to
the AERONET sampling time.
3.3
Statistical approach
The expected error (EE) envelope is often used to validate
satellite retrieval uncertainties. More than 66 % of retrievals
falling within the expected error lines indicate good accu-
racy. For the DT algorithm, the EE envelope is generally
deﬁned as ±(0.05 + 0.15 × AOD) over land, and over 66 %
Atmos. Chem. Phys., 19, 8243–8268, 2019
www.atmos-chem-phys.net/19/8243/2019/

N. Liu et al.: MAIAC, DT, and DB aerosol products over China
8249
of retrievals meet the deﬁned expected error limits at the
global scale (Levy et al., 2010, 2013; Remer et al., 2005).
In the global-scale validation for the MAIAC product, over
66 % of retrievals satisfy the ±(0.05 + 0.1 × AOD) EE lim-
its, demonstrating that the accuracy of MAIAC is relatively
higher than the DT algorithm over land (Lyapustin et al.,
2018). In the regional validation of South America and South
Asia for the MAIAC product, the EE envelope is deﬁned
as ±(0.05+0.05×AOD) and ±(0.05+0.1×AOD) respec-
tively, and the fraction of retrievals within these EE limits
are all over 66 % (Mhawish et al., 2019; Matins et al., 2017).
In our study, to compare DT and DB products, we adopted
±(0.05 + 0.15 × AOD) as the EE envelope and calculated
the proportion within the EE envelope (Within_EE) using
Eq. (2):
AOD −EE ≤AODsat ≤AOD + EE.
(2)
In addition to the EE envelope, we also adopted coefﬁcient
of determination (R2) and Pearson correlation coefﬁcient
(R) to study the correlation between the satellite AOD and
AERONET AOD. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was
also utilized to analyze the dispersion degree of accuracy of
the satellite AOD. The mean bias (bias) was used to describe
the bias of the satellite AOD. These statistical indicators were
calculated using Eqs. (3)–(6), respectively.

Results and discussion
4.1
Overall accuracy comparison
Figure 2 shows the overall evaluation for MAIAC, DT, and
DB products before and after the QA ﬁlter. In total, MAIAC
products have more matchup data than DT and DB prod-
ucts, which indicates the completeness of the MAIAC prod-
uct may be higher than the DT and DB products. Before the
QA ﬁlter, the statistic showed that 69.84 % of retrievals fall
within the EE envelope, indicating a good accuracy for MA-
IAC products in China. Compared with DT and DB products,
only 53.64 % and 55.66 % of retrievals were determined for
DT and DB products. Based on the R statistical result, the
results for the three products were all greater than 0.9, in-
dicating that the three products are all well correlated with
the ground-truth AERONET data. By contrast, the R2 statis-
tical result for MAIAC products, e.g., 0.847, was superior to
those for the DT and DB products, e.g., less than 0.8. From
the bias statistical result, no signiﬁcant bias was observed for
the overall MAIAC product. However, according to the cor-
responding bias box plot in different AOD bins, a slight over-
estimation was observed when the AODs were less than 0.5,
and a slight underestimation was observed when the AODs
were between 0.5 and 1. The DT and DB products appeared
to be less overestimated based on the bias result. From the
corresponding bias box plot, the mean bias result for each
different AOD bin was also almost greater than zero. After
the QA ﬁlter, the correlation for the MAIAC product slightly
improved, but the Within_EE result was slightly reduced, and
the RMSE and bias results increased. From the correspond-
ing bias box plot subﬁgure, the positive mean biases when
the AODs were less than 0.2 increased compared with cor-
responding results before the QA ﬁlter, and the negative bi-
ases when the AODs were between 0.5 and 1 were reduced.
These phenomena resulted in the reduced overall accuracy.
The reason for the changes in these statistical indicators will
be explained in Sect. 4.2. For the DT and DB products, the
overall accuracies were all improved after the QA ﬁlter. The

N. Liu et al.: MAIAC, DT, and DB aerosol products over China
improvement of the DB product was more obvious than for
the DT product. The Within_EE result was improved from
57.66 % to 63.32 %, and the mean biases in the bias box plot
showed no obvious overestimation trend after the QA ﬁlter.
However, the DT product was still overestimated after the
QA ﬁlter, and only a little improvement was achieved in the
Within_EE result.
To analyze and compare the retrieval accuracy at different
AOD levels for three products, four bins with different levels,
low level (< 0.2), moderate level (0.2–0.4), moderate-high
level (0.4–0.6), and high level (> 0.6), are deﬁned (Wang et
al., 2019). Table 3 shows the corresponding statistical results.
At the low, moderate, and moderate-high levels, all statistical
indicators showed that the MAIAC product had better accu-
racy than the DT and DB products before the QA ﬁlter. At
the high level, the DT product achieved the highest correla-
tion with the ground-truth data and low RMSE results, but the
positive bias result for the DT product revealed that the over-
estimation phenomenon was more serious than for the other
two products. After the QA ﬁlter, the accuracy of the DB
product was higher compared with the other two products at
the low level because the positive bias phenomenon became
more severe for the MAIAC product at this level. At the mod-
erate level, the MAIAC product demonstrated the best corre-
lation and lowest RMSE results with a slightly higher posi-
tive bias than the DB product. At the moderate-high level, the
MAIAC product remained the best quality product among
the three products. At the high level, the DT product achieved
the best correlation and lowest RMSE with the highest posi-
tive bias.
4.2
Land cover type dependency analysis
Figure 3 shows a scatterplot ﬁgure of the MAIAC products
in different land cover types before and after the QA ﬁlter.
In total, MAIAC retrievals in cropland, built-up, grassland,
and ocean types were more accurate than forest, unoccu-
pied land, and mixed types according to the Within_EE re-
sults. After the QA ﬁlter, except for grassland, the accuracies
all improved, and the improvement effect in ocean type was
more obvious.
The high aerosol loading, e.g., AODs > 1, mostly emerged
in cropland (Fig. 3a-i and a-ii) and built-up (Fig. 3d-i and d-
ii) types due to biomass burning in the dry season and multi-
ple human activities in the built-up area (Zhang et al., 2010;
Wang et al., 2018). MAIAC retrieved AODs with a very high
accuracy for the two land cover types. The R and R2 results
were over 0.93 and 0.84, respectively, and the Within_EE
results showed that more than 74 % of retrievals fell within
the EE limits. In comparison, retrievals in cropland showed
little bias, in contrast to a small positive bias in the built-
up area, and RMSE results in the built-up area were smaller
than those in the cropland area. This high retrieval accuracy
in cropland and built-up regions can support relative studies
on biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions.
In evergreen forest areas (Fig. 3b-i and b-ii), the retrievals
showed a good correlation with ground measurements, with
Rno_QA = 0.874 and RQA = 0.904. However, the R2 results
without and with the QA ﬁlter were all lower than 0.8, and
only approximately 45 % of retrievals fell within the EE en-
velope. The result is opposite to the conclusion that the MA-
IAC algorithm improves the dark target retrieval accuracy
better than the DT algorithm in Lyapustin et al. (2011). To
eliminate the inﬂuence of retrieval accuracy at a speciﬁc site,
Fig. 4 shows a scatterplot ﬁgure of the forest AERONET
site, ignoring the sites with matchup numbers less than 10.
We can observe good performance at the Chiayi, Qiandaohu,
and Xinglong sites, and the corresponding Within_EE re-
sults were all higher than 70 %. The relatively inferior per-
formance sites were Banqiao and Taipei_CWB. After the QA
ﬁlter, the accuracies were improved to 76.19 % and 61.79 %,
respectively. The site with the worst performance was only
the Lulin site, where the MAIAC retrievals were systemically
higher than the ground measurements, and less than 4 % of
retrievals fell within the EE limits. The percentage of forest
type in the 30 km × 30 km spatial window around the Lulin
site always exceeded 80 % in 2000, 2005, 2008, 2010, and
2013. This high proportion of forest type eliminates the in-
ﬂuence of other mixed land cover type. The Lulin site is lo-
cated on the Taiwan peninsula, and thus the improper aerosol
type in the MAIAC algorithm and cloud cover may explain
the overestimation at the Lulin site (Lyapustin et al., 2018).
For the grassland type (Fig. 3c-i and c-ii), over 83.68 %
of MAIAC retrievals fell into the EE lines before the QA
ﬁlter, and the R2 = 0.750, R = 0.875, RMSE = 0.085, and
bias = −0.018 results all showed good accuracy in the grass-
land type. However, after the QA ﬁlter, the accuracy was
dramatically decreased with Within_EE = 46.02 %, R2 =
0.687, R = 0.868, bias = 0.051, and RMSE = 0.114, repre-
senting the main reason for some of the decreased overall sta-
tistical results shown in Fig. 2 for the MAIAC product after
the QA ﬁlter. It is noteworthy that some values were underes-
timated when the AODs were less than 0.5, and these values
were discarded after the QA ﬁlter. However, some overes-
timated values emerged when the AODs were very small.
To identify the reason, we also performed a statistical vali-
dation for each grassland type site in Fig. 5, excluding the
site with a matchup number less than 10. Before the QA ﬁl-
ter, the underestimated values were mainly at the NAM_CO
and QOMS_CAS sites. These two sites are located on the
Tibetan Plateau. The MAIAC algorithm ﬁlled the AOD re-
trievals using climatology values, e.g., 0.014, in high-altitude
regions, e.g., over 4.2 km, and the QA for climatology val-
ues was 0111 (Lyapustin et al., 2018). After the QA ﬁlter,
the climatology values were thrown away at the NAM_CO
site. For the QOMS_CAS site, nearly 2.13 % of pixels still
had altitudes less than 4.2 km in the spatial window. MAIAC
retrievals in these pixels were overestimated compared with
the ground measurements. After the QA ﬁlter, the Within_EE
results decreased from 92.26 % to 38.53 %. A severe under-

estimation phenomenon was found at the Lanzhou_City site,
in contrast to the positive bias at its closest SACOL site. The
small matchup number for the Lanzhou_City site might be
the reason for the underestimation phenomenon. A great im-
provement was found at the Muztagh_Ata site after the QA
ﬁlter.
MAIAC had good accuracy in the unoccupied land cover
type (Fig. 3e-i and e-ii), with Within_EE results of 67.44 %
and 71.43 % before and after the QA ﬁlter, and R and R2
results over 0.9 and 0.8, respectively. Figure 3f-i and f-ii
indicate that MAIAC also achieved better performance in
the mixed land cover area, with Within_EE = 66.80 % and
R = 0.882. In the ocean area (Fig. 3f-i and f-ii), MAIAC al-
gorithm retrievals seemed to be overestimated when AODs
were small, and the R = 0.796 result was a little worse
than one of the other land types. After the QA ﬁlter, the
overestimated values were discarded, and the accuracy was
greatly improved from R = 0.796, Within_EE = 67.96 % to
R = 0.921, and Within_EE = 78.22 %.
In comparison to DT and DB products, Table 4 shows
the validation of the statistical results for the MAIAC, DT,
and DB products with different land type covers. In cropland
area, the accuracy of the DT product was evidently better
than that of the MAIAC and DB products according to the
R2, R, and RMSE results. However, the values seemed to
be overestimated compared with the MAIAC product, and
the Within_EE result was a little smaller compared with the
MAIAC product. In the forest area, the DT algorithm also
achieved optimal accuracy compared with the MAIAC and
DB products. However, only 56.23 % of the retrievals met
the EE limits, which was less than the DB product. In the
grassland type region, the accuracies for the three products

were all decreased after the QA ﬁlter, and we consider the
validations of the three products to have all been inﬂuenced
by the NAM_CO and QOMS_CAS sites. Compared with DT
and DB products, the MAIAC product obtained the best re-
trieval accuracy. Owing to the overestimation phenomenon at
the QOMS_CAS sites after the QA ﬁlter, the Within_EE re-
sult dramatically dropped from 83.68 % to 46.02 %. In built-
up, unoccupied land, and mixed regions, the MAIAC product
performed better than the DB product, and the DB product
was more accurate than the DT product. In the ocean region,
the DT product was clearly more accurate than the DB and
MAIAC products.
Table 5 shows the validation accuracy for three products
after the QA ﬁlter in four seasons. In cropland, the retrieval
accuracies in autumn for the three products were better than
in other seasons. For forest land types, three products showed
a higher correlation in autumn than the other seasons, but
the Within_EE values demonstrated the best results in winter,
and the corresponding results for DB products were clearly
higher than for the other two products. In terms of grass-
land type, MAIAC and DB products were more accurate in
summer and spring, respectively. In the built-up region, all
products showed a high correlation in all seasons, but DT
products were seriously overestimated. In unoccupied land,
matchup pairs for MAIAC and DB products were more fo-
cused in spring, and MAIAC products performed better than
DB products. A high correlation was also found for the three
products in mixed and ocean regions in all seasons, but more
MAIAC retrievals met the EE envelope line.
The Ångström exponent (AE) is a key parameter to de-
scribe aerosol particle size, and in general, local aerosol
sources play a dominant role in aerosol regimes (Mhawish et
al., 2019). To discover aerosol particle sizes in different land
covers, Fig. 6 shows a scatterplot of the AE (440–675 nm)

parameter versus AOD for different land cover types. Our
results were similar to those of Martins et al. (2017). The
aerosol types in China are mainly ﬁne-mode aerosol particles
(AE > 1). Some coarse-mode particles (AE < 0.5) are mainly
found in some regions with sparse vegetation, e.g., grass-
land (vegetation coverage at selected site less than 20 %),
built-up, and unoccupied land. As observed in Fig. 3, high
AOD values mainly occurred in cropland and built-up areas.

According to the AE parameter, the aerosol types for these
high AOD values were mainly ﬁne-mode aerosol particles.
Figure 7 presents the AOD bias distribution along with the
AE parameter. A higher AOD bias often occurred when the
AODs were higher than 0.8 with 1 < AE < 1.5. There was no
AE dependence when the AODs were very small, e.g., lower
than 0.1, for the three products. However, MAIAC seemed to
have a more positive bias than the DB product at a very small
level.

View of the geometry dependency analysis
To determine how the view geometry inﬂuences the accuracy
for three retrieval algorithms, we analyzed view geometry
dependency using the following four angles: solar zenith an-
gle (SZA), view zenith angle (VZA), scattering angle (SA),
and relative azimuth angle (RAA) (Superczynski et al., 2017;
W. Wang et al., 2019). We separated each kind of angle into
10 bins and statistically analyzed the AOD bias distribution
in each bin. The results are displayed in Fig. 8.
In terms of the solar zenith angle, the three retrieval algo-
rithms all showed a strong dependency with different char-
acteristics. A slight downtrend along with SZA was found
in the MAIAC algorithm, and the MAIAC retrievals seemed
slightly overestimated when SZA was less than 40◦and un-
derestimated when it was larger. The mean biases only ﬂuc-
tuated between −0.05 and 0.05. For the DT algorithm, the
mean bias ﬁrst arose when the SZAs were small, and the
mean bias reached the maximum at SZA ≈25◦. Then, the
mean biases decreased as SZA increased. The mean biases
were close to zero when SZA reached the maximum value.
With regard to the DB algorithm, the mean bias ﬁrst slowly
decreased when the SZAs were less than 35◦and then rapidly
rose as SZA increased. After the QA ﬁlter, the whole mean
bias line shifted down.
The MAIAC and DB algorithms showed no dependency
on the view zenith angle, and the corresponding mean bias
lines did not ﬂuctuate much along with VZA. Compared with
the results obtained before and after the QA ﬁlter, the mean
bias line for the MAIAC algorithm slightly increased, and
the mean bias line for the DB algorithm moves down to a
relatively large degree. VZA slightly affected the DT perfor-
mance with a little downtrend. After the QA ﬁlter, the mean
bias line slightly declined.
The scattering angle also greatly impacted the perfor-
mance of the three retrieval algorithms. MAIAC retrievals
seemed to be underestimated when the SAs were less than
100◦and slightly overestimated when they were between 100

and 155◦. When the SAs were larger than 155◦, the retrievals
tended to be underestimated. After the QA ﬁlter, the corre-
sponding retrievals at large SAs tended to be overestimated.
For the DT and DB retrievals, a signiﬁcant uptrend was ob-
served for the mean bias along with SAs. Small positive bi-
ases were found when the SAs were very small, and large
positive biases occurred when the SAs were very large. After
the QA ﬁlter, the signiﬁcant uptrend was alleviated for DB
retrievals, but a large negative bias was found when SA ap-
proached 180◦. We consider the scarce matchup number of
DB retrievals to be the main reason for the negative bias.
For the MAIAC algorithm, positive biases occurred as
RAA approached the extremes of 0◦and 180◦, and nega-
tive bias emerged as RAA neared 90◦, where the matchup
numbers were very limited in the three angle intervals. In
the other angle intervals, MAIAC showed no dependency
on RAA. After the QA ﬁlter, a downtrend of the mean
bias was apparent along with RAA during backscattering
(RAA < 90◦), and an uptrend of the mean bias was observed
during forward-scattering (RAA > 90◦). For the DT algo-
rithm, the positive mean bias decreased as RAA increased
upon backscattering and ﬁrst increased and then decreased
upon forward-scattering. After the QA ﬁlter, the downward
trend tended to be alleviated upon backscattering. For the DB
algorithm, upon backscattering, the positive mean bias ﬁrst
decreased from very high to zero and then increased to be-
come somewhat high. Upon forward-scattering, the positive
mean biases were all larger than 0.05. After the QA ﬁlter and

upon backscattering, no dependency on RAA was observed
for the DB algorithm, but the highest mean bias was lower
than zero. Upon forward-scattering, an obvious linear down-

increased.

Analysis of the spatiotemporal retrieval accuracy
To investigate retrieval accuracy of the three algorithms at
different regions and different times, Fig. 9 shows the R,
RMSE, bias, and Within_EE results for each AERONET
site, ignoring the sites with fewer than 10 matchup numbers,
which might cause unreliable statistical results.
Three products presented different retrieval accuracies in
different regions. In the BTH region (marked by the black
box in Fig. 1), three products showed a good correlation with
the ground measurements, e.g., R > 0.9. There were, how-
ever, more retrievals for MAIAC and DT products falling
within the EE limits than the DB product. Based on the Bias
results, the DT and DB products seemed to be overestimated
compared with the MAIAC product. The DT product was

jing (built-up); Dunhuang (unoccupied land); Hong_Kong_PolyU

more positively biased compared with the MAIAC product.
In the YRD region, the within_EE results showed that more
MAIAC retrievals met the EE limits than DT and DB prod-
ucts. A good correlation of the three products was also found
in this region. However, the DT product was overestimated,
and DB was underestimated. In the PRD region, the MAIAC
retrievals were obviously more accurate than the DT and DB
retrievals. The Within_EE results for the MAIAC retrievals
in this region were all greater than 70 %. The Within_EE
results for the DT retrievals were relatively low for some
sites before the QA ﬁlter. After the QA ﬁlter, the Within_EE
results were greatly improved. DB retrievals in this region
demonstrated the worst performance with low Within_EE re-
sults, a bad correlation, and a negative bias. In addition, the
MAIAC product was also the most accurate product in the
NW area. The Within_EE and R results overall were higher
than for the DT and DB products. Additionally, the RMSE
results for the MAIAC product in this region were also rel-
atively lower than those for the BTH and YRD regions. The
Within_EE results for the MAIAC product for most sites in
the west of Taiwan were higher than 66 % after the QA ﬁl-
ter, demonstrating a high accuracy compared with DT and
DB products. However, according to the east site, e.g., Lulin,
the MAIAC retrievals seemed to be overestimated with low
Within_EE and R results. Additionally, DB retrievals at the
Lulin site seemed to be unbiased with high Within_EE (over
70 %) and relatively high R (over 0.8) results. In the Tibet
area, three algorithms all failed to retrieve AODs according to
the statistical results due to the high latitude and snow cover.
Figure 10 presents the monthly validation results for the
three products. We overlooked the speciﬁc QOMS_CAS site
for this purpose due to its poor performance after the QA ﬁl-
ter, which would affect the overall accuracy. Three products
showed a good correlation with the ground measurements
for all months with R > 0.85. The AOD deviation for the
DT and MAIAC products was higher in spring and summer
than autumn and winter, consistent with the results of He et
al. (2017). The RMSE results for the DB products were gen-
erally higher than the DT and MAIAC products before the
QA ﬁlter. After the QA ﬁlter, the RMSE results decreased
with no obvious seasonal variability law. The DT product
seemed to be systematically overestimated, and the positive
biases were extremely high in spring and summer. The MA-
IAC product was positively biased from June to October with
a bias < 0.1. The DB product was positively biased in all sea-
sons before the QA ﬁlter, but the bias results from June to Oc-
tober were signiﬁcantly reduced after the QA ﬁlter. Before
the QA ﬁlter, the Within_EE results for the MAIAC prod-
uct were higher than the DT and DB products in all months.
However, less than 60 % of the MAIAC retrievals fell within
the EE limits in summer. After the QA ﬁlter, the Within_EE
results for the DB product from June to September were su-
perior to those of the MAIAC and DT products. The R2 re-
sults for the MAIAC products were stable for all months, and
most R2 results were over 0.8. The DB product had a lower
R2 in the cold season from November to February, and in
April and May, the R2 results for the DT product were gen-
erally lower than those in the other months. After the QA
ﬁlter, the DB product achieved higher R2 results from April
to September. According to the matchup number results, the
MAIAC product had more matchup numbers than the DT and
DB products. However, all products had fewer matchup num-
bers in summer due to the increased cloud cover in the rainy
season. In summary, the MAIAC product was more accurate
than the DT and DB products except for in summer. In con-
trast to the positive bias of MAIAC retrievals in summer, the
DB product after the QA ﬁlter could achieve unbiased results
with higher Within_EE and R2 than the MAIAC product.
We investigate the annual change in retrieval accuracy for
three products to ascertain whether the MODIS instrument
maintains its performance due to it exceeding its designed
lifetime. However, according to Table 1, the time durations
of each AERONET site were signiﬁcantly different. Thus,
the matchup observation pair during each year was from dif-
ferent sites. This phenomenon may result from incomparable
validation results for each year. However, if only consider-
ing the sites with the same monitoring time, most sites will
be discarded, and fewer matchup numbers will cause unreli-
able corresponding statistical results. Thus, we still adopted
all site measurements. We ignored the results for the years
2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 due to fewer matchup numbers
in these years. According to Fig. 11, three products showed

a high correlation with ground measurements according to
the R and R2 results, except in 2009. The reason for the
sharp decline in the R and R2 results in 2009 was mainly
that some sites, e.g., Qiandaohu, SACOL, Kaiping, Shoux-
ian, and Zhangye, did not have matchup pairs in this year,
and matchup pairs containing bad retrieval satellite pixels
around the Lanzhou_City and NAM_CO sites appeared in
2009. Thus, the high correlation revealed MODIS instrument
results consistent the AOD retrievals from 2000 to 2017.
The MAIAC AOD deviation was generally small, with most
RMSE results being lower than 0.2 and larger than 0.15. The
RMSE results for the DB product were generally larger than
0.2 before the QA ﬁlter. After the QA ﬁlter, the RMSE re-
sults varied in a large range from 0.15 to 0.25. Based on
the bias result, there was a signiﬁcant uptrend for the three
products over the year. The MAIAC bias results were gen-
erally smaller than the DT and DB products, and most bias
results for the MAIAC product were within ±0.05, with a
negative bias before 2010 and a positive bias after 2010. To
eliminate the inﬂuence of the contribution of some speciﬁc
sites in the speciﬁc year, Fig. 12 plots bias time series for
ﬁve AERONET sites with a monitoring time covering most
study years and ignoring data with matchup numbers less
than 20. The bias uptrend seemed to appear in three products
for all selected sites except the EPA-NCU site for DT prod-
ucts. Thus the signiﬁcant uptrend of bias results is not caused
by the signiﬁcantly different time durations of AERONET
sites. For the Within_EE results, MAIAC also showed bet-
ter accuracy than DT and DB products, and for Within_EE
results, a slight declining trend was observed over the year.
The matchup numbers for the three products revealed an in-
creasing trend due to the establishment of greater numbers of
AERONET sites in the China region over time.

Analysis on spatial pattern variation difference
To compare the difference in spatial variations for the three
products, we upscaled the MAIAC product to match the grid
of the DT and DB products; thus, 1 km pixels falling within
the 10 km grid were averaged. Such a protocol can aid in in-
vestigating differences in different regions between the three
products.
Figure 13 presents multiyear averaged and difference re-
sults between MAIAC, DT, and DB products, with aerosol
loading presenting a noteworthy assembly characteristic.
Higher AOD values were concentrated in the North China
Plain and Sichuan Basin where the land cover types were
mainly cropland-oriented, as shown in Fig. 1. Before the QA
ﬁlter, compared with the DT and DB observations, the MA-
IAC AODs were smaller in the North China Plain and larger
in Yunnan Province and east Taiwan. After the QA ﬁlter,
the DB AODs became smaller in the North China Plain and
southeast region. Compared with the DB AODs, the MAIAC
AODs became slightly higher in the North China Plain (dif-
ference over 0.1) and obviously higher in southeast China
(difference over 0.3). Recall the statistical result presented in
Fig. 9, in which the DT and DB products were overestimated
in the BTH region, the DB product was underestimated in the
YRD region, and the MAIAC product seemed to be overes-
timated in east Taiwan. These ﬁndings indicate that MAIAC

retrievals are more accurate than DT and DB in the North
China Plain and southeast region, and DB retrievals are more
accurate than MAIAC in east Taiwan. However, due to the
lack of the AERONET site in Yunnan Province, we could
not evaluate the accuracy of the three products in Yunnan
Province. The difference before and after the QA ﬁlter for the
MAIAC product was very small, except for some individual
pixels in the Tibet region. In addition, there was an obvious
boundary in the 30◦latitude for MAIAC AODs. This bound-
ary was caused by the different regional aerosol models used
above and below 30◦latitude (Lyapustin et al., 2018).

in the Tarim Basin in spring were higher than in other sea-

the difference between MAIAC and DT in the North China
Plain evolved gradually from negative in spring to positive
in winter. The negative difference between MAIAC and DB
in the North China Plain was higher in summer and winter
than in spring and autumn. The positive difference in Yunnan
Province between MAIAC and DT was slightly lower than
that between MAIAC and DB. After the QA ﬁlter, AODs in
south China for the DB product were extremely low com-
pared with those for the MAIAC product.

Analysis of spatiotemporal completeness
Based the upscale MAIAC 10 km data in Sect. 4.4, the spatial
completeness in Eq. (7) and temporal completeness in Eq. (8)
for three products are shown in Figs. 15 and 16. According
to Fig. 15, the spatial completeness of the MAIAC product
was higher than the DT and DB products before and after
the QA ﬁlter. The spatial completeness of the DT product
was smallest due to its retrieval failure on a bright surface.
The spatial completeness for all the products showed an ob-
vious periodical trend change. Table 6 shows the statistics
for the spatial completeness of the three products in different
seasons. Before the QA ﬁlter, the averaged spatial complete-
ness of MAIAC (46.87 %) was higher than DT (16.66 %) and
DB (34.80 %). After the QA ﬁlter, the reduced proportion of
MAIAC (17.18 %) exceeded DB (15.30 %) and DT (8.66 %)
because many climatology values in the Tibet Plateau were
discarded. Comparison of the spatial completeness in four
seasons revealed a higher spatial completeness for the three
products in autumn than the other three seasons due to the

this region was very high (over 80 %). After the QA ﬁlter, the
temporal completeness rapidly decreased in this region. In
the other region, the declining proportions of temporal com-
pleteness for MAIAC were mostly lower than 10 %, except
for Yunnan Province (nearly 15 %), Hainan Province (nearly
20 %), and east Taiwan (nearly 20 %). Compared with the
MAIAC and DB products, DT retrievals were very scarce in
the Tarim Basin due to failure on the bright desert surface.
DT retrievals were more concentrated on the North China
Plain and in Yunnan Province. After the QA ﬁlter, a dramat-
ically reduced proportional area of temporal completeness
(nearly 30 %) for DT products was observed in the crop-
land region in northeast China. The severely reduced pro-
portional area (nearly 40 %) for the DB product after the
QA ﬁlter was mainly focused on unoccupied land, e.g., gobi,
saline–alkaline soil, at the top of the Tibet Plateau. Compared
with the MAIAC product, before the QA ﬁlter, the DB prod-
uct showed more retrievals in the Tarim Basin, North China
Plain, and southeast China and fewer retrievals in Yunnan
Province and northeast China. After the QA ﬁlter, the tem-
poral completeness of the MAIAC product was better than
the DB product in all regions.

Conclusion
In this study, we present the ﬁrst comprehensive validation
and comparison of three MODIS aerosol retrieval algorithms
(i.e., MAIAC, DT, and DB) across China in terms of overall
accuracy, land cover dependency, viewed geometry depen-
dency, spatiotemporal retrieval accuracy, spatial distribution
difference, and spatiotemporal completeness. These valida-
tion results may guide users to utilize the three products ap-
propriately. The main results and conclusions are presented
below.
In terms of overall accuracy, the MAIAC product is more
accurate than the DT and DB products. The DT and DB prod-

ucts are positively biased before the QA ﬁlter, and the posi-
tive bias for the DB product is alleviated by the QA ﬁlter.
DT retrievals in cropland, forest, and ocean seem to be
more accurate but with a positive bias than retrievals by the
MAIAC and DB algorithms. The MAIAC algorithm per-
forms better in grassland, built-up, and mixed areas than the
DT and DB algorithms.
Three algorithms show a strong dependency on SZA, SA,
and RAA. VZA only marginally affects the retrieval accuracy
of the three algorithms.
The MAIAC product performs better in the BTH, YRD,
PRD, and NW regions than the DT and DB algorithms, and
the DB product performs better than the DT and MAIAC
products after the QA ﬁlter in east Taiwan. The MAIAC al-
gorithm performs better than the DT and DB algorithms in
most months except June, July, August, and September. In
these four months, MAIAC retrievals appear to be overesti-
mated, and DB retrievals after the QA ﬁlter are more accurate
than MAIAC retrievals.
Three AOD products present a similar spatial pattern with
high aerosol loading in the North China Plain and Sichuan
Basin. In comparison, MAIAC retrievals are lower in the
North China Plain and Sichuan Basin than DT and DB re-
trievals and are higher in Yunnan Province and east Taiwan
than DT and DB retrievals. After the QA ﬁlter, the DB AOD
values are signiﬁcantly reduced and obviously lower than the
MAIAC product in southeast China.
Based on spatiotemporal completeness analysis, the MA-
IAC product has more retrievals in the spatiotemporal do-
main than the DT and DB products. The spatial complete-
ness exhibits a strong periodical change, and the temporal
completeness is highest in autumn compared to other sea-
sons due to the decreasing cloud cover in this dry season,
which is lowest in winter due to the snow cover and decid-
uous vegetation. In terms of temporal completeness, MA-
IAC has more retrievals in the Tarim Basin and the cropland
in northeast China compared with the DT algorithm. Com-
pared with the DB algorithm, MAIAC has fewer retrievals in
the Tarim Basin and southeast China and more retrievals in
northeast China. After the QA ﬁlter, the temporal complete-
ness of MAIAC in all regions of China is better than that of
the DB product.
