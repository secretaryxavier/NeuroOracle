Previous studies have revealed that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels
are inversely associated with the severity of depressive symptoms. In addition, serum
BDNF levels tend to increase with improvement in depressive symptoms. There is
also evidence that BDNF has a possible role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.
Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether BDNF levels correlated
with depressive symptoms in patients with ﬁrst-episode and drug-naïve (FEDN)
schizophrenia. In this study, 90 patients with FEDN schizophrenia and 60 healthy
controls were recruited. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the
17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) were used to gage psychopathological
and depressive symptoms, respectively. All participants had their BDNF levels measured
using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent test. Serum BDNF levels were lower
in patients with FEDN schizophrenia compared with healthy controls. Moreover, patients
with depressive symptoms exhibited a higher PANSS total score and a higher general
psychopathology score than those without depressive symptoms (p < 0.05). For
patients with depressive symptoms, serum BDNF levels were higher than in those
without depressive symptoms (p < 0.05). An association between BDNF levels and
the positive subscore was also observed (p < 0.01). However, there was no signiﬁcant
association between BDNF levels and HAMD scores (p > 0.05). In conclusion, BDNF
levels were shown to be higher in the serum of patients with FEDN schizophrenia
with depressive symptoms than in those without. Additionally, low levels of serum
BDNF may contribute to the positive symptoms of FEDN schizophrenia but not to
depressive symptoms.

Depressive Symptoms and BDNF Levels in Schizophrenia
INTRODUCTION
Depressive symptoms are common in patients with ﬁrst-episode
schizophrenia, not only concurrent with, but also preceding, the
ﬁrst episode of schizophrenia (1). The prevalence of depressive
symptoms among patients with schizophrenia has been estimated
to range between 30 and 70% (2). Patients with schizophrenia are
more likely to experience depressive symptoms than the general
population (3). In addition, depressive symptoms typically
manifest as hallmarks of schizophrenia and are associated with
worse prognoses for schizophrenia (4, 5). Therefore, the quest for
molecular biomarkers of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia
is vital for the development of eﬀective therapies to limit the
detrimental consequences of depressive symptoms.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), one of the most
extensively distributed neurotrophins in the adult mammalian
brain, plays a key role in supporting the dendrites of
various central nervous system (CNS) neurons, such as mood-
regulating neurons (6–9). According to previous studies, BDNF
is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and
is associated with schizophrenia-related phenotypes (10, 11).
A number of studies have shown that the serum BDNF levels
of patients with schizophrenia were lower than those of healthy
controls (12–15). In addition, serum BDNF levels have a
substantial correlation with the Positive and Negative Syndrome
Scale (PANSS) score (16). Furthermore, the mRNA expression of
BDNF and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) was found to
be reduced in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of patients
with schizophrenia, indicating that BDNF should be studied as a
potential target for antipsychotic medications (17, 18).
In addition to schizophrenia, altered levels of BDNF in
the hippocampus and blood have been associated with other
psychiatric disorders, including depression (19, 20). For example,
several animal studies have shown that BDNF appears to have a
crucial role in depressive-like behavior in rats (21, 22). In human
research, the description of BDNF levels in peripheral blood may
be traced back to the early work of Karege, who suggested that
major depression was characterized by low serum BDNF levels
(23). According to increasing evidence, the interaction of BDNF-
TrkB and dopamine (DA) signaling in midbrain circuits plays a
major role in the pathophysiology of depression (24–26). There is
also evidence that serum BDNF levels are decreased in depressed
patients and recover to normal following antidepressant therapy
(27, 28).
The association between depressive symptoms and BDNF
in patients with schizophrenia has received limited research
attention, despite the fact that many studies have investigated
the associations between BDNF and memory and cognitive
performance in schizophrenia (20, 29–31). According to an
earlier study, the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism has been
reported to aﬀect the intensity of depressive symptoms in patients
with schizophrenia (32). In addition, after 12 weeks of olanzapine
medication, researchers found an increase in serum BDNF levels
and a decline in depressive symptoms (33). Although Noto
et al. reported that individuals with more severe depressive
symptoms exhibited higher levels of BDNF (34), no research
has studied the relationship between comorbid depression
and BDNF in patients with ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia. We
therefore set out to explore whether BDNF is associated with
depressive symptoms in patients with ﬁrst-episode and drug-
naïve (FEDN) schizophrenia.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
We recruited a total of 90 patients (48 men and 42 women)
from Beijing Huilongguan Hospital, one of the largest public
psychiatric hospitals in China. We diagnosed patients with
schizophrenia up admission using the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), and
then we conﬁrmed the diagnosis 12 weeks late (35). We deﬁned
patients as FEDN based on a previous study by Lieberman et al.
(36). Inclusion criteria included: (1) age between 16 and 55 years;
(2) acute episodes of DSM-IV schizophrenia at admission;
(3) duration of symptoms ≤60 months; (4) never received
any antipsychotic, antidepressant, or any other psychoactive
treatment; (5) score ≥4 as assessed by the Clinical Global
Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S); and (6) able to provide written
informed consent. Upon admission, all patients were physically
examined and provided a complete medical history. Among
them, those meeting the following criteria were excluded: (1)
current major physical illness; (2) personal history of neurological
disorders; (3) history of alcohol or drug dependence in addition
to smoking; and (4) inability to provide signed consent.
While the patients were being recruited, 60 healthy controls
(31 men and 29 women) were recruited in the local community.
Unstructured interviews and a personal and family psychiatric
history were used to determine their current mental status.
Individuals with a history of mental illness were barred
from participating.
The research protocol was approved by the Institute Review
Board, Beijing Huilongguan hospital. To be a part of the study,
each participant had to complete an informed consent form.
Clinical Measures
The PANSS and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-
17) were applied to measure psychopathology and depressive
symptoms, respectively. Additionally, the clinical severity was
assessed using the Clinical Global Impression Inventory (CGI).
The PANSS, HAMD-17, and CGI evaluations were administered
by four psychiatrists who had been trained in their usage prior
to the commencement of the research to assure the reliability
and consistency of the scales. After training, the correlation
coeﬃcient between investigators while repeatedly scoring the
PANSS, HAMD-17, and CGI was more than 0.80.
The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD)
was applied to assess depressive symptoms, with nine items
scored
from
0
(absent)
to
2
(symptom-speciﬁc
severity
descriptors), and eight items scored from 0 (absent) to 4
(severe). Items 8, 9, and 11 were based on observation of the
patient; the remaining items are assessed based on the patient’s
own verbal narrative; item 1 required a combination of both.
There were two other points to note: item 7 required information

Depressive Symptoms and BDNF Levels in Schizophrenia
from the patient’s family, and item 16 could be assessed based
on the patient’s complaint and information from the patient’s
family. According to a previous study, we deﬁned schizophrenia
patients with depressive symptoms as having a total HAMD-17
score ≥8, while those without depressive symptoms had a total
score ≤7 (37).
Blood Sampling and Serum
Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor
Measurements
Serum samples were collected from participants between 7:00
and 9:00 am after an overnight fast. In order to conduct the
tests, samples were obtained on the same day as the clinical
evaluation and separated, aliquoted, and stored at −70◦C.
A commercially available kit (R&D Systems, Beijing, China) was
used to measure serum BDNF levels using a sandwich enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay. These assays are detailed in full
in our prior reports (38, 39). The same technician, who had
no knowledge of the clinical circumstances, measured all serum
samples. Meanwhile, the principal investigator applied codes
to identify all participants until all biochemical analyses were
completed. The inter- and intra-assay coeﬃcients of variation
were 7 and 5%, respectively.
Statistical Analysis
First, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov one-sample test and the Q-Q
plot were used to verify normality. For normally distributed
numerical variables, mean ± standard deviation were used,
whereas numbers and percentages were used for categorical
variables. Demographic factors were compared using analysis
of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-
square analysis for categorical variables. Demographic factors
were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) for
continuous variables and chi-square analysis for categorical
variables. Furthermore, demographic parameters were taken
into account as covariates in the comparison of serum BDNF
levels between patients and healthy controls. The relationship
between the variables was assessed with the Pearson’s product
moment correlation method. In addition, further multiple linear
regression analysis was used to explore correlations between the
variables. All dependent variables were normally distributed and
there was no evidence of multicollinearity.
We used SPSS (IBM SPSS 24.0, SPSS Inc.) and GraphPad
Prism 8 (GraphPad Software Inc.) for all our analyses, with the
signiﬁcance level α set at p < 0.05 (two-tailed test).
RESULTS
Comparison of Patients and Healthy
Controls
As shown in Table 1, each participant’s demographic, and clinical
data were summarized. There was no signiﬁcant sex diﬀerence
between the patients with FEDN schizophrenia and healthy
controls. However, the patients were younger than the healthy
controls (p < 0.05).

Moreover, no signiﬁcant relationship was observed between
serum BDNF levels and age, sex, education, smoking status,
heredity, or age of onset in patients with and without depressive
symptoms (all p > 0.05; Table 3).
In addition, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted,
considering smoking status as a covariate. Serum BDNF levels
were shown to be higher in individuals with depressive symptoms
compared to those without such symptoms (9.9 ± 5.3 vs.
7.5 ± 2.7 ng/mL; p < 0.05).
Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic
Factor Levels and Psychopathological
Symptoms of Patients
As shown in Table 2, patients without depression showed the
following mean scores on PANSS: positive subscore, 23.7 ± 5.2;
negative subscore, 18.0 ± 5.5; general psychopathology score,
33.0 ± 5.5, and PANSS total score, 74.8 ± 10.0. For patients
with depression: positive subscore, 26.6 ± 6.5; negative subscore,
18.6 ± 7.9; general psychopathology score, 43.1 ± 12.2, and
PANSS total score, 88.3 ± 20.7.
Smoking status was taken into account as a covariate in
the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). There were signiﬁcant

diﬀerences in PANSS general psychopathology (p < 0.001) and
PANSS total scores (p = 0.001) between patients with and without
depressive symptoms.
Further correlation analysis showed a signiﬁcant association
between BDNF levels and PANSS total scores (r = 0.328, p < 0.01;
Figure 1). There was also a signiﬁcant association between
BDNF levels and positive symptom score (r = 0.342, p < 0.01;
Figure 2) and further multiple linear regression aﬃrmed this
result (β = 0.342, 95% CI: 0.018–0.425, p = 0.005). However,
no signiﬁcant association was found between BDNF and other
subscales (all p > 0.05; Table 3).

Neurotrophic Factor and Depressive
Symptoms in Patients With
Schizophrenia
Correlation analyses did not show a signiﬁcant association
between BDNF levels and HAMD scores in all patients with
schizophrenia (p > 0.05; Table 3).
DISCUSSION
In our current study, there were four main ﬁndings. (1) Serum
BDNF levels were signiﬁcantly lower in patients with FEDN
schizophrenia than in healthy controls. (2) Serum BDNF levels
were higher in FEDN schizophrenia patients with depressive
symptoms than in patients without depressive symptoms. (3)
There was a signiﬁcant association between serum BDNF levels
and positive symptoms (p < 0.01). (4) There was no signiﬁcant
association between serum BDNF levels and HAMD scores.

Depressive Symptoms and BDNF Levels in Schizophrenia
prior studies (12, 15) and consistent with other studies in
patients with ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia (14, 40), and chronic
schizophrenia (41–43), albeit not all (44). Levels of BDNF in the
hippocampus and prefrontal cortex have been demonstrated to
be lower in patients with schizophrenia (45). Moreover, several
studies have shown a substantial positive correlation between
peripheral BDNF levels and central nervous system BDNF levels
(46, 47). According to previous studies, peripheral BDNF from
platelets, immune cells, and vascular endothelial cells may cross
the blood-brain barrier (48). Thus, decreased serum BDNF
levels may indicate neuropathological alterations in the brain,
conﬁrming the neurodevelopment hypothesis, which claims that
schizophrenia is the outcome of pathological processes that
begin during prenatal and postnatal central nervous system
development (49).
For the time being, there are still no conclusive results
regarding the BDNF levels in the serum of schizophrenia
patients with depressive symptoms. Our study showed that
schizophrenia patients with depressive symptoms had higher
serum BDNF levels than those without depressive symptoms,
which is consistent with previous studies (34), but contradicts
the ﬁndings of some investigations (50, 51). Many factors
may play a role in these diﬀerences, such as duration of
untreated psychosis, age of onset, duration of illness, test material
(plasma versus serum), and diﬀerent ethnicity of the subjects
(52, 53). Furthermore, numerous studies on inﬂammatory and
oxidative stress markers in schizophrenia have demonstrated
an association between unmediated ﬁrst episode psychosis and
systemic inﬂammation and oxidative stress, as indicated by
elevated levels of cytokines and oxidative stress markers in
peripheral blood (54–57). In addition, BDNF has been shown
to have a compensatory function by reducing oxidative damage
to lipids and proteins via modulating antioxidant defenses when
rats were exposed to chronic unpredictable moderate stress
(58). Therefore, higher levels of BDNF in FEDN schizophrenia
patients with depressive symptoms may be a compensatory
response to reduced antioxidant status and pro-inﬂammatory
imbalance (59) in patients with ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia
(54, 60).
Association Between Brain-Derived
Neurotrophic Factor and Clinical
Symptoms
We found that patients without depressive symptoms performed
lower on the PANSS total score and general subscore than
patients with depressive symptoms. Additionally, we observed
no diﬀerence in the positive subscore between the groups of
patients, which is consistent with Calderon-Mediavilla’s previous
study (61). There was also no diﬀerence in the negative subscore.
Given that negative symptoms are less frequent in the initial
year of schizophrenia, and peak between 2 and 5 years following
the ﬁrst admission, it is understandable that no diﬀerence was
detected (62).
Another ﬁnding of this study was the signiﬁcant correlation
between serum BDNF levels and positive symptoms. In several
previous studies, BDNF levels have been associated with both
positive symptoms (63, 64) and negative symptoms (65).
According to previous ﬁndings, BDNF and the dopaminergic
system are intimately linked. There have been reports that
BDNF and its receptor TrkB were expressed in the midbrain
dopamine (DA) circuit (66). There is also further evidence
to suggest that BDNF may enhance the release of DA (67).
Meanwhile, several theories have argued that uncoordinated DA
signaling is to blame for positive symptoms such as delusions
and hallucinations (68, 69). Therefore, we propose that the
positive correlation between BDNF and positive symptom score
observed in the current research was due to an aberrant
interaction between the BDNF and DA systems, which warrants
further investigation.
In the current study, no signiﬁcant association was noted
between serum BDNF levels and HAMD scores, which is
consistent with some previous studies (70–72), but is not
deﬁnitive (73). Nevertheless, to our knowledge, the current

Our study had several limitations. First, case-control studies
cannot be used to draw conclusions regarding the relationship
between serum BDNF levels and depressive symptoms in patients
with FEDN schizophrenia. Second, patients in the current
study were inpatients recruited at a psychiatric hospital in
Beijing, with a relatively limited sample size, constraining the
application of our results to outpatients and other settings
before conclusive conclusions can be reached. Third, additional
factors not investigated in this research, such as exercise, a
history of suicide attempts, drug use other than smoking,
and seasonality, may impact the prevalence or severity of
depressive symptoms in patients with FEDN schizophrenia.
Fourth, the HAMD-17 was not originally intended to evaluate
depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The
Calgary Schizophrenia Depression Inventory (77), which better
distinguishes between depressive and negative symptoms of
schizophrenia, could have been employed instead. Fifth, we
needed to obtain blood samples from subjects in this study,
but many healthy controls were reluctant to provide blood
samples. Furthermore, there were design ﬂaws in this study.
Therefore, these factors resulted in unbalanced sample sizes
between the schizophrenia and healthy control groups. We
will conduct a follow-up study with a larger sample size
and to ensure equal numbers in both groups. Therefore, to
corroborate our present results, further longitudinal studies
with larger study populations that control for confounding
variables are required.
In summary, we conducted a clinical study to clarify
the relationship between serum BDNF levels and depressive

symptoms in patients with FEDN schizophrenia. Patients with
depressive symptoms in the early stages of schizophrenia
were shown to have higher levels of BDNF in their serum.
In addition, low serum BDNF levels were associated with
positive symptoms of schizophrenia but not with depressive
symptoms. The study’s relatively small sample size limited
the extension of the ﬁndings. In follow-up studies, we will
include more samples to conﬁrm the ﬁndings in this study.
Further longitudinal and prospective investigations may oﬀer
new venues for exploring the relationship between serum
BDNF levels and depressive symptoms in patients with
FEDN schizophrenia.
