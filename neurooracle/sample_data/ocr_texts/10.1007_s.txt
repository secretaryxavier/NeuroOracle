Abstract Safer conception interventions reduce HIV
incidence while supporting the reproductive goals of peo-
ple living with or affected by HIV. We developed a con-
sensus statement to address demand, summarize science,
identify information gaps, outline research and policy pri-
orities, and advocate for safer conception services. This
statement emerged from a process incorporating consulta-
tion from meetings, literature, and key stakeholders. Three
co-authors developed an outline which was discussed and
modified with co-authors, working group members, and

additional clinical, policy, and community experts in safer
conception, HIV, and fertility. Co-authors and working
group members developed and approved the final manu-
script. Consensus across themes of demand, safer concep-
tion strategies, and implementation were identified. There
is demand for safer conception services. Access is limited
by stigma towards PLWH having children and limits to
provider knowledge. Efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and
acceptability data support a range of safer conception
strategies including ART, PrEP, limiting condomless sex to
peak fertility, home insemination, male circumcision, STI
treatment, couples-based HIV testing, semen processing,
and fertility care. Lack of guidelines and training limit
implementation. Key outstanding questions within each
theme are identified. Consumer demand, scientific data,
and global goals to reduce HIV incidence support safer
conception service implementation. We recommend that
providers offer services to HIV-affected men and women,
and program administrators integrate safer conception care
into HIV and reproductive health programs. Answers to
outstanding questions will refine services but should not
hinder steps to empower people to adopt safer conception
strategies to meet reproductive goals.

Context and Purpose
Globally, at least 20-50% of men and women living with
HIV want to have children [1-4]. For many HIV-affected
individuals and couples, attempting pregnancy introduces
risks of HIV transmission to infants and HIV-uninfected
partners. Antiretroviral-driven HIV-prevention strategies
reduce risks of HIV transmission through pregnancy
attempts and pregnancy. Programs to prevent or eliminate
maternal-to-child-transmission (PMTCT/EMTCT) reduce
perinatal transmission to less than 2% for women living
with HIV [5]. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) extends the
health and survival of people living with HTV (PLWH) to a
life expectancy equivalent to that of HIV-negative persons
[6, 7]. Furthermore, HIV prevention programs offer mul-
tiple approaches to reduce sexual HIV transmission risk
during condomless sex [8, 9]: these can be promoted when
people affected by HIV desire and attempt pregnancy.
A growing body of evidence suggests opportunities for
widespread promotion of safer conception counseling and
service delivery. Safer conception interventions reduce
HIV incidence while supporting the pregnancy goals of
men and women living with or affected by HIV. Safer
conception program outputs dovetail with global goals to
enhance HIV testing, ART uptake, and HIV-RNA sup-
pression, and thus reduce HIV incidence and eliminate
perinatal transmission. However, a limited number of
country-level policies and a lack of global guidelines leave
providers unprepared to counsel clients. Therefore,
grounded in a reproductive rights-based framework, with
foundations in scientific data and community values, we
developed this consensus statement to: articulate experi-
ences with and address growing demand for safer con-
ception services; summarize the science; identify
information gaps; outline research and policy priorities;
and advocate for action.
History of Growing Consensus on Safer Conception
This consensus statement was motivated by discussions
over the last decade. Safer conception research, policy, and
implementation has been highlighted at international
meetings [10-15] [16-18], leading journals have
G) Springer
highlighted research in this field through supplements [19]
[20, 21] [22], and several organizations advocate for and
provide safer conception care for persons-affected by HIV
[23] [24] [25]. The Global Network of People Living with
HIV [15] and the International Community of Women
Living with HIV [26] endorse safer conception program-
ming and sexual and reproductive health and rights for
people living with or affected by HIV. Canada [27, 28],
South Africa [29], and the UK [30]) have national guide-
lines offering comprehensive safer conception guidelines.
Call for Consensus Document
The call for this global consensus statement to advocate for
safer conception implementation emerged from a satellite
session at the International AIDS Society 2015 Conference
titled “Achieving pregnancy while minimizing HIV
transmission risks: Safer conception research, policy, and
programming priorities for HIV-affected individuals and
couples” [31]. This session convened approximately 180
stakeholders from 25 countries including PLWH, clini-
cians, researchers, policy makers, community advocates,
and donor agencies.
Our process
This document emerged from a consultative process
incorporating input from the above meetings, literature,
and discussions with key stakeholders. Three co-authors
(LTM, RH, AK) developed a draft outline of the manu-
script which was discussed and modified with co-authors
and other experts in safer conception, HIV treatment and
prevention, fertility, and perinatal transmission.
The updated outline informed a draft of the statement
and feedback was sought from co-authors and key stake-
holders (consumers, persons living with HIV, research and
clinical leaders in safer conception). Feedback was inte-
grated to develop a penultimate draft of the manuscript. All
co-authors approved the final draft of the consensus
guidelines. Subsequently, the statement was posted online
and circulated to key stakeholders including organizations,
clinicians, community members, researchers, and advo-
cates in sexual and reproductive health, fertility, and HIV
for endorsement (https://www.hiveonline.org/safe
rconceptionendorse/).
Consensus
We summarize the evidence regarding demand for,
strategies for, and implementation of safer conception
services. Several related topics such as contraception,
antiretroviral treatment choices during pregnancy, perinatal

transmission of HIV, and breastfeeding practices are not
explicitly covered in this document. We outline key
questions that remain unanswered and suggest steps for the
way forward. We articulate the need for action to provide
services to minimize pregnancy-related HIV transmission
risks while supporting the sexual and reproductive goals of
men and women affected by HIV. We urge providers and
policy-makers to support safer conception service imple-
mentation even as research and advocacy continue.
Demand for Safer Conception Services: Evidence
For most men and women, an HIV diagnosis does not
eliminate hopes or plans to have children, yet few access
safer conception care [32—35]. Individual stories articulated
by people living with HIV highlight the demand and
opportunities for service delivery (See Box 1).
The demand, opportunities, and challenges expressed in
these stories echo throughout the literature. Most men and
women living with or affected by HIV have limited
awareness about HIV prevention options that reduce
transmission during condomless sex [35, 36]. Providers do
not initiate conversations about reproductive goals with
HIV-affected clients [33, 35, 37-39] and anticipated stigma
from providers is a barrier to seeking care [34, 40, 41]. In
Box 1 Pregnancy experiences of HIV-affected men and women
addition, individuals and couples who want to have chil-
dren may not explicitly plan for pregnancy, limiting
opportunities for pre-conception counseling [35, 42, 43].
HIV counseling and testing can be an entry point to dis-
cussions about pregnancy plans and safer conception care
but uptake of pre-conception HIV testing is low [44].
Furthermore, this is not a one-time conversation, as
reproductive goals evolve over time. For many seeking
pregnancy, reproductive services and/or fertility evaluation
may be necessary, but ongoing stigma and limited
resources constrain access to fertility services for PLWH.
Among those who know their serostatus, barriers to dis-
closure to sexual partners and confusion about serodis-
cordance limit recognition that conception attempts may be
accompanied by HIV exposure [40, 45, 46]. When dis-
cussion about safer conception is started, provider guidance
about the various methods is desired [47, 48]. Men’s voices
are nearly absent in conversations about sexual and
reproductive health for persons living with or affected by
HIV [49]. Furthermore, many men and women make
decisions and plans regarding reproductive goals together
with families and communities where knowledge of safer
conception opportunities is low. See Table | for summary
consensus points in the area of Demand for Safer Con-
ception Services.
Jacque is a Kenyan woman in her early 40 s. She was diagnosed with HIV in 2004. 5 years after learning her positive HIV status, she
discovered she was pregnant again. Although this was an unplanned pregnancy, it was not unwanted. Her partner at the time was also living
with HIV. The reaction of her community as they learned that she was a pregnant woman living with HIV surprised her. They questioned
why a woman living with HIV would become pregnant and accused her of wanting to give her unborn child AIDS. Nonetheless, she carried
on with the pregnancy, received PMTCT care, and was blessed with a son who is now 7 years old and HIV-negative. However, Jacque’s
experiences of stigma and discrimination throughout her pregnancy caused her to limit her desire to expand her family further, until recently
She now has a partner who is HIV-negative and he would like to have a child with her. He is concerned about acquiring HIV and the risks to a
future baby. He does not know if it is possible to conceive with an HIV-positive partner and anticipates facing judgment from his family,
community, and healthcare providers. As an activist and well-informed woman, Jacque knows that safer conception is possible but feels the
burden of responsibility to find a willing provider or take it upon herself to educate and inform her HIV care providers to support the fertility

Juan* is a North American man living with HIV. When he was diagnosed with HIV in 2008, he worried about whether he would be able to
have a family. Juan’s provider asked him about whether or not he wanted a child in the future, discussing the options together. When Juan
began dating Monica, she came to clinic with him and learned about reducing HIV transmission, including pre-exposure prophylaxis/PrEP.
Monica chose to take PrEP and stay on contraception until she finished school. After graduating, she continued PrEP and became pregnant.
Monica remains HIV-negative and delivered an HIV-negative baby. Juan remains engaged in care and maintains an undetectable HIV-RNA
viral load
Lisa is a young Canadian woman who acquired HIV infection via perinatal transmission. As a young child, she received HIV care including
antiretroviral therapy through a local clinic for HIV-infected children, women, and their families. In her 20 s, Lisa fell in love with and
married an HIV-negative man. When the couple decided to expand their family, they sought guidance from Lisa’s HIV providers, with
whom she had developed a trusting relationship. Lisa’s care providers supported her pregnancy plans and offered the couple safer
conception counseling. Lisa successfully used ART and had an undetectable viral load for at least six months before the couple started
having sex without condoms to try to get pregnant. They paid attention to time their condomless sex to days with high fertility. Within a
year, Lisa and her husband welcomed a baby girl. Both her husband and baby remain HIV-uninfected. Lisa credits her supported journey to
motherhood to her HIV care providers’ commitment to integrated, women-centered, and holistic management of HIV, from diagnosis,
treatment initiation, and conception, to pregnancy, postpartum, and beyond

Table 1 Summary group consensus points based on the available evidence
Demand for safer conception services
e There is widespread demand for safer conception services. In the absence of support for
informed decisions about safer conception practices, HIV-affected individuals and couples
navigate pregnancy decisions without information to support HIV risk reduction opportunities
® Stigma towards PLWH having children limits access to comprehensive reproductive care
e Insufficient knowledge, a lack of normative safer conception guidance, and limited skills
regarding safer conception options prevent healthcare providers from initiating conversations
about reproductive goals with PLWH and their partners
e Attrition across the HIV care cascade limits the reach and potential of safer conception care.
Efforts are required to ensure that HIV prevention services are available to all who require
them
e Reproductive goals, risk perceptions, and acceptance of both risks and risk reduction
strategies are fluid and thus not readily addressed by one-time counseling
© Safer conception information needs to be shared beyond individual-level clinic counseling to
include partners, family members, and communities.
Opportunities for HIV prevention in the
context of desired pregnancy
e There is clear scientific evidence regarding efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and client
acceptability supporting a range of biomedical and behavioral safer conception strategies
e Antiretroviral treatment (ART) for people living with HIV is indicated for their own health,
and also to reduce transmission to partners and (for women) infants at all times, including
when pregnancy is intended
® Choices provide options and engage people living with HIV in care. PrEP for HIV-negative
partners, limiting condomless sex to peak fertility, home insemination, male circumcision,
treatment of sexually transmitted infections, couples-based HIV testing, semen processing
and assisted reproductive technologies, and fertility care provide additional HIV prevention
options to support individual preferences and the realities of accessible services

Opportunities for HIV Prevention in the Context
of Desired Pregnancy: Evidence
Several strategies allow HIV-affected couples to conceive
with minimal transmission risk to the uninfected partner
(Table 2). All PLWH, regardless of reproductive plans, are
encouraged to initiate ART upon HIV diagnosis to improve
their own health, reduce morbidity and mortality, and
reduce HIV transmission [50]. When pregnancy is desired,
the benefits of ART extend to safer conception. It is ideal
for individuals and couples to delay pregnancy attempts
until HIV-RNA is suppressed or after at least six months of
ART [51], 52].
Because uptake of and adherence to ART is often
imperfect or unknown to the partner, individuals may
choose additional methods to reduce transmission risk. Pre-

exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended for those at
substantial risk of HIV and is an important option for an
uninfected partner wishing to conceive with an infected
partner whose ART use is suboptimal or unknown [50]. For
men or women exposed to HIV and not yet on PrEP,
antiretroviral post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) may reduce
HIV acquisition risks and can be offered within 72 h of
exposure and continued for 28 days after exposure [53]
[50]. For individuals or couples exposed to HIV as part of
conception attempts, PEP may be a bridge to PrEP [42].
When used prior to pregnancy, there are minimal safety or
fertility concerns about tenofovir-based PrEP [54, 55]. For
uninfected women, safety data about TDF/FTC-based PrEP
during pregnancy are based on studies of women living
with HIV or hepatitis B exposed to combination ART
throughout pregnancy. The data are largely reassuring but

inconsistent results suggest possible decreased bone min-
eral density in newborns, with unknown clinical signifi-
cance, and one study showed risk of adverse infant
outcomes (low birth weight or even stillbirth) among
infants exposed to TDF/FTC as part of ART, a finding not
replicated in other studies [55, 56]. This warrants addi-
tional data collection among women using PrEP through-
out pregnancy. Current guidelines recommend PrEP as a
safer conception strategy with discussion of the risks and
benefits of continuing PrEP use during pregnancy and
breastfeeding [50, 57].
Additional strategies to decrease HIV acquisition by
men during pregnancy attempts with a woman living with
HIV include vaginal self-insemination, which eliminates
the need for condomless sex [58]; and medical male cir-
cumcision [59]. Treatment for sexually transmitted infec-
tions (STIs) has been shown to further reduce HIV
transmission risk [60, 61]. Limiting condomless sex to days
with peak fertility [62] maximizes likelihood of achieving
pregnancy while limiting HIV exposure.
For HIV-serodiscordant couples where the man is living
with HIV, sperm processing or “washing” can isolate
sperm (which do not harbor HIV) from seminal plasma and
leukocytes [63]. Processed semen can be introduced via
intrauterine insemination, in vitro fertilization with or
without intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or via a cervical
cap. Robust data suggest that this process is safe and
effective, with no recorded HIV transmissions to preg-
nancy partners [64]. This is an important option but should
by no means be mandated [65].
Compromised fertility among HIV-affected couples
may result in HIV-exposure with minimal chances of
pregnancy [66]. Infertility screening may identify couples
who would benefit from services to optimize fertility pro-
spects prior to pregnancy attempts [67]. Comprehensive
safer conception care also includes offering contraception
until couples are ready to attempt pregnancy and/or once
they have met their reproductive goals. See Table 1 for
summary consensus points in the area of “Opportunities for
HIV prevention in the context of desired pregnancy.”

Implementation of Comprehensive Sexual
Reproductive Health Services: Evidence
Normative Guidance
Few countries have safer conception clinical guidelines.
Canada, South Africa, and the UK have guidelines; how-
ever, many providers in these locations remain unprepared
to counsel clients [35—37, 39, 41, 68, 69]. The WHO rec-
ommends ART for all PLWH and PrEP for HIV-exposed
persons. Current global EMTCT guidance does not
explicitly address safer conception programming.
Systems
Most safer conception services exist within specialized
academic medical centers, private clinics, research pro-
jects, or privately funded implementation programs
[42, 70-73]. Data show that where services are offered,
uptake is high and outcomes are encouraging. These pro-
grams provide opportunity to inform future implementation
efforts.
Reproductive Rights of People Living with HIV
A reproductive rights framework recognizes that all cou-
ples and individuals, including those living with or affected
by HIV, have the basic right to “decide freely and
responsibly the number, spacing, and timing of their chil-
dren and to have access to the information, education, and
means to do so” [74]. These rights also include the right to
make reproductive decisions “free of discrimination,
coercion, and violence”. The endorsement of the sexual
and reproductive rights of PLWH is essential within safer
conception guidelines, policies, and programs as a step
towards building trust between providers and HIV-affected
clients, given a history of sexual and reproductive rights
violations of PLWH [75].
Legal and ethical issues present challenges to safer
conception care delivery. Expectations that clients seeking
pregnancy disclose HIV status to pregnancy partners must
be considered in the context of clients’ lives and safety.
Supporting safe disclosure is a component of safer con-
ception programming, but not a prerequisite for participa-
tion. For many PLWH, particularly women, disclosure is
highly challenging and in some cases dangerous—with
risks of violence, relationship dissolution, and abandon-
ment [76]. Disclosure challenges are exacerbated in set-
tings where laws criminalize HIV _ non-disclosure,
exposure, and/or transmission to sexual partners [77].
Institutionalized stigma and HIV criminalization are likely
to influence willingness of HIV-affected individuals to
G) Springer
engage and remain in HIV care [78] and safer conception
care.
Providers
Providers rarely counsel clients about safer conception
options [33, 35-39, 41, 68, 79-81]. In addition, many
providers retain negative attitudes towards PLWH having
children, in part due to experiences caring for children
living with HIV, historical recommendations against
pregnancy for PLWH, and lingering stigma and discrimi-
nation [36, 37, 39, 41, 81, 82]. After decades of focusing on
condoms for HIV prevention, providers hesitate to endorse
condomless sex [41, 81]. Provider time is limited and in
demand. In addition, clients who want safer conception
advice often hesitate to ask for it, in part due to the
emphasis on condom use and perceptions of provider
stigma towards pregnancy among PLWH [34, 40, 41, 82].
HIV-affected men and women may also seek care from
traditional healers and other providers who may not have
safer conception information [83, 84]. See Table 1 for
summary points regarding Implementation of Compre-
hensive Safer Conception Services.
Key Questions Within the Areas of Demand,
Opportunities for Prevention, and Implementation
We identified key questions within the areas of demand,
opportunities for prevention, and implementation. Answers
to these questions will improve care and implementation
and inform policy, but need not delay service
implementation.
Demand
How to reach at-risk, uninfected men and women who may
benefit from safer conception services as well as PLWH
not engaged in care or aware of their own or their partner’s
serostatus is a gap. Normalizing pregnancy desires and
pregnancy among people living with and affected by HIV
is an outstanding goal to decrease stigma.
Prevention
The science of HIV prevention offers clear data regarding
reduced risk of sexual transmission of HIV, but few
methods have been studied in the context of couples or
individuals seeking personal or partner pregnancy.
Research to understand method use in the context of
desired pregnancy is needed. While HIV-RNA suppression
would ideally be confirmed prior to conception attempts,
this is less feasible in resource-limited settings. 6 months is
sufficient for the majority of clients to suppress HIV-RNA

AIDS Behav (2018) 22:1713-1724
1719
while taking effective ART. Strategies to test for sup-
pression sooner for those eager to move forward with
pregnancy attempts, or for those who feel more comfort-
able proceeding with proof of HIV-RNA suppression, are
needed.
Tenofovir-based PrEP is a relatively new prevention
technology and, accordingly, there are ongoing questions.
A major challenge is how to best support adherence to
PrEP [85]. In addition, there remain outstanding questions
regarding the safety of TDF/FTC as prophylactic medica-
tion during pregnancy and breastfeeding [86]. Current
WHO guidelines recommend PrEP as a safer conception
strategy with discussion of the risks and benefits of use
during pregnancy [50]—but some regional guidelines
caution against use in pregnancy [87, 88]. Data to answer
these questions are being collected [42, 72, 89]: how to
Table 3 Resources
counsel clients and providers to make informed decisions
based on available and evolving data is needed [90].
Implementation
In early implementation studies, many clients seeking safer
conception services have a medical history suggestive of
infertility [91, 92]. How to support HIV-affected couples
who have compromised fertility is a significant gap. Fer-
tility evaluation after 6 months of timed unprotected sex
has been recommended for HIV-negative women older
than 35 years [93]. A similar approach has been advocated
to minimize the duration of HIV exposure for HIV-affected
couples, but there is not consensus about whether a fertility
evaluation should be conducted prior to the couple’s
attempts at achieving pregnancy, or at six or 12 months

after attempted conception. A lack of available resources
for fertility assessment and management should not pre-
clude safer conception care [94] (Table 3).
Safer conception options are required for those who are
not ready for ART, who do not know partner HIV status, or
whose partner is not engaged in care, on ART, or adherent.
The consensus group agrees that combinations of methods
are likely best, but which combinations and how many
methods depends on the level of HIV risk, preferences of
the individuals, and available services. The importance of
balancing a public health approach (which may find PrEP
cost-ineffective on top of ART for an infected partner) with
personal risk assessment (for example, an individual may
not feel confident that his or her partner is adherent to
ART) is important to supporting clients while also
attending to cost-effectiveness.
Questions regarding implementation are abundant.
While ideally a diverse array of providers in HIV-endemic
settings should provide these services, the reality is that
services will first be offered by a smaller cadre of inter-
ested, motivated, or externally-funded providers. How to
expand beyond providers with a particular interest in these
services remains unclear. Community health workers may
play an important role. How to integrate safer conception
methods into existing paradigms (e.g. HIV care, sexual and
reproductive health care) to leverage resources and maxi-
mize efficiencies is unknown. Provider tools that support
provision of safer conception counseling and address
stigma towards PLWH having children are also needed
[82]. We also identified a need for systems to support
providers offering care in settings where condomless sex
without HIV disclosure among PLWH is criminalized
(77, 78].
On the client level of implementation, how best to
support safer conception programming for HIV-concor-
dant-positive couples, men, same-sex couples, single par-
ents by choice, extended and co-parenting families are
outstanding questions. Ensuring that pregnancy planning
and reproductive agency and autonomy are promoted
within safer conception services and that providers support
clients who want to have children but are not yet able to
safely disclose to their partner, are outstanding gaps. How
to create consumer-friendly services and tools is an area for
future research.
Conclusions/Recommendations
It is time to implement safer conception services. This
consensus is supported by science, consumer demand, and
global goals to eliminate perinatal HIV transmission. We
recommend that providers offer available safer conception
services to HIV-affected men and women, and health

program administrators integrate safer conception services
into existing HIV and reproductive health programs. While
the range of service choices may vary across settings, in all
settings a minimal set of safer conception services is
available. The most fundamental tenets of safer conception
counseling are know your HIV-serostatus, know your
partner’s HIV-serostatus, and wait until the partner living
with HIV is on effective ART before attempting preg-
nancy. These basic tenets should be widely shared with
HIV-affected persons, families, communities, and provi-
ders. We maintain that this work no longer needs to be the
purview of specialists. Answers to outstanding questions
will refine care, implementation, and policy but do not need
to be resolved prior to offering services.
HIV-related stigma is a key barrier to uptake and
delivery of safer conception care. People living with and
affected by HIV who consider pregnancy or become
pregnant and have children express internalized stigma
and describe experiences of stigma from providers and
community. Stigma compromises the willingness of cli-
ents to seek care and provider willingness to address
reproductive goals with clients. It is imperative to
acknowledge and support the sexual and reproductive
rights of persons living with and affected by HIV and
focus efforts on reducing stigma at individual-, provider-,
and community-levels, such that HIV-affected men and
women can make informed decisions and build healthy
families.
We must develop tools that support HIV-affected per-
sons to identify potential risk, engage with safer conception
services, and use methods that align with preferences and
level of risk. The goal is to engage all populations who
could benefit from services including mutually-disclosed
HIV-serodiscordant heterosexual couples, men and women
living with or exposed to HIV, same sex couples, and
seroconcordant-positive couples. Safer conception care
must be flexible and address a diversity of clients.
We support development and implementation of strate-
gies that can be adopted in diverse settings to support HIV-
affected persons to achieve reproductive goals including
increased access to ART and PrEP, HIV-RNA testing, STI
testing, sperm washing and assisted reproductive tech-
nologies, and fertility care. Programs must be nimble in
incorporating discussions about reproductive goals at many
points in a client’s care without creating undue burden on
providers or systems. Integrating safer conception mes-
saging into public health targets for HIV prevention and
treatment can maximize synergies.
Provider-initiated conversation is an important gateway
to practicing safer conception. Providers across diverse
disciplines and training-levels should be able to discuss
reproductive options with HIV-affected couples and indi-
viduals. Tools to support providers to offer services are

AIDS Behav (2018) 22:1713-1724
1721
required, as are strategies and financing to support service
integration [95].
Documenting the effect of safer conception is para-
mount for guidelines and for the confidence of providers
and consumers. EMTCT and treatment as prevention ini-
tiatives dovetail with safer conception efforts. Data high-
lighting the advantages of these synergies may catalyze
changes in policy and programs. Ensuring that the voices,
values, preferences, and experiences of PLWH are at the
forefront of safer conception messaging can normalize
care-seeking and pregnancy in the context of HIV.
It is time to seize the opportunity to empower people
affected by HIV to embrace their fertility goals and utilize
safer conception strategies to satisfy goals for pregnancy
with minimal HIV transmission risks. This group consensus
is strongly supported by science, consumer demand, and
global goals to reduce HIV incidence and eliminate peri-
natal transmission. We invite you to endorse this statement
