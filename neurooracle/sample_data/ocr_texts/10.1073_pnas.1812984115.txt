Mycobacterium abscessus is a peculiar rapid-growing Mycobacte-
rium (RGM) capable of surviving within eukaryotic cells thanks to
an arsenal of virulence genes also found in slow-growing myco-
bacteria (SGM), such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A screen
based on the intracellular survival in amoebae and macrophages
(MΦ) of an M. abscessus transposon mutant library revealed the
important role of MAB_0855, a yet uncharacterized Mycobacterial
membrane protein Large (MmpL). Large-scale comparisons with
SGM and RGM genomes uncovered MmpL12 proteins as putative
orthologs of MAB_0855 and a locus-scale synteny between the
MAB_0855 and Mycobacterium chelonae mmpL8 loci. A KO mutant
of the MAB_0855 gene, designated herein as mmpL8MAB, had im-
paired adhesion to MΦ and displayed a decreased intracellular
viability. Despite retaining the ability to block phagosomal acidifi-
cation, like the WT strain, the mmpL8MAB mutant was delayed in
damaging the phagosomal membrane and in making contact with
the cytosol. Virulence attenuation of the mutant was confirmed in
vivo by impaired zebrafish killing and a diminished propensity to
induce granuloma formation. The previously shown role of MmpL
in lipid transport prompted us to investigate the potential lipid
substrates of MmpL8MAB. Systematic lipid analysis revealed that
MmpL8MAB was required for the proper expression of a glycolipid
entity, a glycosyl diacylated nonadecyl diol (GDND) alcohol com-
prising different combinations of oleic and stearic acids. This study
shows the importance of MmpL8MAB in modifying interactions be-
tween the bacteria and phagocytic cells and in the production of a
previously unknown glycolipid family.

O
ne major feature of pathogenic mycobacteria is their ability
to survive in phagocytic cells (1, 2), a property that is shared
with the rapidly growing Mycobacterium abscessus (3, 4). The unique
and lipid-rich mycobacterial cell envelope is largely responsible
for the interactions with host immune cells, enabling the bacilli
to resist the harsh conditions and bactericidal processes encoun-
tered within the macrophage (MΦ), such as phagosome matura-
tion, nitrosative and oxidative stress, and nutrient deprivation (1, 2,
5–7). A large set of proteins participates in the biogenesis and
transport of a wide diversity of cell wall-associated (glycol-)lipids
(8–10). Impaired synthesis and/or transport of some of these lipids
render pathogenic mycobacteria more susceptible to the host im-
mune defenses (11–14). Mycobacterium tuberculosis mutants that
fail to synthesize or transport the cell wall-associated phthiocerol
dimycocerosates (PDIMs) show limited growth in the lungs of in-
fected mice (11). The structurally related phenolic glycolipids
(PGLs), which are unique to a few pathogenic species, are also re-
quired for optimal virulence in zebrafish of Mycobacterium marinum,
a close pathogenic relative to M. tuberculosis (12, 15). Immune
evasion by M. tuberculosis and M. marinum also seems to be
mediated by PDIM, very likely through masking the underlying
pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and by PGL through
the involvement of a chemokine receptor 2-mediated pathway
with preferential recruitment and infection of permissive MΦ
while evading microbicidal ones (13).
In nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) such as Mycobacterium
avium, a slow-growing Mycobacterium (SGM), or M. abscessus, a
rapid-growing Mycobacterium (RGM), glycopeptidolipids (GPLs)
play an important role in NTM physiology and behavior toward
eukaryotic hosts (4, 16). A transition from a smooth (S) to a
rough (R) morphotype in NTM is associated with GPL loss (17–19)
that results in an exacerbated virulence phenotype in various cellular
and animal models (20–23). Isolation of the R variant is often
Significance
One major defense mechanism of mycobacteria relies mainly
on the synthesis and transport of specialized lipids, processes
that reside in the cell wall. Among the transporters, Myco-
bacterial membrane protein Large (MmpL) plays an essential
role. We describe the role of MmpL8 (MmpL8MAB) in the sur-
vival of Mycobacterium abscessus within eukaryotic hosts. We
show that its absence slows the contact between M. abscessus
and the host cell cytosol, an essential element in its resistance
to the cell bactericidal mechanisms. The absence of MmpL8MAB
leads to reduced production of a previously unknown glyco-
lipid: a glycosyl diacylated nonadecyl diol (GDND). The glyco-
lipid seems unique to the Mycobacterium chelonae complex,
supporting the view that GDND might represent a typical sig-
nature of M. abscessus infection.

associated with chronic and more severe disease in patients with
reduced pulmonary functions (4, 24–26). This is exemplified in
the case of M. abscessus, where the transition to an R morpho-
type is sufficient to confer a highly virulent phenotype in zebrafish
or mice (27, 28).
However, we recently showed, by looking at the differential
intracellular behavior of both S and R M. abscessus variants, that
GPLs confer a clear intracellular survival advantage to the S variant
compared with the R variant, including resistance to several cellular
antibacterial mechanisms, such as blockage of phagosomal acidi-
fication, and resistance to apoptosis and autophagy (4, 7).
Complementary to our study, GPLs were shown to inhibit apoptosis
in M. abscessus-infected MΦ by interacting with the mitochondrial
cyclophilin D (29).
These results further highlight how mycobacterial lipids fine tune
MΦ–M. abscessus interactions to modulate the host immune response.
However, GPLs are common to all NTM, SGM, and RGM, and
M. abscessus belongs to the RGM group that comprises mainly
saprophytic species. However, unique lipids possibly involved in
the peculiar pathogenicity of M. abscessus remain to be identified.
To act as critical players in mycobacterial pathogenesis, these
complex lipids, usually synthesized within the cytoplasm, need to
be translocated through the cell envelope and exposed to the
bacterial surface, a process that can require a wide repertoire of
lipid-specific transporters. Gap, a transmembrane protein partici-
pating in the transport of GPL through the plasma membrane, was
originally identified in Mycobacterium smegmatis (18). The last
decade has seen a mounting focus on the Mycobacterial membrane
protein Large (MmpL) permeases, which are a subclass of the
Resistance-Nodulation-cell-Division proteins containing 12 trans-
membrane domains (TMDs) and are known to translocate lipids
through the plasma membrane (30–32). Complex lipids thought to
be transported by MmpL proteins include PDIM (MmpL7),
sulfoglycolipid (MmpL8), diacyltrehaloses (DATs) and poly-
acyltrehaloses (MmpL10), monomeromycolyl diacylglycerol (MmpL11),
and trehalose monomycolate (MmpL3), all of which have been
implicated in M. tuberculosis virulence (31, 32). Additionally, the
essential MmpL3 transporter represents a promising pharmaco-
logical target in M. tuberculosis and M. abscessus (33–35). In
M. abscessus, we and others unraveled the specific role of MmpL4a
and MmpL4b in GPL transport by analyzing the S to R transition
in the three subspecies of the M. abscessus complex (17, 22, 36).
These MmpLs represent the only MmpL actors described so far
in M. abscessus virulence, despite the greater abundance of
MmpLs in the M. abscessus complex (4). Another group of
lipids, the trehalose-based polyphleates, present in many NTM
(37) has recently been proposed to contribute to the highly aggre-
gative phenotype of M. abscessus R (38), but a direct role in M.
abscessus virulence remains to be shown.
In continuation of our previous efforts to decipher the
mechanisms of pathogenicity of M. abscessus, we recently per-
formed a phenotypic screen of a transposon (Tn) mutant library
generated in M. abscessus subspecies (subsp.) massiliense in
amoebae and MΦ. This led to the discovery of the role of the
ESX-4 type VII secretion system (T7SS) in intracellular sur-
vival of M. abscessus (39). This genetic screen also disclosed the
MAB_0855 gene, encoding a yet uncharacterized MmpL. Herein;
we aimed at characterizing this MmpL, designated MmpL8MAB, as
well as its putative lipid substrate. We show the crucial role of
MmpL8MAB in intracellular survival and virulence of M. abscessus in
various cellular and animal models. We also present a structural
description of a glycolipid family produced at reduced levels in the
absence of MmpL8MAB, thereby opening the way to promising fu-
ture translational applications.
Results
Identification of an mmpL Gene Crucial for Intracellular Survival of M.
abscessus. A Tn mutant library constructed in the M. abscessus
subsp. massiliense 43S clinical isolate was originally screened for
survival in Acanthamoeba castellanii amoebae and in J774.2
murine MΦ (39); 7 of 47 mutants that exhibited a Growth Index
(GI) below 0.5 in MΦ compared with the WT strain carried a single
Tn insertion in genes involved in cell wall/membrane/envelope as-
sembly and/or lipid transport and metabolism as determinated by
cluster of orthologous groups (COG) analysis (COG M and I, re-
spectively) (Fig. 1 and Table 1). Interestingly, one mutant (55F6)
was highly attenuated in both amoeba and MΦ (GIs of 0.13 and
0.31, respectively) and was linked to only a general function (COG
R) (Fig. 1). By sequencing the Tn insertion site, we identified the
Tn-disrupted gene as MYCMA_0439 (SI Appendix, Table S1), iden-
tical to the M. abscessus subsp. abscessus ATCC19977 MAB_0855 gene,
which according to systematic annotation, encodes a putative
MmpL protein. The 55F6 mutant’s intracellular defect was further
confirmed by survival kinetics performed in amoebae and MΦ by
determining the cfu and the corresponding GIs (0.18 in amoebae
and 0.22 in MΦ) (SI Appendix, Fig. S1).
MAB_0855 Is Unique to the Mycobacterium chelonae Complex. Pri-
mary sequence analysis and 3D homology modeling indicate that
MAB_0855 presents the typical features of MmpL transporters,
possessing 12 helical TMDs as well as two extracytoplasmic loops
between TMD1/2 and TMD7/8, which are potentially implicated
in substrate binding (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
Phylogenetic relationships among 31 MmpLs of M. abscessus
and 13 MmpLs of M. tuberculosis allowed the identification of
two M. abscessus MmpL-specific clades (light blue and red spots
in Fig. 2A), supporting the hypothesis of MmpL diversification in
M. abscessus (31). Tandem duplications occurred as illustrated
by the mmpL4 genes (mmpL4a and mmpL4b) (blue brackets in
Fig. 2A). MAB_0855 clustered with M. tuberculosis MmpL8 and
MmpL12 and to a lesser extent, with M. tuberculosis MmpL10 and
M. abscessus MAB_0937c (dark blue spot in Fig. 2A). MAB_0937c
is orthologous to MmpL10 in both RGM and SGM (Fig. 2B).
Neither phylogenetic reconstruction nor Bidirectional Best Hit (BBH)
search found putative orthologs of MAB_0855 in M. tuberculosis
(Fig. 2 A and B). However, an extensive mycobacterial BBH search
identified MmpL12 proteins in Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium
gastri, M. smegmatis, and Mycobacterium mucogenicum as putative
orthologs to MAB_0855 (Fig. 2B). It is worth noting that, in these
mycobacterial species, MmpL12 was suggested to transport
lipooligosaccharides (LOSs) (40), which are absent in M. abscessus.
MAB_0855 Best Hit (BH) scores were low (under 60) except in the
M. chelonae complex (MCC; i.e., comprising the M. abscessus sub-
species and M. chelonae) and in Mycobacterium immunogenum, for
which the BH score was up to 96 (Fig. 2B). Finally, we failed to
identify any syntenic conservation in other mycobacteria of the re-
gion spanning from MAB_0852 to MAB_0859, with the exception of
the M. chelonae mmpL8 locus (Fig. 2C); therefore, MAB_0855 was
designated mmpL8MAB. Quite notably, several genes from M. tuber-
culosis were syntenic to the M. abscessus genome upstream of MAB_
0852 and downstream of MAB_0859, suggesting that a deletion may
have occurred between these genes in M. tuberculosis, perhaps as a
consequence of the genomic reduction that occurred in the tubercle
bacillus (Fig. 2C).
Overall, the mmpL8MAB genomic environment revealed a
potential role in lipid biogenesis/transport, with a putative lipase/
esterase encoding gene (lipP) as well as two fad genes (fadA and
fadB) located upstream of mmpL8MAB (Fig. 2C). A polyketide
synthase (pks)-associated gene (papA2) as well as a putative poly-
ketide cyclase gene (MAB_0859), possibly participating in the bio-
genesis and assembly of a complex cell wall lipid (41), were also
found in close proximity to mmpL8MAB.
MmpL8MAB Plays a Critical Role in M. abscessus Intracellular Survival
and Virulence. To confirm the contribution of MmpL8MAB to M.
abscessus virulence, deletion mutants were generated in both the

S and R variants of the M. abscessus ATCC19977-type strain by
allelic exchange of the mmpL8MAB ORF using the recombineering
strategy (42, 43) that replaces genes targeted for deletion with a
zeocin resistance cassette (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). The proper deletion
of mmpL8MAB was subsequently confirmed through a combi-
nation of PCR and sequencing analyses (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
The corresponding mutant strains generated in the S or R back-
ground, hereafter referred to as SΔmmpL8MAB or RΔmmpL8MAB,
were complemented by transformation with an integrative plasmid
containing an intact copy of mmpL8MAB.
SΔmmpL8MAB exhibited a pronounced defect in intracellular
survival in murine MΦ compared with the WT or SΔmmpL8MAB-
complemented strains, and this alteration was already significant
at 1 day postinfection (dpi) (Fig. 3A). Functional complementation
of the mutant with the mmpL8MAB gene (ΔmmpL8::mmpL8MAB)
fully restored the WT phenotype, whereas complementation
with the Mycobacterium massiliense homolog MYCMA_0439
(ΔmmpL8::0439MMAS) only partially restored the effect (Fig. 3A).
These results indicate that the decreased viability of ΔmmpL8MAB
was not caused by a polar effect on the expression of the down-
stream genes. To get more insight into the biological functions of
mmpL8, we addressed whether the three “closest” homologs found
in M. tuberculosis (i.e., mmpL8, mmpL10, and mmpL12) (Fig. 2A)
may restore the intracellular defect of ΔmmpL8MAB. As shown in
Fig. 3B, a near-complete restoration of intracellular growth was
obtained with the mmpL8MTB and mmpL12MTB genes but not with
mmpL10MTB. The intracellular growth defect of RΔmmpL8MAB was
also fully restored on complementation with mmpL8MAB (Fig. 3C).
Overall, these results show that MmpL8MAB is required for the
intracellular survival of both M. abscessus variants.
ΔmmpL8MAB Presents a Reduced Adhesion to MΦ and Is Impaired in
Phagosome-Membrane Rupture. The intracellular behavior of M.
abscessus resembles the intracellular lifestyle of a slow-growing
pathogenic species (4). In particular, scrutinizing the S and R
forms in MΦ highlighted the importance of the outer cell wall
layer in defining important physiological and ultrastructural
features of the phagosomal compartment/membrane. Disruption
of the phagosomal membrane enables the escape of the S variant
to establish cytosolic communications, thereby contributing to sur-
vival inside the host cells (4). In line with these earlier findings, we
investigated the possible mechanism(s) by which MmpL8 may
interact with MΦ.
The question of whether MmpL8 affects the adhesion of the
bacilli to the MΦ surface was determined by measuring the ad-
hesion capacity of SΔmmpL8MAB to MΦ using flow cytometry.
Cells with adherent bacteria formed a population that was well
separated from the nonadherent bacteria together with cellular
debris (Fig. 4A). A reproducible and significant twofold decrease
in ΔmmpL8MAB cell adhesion was observed compared with WT
and complemented strains (Fig. 4A).
We next addressed whether a functional MmpL8MAB partici-
pates in the inhibition of phagosomal acidification, known as a crucial
event for intra-MΦ survival of pathogenic mycobacteria (44). As
shown in Fig. 4B, WT M. abscessus, but not the heat-killed strain,
inhibited the intraphagosomal pH as reported previously (4).
ΔmmpL8MAB blocked phagosomal acidification in a manner similar
to the WT and ΔmmpL8MAB-complemented strains (Fig. 4B). This
indicates that it is very unlikely that the reduced intracellular survival
of ΔmmpL8MAB is connected to a defect in phagosomal acidification
and the subsequent maturation of the phagolysosome compartments.
To address the potential role of MmpL8MAB in phagosomal
membrane damage that leads to cytosolic communications, we
carried out an FRET-based assay recently adapted for M. abscessus
that allowed us to assay phagosomal membrane disruption (4). At
20 h postinfection (hpi), ΔmmpL8MAB was significantly reduced in
its ability to damage the phagosomal membrane, and this persisted
for longer time points (30 hpi) compared with the WT and
ΔmmpL8MAB-complemented strains (Fig. 4C). To further con-
firm the inability of ΔmmpL8MAB to establish contacts with the
cytosol, we evaluated the production of IL-1β (Fig. 4D), documented
as a biomarker of cytosolic M. tuberculosis (45–49). Consistently

Identification of a putative MmpL required
for intracellular replication in both amoebae and MΦ
from a Tn library screen. Tn mutants impaired in their
intracellular survival compared with the WT strain GI
in amoebae and MΦ. Amoebae (A. castellanii) and
murine MΦ were infected at an MOI of 10 and lysed
at different dpi (2 and 3 dpi, respectively) before cfu
determination. The Tn insertion site was cloned to
identify the disrupted genes. Identified genes were
categorized with the COG classification. Mutants for
which the Tn insertion occurred in a gene implicated
in either lipid metabolism/transport or related pro-
cesses (COG M and I, respectively) and 55F6 unchar-
acterized (COG R) mutant putatively implicated in lipid
transport and metabolism are depicted.

with the FRET data, ΔmmpL8MAB was less potent at inducing
IL-1β production by infected MΦ compared with WT and
ΔmmpL8MAB-complemented strains. This effect, already seen at
3 hpi, persisted for at least 30 hpi and was dependent on the
caspase-1 pathway, as shown in SI Appendix, Fig. S4A, and based
on the presence of the mature form of IL-1β (SI Appendix, Fig.
S4B), it was not an artifact.
Taken collectively, these results indicate that the inactivation
of MmpL8MAB reduces its interaction with MΦ as well as its
ability to enter the cells; it also impairs the establishment of
cytosolic connections. Whether these cellular phenotypes are
translated into attenuation was next investigated using the re-
cently developed zebrafish model of infection (28).
MmpL8MAB Is Essential for Full Virulence of M. abscessus in Zebrafish.
Since M. abscessus R induces a more robust and lethal infection
in zebrafish compared with the S form (28, 50, 51), embryos were
infected with WT, RΔmmpL8MAB, and complemented strains
before the determination of the survival curves. While the R WT
strain led to rapid larval death (∼80% killing at 13 dpi) as reported
previously (28), ΔmmpL8MAB, which has retained its propensity to
produce cords (SI Appendix, Fig. S5), was attenuated in its virulence
(∼30% killing at 13 dpi) (Fig. 5A). Reintroduction of a functional
copy of the gene into ΔmmpL8MAB partially restored the virulent
phenotype to the level of the WT strain, thus linking MmpL8MAB to
M. abscessus virulence in zebrafish.
In addition to cording, a phenotypical trait conferring viru-
lence to the R variant in zebrafish (51) is granuloma formation,
which also represents a physiopathological sign of M. abscessus
infection in embryos, although it has been reported to occur in both
S and R variants (22, 28). We thus compared granuloma formation
after infection with WT R and S variants and ΔmmpL8MAB R and S
mutants. A striking reduction in the number of embryos with
granulomas (Fig. 5B, Left) as well as in the number of granulomas
per embryo (Fig. 5B, Right) was observed in ΔmmpL8MAB-infected
embryos. Partial restoration of the WT phenotype (embryos with
granulomas and number of granulomas per embryo) was observed
with the ΔmmpL8MAB-complemented strain (Fig. 5B). These di-
minished pathological signs were unrelated to the morphotype of
the mutant. Granuloma production is usually associated with
chronic rather than with acute infection. Therefore, this pheno-
typic characteristic is probably not incriminated in the increased
survival of the embryos infected with the mutant. However, since
granuloma formation is a consequence of cellular aggregation of-
ten linked to the surface properties of the mycobacterial cell wall
and/or the release of granulomatogenic compounds, notably lipids
(52), these results raise the question whether specific modifications
on the outer layer of M. abscessus are connected to a specific lipid
exported by MmpL8MAB.
MmpL8MAB Is Required for Production of a Glycolipid. A systematic
TLC-based approach for the whole range of apolar and polar
lipids was implemented; 1D TLC enabled the separation of abun-
dant glycolipids, such as GPL and trehalose dimycolate, and allowed
the identification of a chaplet of lipids with amounts that seemed to
be severely decreased in mutant 55F6 compared with its M. massi-
liense 43S parental strain (brackets) (Fig. 6A, lanes 1 and 2). The
same chaplet of lipids, with expression level that was affected in
55F6, was also decreased in SΔmmpL8MAB mutants compared with
their WT progenitors (Fig. 6A, lanes 3 and 4), and partial restora-
tion of the phenotype was observed for the complemented S strain
(Fig. 6A, lane 5). In particular, the abundance of one lipid assumed
to be exported by MmpL8MAB, migrating close to the GPL, was
markedly different between mutant and WT strains, which was
especially apparent in the R background devoid of GPL (Fig. 6B,
lanes 3 and 4). Restoration of the phenotype was also observed
for the complemented strain (Fig. 6B, lane 5). Restoration of
lipid production was further confirmed when M. tuberculosis mmpL8
and -12, but not M. marinum mmpL7, were used to complement
ΔmmpL8MAB (SI Appendix, Fig. S6).
The MmpL8MAB Putative Substrate Is a Glucose-Containing Lipid. To
get insights into the structure of the MmpL8MAB substrate, the
lipid was first purified from the polar lipid fraction of M. abscessus
as a homogenous lipid fraction, Pa3 (Fig. 6C and SI Appendix, Fig.
S7). Monosaccharide and lipid composition analyses of the product
showed the presence of glucose (SI Appendix, Fig. S8), hex-
adecanoic (C16), and octanoic acid (C18), which established the
presence of a glucose-based glycolipid substituted by C18 and C16.
MALDI-MS analysis of the Pa3 lipid fraction showed a complex
pattern of signals with 28-amu increments dominated by signals at
m/z 959, 987, and 1015 (Fig. 6D) tentatively attributed to [M + H]+
ions of Glc1(C16)2, Glc1(C16)1(C18)1, and Hex1(C18)2, respectively,
all substituted by a yet unknown lipid moiety. MS2 fragmentation of
parent ions at m/z 987 showed that one Glc residue, one C18,
and one C16 could be independently cleaved from the parent ion.
C16 and C18 could be further independently cleaved from the [M-
Hex + H]+ fragment ion as established by MS3 fragmentation of
the fragment ion at m/z 825. This shows that C16 and C18 do not

esterify the Glc residue. Finally, MS4 fragmentation of the MS3
fragment ion [M-Hex-C18 + H]+ at m/z 541 generated a fragment
ion at m/z 285 (Fig. 6D) that could be equally assigned to [M + H]+
ions of octanoic acid CH3(CH2)16COOH or of nonadecyl alcohol
CH3(CH2)18OH. NMR analysis of the carbohydrate moiety showed
the presence of a heterogeneous H1/C1 signal at δ1H/13C 50.6–
5.2/94.2 that correlates on 1H-1H total correlated spectroscopy
(TOCSY) and 1H/13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence
(HSQC)-TOCSY spectra with an H2/C2 to H6/C6 monosaccharide
spin system assigned as α-Glcp in a terminal nonreducing position
(Fig. 6E), which establishes that the major Glc residue is not ester-
ified on any carbon. Accordingly, the absence of a β-anomeric signal
further suggests that the C1 position of α-Glcp is involved in an O
linkage. However, the low available quantity of compound pre-
cluded the 1H-1H nuclear overhauser effect (NOe) transfer from
the anomeric proton or 3JH,C connections by an 1H-13C hetero-
nuclear multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) experiment, and thus,
a final proof of the αGlcp-O-CH2-R linkage could not be provided.
As aforementioned, structural analysis by NMR data and MSn
fragmentation patterns suggest that the lipid is composed of an alkyl
α-glucopyranoside substituted by a C19 alkane chain diesterified by
two fatty acid chains. The fragmentation pattern of the parent ion at
m/z 987 established that it is substituted by one palmitic and one
stearic acid (Fig. 6D), whereas the parent ion at m/z 959 is substituted
by two palmitic acid chains (SI Appendix, Fig. S9). The exact position
of esterification sites on the alkyl chain could not be directly estab-
lished by NMR due to low quantities. Finally, the observation of
three 1H/13C signals with deshielded protons at δ 5.38/72.3, 5.18/69.4,
and 5.061/68.51 (Fig. 6E) strongly suggests the presence of other
forms of the lipid in which the Glc ring carbons are differentially
acetylated. This would retrospectively explain the chemical shift
heterogeneity of the anomeric signal of the αGlcp residue.
In summary, structural analyses established that the major
lipid with production that is severely affected by MmpL8MAB
deficiency consists of a heterogeneous family of Glc-containing
lipids in which Glc is linked to a diacylated lipid. All of the data are
consistent with the presence of a Glc alkylated with a C19 diol
esterified by different combinations of palmitic and stearic acids
(Fig. 6D), but they do not exclude the presence of additional related
compounds with further acylation sites on the glucose residue.
Discussion
NTM have recently emerged as important opportunistic patho-
gens responsible for severe lung diseases. Several studies have
reported the predominance of M. abscessus among RGM in
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (53), underinhaled corticosteroid therapy, and bronchi-
ectasis (21, 54–58). The deleterious impact of M. abscessus in the
degradation of lung function in CF patients has also been well
documented (26). To dissect important and specific mechanisms
of pathogenesis and to identify virulence determinants, we re-
cently screened a Tn mutant library in A. castellanii and un-
covered genes essential for M. abscessus intracellular survival
(39). This approach unraveled the crucial and unexpected role of
the ESX-4 locus for intracellular survival and phagosomal escape
(39). In continuation of these efforts, we present here the dis-
covery and preliminary characterization of MYCMA_0439 as an
additional factor required for the intracellular survival of M.
abscessus in both amoebae and MΦ. By focusing on its M.
abscessus subsp. abscessus counterpart (MAB_0855, mmpL8MAB),
we confirmed the contribution of MmpL8MAB in M. abscessus
virulence by first generating an mmpL8MAB deletion mutant
(ΔmmpL8MAB) and subsequently showing for this mutant attenu-
ation in intracellular survival, delayed cytosolic escape, and a

cooled down to avoid bacterial internalization and
then infected with CFDA-SE–stained bacteria at an
MOI of 100 for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation to
favor bacteria-to-cell contact. Nonadherent bacteria
were well separated from intact cells (Left), and a
substantial shift was observed for the cell population
with adherent bacteria (Right; infected cells). The

along the infection is extrapolated from a pH stan-
dard curve. HK corresponds to heat killed bacteria. (C)

reduced capacity to provoke zebrafish killing. Direct implication
of MAB_0855 (mmpL8MAB) in these impaired virulence phe-
notypes was confirmed by functionally complementing the
mutant phenotypes.
MmpL contribution to mycobacterial virulence was first repor-
ted in M. tuberculosis by the screening of a Tn mutant library for in
vivo survival deficiency (59). Genetic disruptions in M. tuberculosis
mmpL4, -5, -7, -8, -10, and -11 were correlated with attenuation in
mice (14). M. tuberculosis MmpL4 and MmpL5 were found to
transport siderophores that were crucial to cope with iron star-
vation in a mouse model of infection (60). M. tuberculosis MmpL7,
-8, -10, and -11 were shown to play a direct role in mycobacterial in
vivo survival by shaping the cell wall (61–63).
We show here the reduced production of a previously unde-
scribed glycolipid family, termed glycosyl diacylated nonadecyl
diol (GDND), in the absence of MmpL8MAB. The cell wall
composition and architecture modifications in the ΔmmpL8MAB
mutant, either due to the reduced GDND production and/or
altered levels of other lipid species, may explain changes in the
interactions between bacteria and MΦ, resulting in decreased
intracellular survival and virulence. These cell wall alterations in
the ΔmmpL8MAB mutant might also underlie the lower number of
granulomas formed in zebrafish independent of an SΔmmpL8MAB
or an RΔmmpL8MAB infection as already observed with other
deletion mutants in M. abscessus (33, 51).
A peculiar characteristic of M. abscessus is its very large
number of MmpL proteins, the highest among 108 mycobacterial
strains (31). This observation is particularly striking compared
with the SGM MmpL number, with twice the number of MmpLs
in the M. abscessus clade compared with M. tuberculosis complex
strains (31). Our phylogenetic studies corroborate these obser-
vations by individualizing two M. abscessus MmpL-specific clades
(blue and red spots in Fig. 2A) and by highlighting tandem du-
plications (blue brackets in Fig. 2A).
Several MmpL members from M. abscessus clustered with
M. tuberculosis MmpL proteins as exemplified for MmpL8MAB
that clustered with M. tuberculosis MmpL8, -10, and -12, although
the phylogenetic distance was the highest with MmpL10TB.
M. tuberculosis MmpL10 is involved in the biosynthesis and
transport of DATs (64). Its closest homologs in M. smegmatis and
in M. abscessus (MAB_0937c) were also reported to transport
DATs but did not impact the intracellular persistence of M.
abscessus (37). We confirm here that M. tuberculosis mmpL10 fails
to complement the intracellular phenotype of ΔmmpL8MAB. Only
transcomplementation of ΔmmpL8MAB with M. tuberculosis
mmpL8 and -12 restored the WT intracellular phenotype, and this
correlated with restoration of GDND production. This comple-
mentation is intriguing with regard to the lipid substrate transported.
MmpL12 of M. smegmatis is involved in the biosynthesis and/or
transport of LOS (40), which is no longer functional in M. tuberculosis
due to genomic reduction (65). Analysis of the syntenic conservation of
the M. abscessus mmpL8 locus indicated that it is not conserved
in M. smegmatis but dispersed across its genome (Fig. 2C). In
M. smegmatis, LOSs are presumably transported by MmpL12 (40).
However, most of the LOS locus from M. smegmatis (MSMEG_4731–
MSMEG_4740) is not conserved in M. abscessus that does not
produce LOS. MmpL8 of M. tuberculosis is involved in the bio-
synthesis and/or transport of sulfolipid SL-1 (62), a lipid that is also
not present in M. abscessus. The restoration of lipid export was not
fully in agreement with the intracellular phenotypic behavior for all
complemented strains. Considering that the MΦ or amoeba assays
are stringent phenotypic assays, this difference reveals subtle sub-
strate differences that might correlate more to the described ge-
netic distances. This point might be solved by purifying each lipid
substrate as done for GDND to unravel these differences. In ad-
dition, MmpL8MAB and functional equivalent, M. tuberculosis
MmpL8 and -12, might fulfill another role in addition to trans-
port; they might be involved in the maturation of the exported
lipid, a function already reported for M. tuberculosis MmpL8 (62).
Of additional interest and to highlight scarcity of homologs of
MAB_0855, we could not find syntenic conservation of the
mmpL8MAB region in any other Mycobacterium, with the exception
of M. chelonae, hence providing a unique signature characteristic
of the MCC complex. When considering the genes surrounding the
locus, synteny was observed only in M. tuberculosis, suggesting that
the mmpL8MAB locus was lost in M. tuberculosis as part of the
genomic reduction that occurred in the tubercle bacillus.
In the M. tuberculosis genome, clusters harboring pks genes
have been implicated in lipid biosynthesis and assembly (41). Most
of these clusters also contain an MmpL-encoding gene that par-
ticipates in the biosynthesis/export of lipids. In M. abscessus, the
abundance of MmpL is not associated with a concomitant increase
in pks genes, suggesting additional roles for MmpL, such as in de-
toxification or drug efflux mechanisms as reported for M. tubercu-
losis MmpL5 (66) rather than contributing to cell wall elaboration.
From a structural perspective, GDND differs from PDIM by
the presence of standard fatty acids (a C19 diol core replacing
the phthiocerol and C16/C18 replacing the polymethylated
mycocerosic acids) and by the presence of a Glc residue linked to
the C19 diol. PDIM represents one of the most important cell
wall-associated lipids involved in M. tuberculosis virulence (67).
Transported by MmpL7MTB, it contributes to M. tuberculosis
escape from the phagosome independent of the pore-forming
activity of the ESX-1–secreted substrate EsxA (68). Likewise,
PDIM acts in concert with the ESX-1 T7SS (69) to promote
phagosomal escape. Notably, our original screen identified the
ESX-4 locus as a major contributor to M. abscessus virulence in
amoebae and MΦ. A deletion mutant of eccB4, which encodes a

core structural element of ESX-4, acidified phagosomes and showed
reduced signs of phagosome-to-cytosol contacts (39). By analogy
with the PDIM/ESX-1 machinery found in M. tuberculosis, one may
hypothesize that a similar mechanism involving the GDND/ESX-
4 system might be used by M. abscessus to escape the phagosomal
compartment. However, future studies will be required to test this
attractive hypothesis.
In conclusion, our study highlights the major role played by
MmpL8MAB in controlling M. abscessus virulence and production
of a family of glycolipids that seems unique to the MCC. As such,
this could be considered as the basis of diagnostic markers for
pulmonary infections caused by M. abscessus.
Materials and Methods
Strains, Cells, and Culture Conditions. Mycobacterial strains were grown aer-
obically at 37 °C in Middlebrook 7H9 and on 7H11 (Sigma-Aldrich) medium
supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and 1% glucose. When necessary, kanamycin,
hygromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and zeocin (Thermo Fisher Scientific)
were added in the growth medium at 250, 1,000, and 100 μg/mL respectively.
Murine J774.2 (Sigma-Aldrich) MΦ were grown at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in
DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS (FBS; Thermo Fisher
Scientific), penicillin (100 IU/mL), and streptomycin (100 IU/mL; Thermo
Fisher Scientific).
The human promonocytic cell line, THP-1, was maintained in RPMI
1640 glutamax (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 10% heat-inactivated FBS at
37 °C under 5% CO2. For differentiation into monocytes, 106 THP-1 cells were
seeded into 12-well plates and activated with 20 ng/mL of Phorbol Myristate
Acetate (Sigma-Aldrich) for 72 h.
A. castellanii (ATCC30010) was grown in PYG Broth (70) for amplification.
Tn Mutant Selection and Identification of the Tn Insertion. Selection of Tn
mutants defective for growth in amoebae and MΦ and identification of the Tn
insertion site were performed as described previously (39). The Tn insertion
site was identified by nucleotide BLAST comparison against the Tn se-
quence and the M. massiliense GO 06 genome hosted by the National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). To confirm the BLAST results,
the disrupted region was amplified by PCR using purified genomic DNA obtained
from the mutant and a primer that hybridizes within the disrupted gene down-
stream of the Tn insertion site (SI Appendix, Table S1).

MAB_0855 Gene (mmpL8MAB) and Locus Description. A motif analysis was
performed with InterProScan (71) to confirm that MAB_0855 belongs to the
mmpL family, and all proteins encoded by genes from MAB_0845 to MAB_0864
were also submitted to InterProScan (71) to check their annotation and to
further predict the functions of their corresponding proteins when no func-
tional annotation was provided. M. abscessus and M. tuberculosis mmpL phy-
logeny was inferred by Maximum Likelihood using the PHYML software and the
approximate likelihood-ratio test (aLRT) statistic. MAB_0855 and MAB_0937c
phylogenetic comparison with other mycobacteria was performed by searching
putative orthologs with the Opscan program with the “-H” and “-O” options,
enabling the identification of a BBH (wwwabi.snv.jussieu.fr/public/opscan/). A
list of BHs was obtained by replacing the « -H » option with the « -S » option.
BHs displayed a score higher than 40. Conservation of the locus spanning
from MAB_0845 to MAB_0864 was assessed by a BBH search in the species
closest to M. abscessus: M. chelonae and M. immunogenum. Comparisons
with saprophytic (M. smegmatis), opportunistic (M. avium), and strictly path-
ogenic (M. tuberculosis) species were also performed. The loci were drawn
with the genoPlotR package (72).
Construction of the mmpL8MAB KO and Relative Complemented Mutants in the M.
abscessus Subsp. abscessus Type Strain. A KO was performed in the M. abscessus
subsp. abscessus S and R ATCC19977 strains using the recombineering approach
(36, 39, 42, 73, 74). Complementation was performed by electrotransforming
the mutant strains with the integrative vectors pMVH361::mmpL8MAB and
pMVH361::MYCMA_0439. Complementation studies with the closest homolo-
gous M. tuberculosis genes to M. abscessus mmpL8 [Rv1183 (MmpL10MTB),
Rv1522c (MmpL12MTB), and Rv3823c (MmpL8MTB)] were performed in a similar
fashion. Complementation study with the M. marinum mmpL7MAR (MMAR_1764)
gene was also performed in a similar fashion but using the plasmid pMV306.
Lipid Analyses. For exploratory systematic lipid analysis, bacteria were cul-
tured in 100 mL LB medium without shaking for 2 wk to obtain mature
pellicles. These bacteria were collected by centrifugation, autoclaved, and
washed twice with PBS before they were lyophilized. Apolar and polar lipid
fractions were extracted from exactly 50 mg of freeze-dried material (R
ATCC19977 WT strain) and subsequently analyzed by thin-layer liquid
chromatography as previously described (75). For lipid purifications, expo-
nentially growing bacteria (S and R ATCC19977 WT, ΔmmpL8, and com-
plemented strains) were plated on 7H10OADC agar plates (100 μL per plate)
and incubated for 1 wk at 37 °C until a dense lawn of bacterial growth was
obtained. Subsequently, bacteria were collected using an inoculation loop,
suspended in PBS, autoclaved for 10 min at 121 °C, washed thrice with PBS,
flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and freeze dried. Apolar and polar lipid
fractions were then obtained, and polar lipids were fractionated by two
rounds of liquid flash chromatography on a silica gel column (80 g, 50 mm)
using a chloroform:MeOH gradient (100:0–40:60). The lipid of interest was fi-
nally purified by preparative TLC in chloroform:methanol [9:1 (vol/vol)].
Monosaccharide composition was established by GC-flame ionization
detector (FID) and GC-MS analyses of trimethylsilylated methylglycosides
according to Kamerling et al. (76) using mesoinositol and scylloinositol as
internal standards. Fatty acids were released by methyl esterification with
0.5 M HCl in anhydrous methanol at 80 °C for 20 h, extracted with hep-
tane, and identified by GC-MS as fatty acid methyl esters. Intact glycolipids
were sequenced by MSn using an Axima Resonance MALDI quadrupole ion
trap TOF instrument (Shimadzu). The sample was dissolved in chloroform:
methanol [9:1 (vol/vol)] and mixed with 1 vol of a solution of 10 mg 2,5-
dihydroxybenzoic acid in 1 mL chloroform:methanol [2:1 (vol/vol)] before
spotting on an MALDI plate. The instrument was operated in positive ion
and reflectron mode. Fragment ions were analyzed by collision-induced
dissociation of the precursor ions, and argon was used as a collision gas.
Before NMR spectroscopic analyses, the sample was repeatedly exchanged
in CDCl3:CD3OD [2:1 (vol/vol); 99.97% purity; Eurisotop-Saclay] with in-
termediate drying and then dissolved in CDCl3:CD3OD [2:1 (vol/vol)].
Solution-state NMR experiments were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker
Avance 900 spectrometer equipped with a 3-mm triple-resonance cryo-
probe using Bruker standard pulse programs.
Infection, Adhesion, and Phagosomal Escape Assays. MΦ infection experi-
ments with the WT, ΔmmpL8, and complemented strains were performed as
described (4, 42).
Adhesion experiments to murine MΦ were performed by flow cytometry
based on the method described by Hytönen et al. (77). Before infection, log-
phase bacteria were stained with CFDA-SE 50 μM (Molecular Probes; Thermo
Fisher Scientific) for 20 min at 37 °C with end-over-end rotation, washed twice
with cold PBS, and kept on ice protected from light. In the meantime, MΦ
were washed twice with DMEM, scraped, and resuspended in DMEM. The cells
were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with gentle agitation before the infection;
50,000 cells were infected with the bacterial strains at a high multiplicity of
infection (MOI) of 100 to favor bacteria-to-cell contacts and then incubated at
4 °C for 45 min with gentle agitation. The cell–bacteria incubations were
carried out in three parallel tubes, and the experiments were repeated twice
with new batches of MΦ and labeled bacteria. The fluorescence intensity of
the cells with adherent bacteria was measured with BD Fortessa equipment
(Becton Dickinson Biosciences). The data obtained from the flow cytometer
were analyzed using BD FACSDIVA software and the FlowJo software.
Phagosome acidification and phagosomal escape FRET assays were con-
ducted in THP-1 cells as previously described (78).
Cytokine Assays. IL-1β secretion was measured as previously described (79).
The FAM-FLICA caspase-1 Assay Kit (ImmunoChemistry Technologies) was
used to evaluate the presence of catalytically active forms of caspase-
1 p10 and p12. THP-1 cells were infected at an MOI of 10 for 3 h. As a
positive control of apoptosis induction, cells were incubated with 500 nM LPS
for 8 h at 37 °C. The adherent cells were gently dissociated with TrypLE
Express reagent (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific) as recommended. Cells
were washed twice and resuspended in RPMI medium with 10% FBS before
staining with 30×XFam-Vad-Fmk for 30 min at 37 °C. To gate specifically on
differentiated intact cells, the cells were also stained with the CD11b anti-
body (78) before treatment with 5% paraformaldehyde (PFA). Fixed cells
were then analyzed by flow cytometry. The results are expressed as the
percentage of cells harboring the caspase-1 p10 and p12 active forms.
Zebrafish Infections. All zebrafish protocols adhered to the guidelines spec-
ified by the Direction Sanitaire et Vétérinaire de l’Hérault et Comité
d’Ethique pour l’Expérimentation Animale de la région Languedoc Roussil-
lon under the reference CEEA-LR-1145. All efforts were made to minimize
pain and discomfort according to European animal welfare regulations and
standard protocols. Infection experiments were done using tdTomato-
expressing M. abscessus strains and performed as described previously (28).
Mortality was determined by recording the number of dead embryos daily.
To evaluate granuloma formation, embryos at 5 dpi were embedded in 1%
low melting point agarose and transferred to a Zeiss microscope with a Zeiss
Plan NeoFluar Z 1×/0.25 objective for monitoring.
Culture for Cording. In total, 4 million cfu of mycobacteria were cultured in
1 mL of 7H9 supplemented with 1% glucose in a 24-well plate at 37 °C
without agitation until visualization of a bacterial film on the surface of the
medium. The plates were sealed with parafilm to avoid evaporation. The
formation of cords was checked by observation with an optical microscope
(SI Appendix, Fig. S5).
