Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with persistence of symptoms
throughout adult life in most of the affected patients. This unfavorable course is
associated with multiple episodes and residual symptoms, mainly negative symptoms
and cognitive deﬁcits. The neural diathesis-stress model proposes that psychosocial
stress acts on a pre-existing vulnerability and thus triggers the symptoms of
schizophrenia. Childhood trauma is a severe form of stress that renders individuals
more vulnerable to developing schizophrenia; neurobiological effects of such trauma on
the endocrine system and epigenetic mechanisms are discussed. Childhood trauma
is associated with impaired working memory, executive function, verbal learning,
and attention in schizophrenia patients, including those at ultra-high risk to develop
psychosis. In these patients, higher levels of childhood trauma were correlated with
higher levels of attenuated positive symptoms, general symptoms, and depressive
symptoms; lower levels of global functioning; and poorer cognitive performance in
visual episodic memory end executive functions. In this review, we discuss effects of
speciﬁc gene variants that interact with childhood trauma in patients with schizophrenia
and describe new ﬁndings on the brain structural and functional level. Additive effects
between childhood trauma and brain-derived neurotrophic factor methionine carriers on
volume loss of the hippocampal subregions cornu ammonis (CA)4/dentate gyrus and
CA2/3 have been reported in schizophrenia patients. A functional magnetic resonance
imaging study showed that childhood trauma exposure resulted in aberrant function
of parietal areas involved in working memory and of visual cortical areas involved in
attention. In a theory of mind task reﬂecting social cognition, childhood trauma was
associated with activation of the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and dorsomedial
prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, decreased connectivity was
shown between the posterior cingulate/precuneus region and the amygdala in patients

with high levels of physical neglect and sexual abuse during childhood, suggesting that
disturbances in speciﬁc brain networks underlie cognitive abilities. Finally, we discuss
some of the questionnaires that are commonly used to assess childhood trauma and
outline possibilities to use recent biostatistical methods, such as machine learning, to
analyze the resulting datasets.

INTRODUCTION
Schizophrenia is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder that aﬀects
about 1% of the population (Jablensky, 1995). It is particularly
prevalent in young adults between 20 and 30 years of age and
leads to disability in about half of the patients (Murray and
Lopez, 1996). The disorder is among the leading cause of years
lived with disability worldwide (Whiteford et al., 2013), and,
among all mental illnesses, schizophrenia is associated with the
highest socioeconomic costs (Gustavsson et al., 2011). This high
disorder burden is due to the early onset of schizophrenia in
late adolescence and early adulthood and the persistence of
symptoms throughout adult life in over 90% of aﬀected patients
despite meeting remission criteria (Häfner and an der Heiden,
2007; Schennach et al., 2015). Symptom improvement has been
measured as “therapeutic response,” which was deﬁned by, e.g.,
a 20% symptom reduction after 4 weeks of treatment (Kane
et al., 1984). Subsequently, the term “remission” was introduced,
requiring a simultaneous reduction of all diagnosis-speciﬁc core
symptoms (positive and negative symptoms) to a level of “mild
or less” on established questionnaires (Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Scale for the
Assessment of Positive Symptoms, Scale for the Assessment of
Negative Symptoms) for a minimum of 6 months (Andreasen
et al., 2005). However, since only a small portion of schizophrenia
patients can achieve this, the new deﬁnition of “recovery” was
conceived, which takes into account not only a reduction of
clinical symptoms, but also an improvement in occupational,
social and adaptive functioning (Chan et al., 2018). However,
only 20% of people with schizophrenia are able to work in
the primary labor market, and only about 30% are able to
maintain a stable relationship (Häfner and an der Heiden, 2007).
The unfavorable disorder course is associated with multiple
episodes and residual symptoms, mainly negative symptoms and
cognitive deﬁcits (McGrath et al., 2008). Cognitive deﬁcits as
a core feature of the disorder are present in domains such
as episodic memory, executive function, social cognition, and
attention (Green, 1996; Hoﬀet al., 2005). These deﬁcits may lead
to memory decline, social withdrawal, and ultimately impaired
social and role functioning as measured by the Global Assessment
of Functioning (GAF) scale (Green et al., 2015a). Several studies
have operationalized the term “recovery” by using the GAF scale
to investigate the long-term outcome and its relevant inﬂuencing
factors in psychosis patients (Scott et al., 2013; Amminger et al.,
2015; Koutsouleris et al., 2016; Jagannath et al., 2018; Lho
et al., 2019). While childhood trauma has been repeatedly shown
to negatively impact “recovery” among schizophrenia patients
(Alameda et al., 2015, 2017; Trauelsen et al., 2016), some of
these ﬁndings were only partially replicated (Trotta et al., 2016;
Ajnakina et al., 2018), hereby leading to a rather heterogeneous
body of evidence and consequently emphasizing the need for
further research into the neurobiological underpinnings of
this association.
RISK FACTORS FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA
AND THE NEURODEVELOPMENTAL
HYPOTHESIS
Twin studies found a heritability of about 60–80% for
schizophrenia (Sullivan et al., 2003), and new genome-wide
association studies (GWASs) revealed a total of 145 genetic
risk loci, the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), each
with only a weak eﬀect (Pardinas et al., 2018). GWAS-based
schizophrenia polygenic risk scores showed associations with
social and cognitive impairments during early childhood, which
were interpreted as being possible early manifestations of genetic
liability (Riglin et al., 2017). In schizophrenia, however, about
8,300 SNPs have been estimated to contribute to a common risk
of only 32% (Ripke et al., 2013), suggesting that—in addition to
the genetic background—environmental factors may be the basis
of pathophysiological processes (Manolio et al., 2009).
Schizophrenia has been regarded as a neurodevelopmental
disorder
in
which
defective
genes
and
environmental
factors interact and induce symptoms of the disorder. The
neurodevelopmental hypothesis proposes that schizophrenia
is related to adverse conditions, such as genetic background
and environmental factors, which lead to abnormal brain
development. Disorder onset and ﬁrst symptoms occur in early
adulthood, after synaptic pruning (Weinberger, 1996; Fatemi
and Folsom, 2009). In the two-hit model, a neurodevelopmental
disturbance during the perinatal period may lead to dysfunction
of neuronal circuits and vulnerability to stress during vulnerable
brain periods, and later psychosocial stress or drug abuse, for
example, may then trigger the disorder (Schmitt et al., 2014).
Today, researchers propose that several hits in the form of
genetic and environmental risk factors may interact in a complex
way during key periods of neurodevelopment and cumulate
in the expression of the disorder state (Figure 1); these risk
factors are hypothesized to be common across neuropsychiatric
disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major
depression (Davis et al., 2016). The neural diathesis-stress
model proposes that psychosocial stress acts upon a pre-existing
vulnerability and triggers the symptoms of schizophrenia
(Walker and Diforio, 1997). Speciﬁc stress factors have been

Childhood Trauma in Schizophrenia
FIGURE 1 | The ﬁgure contains a general outline of the three main pathophysiological pathways between childhood trauma and schizophrenic symptoms. These
pathways are meant to illustrate the pathological cascade ranging from molecular and (epi-) genetic abnormalities to neuroanatomical changes and eventually to the

identiﬁed that trigger or worsen symptoms of the disorder,
such as perceived uncontrollable threats to important goals
and socio-evaluative threats (Jones and Fernyhough, 2007). In
addition, schizophrenia patients are more emotionally reactive
than non-psychiatric controls to stressors such as higher arousal
and anxiety (Docherty et al., 2009).
NEUROBIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF
STRESS
Stress sensitization may play a role in schizophrenia by lowering
the vulnerability threshold for the disorder. The neurobiological
consequence of stress sensitization involves dysregulation of the
hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is the major
stress neuroendocrine system of the body and is involved in
the production of the stress hormone cortisol by the adrenal
glands (Holtzman et al., 2013; Schmitt et al., 2014). A stress-
induced activation of the HPA axis contributes to dopamine
sensitization in mesolimbic areas and increases stress-induced
striatal dopamine release (van Winkel et al., 2008). These eﬀects
are important because increased dopamine neurotransmission
with overstimulation of the D2 receptors in several brain regions
has been hypothesized in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia,
a hypothesis that is supported by the antipsychotic eﬀects of
dopamine receptor antagonists (Falkai et al., 2011).
In animal models, acute or chronic stress decreased brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the hippocampus,
which is involved in synaptogenesis (Neto et al., 2011). In
accordance with these ﬁndings, stress was found to reduce
hippocampal dendrites (Magarinos et al., 2011). Additionally,
application of glucocorticoids reduced hippocampal BDNF
levels, mimicking the stress reaction (Neto et al., 2011).
Animal models have shown that chronic stress or repeated
administration of glucocorticoids results in degeneration of
hippocampal neurons, with decreased soma size and atrophy
of dendrites (Sapolsky et al., 1990; Watanabe et al., 1992). This
stress-induced glucocorticoid neurotoxicity (Arango et al., 2001;
Frodl and O’Keane, 2013) may contribute to a volume loss in
vulnerable brain regions such as the hippocampus; hippocampal
volume reduction has been reported for schizophrenia even
in early disorder stages (Adriano et al., 2012). Moreover,
elevated glucocorticoids can suppress myelination and may aﬀect
calcium channels (Damsted et al., 2011). Both mechanisms are
related to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and result in
impaired macro- and microconnectivity (Berger and Bartsch,
2014; Cassoli et al., 2015).
In rodents, juvenile social isolation and maternal separation
are models of childhood stress, and these animal models
have shown lasting eﬀects on the HPA axis along with
deﬁcits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory
(Bremne and Vermetten, 2001). The mouse model of juvenile
social isolation builds on social isolation immediately after
weaning:

and decreased myelin basic protein and myelin-associated
glycoprotein expression have been detected in brain regions
(Varty et al., 2006; Makinodan et al., 2012) and resemble the
deﬁcit of myelination and oligodendrocytes in schizophrenia
(Cassoli et al., 2015). Importantly, in contrast with the
eﬀects of adult social isolation this early-induced phenotype
cannot be rescued by later social re-integration (Makinodan
et al., 2012), implicating impaired recovery, such as in
schizophrenia (Table 1).
STRESS RESPONSE IN PATIENTS WITH
SCHIZOPHRENIA AND INDIVIDUALS AT
ULTRA-HIGH RISK OF DEVELOPING
PSYCHOSIS
An increased release of glucocorticoids has been proposed to play
a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Corcoran et al.,
2003), and the stress-diathesis model proposes that schizophrenia
is associated with elevated baseline and challenge-induced HPA
activity (Walker et al., 2008). In addition, cortisol treatment
can induce psychotic symptoms (Walker et al., 2008). This
model is supported by reports of increased levels of blood
cortisol (Ryan et al., 2004) and a blunted cortisol response to
stress (Mondelli et al., 2010); the latter was suggested to reﬂect
impaired responsiveness of a desensitized system. Indeed, a
meta-analysis on stress-moderating eﬀects of baseline cortisol
levels revealed that schizophrenia patients have lower cortisol
levels than controls during anticipation of social stress and
after exposure to it (Ciufolini et al., 2014). A reduced ability
of these patients to appropriately contextualize past experiences
has been hypothesized to underlie the missing cortisol response
in these experiments (Ciufolini et al., 2014). A blunted cortisol

stress reactivity in schizophrenia patients was again reported
in a more recent meta-analysis by Zorn et al. (2017), who also
pointed toward a possible publication bias as well as an overall
small number of studies with properly standardized cortisol
protocols as limiting factors for the interpretation of these
ﬁndings. Moreover, treatment with antipsychotics may have
inﬂuenced the results (Walker et al., 2008). However, the HPA
axis response was also impaired in medication-naïve patients
with ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia, i.e., the cortisol response
was ﬂattened, indicating impairments in stress processing
(van Venrooij et al., 2012).
According to the neurodevelopmental hypothesis, prodromal
and psychotic symptoms occur for the ﬁrst time in adolescence.
In adolescents at ultra-high risk of psychosis (UHR), increased
resting cortisol levels have been reported and associated
with higher rates of critical statements from relatives and
negative self-concept (Carol and Mittal, 2015), indicating that
a dysfunction of the HPA axis is related to environmental
characteristics. The cortisol level after awakening, which reﬂects
HPA regulation, was also increased in this patient group
compared with healthy controls (Nordholm et al., 2018).
Additionally, in UHR adolescents a reduced stress responsivity
of the HPA axis was correlated with smaller gray matter
volumes of the hippocampus and prefrontal, temporal, and
parietal cortices, which may represent the neural components
in the stress vulnerability model (Valli et al., 2016) (Figure 1).
Interestingly, those individuals who subsequently developed
psychosis showed a signiﬁcant blunting of the HPA stress
response (Valli et al., 2016).
EFFECTS OF CHILDHOOD
MALTREATMENT ON EPIGENETIC
PROCESSES
In addition to eﬀects on the hormone system, environmental
factors, such as childhood trauma, may contribute to genome–
environment interactions; these interactions are mediated
by
epigenetic
processes,
such
as
DNA
methylation
and
histone modiﬁcations (Fischer, 2014). Hypomethylation of
DNA repetitive sequences has been detected in ﬁrst-episode
schizophrenia patients with a history of childhood trauma
(Misiak et al., 2015). Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC)
have been suggested to improve cognitive function and
ameliorate disorder pathogenesis in neuropsychiatric disorders
such as schizophrenia (Nestler et al., 2016). In schizophrenia
patients, we found that the experience of childhood trauma
was related to increased HDAC1 levels in blood samples
(Bahari-Javan et al., 2017). This corresponds with recent ﬁndings
that HDAC1 levels are increased in the prefrontal cortex and
hippocampus of patients with schizophrenia (Benes et al.,
2007; Sharma et al., 2008; Bahari-Javan et al., 2017) (Figure 1).
Interestingly, in mice with early life stress as a model of childhood
trauma HDAC1 expression is increased in the prefrontal cortex
and hippocampus, and these mice display schizophrenia-like
behavioral phenotypes, such as deﬁcits in PPI, working memory,
and synaptic plasticity (Bahari-Javan et al., 2017) (Table 1).

Childhood Trauma in Schizophrenia
The eﬀects of childhood trauma on epigenetic mechanisms
and the relationship with cognition and disorder symptoms
should be investigated in more detail in larger studies in
schizophrenia patients.
CHILDHOOD TRAUMA IN
SCHIZOPHRENIA: EVIDENCE FROM
HUMAN STUDIES
Childhood trauma can be assumed to be a severe form of
stress that renders individuals more vulnerable to developing
schizophrenia. In a meta-analysis of 18 case-control studies
(including
2048
patients
with
psychosis
and
1856
non-
psychiatric controls), 10 prospective studies (including 41,803
participants), and 8 population-based cross-sectional studies
(35,546 participants), Varese et al. (2012) found that adverse
experiences in childhood signiﬁcantly increased the risk to
develop psychosis and schizophrenia. The group showed a
signiﬁcant association between childhood adversity, including
trauma, and psychosis: the odds ratio was between 2.72 and
2.99, indicating a strong association between childhood adversity
and psychosis, including schizophrenia. Epidemiological studies
show that exposure to early stress in the form of abuse and neglect
in childhood increases the risk to later develop schizophrenia
(Bonoldi et al., 2013). In schizophrenia patients, the most
frequent subtype of trauma was emotional neglect, but rates
of physical abuse and physical neglect were also signiﬁcantly
increased (Larsson et al., 2013). Childhood abuse and neglect
are known to have a negative inﬂuence on cognition in patients
with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Shannon et al., 2011).
In ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia patients, exposure to childhood
neglect was a predictor for impairment in social cognition
and poorer verbal learning, whereas abuse was not (Kilian
et al., 2017). A study in Chinese patients with schizophrenia
reported that physical neglect was negatively correlated with
delayed memory and attention and with the total cognition
score (Li et al., 2017). A large study assessed 406 patients with
schizophrenia spectrum disorders with the Childhood Trauma
Questionnaire and found that physical abuse, sexual abuse,
and physical neglect were signiﬁcantly associated with reduced
scores in working memory, executive function, and verbal tasks
(Aas et al., 2012b). In another study, metacognitive capacity was
lower in patients with childhood emotional abuse (Aydin et al.,
2016). Female patients who reported childhood physical abuse
had more psychotic and depressive symptoms than both women
without this history and men with or without a trauma history
(Kelly et al., 2016).
UHR individuals more frequently had a history of childhood
trauma, such as emotional and sexual abuse as well as emotional
and physical neglect, while emotional neglect in particular was
associated with paranoid symptoms (Appiah-Kusi et al., 2017).
Even in UHR individuals, a history of childhood maltreatment
predicted poorer functioning at follow-up in both those who had
transitioned to psychosis and those who had not (Yung et al.,
2015). Childhood trauma did not predict transition to psychosis,
but after a 2-year follow-up UHR individuals with higher levels
of childhood trauma had higher levels of attenuated positive
symptoms, general symptoms, and depressive symptoms and
lower levels of global functioning (Kraan et al., 2015). In children
born to parents with major psychoses, those who were exposed
to abuse or neglect had lower IQ and GAF scores and displayed
poorer cognitive performance in visual episodic memory end
executive functions (Berthelot et al., 2015).
INTERACTION OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA
WITH GENETIC FACTORS
Gene–environment interactions have been suggested to play
a role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Figure 1).
In 429 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaﬀective disorder,
the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype moderated
the eﬀects of childhood trauma on cognition and symptoms
in methionine (met) carriers with a history of childhood
physical abuse and more severe positive symptoms; Met
carriers with a history of emotional neglect had more severe
negative symptoms (Green et al., 2014). In another study,
a variant of the FK506 binding protein 5 (FKBP5) gene
interacted with childhood trauma and aﬀected attention in
both schizophrenia patients and healthy controls (Green et al.,
2015b). In patients with schizophrenia and aﬀective disorders,
an interaction between a variant in the serotonin transporter
gene 5-HTTLPR and childhood trauma was observed in the
California Verbal Learning Test (Aas et al., 2012a). A variant
of BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was shown to moderate
the impact of childhood adversity on later expression of
aﬀective symptoms in schizophrenia patients (Sahu et al.,
2016). In 249 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder,
carriers of the met allele of the BDNF gene exposed to high
levels of childhood physical and emotional abuse demonstrated
poorer cognitive functioning than monozygotic valine carriers.
Moreover, Met carriers exposed to childhood sexual abuse
showed reduced right hippocampus volume (Aas et al., 2013),
suggesting negative eﬀects on neuroplasticity in the brain. On
an epigenetic level, a recent review concluded that childhood
trauma was associated with global DNA hypomethylation
and reduced BDNF gene-expression in ﬁrst-episode psychosis
subjects (Tomassi and Tosato, 2017). However, the literature
on gene–environment relationship in the etiology of psychosis
is rather heterogeneous as the results from candidate gene
studies could quite frequently not be replicated (Zwicker et al.,
2018). Thus, epidemiological studies investigating the interplay
between familial and environmental factors in the development
of psychosis within large cohorts are another valuable resource
for further insight. Using these epidemiological approaches, it
was found that environmental risk factors, such as childhood
adversity, and a family history of aﬀective and psychotic disorders
additively impact the psychosis risk across a multidimensional
spectrum of positive, negative, cognitive and aﬀective symptoms
(Binbay et al., 2012; Pries et al., 2018; Radhakrishnan et al., 2018).
Moreover, studies repeatedly showed that childhood adversity
and familial liability increased the risk predominantly for positive
symptoms of psychosis, such as delusions and hallucinations, as
Frontiers in Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org

Popovic et al.
Childhood Trauma in Schizophrenia
well as aﬀective symptoms (Jeppesen et al., 2015; Smeets et al.,
2015; Veling et al., 2016). Therefore, the connection between
childhood trauma, familial liability and the onset of psychosis is
increasingly being labeled as one of the key mechanisms of the
proposed “aﬀective pathway” to psychosis (Isvoranu et al., 2017).
BRAIN STRUCTURAL AND FUNCTIONAL
CORRELATES OF CHILDHOOD TRAUMA
Emotional neglect in patients with schizophrenia was negatively
associated with total gray matter volume and speciﬁcally with
the density and volume of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex,
which in turn predicted disorganization (Cancel et al., 2015).
Interestingly, additive eﬀects of childhood trauma and being
a BDNF met carrier on volume loss in the hippocampal
subregions cornu ammonis (CA)4/dentate gyrus and CA2/3 have
been reported in schizophrenia (Aas et al., 2014). Childhood
maltreatment has been associated with reduced hippocampal
volume as well as amygdala hyperreactivity and was shown to
predict poor treatment outcome (Teicher and Samson, 2013).
A functional magnetic resonance imaging study showed that
childhood trauma exposure resulted in aberrant function of
parietal areas involved in working memory and of visual cortical
areas involved in attention. On the basis of these data, the authors
hypothesized that childhood trauma in psychosis contributes to
alterations in attention during performance of working memory
tasks (Quide et al., 2017a). During a theory-of-mind task that
reﬂected social cognition, childhood trauma was associated
with activation of the posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and
dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in patients with schizophrenia
(Quide et al., 2017b). In addition, decreased connectivity between
the posterior cingulate/precuneus region and the amygdala was
shown in patients with high levels of physical neglect and
sexual abuse during childhood (Cancel et al., 2017) (Figure 1).
Finally, an fMRI study showed an increased brain response
to emotionally negative faces compared with the response to
positive faces in patients with psychosis and high childhood
trauma, as assessed by the Childhood Trauma questionnaire (Aas
et al., 2017). Overall, ﬁndings from MRI, genetic, and large-
scale gene expression and epigenetic studies often were not
reproducible and need to be replicated in larger samples before
ﬁnal conclusions can be drawn.
LACK OF SPECIFICITY OF FINDINGS
FOR SCHIZOPHRENIA
It must be noted that eﬀects of childhood trauma are not
speciﬁc for schizophrenia. In childhood-maltreatment related
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a recent meta-analysis
clearly showed bilateral reduction of hippocampal and amygdala
volumes in the PTSD group compared to healthy controls
(Ahmed-Leitao et al., 2016). In addition, cognitive deﬁcits
in diﬀerent domains such as general intelligence, language,
information processing, learning and memory and executive
skills have been observed in trauma-exposed children with PTSD
compared to controls. Trauma-exposed children with PTSD
had poorer general intelligence and visuospatial skills compared
with trauma-exposed children who did not develop PTSD
(Malarbi et al., 2017). Dysfunction of the HPA axis in PTSD has
been reported, particularly hypersensitivity of the glucocorticoid
receptor (GR). Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the
GR and FKBP5 gene were associated with PTSD risk and
the FKBP5 gene SNP interacted with childhood adversity to
moderate PTSD risk (Binder et al., 2008; Castro-Vale et al., 2016).
Other neurochemical markers for PTSD include neurotrophic
factors such as BDNF (Bandelow et al., 2017). Regarding
epigenetic factors, DNA methylation is so far the best studied in
PTSD and could be responsible for long-lasting eﬀects of gene–
environmental interactions (Rampp et al., 2014). Furthermore,
eﬀects of parental trauma could be transmitted to the next
generation by epigenetic marks (Ramo-Fernandez et al., 2015).
A meta-analysis showed that childhood psychological abuse
and neglect were strongly associated with depression (Infurna
et al., 2016). Other factors of childhood maltreatment related to
adult depression were emotional abuse, sexual abuse, domestic
violence and physical abuse (Mandelli et al., 2015). Regarding
genetic factors, the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor
1 (CRHR1) gene may moderate the eﬀects of childhood
trauma on depression (Heim et al., 2009; Ressler et al., 2010).
BDNF gene methylation level was correlated with depression
(Chen et al., 2017).
TOOLS TO ASSESS CHILDHOOD
TRAUMA
In the ﬁeld of childhood trauma research, it is not uncommon to
investigate early stress by clinically assessing whether some form
of maltreatment took place in the individual’s childhood without
applying standardized trauma or maltreatment questionnaires
(Choi and Sikkema, 2016; Green et al., 2017). However, in
the context of clinical studies and to further both the validity
and the reliability of the observed eﬀects in childhood trauma
studies, standardized instruments should be used. Below, we
present a representative selection of the most commonly used
questionnaires because it would be beyond the scope of this
article to include all the available ones.
Overall,
questionnaires
on
childhood
trauma
can
be
categorized into instruments to diagnose PTSD and more
specialized assessment tools, whose goal is to assess childhood
maltreatment in depth rather than to validate a DSM or ICD
diagnosis. A vast number of PTSD-speciﬁc questionnaires
are available, but we will give an overview of three structured
interviews and one self-report measure. The Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) and the Composite International
Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) are structured interviews that cover
the entire spectrum of mental disorders and can be applied by
both trained professionals and trained lay interviewers. Both
interviews have a speciﬁc section on PTSD, are frequently used in
epidemiological studies and can be used to validate a suspected
diagnosis of PTSD (Kessler et al., 2007; Stein et al., 2014; Guina
et al., 2016). Another instrument that has also been extensively

Popovic et al.
Childhood Trauma in Schizophrenia
reviewed and is regarded by some as the gold standard in
diagnosing PTSD is the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale
(CAPS). The CAPS is a 30-item structured interview that should
ideally be administered by clinicians and clinical researchers with
a working knowledge of PTSD (Weathers et al., 2001, 2018). In
addition to these structured interviews, the PTSD Checklist for
DSM-5 (PCL-5), a 20-item self-report measure that assesses the
20 DSM-5 symptoms of PTSD, can be used to solidify a PTSD
diagnosis (Franklin et al., 2018).
Besides these PTSD-speciﬁc diagnostic instruments, a large
group of questionnaires focuses on distinct types of childhood
maltreatment that do not automatically have to fulﬁll the PTSD
criteria. Childhood maltreatment is usually assessed along the
domains of abuse (physical, sexual, emotional/psychological) and
neglect (emotional/psychological, physical) (Hovdestad et al.,
2015). The most commonly used childhood maltreatment self-
reports and semi-structured interviews are described here.
The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ, Bernstein et al.,
1997) is one of the most frequently used self-reports in
the current literature (Viola et al., 2016). It has a total of
28 items and measures the above mentioned ﬁve types of
maltreatment, i.e., emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, and
emotional and physical neglect. It also includes a three-item
minimization/denial scale to assess the potential underreporting
of maltreatment. Another common self-report tool is the
Personal Safety Questionnaire (PSQ), which is based on the
Conﬂicts Tactics Scales (Straus and Douglas, 2004). The PSQ
queries the occurrence of speciﬁc incidents and mainly focuses
on physical or sexual abuse; it can be used to sequentially assess
incidents that occur in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood.
This feature allows researchers to examine both the type (physical
or sexual) and timing of abuse over life periods (Rich-Edwards
et al., 2011). A questionnaire that speciﬁcally focuses on sexual
abuse in childhood is the Child Sexual Assaults Scale (CSAS,
Koss et al., 1987). This instrument assesses sexual abuse along
ﬁve subscales: demographic variables subscale, PTSD symptom
subscale, center for epidemiologic studies depression subscale,
traumatic events questionnaire, and childhood sexual experiences
subscale (Yampolsky et al., 2010). An advantage of the CSAS
is that it not only assesses possible traumatizing sexual events,
but it also checks for PTSD and aﬀective symptoms, therefore
mirroring the complex nature of this kind of childhood trauma.
Because large multi-center studies have become more important
in today’s psychiatry, the Early Trauma Inventory Self Report
(ETI-SR) represents a powerful assessment tool that has the
advantage of being validated many languages (German, French,
FIGURE 2 | The graph depicts the different workﬂows in traditional statistics compared with machine learning approaches. In traditional statistics, one approaches a
dataset with predeﬁned assumptions, reduces the entire dataset according to those assumptions and then tests a certain hypothesis for signiﬁcance. In contrast,
unbiased machine learning approaches split the dataset into training and test data and let an algorithm learn from the training data in an unbiased and
hypothesis-free manner. The evaluation of the analysis then depends on how well the model performs when applied to the test data. These two approaches can
yield quite different results.

Popovic et al.
Childhood Trauma in Schizophrenia
Chinese, Spanish, Portuguese, Plaza et al., 2012). The ETI-SR
is a 56-item inventory that assesses the presence of childhood
trauma with a series of “yes or no” questions and includes
speciﬁc items for physical (9 items), emotional (7 items), and
sexual abuse (15 items) and general trauma (31 items). It also
assesses the frequency of trauma, age at trauma, perpetrator,
and other variables before age 18 (Bremner et al., 2007; Plaza
et al., 2011). The Traumatic Life Events Questionnaire (TLEQ)
can be a viable alternative if a broader perspective on possible
traumatic or adverse life events is desired. This tool assesses
exposure to 16 types of potentially traumatic events, including
natural disasters, exposure to warfare, unexpected death of a
loved one, severe physical assault, diﬀerent forms of sexual abuse,
and experiences of stalking, and also accounts for the frequency
and severity of the named traumatic experiences (Kubany et al.,
2000). A rather brief self-report questionnaire is the Adverse
Childhood Experiences (ACE) questionnaire (Felitti et al., 1998).
In a total of 17 questions, this questionnaire assesses childhood
abuse within the domains of psychological, physical, and sexual
abuse. Additionally, it sets itself apart from many other self-
reports because it also includes four categories of childhood
exposure to household dysfunction, i.e., substance abuse, mental
illness, violent treatment of mother or stepmother, and criminal
behavior in the household.
With regards to semi-structured interviews, two more
questionnaires are of interest because they both have speciﬁc
advantages and can be useful in clinical studies: The Early
Trauma Inventory and the Children’s Life Events Scale (CLES).
The former instrument is a semi-structured interview that
assesses four domains of traumatic experiences (physical,
emotional, and sexual abuse and general traumatic experience)
and then addresses the most serious trauma in an additional
question (Bremner et al., 2000). This additional question can be
very useful in clinical settings because of the potential need for
an extended conversation about the most burdensome issue. The
CLES, which is an expansion of The Source of Stress Inventory
(Chandler, 1981), is a checklist composed of 50 moderate-to-
major stressful childhood events that covers categories such
as negative emotional feedback, family deaths, maltreatment,
failure in school, and family dysfunction (Crossﬁeld et al., 2002;
Grandin et al., 2007).
When selecting a questionnaire, equally important to the
frequency of use is the analysis of the resulting dataset. Therefore,
in the next section we critically discuss current analysis methods
and give an outlook on advanced mathematical analysis methods.
NOVEL APPROACHES FOR ASSESSING
AND ANALYZING CHILDHOOD
MALTREATMENT
Childhood trauma poses several challenges when it comes to
data integration and data analysis, mainly with regards to the
temporal resolution and the reciprocity and interdependency
of the observed phenotypes. The temporal problem arises
because most adverse events, which presumably occurred

Popovic et al.
Childhood Trauma in Schizophrenia
in childhood, can only be assessed retrospectively and are
therefore prone to a certain recollection bias (MacDonald et al.,
2015). Furthermore, the sequence in which adverse events
in childhood were experienced and psychiatric symptoms
developed is often unclear. Another issue lies in the reductionist
steps that most studies take during “preprocessing” of the
data on adverse experiences or events. In the ﬁrst step, the
data are categorized into speciﬁc overarching domains, such
as physical or emotional abuse (Morgan and Fisher, 2007),
which removes a great amount of the detailed information
given by the individual. The next quite common reductionist
step is to build sum scores for these domains or, in some cases,
a total score for all domains (Hovdestad et al., 2015). In this
second step, information given by patients is summarized
into nominal or ordinal categories, for example “childhood
trauma present” versus “childhood trauma absent” or “high
childhood trauma,” “medium childhood trauma,” and “low
childhood trauma” (Daruy-Filho et al., 2011; Agnew-Blais and
Danese, 2016). This step removes a great amount of variance
and heterogeneity within the dataset that could be important
for future analyses. Overall, these preprocessing steps take the
interdependency and reciprocity of these adversary factors and
their association with the observed psychopathology out of
the equation. The possible interactive eﬀects between various
kinds of adverse experiences, psychopathological symptoms,
and organic features (i.e., structural and functional MRI,
DNA variants, gene expression, or epigenetic mechanisms)
of the aﬀected individual are largely removed. Thus, most
current studies in the ﬁeld of childhood trauma research are
trying to investigate a highly dynamic phenomenon, in which
various risk and protective factors interact with each other
and produce complex clinical and organic phenotypes, with
simpliﬁed models that use ordinal and nominal grouping
and univariate statistics (Figure 2). At the same time, age
and sex are mostly controlled for, even though age- and
sex-speciﬁc eﬀects are found in various psychiatric disorders
(Cascio et al., 2012; Gur and Gur, 2016). Based on these
methodological issues, the potential advantage of using unbiased
and explorative machine learning and multivariate analysis
techniques becomes evident (Dwyer et al., 2018b; Jollans
and Whelan, 2018). While supervised learning algorithms
such as neural networks, tree-based algorithms and vector
machines
can
deliver
insights
into
psychiatric
disorders
through classiﬁcation and regression of labeled training data
(Bzdok et al., 2018), unsupervised learning algorithms are
able to complement this by uncovering latent structures
within an unlabeled training dataset (Figure 3). Hence, latent
variable models based on factor analysis or singular value
decomposition
(i.e.,
principal
component
analysis,
non-
negative matrix factorization, partial least squares) might
be used to explore associative eﬀects between variables of
interest (Jessen et al., 2018; Stein-O’Brien et al., 2018). In
this context, these associative eﬀects could then be used
to further explore causal links between diﬀerent kinds of
childhood adversity, psychopathology, and organic features,
e.g., MRI images or DNA expression proﬁles (Krakauer
et al., 2017). Other unsupervised techniques like hierarchical
clustering or self-organizing maps could be employed to ﬁnd
mathematically sound clusters of adverse childhood eﬀects
or certain phenotypical or organic patterns of childhood
trauma, that would be lost if one kept to the overly restrictive
approach of using DMS diagnoses or categorical/nominal
grouping of childhood trauma loading (Dwyer et al., 2018a).
Another interesting topic for analysis with multivariate tools
is the timeline of each individual, which is deﬁned by speciﬁc
childhood trauma experiences and onset and development of
certain symptoms.
The eﬀect of childhood trauma on psychopathology and
organic variables, such as brain structure and DNA variants
(see above), cannot be reduced to a static observation,
and we need to consider longitudinal data, the course of
disorder, and the biography of each individual. Therefore,
mixture models involving (Hidden) Markov Models, Directed
Graphical Models, and Bayesian Networks, would help to model,
predict and consequently explain the connection and evolution
of childhood trauma, psychopathology, and, if desired, its
organic correlates (Orphanou et al., 2014; Ryali et al., 2016;
Seltman et al., 2016). Some of these approaches have already
been undertaken in the ﬁeld of PTSD research (Galatzer-
Levy et al., 2014; Karstoft et al., 2015); however, to our
knowledge in the ﬁeld of childhood trauma and psychosis
research no studies have yet been published on machine
learning techniques (Figure 1). Therefore, this still unexplored
ﬁeld of unbiased, data-driven childhood trauma research has
exciting potential and should be one of the priorities for
future research.
