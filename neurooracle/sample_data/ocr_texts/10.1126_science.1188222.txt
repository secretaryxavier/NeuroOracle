Abstract
T cell egress from the thymus is essential for adaptive immunity, yet the requirements for and sites
of egress are incompletely understood. We have shown that transgenic expression of
sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1) in immature thymocytes leads to their perivascular
accumulation and premature release into circulation. Using an intravascular procedure to label
emigrating cells, we found that mature thymocytes exit via blood vessels at the corticomedullary
junction. By deleting sphingosine kinases in neural crest-derived pericytes, we provide evidence
that these specialized vessel-ensheathing cells contribute to the S1P that promotes thymic egress.
Lymphatic endothelial cell-derived S1P was not required. These studies identify the major thymic
egress route and suggest a role for pericytes in promoting reverse transmigration of cells across
blood vessel endothelium.
The thymus is an essential site of T cell development and tolerance induction. CD4 and CD8
double-negative (DN) precursors develop into double-positive (DP) thymocytes in the
thymic cortex, and cells positively selected for weak recognition of self major
histocompatibility (MHC)-peptide complexes give rise to semi-mature single-positive (SP)
thymocytes that localize to the medulla. Strongly self-reactive semi-mature SP thymocytes
are negatively selected whereas cells that pass this tolerance checkpoint undergo further
maturation in the medulla. Over a period of a few days, SP thymocytes upregulate the
transcription factor Kruppel-like factor (KLF) 2 and KLF2 target genes, including the G
protein-coupled receptor sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1) and the adhesion
molecule CD62L, and mature SP cells exit the thymus in an S1P1-and sphingosine-1-
phosphate (S1P)-dependent manner (1–3). The route by which egress occurs has not yet
been identified. Electron microscopy studies have occasionally (non-quantitatively)
identified cells crossing blood vessels at the corticomedullary junction (4–7). Thymic
progenitor cells are thought to enter the thymus at this location (8, 9), however, and it was
not possible in these studies to determine whether the transmigrating cells were entering or
exiting the thymus. Thymic lymphatics have also been implicated as a route of egress (7,
10–13); whether egress occurs predominantly via blood vessels or lymphatics has not been
resolved (2, 3).
S1P1 is sufficient to mediate immature thymocyte egress
To examine whether S1P1 upregulation is the key maturation event occurring in SP
thymocytes that is necessary for their egress, we asked whether premature expression of
S1P1 on immature thymocytes was sufficient to promote egress. Transgenic mice carrying
an S1P1 transgene under control of the Lck proximal promoter and immunoglobulin heavy

chain (Eμ) enhancer (14), which together direct transgene expression in developing
thymocytes and B cells, were generated and screened for S1P1 expression in thymocytes.
One line (line A) showed abundant expression in DP thymocytes and semi-mature SP
thymocytes (Fig. 1A), and a second line (line D) had lower but detectable expression in
these cells (Fig. 1A). In chemotaxis assays S1P1A transgenic DP and semi-mature SP
thymocytes showed migratory responses to S1P whereas control cells did not (Fig. 1B).
Analysis of blood and spleen samples from S1P1 transgenic mice revealed the presence of
substantial numbers of DP thymocytes (Fig. 1C), and there was a reduction of these cells
within the thymus (Fig. 1C). The reduction was greatest for the more mature CD3hiCCR7hi
DP cells, and these cells were also enriched among DP cells that reached the spleen and
were more responsive to S1P in chemotaxis assays (Fig. S1). Post-selection DP thymocytes
also migrate more rapidly in vivo (15), which suggests that factors affecting overall cell
motility may influence egress efficiency. To determine whether there was premature egress
of SP thymocytes, we intercrossed S1P1A transgenic mice with RAG-GFP reporter mice
(16); in these mice GFP is under the control of recombination-activating gene-1 (RAG-1)
regulatory elements and GFP is expressed in RAG-1+ DP thymocytes and then gradually
decays over a period of days as the thymocytes mature (17, 18). Enumeration of CD4 T cells
in the periphery that had the RAG-GFPhi Qa2int phenotype of recent thymic emigrants (17)
revealed they were present in elevated frequencies and numbers in the transgenic mice (Fig.
1D). To directly test whether S1P1 was the sole KLF2-target gene needed for egress of
mature SP thymocytes, we bred S1P1A transgenic and KLF2f/f -CD4Cre mice (19), which
selectively delete KLF2 in thymocytes at the DP stage, and enumerated mature S1P1+ cells
in the thymus. The S1P1 transgene was not expected to be KLF2-regulated because it is
under the control of the Lck promoter and Eμ enhancer. Indeed, no difference in S1P1
staining was detected between KLF2f/f -CD4Cre S1P1A transgenic and wild-type S1P1A
transgenic mature SP thymocytes (Fig. 1E). In contrast to findings in KLF2-deficient non-
transgenic mice, where mature SP thymocytes accumulate [Fig. 1E and (20)], there was no
accumulation of mature SP thymocytes in KLF2-deficient S1P1 transgenic mice (Fig. 1E)
indicating that egress of the transgenic SP cells was not KLF2-dependent. These
observations establish that S1P1 is sufficient to promote egress of KLF2-negative DP cells
and KLF2-deficient mature SP thymocytes, demonstrating that S1P1 is the essential KLF2-
target gene needed for emigration.
Perivascular accumulation of S1P1 transgenic thymocytes
In sections of S1P1 transgenic thymi, unusual perivascular accumulations of thymocytes
were observed, most strikingly in the cortex but also detectable in the medulla (Fig. 2A).
Transgenic cells accumulated between the epithelial basement membrane associated with
CK5+ epithelial cells and ERTR7+ cells and the basement membrane of the blood vessels
and associated ERTR7+ and PDGFRβ+ pericytes, the specialized support cells that
ensheathe blood vessels (Fig. 2A). In mixed bone marrow chimeras, transgenic cells were
localized in these perivascular channels, bounded by laminin-containing epithelial and
endothelial basement membranes, whereas wild-type cells were excluded (Fig. 2B).
Treatment with FTY720 to disrupt thymocyte S1P1 function (3) dramatically reduced the
perivascular accumulations, causing cells to disperse from the perivascular region and return
to the thymic parenchyma (Fig. 2A). These observations indicate that the perivascular
accumulations were maintained by ongoing S1P responses and suggest that there is local
availability of S1P in the immediate vicinity of thymic blood vessels. The much greater
accumulation of cells in perivascular channels of transgenic mice than occurs in wild-type
mice (8, 11, 21) may reflect both the higher number of S1P1-expressing cells and the higher
S1P1 surface abundance and greater S1P sensitivity of the transgenic cells (Fig. 1, A and B).
The greater accumulation around cortical than medullary vessels may indicate that despite

abundant S1P1-transgene expression, DP thymocytes are less efficient at egressing than SP
thymocytes, or cortical vessels are less efficient at supporting egress.
Autoimmunity in S1P1 transgenic mice
To explore the possibility that premature egress might be associated with diminished
negative selection and autoimmunity, various organs of the S1P1 transgenic mice were
examined for cellular infiltrates (Fig. S1). Large lymphoid infiltrates were observed in
salivary gland, lacrimal gland and lung at a substantially higher frequency in the S1P1A
transgenic mice than in littermate control mice (Fig. S1). Recent findings have shown
elevated S1P1 expression diminishes T-regulatory (Treg) cell development (22) and we also
observed reduced Treg numbers in the thymi of S1P1A transgenic mice (Fig. S1). Peripheral
Treg frequencies, however, were not affected (Fig. S1) and previous studies have shown that
even small numbers of Treg can protect from disease (23). Thus, although we cannot
exclude an effect of the S1P1A transgene on peripheral Treg function, our results are
consistent with the possibility that premature thymic egress of developing T cells is
associated with insufficient negative selection and autoimmunity.
Intravascular labeling identifies emigrating thymocytes
The heightened frequency of emigrating thymocytes in S1P1A transgenic mice led us to ask
if we could detect thymocytes in the act of egress. A previous study has shown that very
short treatment with labeled antibodies, particularly if conjugated to the large fluorophore
phycoerythrin (PE), achieves selective labeling of cells exposed to the vascular compartment
in bone marrow (24). Mice were injected intravenously with PE-conjugated CD4 antibody
(CD4PE) and a few minutes later the thymus was isolated and prepared for flow cytometric
analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy. In S1P1A transgenic mice we observed a low
but reproducible frequency of DP thymocytes that became CD4PE-labeled (Fig. 3A). No DP
cells became labeled in nontransgenic littermate controls (Fig. 3A). The labeled DP cells in
transgenic thymi did not simply reflect blood contamination because the frequency of DP
cells amongst the CD4PE-labeled cells was highly enriched compared to their frequency
amongst CD4PE-labeled cells in venous blood (Fig. 3A). When DP cells were transferred
directly into the blood they disappeared with a half-life of about 3 hours (Fig. S2),
suggesting they are lost rapidly once they leave the thymus and enter general circulation. In
sections, the S1P1A transgenic cells labeled following intravenous CD4PE antibody
treatment were located in blood vessels distributed in both the cortex and medulla (Fig. 3B
and Fig. S2). In some cases the CD4PE-labeled cells were found to be spanning the CD31+
endothelium, apparently caught in the act of crossing (Fig. 3B).
By collecting large (~5 million event) flow cytometric files it was possible to observe
intravascularly CD4PE-labeled SP thymocytes in normal mice (Fig. 3, A and C). Using
RAG-GFP reporter mice to track thymocyte maturity (17), the majority (~80%) of
intravascularly CD4PE-labeled cells in the young adult thymus had higher amounts of GFP
than cells in the blood, indicating that these were cells that had just emigrated but not yet left
the thymus, rather than corresponding to cells already present in blood circulation (Fig. 3D).
These thymic cells also expressed higher amounts of CD31 than cells in the blood or the
most mature cells in the thymus (Fig. 3D) suggesting they had transiently acquired or
upregulated CD31 during egress. We used this labeling technique to examine mice lacking
CD69, a protein that regulates S1P1 function in peripheral T cells (25) and that is expressed
on semi-mature SP thymocytes but is of unknown function in the thymus (26, 27).
Intravascularly CD4PE-labeled cells in the thymus of CD69−/− RAG-GFP+ mice had higher
amounts of GFP than cells in control RAG-GFP+ mice, indicating they were less mature and
based on estimates of GFP half-life (18) had emigrated several hours prematurely (Figs. 3E

and S3). CD69−/− mice also had fewer mature SP cells in the thymus and more recent
thymic emigrants in the periphery (Fig. S3). These observations indicate CD69 regulates the
timing of thymocyte egress.
Thymocytes emigrate by blood vessels at the corticomedullary junction
Immunofluorescence analysis of sections from in vivo labeled wild-type thymus revealed
rare PE-labeled cells in vessels near the corticomedullary junction (Fig. 4). Enumeration of
CD4PE-labeled cells across 30 μm thick thymic cross-sections revealed a mean of 70 cells
per section (Figs. 4A and S4A) with the great majority being located in vessels within 50 μm
of the corticomedullary junction (Fig. 4B). Using the number of cells present in the volume
of one section to extrapolate the number present in the volume of the whole organ (~0.025
cubic centimeters), we calculated that roughly 2500 labeled cells are present per thymus.
This number agrees closely with that obtained by flow cytometry (Fig. 3C). If we assume
that thymocyte reverse transmigration has a similar speed to other T cell transmigration
events and takes approximately 3 minutes (28, 29), then we estimate 0.8 million CD4 SP
cells (or ~1 million total SP cells) exit the thymus per day. This number is in close
agreement with the estimate from intra-thymic FITC labeling experiments that ~1% of total
thymocytes (~1 million cells) egress per day (30). Close examination of in vivo labeled
thymic sections revealed examples of cells that appeared to be in the act of reverse
transmigrating across the vascular endothelium into the blood (Figs. 4, B and C and S4, B
and C). Analysis of serial sections confirmed that the cells were projecting through the
CD31+ endothelium (Movies S1 and S2). In summary, by selectively labeling egressing
cells we demonstrate that the majority of thymocytes emigrate via blood vessels at the
corticomedullary junction.
Neural crest-derived pericytes promote thymocyte egress
S1P is present at high concentration in blood and low concentration in the thymus (3).
Previous work established that the major source of S1P necessary for thymic egress is
radiation-resistant (31). This suggested, surprisingly, that blood S1P is not sufficient to
promote normal egress and S1P production by a local stromal cell type might be required.
Pericytes are a diverse population of cells that closely ensheathe blood vessels, but not
lymphatics, and can lack or express α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) (32, 33). Recently it
was discovered that thymic perivascular cells are unusual in having a neural crest origin (34,
35). For simplicity and in accord with a prior study (35) we refer to the neural crest-derived
perivascular cells as pericytes. Thymocytes undergoing reverse (basolateral-to-apical)
transmigration are likely to encounter pericytes prior to engaging the endothelium. This
prediction, and our finding that S1P1 transgenic thymocytes accumulate adjacent to
pericytes (Fig. 2A) led us to hypothesize that S1P produced by neural crest-derived pericytes
might be required for thymic egress. Wnt1-Cre, an established neural crest-specific Cre (36),
causes efficient recombination and expression of the Rosa26eYFP locus in the majority of
thymic pericytes (34, 35). To test for a possible role of pericytes as a radiation-resistant S1P
source necessary for thymocyte egress, Wnt1-Cre mice were intercrossed with Sphk1f/−
Sphk2−/− mice (31), to generate mice with neural crest-derived cells lacking the two kinases
required for production of S1P. Wnt1-Cre+ Sphk1f/− or f/f Sphk−/−2 mice were viable and
showed no gross abnormalities, suggesting intrinsic Sphk-activity may not be essential for
neural crest function during development. However, analysis of Wnt1-Cre+ Sphk1f/− orf/f
Sphk2−/− mice revealed a selective accumulation of CD62LhiHSAint/lo mature SP
thymocytes compared to littermate controls that retained at least one intact copy of Sphk1 or
Sphk2 (Fig. 5A). This accumulation was partial compared with that observed in polyI:C-
treated MxCre Sphk-deficient mice (Fig. 5A) that lack sphingosine kinases in a wide range
of IFNα/β-responsive cell types and have undetectable plasma S1P (31). Plasma S1P

amounts were unaffected in Wnt1-Cre Sphk-deficient mice (Fig. S5). Intravenous CD4PE
antibody treatment showed a reduced number of vascularly exposed CD4 SP thymocytes in
the mice lacking Sphk activity in neural crest-derived cells (Fig. 5B), and there were
reduced numbers of HSAint Qa2int recent thymic emigrants (17) in peripheral lymph nodes
(Fig. 5C). Mature T cell numbers in lymph nodes were in the normal range (Fig. S5),
perhaps due to incomplete activity of Wnt1-Cre in neural crest-derived pericytes (34) or the
sufficiency of plasma S1P to promote a significant amount of thymic egress (31). S1P1
surface abundance was slightly elevated on mature SP thymocytes in Wnt1-Cre Sphk-
deficient mice, consistent with reduced exposure to S1P (Fig. 5D). Despite the accumulation
of mature SP thymocytes in Wnt1Cre Sphk-deficient mice (Fig. 5A) there was a lower
frequency of CD69-negative cells amongst this population compared to littermate controls
(Fig. 5E). This may reflect a requirement for S1P exposure for full CD69 downregulation
during thymocyte maturation. Immunohistochemical analysis established that the pericyte
distribution in the thymus of Wnt1-Cre Sphk-deficient mice was normal (Fig. 5F). To
determine whether the thymic egress block in polyI:C-treated MxCre Sphk-deficient mice
could also reflect gene deletion in pericytes, we examined Rosa26eYFP reporter expression
in isolated cells by flow cytometry (Fig. 6A). Pericytes, identified as PDGFRβ+ CD31−
CD45− cells (34) showed near complete reporter gene activation whereas blood endothelial
cells showed partial reporter gene activation (Fig. 6A). The findings from the Wnt1-Cre and
MxCre Sphk-deficient mice suggest that pericytes contribute to the S1P required for
thymocyte egress. These results do not exclude the possibility that Sphk ablation affects
pericyte function in additional ways.
Lymphatic S1P is not required for thymic egress
Some studies have suggested a major role for lymphatic vessels in thymocyte egress (2, 7,
10–13, 21). In our studies, LYVE1+ lymphatic vessels were rarely detected in cross sections
of adult C57Bl/6 mouse thymi and gp38+CD31+ lymphatic endothelial cells were very rare
by flow cytometric analysis of enzyme digested thymi, being outnumbered by gp38− CD31+
blood vessel endothelium by at least 50 to 1 (Fig. 6A and B). Lymphatic endothelial cells
are a necessary S1P source for lymphocyte egress into lymph node lymphatics (37). To
further test whether lymphatic endothelium played a role in thymic egress, we analyzed
LYVE-1Cre Sphk1f/f Sphk2−/− mice. LYVE-1Cre causes efficient floxed gene ablation in
lymphatic endothelial cells and partial ablation in blood vasculature (37). Analysis of
LYVE-1Cre x Rosa26eYFP mice revealed yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) expression in
~40% of thymic blood vessel endothelial cells (Fig. 6B); there were too few lymphatic
endothelial cells in the thymus to permit reporter analysis. In lymph nodes, however, all the
lymphatic endothelial cells were YFP reporter+ (Fig. 6B) as expected (37). In LYVE-1Cre+
Sphk-deficient mice there was no increase in mature SP thymocyte numbers in the thymus
(Fig. 6C). These observations and the concordance between the number of cells egressing
into blood vessels and exiting from the thymus as a whole lead us to the conclusion that
lymphatic vessels do not play a major role in thymic egress.
Discussion
In summary, we provide evidence that S1P1 is the only target that KLF2 must upregulate in
mature SP thymocytes to promote their emigration. Using an intravascular labeling
approach, we establish that T cells emigrate from the thymus via blood vessels at the
corticomedullary junction. This non-invasive technique for enumerating and phenotyping
emigrating thymocytes also allowed us to estimate that CD69 delays thymic egress by
several hours, likely helping ensure cells complete selection and maturation events before
reaching circulation. Unlike most vascular beds, thymic blood vessels are ensheathed by
neural crest-derived pericytes (34, 35). We provide evidence of an active role for these

support cells in promoting T cell reverse transmigration. These data help explain the
seemingly discrepant findings that thymocyte egress occurs into the blood, yet plasma S1P
alone appears insufficient to promote normal egress (31). Endothelial cells can produce S1P
in vitro (38) and we do not exclude the possibility that endothelial cell S1P works together
with pericyte and plasma S1P in promoting thymocyte egress. Postcapillary venules at the
corticomedullary junction have large (10–50 μm) diameters (4) and are thin walled, with
only a single layer of ensheathing α-SMA+ pericytes (35), perhaps indicating specialization
to support thymocyte egress. Our findings exclude a major role for lymphatic vessels in
thymocyte egress in the young adult mouse, and the lack of LYVE1+ lymphatics in the
human thymic medulla suggests a similar conclusion for human thymocyte egress (39).
However, it remains possible that lymphatics contribute to egress from thymi of aged or
diseased animals, where they are sometimes more prevalent (11, 40). Perivascular channels
containing thymocytes have been seen in thymi of a number of species including humans (5,
7, 11, 41). Our findings indicate that thymocyte accumulation in these channels can be S1P-
mediated. We suggest that with their rich content of extracellular matrix, perivascular
channels provide a space where pericyte-and vessel-derived S1P is protected from rapid
degradation by cell-associated enzymes (1, 3), facilitating formation of an egress-promoting
S1P gradient. An important question is whether S1P secretion is a unique property of the
neural crest-derived thymic pericytes, or whether it also occurs in other vascular beds. We
propose that the differential propensity of pericytes to secrete S1P may be a key factor
determining whether S1P receptor-expressing cells undergo reverse transmigration across
blood vessels.

(C) Flow cytometric detection of intravascularly CD4PE-labeled SP cells in the thymus of
non-transgenic mice and their absence after 12 h FTY720 treatment. Bars in right graph
show mean of 3 experiments (n=3 mice). (D) RAG-GFP intensity and CD31 staining on the
indicated CD4PE-labeled cells. Left histogram plot shows GFP fluorescence in
intravascularly CD4PE-labeled cells in thymus, mature CD62Lhi Qa2int CD4 SP
thymocytes, and CD4 T cells in blood, and numbers indicate % GFPhi for each cell type.
Middle graph shows summarized data for 3 mice aged 5 to 6 weeks. Right histogram plot
shows CD31 staining with inset fluorescent intensities for the indicated thymic populations
and RAG-GFPhi blood recent thymic emigrants (RTE). Data are representative of 5 mice
analyzed in 5 experiments. (E) RAG-GFP intensity of CD69−/− (blue) and CD69+/− (red)
mature CD4 SP and IV CD4PE+ thymocytes. Bottom bar graph shows ratios of GFP
intensity comparing mature CD4 SP and IV CD4PE+ thymocytes for individual mice. These
data represent 7 mice analyzed in 7 experiments.

In vivo labeling identifies CD4 SP thymocytes emigrating at the cortico-medullary junction.
(A–C) Immunofluorescence of thymic sections from non-transgenic mice injected with anti-
CD4PE, also stained to detect vascular endothelium with anti-CD31 (green) and with anti-
CD8 to highlight cortical regions (A) or with DAPI (B–C) to detect nuclei (blue). (A) Tiled
view of an entire thymic lobe section with CD4PE+ cells highlighted by red squares and an
example shown in the top left inset. Bottom right inset displays enumeration of CD4PE-
labeled cells in thymic cross sections, assigned as being located in vessels within 50 μm of
the corticomedullary junction (CMJ), in the cortex (Cort or “C”) or in the medulla (Med or
“M”). Scale bars indicate 25 μm (inset image) and 800 μm (main image). (B, C) High power
views of transmigrating thymocytes. Large left panel displays a single 0.24 μm-thick xy
