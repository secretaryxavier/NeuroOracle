Abstract
Mycobacterium tuberculosis heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA), a virulence factor involved in extrapulmonary
dissemination and a strong diagnostic antigen against tuberculosis, is both surface-associated and secreted. The role of
HBHA in macrophages during M. tuberculosis infection, however, is less well known. Here, we show that recombinant HBHA
produced by Mycobacterium smegmatis effectively induces apoptosis in murine macrophages. DNA fragmentation, nuclear
condensation, caspase activation, and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage were observed in apoptotic macrophages
treated with HBHA. Enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and Bax activation were essential for HBHA-induced
apoptosis, as evidenced by a restoration of the viability of macrophages pretreated with N-acetylcysteine, a potent ROS
scavenger, or transfected with Bax siRNA. HBHA is targeted to the mitochondrial compartment of HBHA-treated and M.
tuberculosis-infected macrophages. Dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DYm) and depletion of
cytochrome c also occurred in both macrophages and isolated mitochondria treated with HBHA. Disruption of HBHA gene
led to the restoration of DYm impairment in infected macrophages, resulting in reduced apoptosis. Taken together, our
data suggest that HBHA may act as a strong pathogenic factor to cause apoptosis of professional phagocytes infected with
M. tuberculosis.

Introduction
Tuberculosis remains a serious global problem, although many
researchers have made a persistent effort for several decades.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major causative agent of pulmonary
tuberculosis, is responsible for 1.8 million deaths per year
worldwide [1]. Innate immune system plays a critical role in
antimicrobial host response during the early stage of M. tuberculosis
infection. Alveolar macrophages mediate innate immunity by
phagocytosing pathogens and are the chief defense against M.
tuberculosis, which can survive and replicate within phagocytes [2].
The course of tuberculosis rests on the outcome of the interaction
between the bacterium and host macrophage. Therefore, a better
understanding
of
these
complex
interactions
is
critical
to
controlling mycobacterial infection.
Many bacterial and viral pathogens utilize various strategies to
manipulate host machinery to serve their own needs. Apoptotic
cell death has been regarded as an innate cellular response to limit
the multiplication of intracellular pathogens [3], although the
precise mechanism of the direct antimicrobial action in infected
macrophages undergoing apoptosis is unclear. Generally, infec-
tious intracellular pathogens tend to prevent host cell apoptosis
during an early stage of infection. However, they may also induce
host cell apoptosis with a specific aim to subvert the host attack,
such as immune and inflammatory response, at later stages [4,5].
A number of reports have indicated that M. tuberculosis does
indeed inhibit host cell apoptosis, while at the same time it induces
pro-apoptotic signals. Recent studies showed that only virulent
mycobacterial species can inhibit apoptosis induction in primary
human alveolar macrophages [6], THP-1 [7,8], and J774
macrophage cell lines [9]. Virulent M. tuberculosis reportedly
induced the apoptotic death of host cells. For example, enhanced
apoptotic
response
was
detected
in
alveolar
macrophages
recovered from patients with pulmonary tuberculosis [10,11].
Extensive apoptosis was also observed in caseating granulomas
from lung tissue samples obtained from patients with tuberculosis
[12,13]. Several apoptosis-inducing factors of M. tuberculosis,
such as 19-kDa glycolipoprotein (Rv3763) [14], PE_PGRS33
(Rv1818c) [15], ESAT6 (Rv3875) [16], and 38-kDa lipoprotein
(Rv0934) [17] are reported.
Heparin-binding hemagglutinin adhesin (HBHA) is a 28-kDa
multifunctional protein found on the surface and culture filtrates of
mycobacteria. It has hemagglutination activity and binds to
sulfated glycoconjugates such as heparin and dextran sulfate [18].
HBHA interacts specifically with non-phagocytic cells and is
essential for the infection of lung epithelial cells and extrapulmo-

nary dissemination of M. tuberculosis [18,19]. Protective immunity
induced by HBHA is observed in M. tuberculosis-infected mouse
models, indicating that HBHA is a protective antigen [20]. Recent
studies suggest that HBHA is a useful diagnostic marker for
tuberculosis [21]. We also identified and characterized HBHA as a
serologically active mycobacterial antigen in a previous study,
whereby HBHA binds strongly to the immunoglobulin M of
patients with tuberculosis [22]. Although HBHA function in
mycobacterial pathogenesis has been extensively studied, the role
of HBHA on professional phagocytes, such as macrophages, is still
poorly understood.
The aim of the present study was to characterize the biological
effects of M. tuberculosis HBHA on macrophages. We found that
HBHA induced apoptosis in murine macrophages and investigat-
ed its underlying mechanism. Here, we show that HBHA
treatment caused a loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential
(DYm) and the release of cytochrome c from purified mitochondria
in vitro, as well as mitochondria of intact cells, and HBHA was
efficiently targeted to mitochondria of macrophages.
Results
HBHA induces macrophage apoptosis via caspase
activation
We first sought to determine whether HBHA could induce
macrophage apoptosis. Apoptosis was assessed by quantifying
DNA fragmentation, which is considered a hallmark of apoptosis,
in the cytoplasmic fractions of dying cells using a commercially
available ELISA kit. The incubation of RAW 264.7 cells with
HBHA resulted in a significant increase in the release of
oligonucleosomal fragments into the cytoplasm in both dose-
and time-dependent manners as compared to compared to control
cells (Figure 1A and 1B). Cell death was significantly greater in
cells treated with HBHA as compared to buffer-treated control
cells. As lactate dehydrogenase was not detected in the cell culture
supernatant during HBHA treatment, the possibility that HBHA-
induced death is necrosis was excluded (Figure S1). We used native
antigen 85 complex (Ag85) as an unrelated control protein. The
Ag85 of M. tuberculosis is the major secreted protein and
fibronectin-binding protein, and shows strong immunoreactivity
[23,24]. Similar results were observed in bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDMs); like PBS-treated BMDMs DNA frag-
mentation was not detected in Ag85-treated cells, whereas
dramatic DNA fragmentation was observed in HBHA-treated
cells (Figure 1C). HBHA-induced apoptosis was further confirmed
by examining the nuclear morphology of dying cells using a
fluorescent DNA-binding agent, 49-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI). As shown in Figure 1D, control cells treated with buffer
had intact nuclei. In contrast, within 48 h of HBHA treatment,
RAW 264.7 cells clearly exhibited condensed or fragmented nuclei
indicative of apoptotic cell death. We further analyzed the caspase
dependency of HBHA-induced apoptosis. Western blot analysis
showed that the cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-9, and poly(ADP-
ribose) polymerase (PARP) was evident in cells incubated with
HBHA for 48 h (Figure 1E). Inhibition of caspases by a pan-
caspase inhibitor, zVAD-fmk, attenuated the HBHA-induced
DNA fragmentation, indicating that HBHA induces caspase-
dependent apoptosis (Figure 1F). These results suggest that
macrophages treated with HBHA undergo caspase-dependent
apoptosis.
HBHA causes a decrease in DYm
The mitochondrion acts as a central executioner in response to
apoptotic stimuli, allowing signals from various inputs to converge
[25]. We investigated whether HBHA treatment affected the
structural and biochemical integrity of mitochondria. Mitochon-
drial damage was assessed by examining mitochondrial DYm,
which was determined by staining cells with 3,39-Dihexyloxacar-
bocyanine (DiOC6), a dye that incorporates into mitochondria
with intact membrane potential [26], for flow cytometric analysis.
As shown in Figure 2A, a significant loss of DYm was observed in
RAW 264.7 cells incubated with HBHA as indicated by a decrease
in DiOC6 intensity. Analysis of the time course for examination of
DYm onset showed a noticeable dissipation of DYm after 18 h of
HBHA treatment, which further decreased with time. A similar
result was obtained in BMDMs incubated with HBHA (Figure 2B).
These results suggest that mitochondrial damage appears as a
subsequent event in the intracellular action of HBHA.
HBHA induces Bax translocation to mitochondria and
releases cytochrome c from mitochondria to the cytosol
Apoptosis at the mitochondrial level involves the oligomeriza-
tion of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax [27], leading to permeabi-
lization of the outer mitochondrial membrane (MOMP) and
release of cytochrome c [28]. We performed immunocytochem-
istry to detect Bax translocation and cytochrome c release. An
antibody recognizing the Bax N-terminus, which is exposed by the
activation of Bax and its insertion into the mitochondrial
membrane, was used. Figure 3A shows the translocation of Bax
distributed evenly in the cytoplasm to the mitochondria in
macrophages as evident by the colocalization of Bax with
Mitotracker, a potential-sensitive dye specific for mitochondria.
In PBS-treated cells, cytochrome c showed a punctate pattern that
colocalizes
with
Mitotracker,
whereas
the
faint
signal
for
cytochrome c and the decreased colocalization with Mitotracker
were detected in HBHA-treated cells, indicating cytochrome c
release. These results were confirmed by performing subcellular
fractionation and Western blot analysis (Figure 3B). HBHA caused
a decrease in cytochrome c immunoreactivity in the mitochondrial
fraction with a concomitant increase in the cytosolic fraction and
vice versa for Bax immunoreactivity. Collectively, these findings
suggest that the apoptotic effect of HBHA on macrophages is
associated with cytochrome c release and Bax translocation. To
Author Summary
Cell death is a common outcome during infection with a
number of pathogenic microorganisms. Therefore, defin-
ing the factors responsible for killing of host cells is
important to uncovering mechanisms of pathogenesis.
World-wide, two billon people are latently infected with
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is still killing 2–3 million
people each year. Heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA)
protein of M. tuberculosis is known to interact specifically
with non-phagocytic cells and to be involved in dissem-
ination from lungs to other tissues. Nevertheless, the role
of HBHA in phagocytic cells such as macrophages, which
are the first cells of the immune system to encounter
inhaled pathogens, has been unknown. In the present
study, we suggest HBHA as a critical bacterial protein for
macrophage cell death. After M. tuberculosis infection or
HBHA treatment of macrophages, HBHA targeted to
mitochondria and then caused mitochondrial damage
and oxidative stress, which eventually lead to apoptosis. A
mutant of M. tuberculosis lacking HBHA induced less
apoptosis with moderated mitochondrial damage. These
experiments provide a candidate virulence factor which
may be a novel target for tuberculosis treatment.

determine whether Bax activation is necessary for HBHA-induced
apoptosis, we knocked down the level of Bax by transfecting RAW
264.7 cells with Bax siRNA. The Bax protein level was
significantly reduced in cells transfected with Bax siRNA; Bax
protein
in
control
siRNA-transfected
cells
was
unchanged
(Figure 3C). We then determined the effect of knockdown Bax
on HBHA-induced apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells. As shown in
Figure 3D and 3E, HBHA-induced increase in DNA fragmenta-
tion was blocked and DYm loss was restored by Bax knockdown,
suggesting that Bax activation is required for HBHA-induced
macrophage apoptosis.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are required for apoptosis
induced by HBHA
Enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, charac-
teristic of early apoptotic events, can be both a cause and a

consequence of changes in DYm [26,29]. To examine the
involvement of ROS generation on HBHA effects in macrophag-
es, the oxidation of DCF was monitored by flow cytometry and
fluorescent microscopy (Figure 4A). Compared to PBS or Ag85,
HBHA significantly induced the increase of intracellular hydro-
peroxide in macrophages. To determine the requirement of ROS
increase in HBHA-induced apoptosis, the effect of HBHA alone or
in combination with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a general ROS
scavenger, on DNA fragmentation was assessed. NAC pretreat-
ment effectively inhibited HBHA-induced DNA fragmentation
(Figure 4B) as well as ROS production, suggesting that ROS
increase is essential for the apoptotic response caused by HBHA.
HBHA is targeted to the mitochondria
Studies have suggested that some infectious
intracellular
pathogens regulate apoptosis of their host cells by targeting
proteins to mitochondrial membranes that either induce or inhibit
MMP [30]. We addressed the question of where HBHA is
localized in mitochondria of HBHA-treated cells. Therefore, the
possibility that HBHA interacts with the mitochondrial compart-
ment was examined. Confocal microscopic analysis revealed the
presence of HBHA in the mitochondria of HBHA-treated cells, as
evidenced by a significant overlap between HBHA and Mito-
tracker (Figure 5A). Subcellular fractionation and Western blot
analysis consistently showed that large amounts of HBHA were
detected in the mitochondrial fraction, but not in the cytosolic
fraction, where little HBHA was observed (Figure 5B). In contrast,
the minimum of Ag85 were detected in cytoplasmic fraction of
macrophage treated with Ag85, suggesting that it is not able to
pass through plasma membrane. Furthermore, to determine
whether HBHA was imported into mitochondria, we isolated
mitochondria from cells treated with HBHA. The purified
mitochondria were subsequently digested with proteinase K. As
shown in Figure 5C, HBHA disappeared in mitochondria digested
with proteinase K, indicating that HBHA adheres to the outer
membrane of the mitochondria.
HBHA induces the release of cytochrome c and the loss
of DYm in isolated mitochondria
We next determined whether HBHA induced cytochrome c
release from isolated mitochondria. As shown in Figure 6A,
isolated mitochondria from RAW 264.7 cells released cytochrome
c after HBHA treatment, whereas the buffer control or Ag85 did
not stimulate this release in a cell-free assay. We also examined the
effect of HBHA on the collapse of membrane potential in purified
mitochondria. For this, mitochondria incubated with HBHA were
stained with DiOC6, and the fluorescence intensity was monitored
by flow cytometry (Figure 6B). A significant shift to a lower
intensity was observed in mitochondria treated with HBHA as
compared to buffer control or Ag85, indicating the decrease in
DYm. These data provide evidence that similar to the event that
occurs in macrophages, HBHA can solely induce mitochondrial
damage in a cell-free system, indicating that Bax translocation to
mitochondria is not essential for of DYm loss and cytochrome c
release.
HBHA partially localizes to mitochondria during M.
tuberculosis infection and impacts viability of infected
macrophages
HBHA is a secreted protein in M. tuberculosis as well as a surface-
associated protein [18]. To examine whether HBHA is also
transported to mitochondria during M. tuberculosis infection,
BMDMs were infected with H37Rv wild type and mutant
disrupted in hbhA. Immunofluorescence microscopy of infected
cells revealed that a part of HBHA colocalized with mitochondria
(Figure
7A).
Purified
mitochondrial
fraction
of
these
cells
contained a considerable amount of HBHA protein, although a
large portion of HBHA were observed in cytosolic fraction
(Figure 7B). These findings demonstrate that HBHA is efficiently
transported to mitochondria of infected macrophages. To analyze
the effects of HBHA on macrophages in the context of the

of DiOC6 was determined by flow cytometry as described in the
Materials and Methods. A shift in the cell population to the left indicates
a loss of DYm. Histograms shown are representative of at least three
independent experiments. Mean 6 SD of three independent experi-

bacterium as a whole, we compared the relative ability of M.
tuberculosis H37Rv wild type and mutant disrupted in hbhA to
induce apoptosis and DYm collapse in macrophages. A reduced
DNA fragmentation and an increased intact mitochondria were
observed in BMDMs infected with mutant strain compared to its
parent
(Figure
7C
and
7D),
which
was
noticeable
when
macrophages were infected at MOIs of 5 and 10 but not at an
MOI of 25 (Figure S2A). On the other hand, there was no
significant difference in LDH release between cells infected with
two strains (Figure S2B). Similarly, more significant DNA
fragmentation and DYm loss were detected in cells infected with
M. smegmatis ectopically expressing HBHA compared to cells
infected with the M. smegmatis control.
HBHA has no influence on the viability of A549 cells
HBHA is involved in the interaction of mycobacteria with
alveolar epithelial cells [19]. To determine whether these cells
exposed to HBHA undergo apoptosis, human type II A549
pneumocytes were treated with purified HBHA for 48 h. As
shown in Figure 8A and 8B, neither DNA fragmentation nor DYm
collapse was observed in HBHA-treated A549 cells. Immunoflu-
orescent microscopy showed that a very faint green signal was
detected in A549 cells incubated with HBHA, indicating that
HBHA enters A549 cells much less efficiently (Figure 8C, upper
panels). To confirm this issue, A549 cells were infected with M.
tuberculosis wild type and hbhA deficient strains. Like experiments
conducted in macrophages, M. tuberculosis infection led to severe
DYm dissipation, accompanied by the partial presence of HBHA
in mitochondrial compartments (Figure 8B and 8C, lower panels).
In contrast, a decrease in the percentage of cells displaying loss of
DYm was observed in A549 cells infected with the hbhA deficient
strain (Figure 8B). These data suggest that cell entry and targeting
to mitochondria of HBHA are essential for DYm loss and
apoptotic response.
Discussion
Programmed cell death is emerging as a major effect of bacterial
pathogenesis. Numerous studies have shown that M. tuberculosis
infection can increase the rate of macrophage apoptosis [31,32].
Pro-apoptotic activities of a growing number of mycobacterial
components have recently been described [14–17]. Nevertheless,
data regarding the identities of the mycobacterial molecules
involved and the underlying apoptotic mechanism are still scarce.
We
showed
here
that
intracellular
HBHA
is
targeted
to
mitochondria in murine macrophages, which leads to DYm
dissipation and eventual apoptosis. Although the possibility that
HBHA may interact with cytosolic molecules or other cell
compartments cannot be ruled out completely, these connections
clearly appear to be insignificant. To our knowledge, the present
study is the first description of a mycobacteria-encoded protein
stimulating apoptotic cell death via a mitochondria-dependent
pathway in macrophages.
M. tuberculosis HBHA is a protein that is both surface-associated
and secreted. HBHA is involved in the binding of M. tuberculosis to
type II pneumocytes, but not to professional phagocytes such as
macrophages, and is required for the dissemination of tubercle
bacilli from the lungs to other tissues [19]. In this respect, its
impact on macrophages has received relatively little attention.
However, HBHA was recently demonstrated to have the capacity
to bind to complement component C3, and recombinant HBHA
was found to mediate the attachment of latex beads to murine
macrophage-like cells in both C3-dependent and -independent
manners [33]. M. tuberculosis can bind to the complement receptors

and is subsequently introduced into the phagocytic cell [34]. These
results raise the possibility of the interaction between HBHA and
macrophages during mycobacterial infection.
Mitochondria are central organelles in which a variety of key
events in apoptosis occur, including the release of cytochrome c,
changes in electron transport, DYm collapse, altered cellular
oxidation–reduction, and participation of pro- and anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 family proteins [26]. Presently, mitochondria are regarded as
the targets for the manipulation of many bacterial and viral
pathogens determining the fate of infected host cells [35]. Moreover,
mitochondrial damage has been suggested to play a critical role in
the outcome of macrophage infection with M. tuberculosis [36]. These
findings offer the potential of mycobacterial components for the
regulation of programmed cell death at the mitochondrial level.
MMP is regulated by endogenous molecules, including Bcl-2
family members such as Bax [37]. The Bax present in the cytosol
under normal conditions fosters the loss of DYm and releases
cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) from mitochon-
dria after its introduction into the mitochondrial compartment
[26]. Indeed, mitochondrial translocation of Bax was observed in
macrophages treated with HBHA, and the interaction of HBHA
with mitochondria resulted in cytochrome c release in murine
macrophages. However, Bax translocation may not be essential for
mitochondrial
dysfunction
by
HBHA,
as
evidenced
by
a
mitochondrial cell-free assay in which HBHA caused DYm loss
and cytochrome c release in vitro. Not surprisingly, we observed the
activation of caspases 3 and 9 and subsequent cleavage of PARP
after incubation of macrophages with HBHA. In contrast, we
found no evidence of cytosolic or nuclear translocation of AIF
induced by HBHA (data not shown), indicating that it is not
involved in HBHA-induced cell death. ROS generation with DYm
modulation and caspase-9 activation is known to be a major
component of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis [38]. ROS
are predominantly produced in the mitochondria and lead to the
modulation of DYm, which finally results in apoptosis [39]. Our
results indicate that HBHA induces macrophage
apoptosis
through ROS generation and DYm collapse, suggesting that these
play an essential role in HBHA-induced apoptosis.

Our
results
indicate
that
cellular
entry
is
essential
for
mitochondria-mediated apoptotic effect of HBHA, although the
mechanism by which HBHA internalized by host cells remains
unresolved. In A549 cells infected with M. tuberculosis but not cells
incubated with purified HBHA, the severe DYm collapse and the
presence of intracellular HBHA in mitochondrial compartment
were observed. There was a significant increase in the percentage
of cells with intact DYm, when A549 cells were infected with the
mutant strain lacking HBHA gene. We cannot rule out that these
results might come from decreased number of mycobacteria in
cells, because invasion of A549 cells, but not macrophages, by
HBHA-deficient strain compared with parental strain was reduced
[19]. Moreover, HBHA induced DYm loss and cytochrome c
release in purified mitochondria from not only RAW 264.7 cells
but also mouse liver (data not shown). Thus, no impact on viability
of epithelial cells treated with HBHA might be due to the absence
of intracellular this protein.
What host molecules physically and functionally interact with
intracellular HBHA and how do they then induce mitochondrial
dysfunction? In the present study, proteinase K digestion in vitro
showed that intracellularly inserted HBHA is attached to the
mitochondrial surface but is not imported into mitochondria,
indicating that HBHA probably interacts with integral outer
membrane molecules. Several mitochondria-targeted proteins
encoded by pathogens interact with voltage-dependent anion
channel (VDAC). The porin B from N. meningitidis is a VDAC-
targeted protein [40]. Hepatitis B virus X protein also co-localizes
to mitochondria where it interacts with a particular VDAC
isoform, HVDAC3 [41]. Anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2
family, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are located in mitochondrial
membranes where they inhibit cytochrome c release from
mitochondria and thereby prevent downstream caspase activation.
Pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, such as Bax, can
translocate into mitochondria and induce MMP [42]. These Bcl-2-
like proteins can be prominent targets of bacterial proteins [30,43].
Recombinant HBHA used in the present study was a His-tagged
fusion protein. To determine the interaction between HBHA and
VDAC or the Bcl-2 family proteins, HBHA and interacting
molecules were purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography,
followed by immunoblotting against them. However, HBHA
showed no direct interaction with VDAC or Bcl-2 family members
(data not shown). In addition, the possibility of HBHA nonspecific
binding to mitochondria cannot be excluded. The C-terminal
region of HBHA contains several cationic lysine-rich repeats
where methylation can occur [44]. This region may work like
natural antibiotic peptides which form cationic residues on one
end and interact with anionic molecules such as phospholipids to
disrupt negatively charged membranes and result in apoptosis
[45].
Virulent
M.
tuberculosis
induces
necrosis
of
the
infected
macrophages by inhibiting the repair process of plasma mem-
brane; this leads to cellular lysis and reinforces the spreading to the
adjacent infection sites [46–48]. Recent reports suggested that
high intracellular burden of virulent M. tuberculosis induces host cell
death via a new caspase-independent apoptotic pathway involved
in the bacterial escape and extracellular replication [49,50].
Because gain of function mutation in HBHA enhanced the
apoptogenic potency of M. smegmatis (Figure 7C), it is plausible that
HBHA may be the factor that allows M. tuberculosis to escape from
the infected macrophages at high intracellular burden. However,
similar levels of apoptosis were observed between macrophages
infected with M. tuberculosis H37Rv wild type and mutant disrupted
in hbhA at an MOI of 25 but not low MOIs (Figure S2A). Further,
HBHA deficiency had no influence on the macrophage necrosis
caused by M. tuberculosis at both low and high MOIs (Figure S2B),
indicating no involvement of HBHA in bacterial escape from the
macrophages at an early stage of infection.
Studies
on
the
comparison
of
virulent
and
attenuated
mycobacterial strains have demonstrated that the latter has much
stronger apoptotic activity in macrophages. This concept is
supported by the identification of genes that inhibit apoptosis of
host cells [51–53]. In this sense, our claims that HBHA targets to

the mitochondria of host cells in the induction of apoptosis may be
confusing. However, there is cumulative evidence suggesting that
virulent M. tuberculosis induces host cell apoptosis. Furthermore, the
transcriptional profiling of cells infected with virulent M. tuberculosis
showed increases in the expression of both pro- and anti-apoptotic
genes [54,55]. Collectively, it is highly likely that M. tuberculosis
infection results in pro- and anti-apoptotic response of host cells.
The final outcome may depend on the nature and activation status
of the host cell. Although the pro-apoptotic response is inarguably
beneficial to the host, it may provide a favorable circumstance for
the induction of necrotic cell death and subsequent bacterial
escape to the adjacent cells, which may provide a clue for HBHA
function during M. tuberculosis infection [46,49,50].
Taken together, the present study suggests the possibility that
the M. tuberculosis HBHA may be an apoptosis-inducing factor of
mycobacteria, although the molecular mechanism by which
HBHA causes loss of DYm remains unknown. Future work should
focus on the exploration of host targets of HBHA and the
mechanism by which HBHA modulates DYm and cytochrome c
release in detail, as well as identification of the HBHA domain
essential for its activity in mitochondrial dysfunction.

The anti-PARP and anti-b-actin, anti-Bax, and anti-Tom40
antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA). Antibodies against cytochrome c (for immunofluores-
cence, clone 6H2.B4; for Western blot analysis, clone 7H8.2C12)
were acquired from BD Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), and the
anti-cytochrome oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) antibody was
purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Dichlorodihydrofluor-
escein diacetate (H2DCFDA), DAPI, and DiOC6 were obtained
from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) and zVAD-fmk and NAC
were purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).
Recombinant HBHA protein, Native Ag85 protein, anti-
HBHA, and mycobacterial strains
Mycobacterium smegmatis strains, recombinant HBHA protein
from M. smegmatis, and antiserum to HBHA were produced and
prepared as described previously [22]. Ag85 was purified from the
culture filtrate protein of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (ATCC 27294), as
previously described by Lim et al [24]. Parental and mutant (hbhA
deletion) Mycobacterium tuberculosis 103 were kindly provided by Dr.
Camille Locht (Institut Pasteur de Lille, Lille, France) [19]. HBHA
proteins were used in experiments after lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
inactivation with polymyxin B (Invivogen, San Diego, CA), a
known pharmacological antagonist of LPS.
Cell culture
RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line and A549 human
alveolar epithelial cell line were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Lonza, Walkersville, MD) supplement-
ed with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone, Logan, UT), 1%
HEPES, and 1% L-glutamine at 37uC with 5% CO2. BMDMs
were obtained from 6–8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice. Briefly,
bone marrow cells from the femur and tibia were cultured in
DMEM that contained 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin,
100 mg/mL streptomycin, 10% FBS, and 25 ng/mL recombinant
mouse M-CSF (R&D system, Minneapolis, MN) at 37uC with 5%
CO2. After 4 days, non-adherent cells were removed and
differentiated macrophages were incubated in antibiotic-free
DMEM until use.
Bax siRNA transfection
One day before transfection, RAW 264.7 cells were plated and
grown at 37uC to 70% confluency in complete medium without
antibiotics in 6 well plates. One micrograms of a Bax siRNA
(Bioneer, Deajeon, Korea, sense: CCGGCGAAUUGGAGAU-
GAA; anti-sense: UUCAUCUCCAAUUGGCCGG) or a non-
complementary siRNA were transiently transfected into RAW
264.7 using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
DNA fragmentation assay (Apoptosis ELISA)
Cells were seeded in 96-well flat-bottom culture plates. After
incubation with recombinant HBHA proteins, cells were collected,
washed with PBS, and processed for quantification of cytoplasmic
histone-associated DNA fragments formed during apoptosis using
an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Cell Death Detection
ELISA PLUS; Roche Diagnostic) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay
The release of LDH from RAW 264.7 cells incubated with
recombinant HBHA or from BMDMs infected with M. tuberculosis was
measured using a Cytotoxicity Detection Kit plus (Roche, Indianapolis,
IN) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Relative cytotoxicity was
calculated using the following equation: Cytotoxicity (%) = % of LDH
released from the infected cells/maximum LDH released.
Assessment of DYm
DYm was assessed by measuring retention of the lipophilic
cationic dye DiOC6 in mitochondria. Cells were harvested and
incubated in a DiOC6 solution (10 nM in fresh medium) for
20 min at 37uC in the dark. The cells were then washed and
resuspended in PBS. Immediately after PBS washing, DYm was
measured by sorting the cells using FACSCanto (BD Biosciences).
Dead cells were excluded by forward and side-scatter gating. Data
were acquired by analyzing an average population of 10 000 cells
using CELLQuest software (BD Biosciences).
Immunofluorescence microscopy
Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips in 12-well plates. Nuclear
changes were analyzed by DAPI staining. After cells were
incubated with HBHA for the indicated times, they were fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated with DAPI (10 mg/mL)
for 10 min in the dark. The nuclei of stained cells were visualized
using an Olympus BX50 fluorescence microscope (Olympus
Optical Co., Hamburg, Germany). To determine the localization
of cytochrome c or Bax, cells treated with HBHA were incubated
in pre-warmed medium containing 100 nM of Mitotracker Red
(Molecular Probes), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized
with 0.1% Triton X-100, and then stained with anti-cytochrome c
or
anti-Bax
and
Alexa-488-conjugated
secondary
antibody
(Jackson Immuno Research Laboratories) before confocal micros-
copy. The subcellular localization of HBHA was analyzed using a
confocal microscope (LSM510 META; Carl Zeiss). The cells
incubated with Mitotracker Red were fixed, permeabilized, and
stained with an anti-HBHA antibody followed by a fluorophore-
conjugated antibody (anti-mouse IgG Alexa-488). After DAPI
staining, cells were imaged with a confocal microscope.
Mitochondrial and cytosolic fractionation
Subcellular fractionation was performed as previously described
[56]. Briefly, cells were incubated on ice for 5 min in 100 mL of ice
cold CLAMI buffer (200 mM sucrose, 70 mM KCl, 200 mg/mL
digitonin in PBS) and centrifuged at 1,000 6 g for 5 min at 4uC.
The supernatants (cytosolic fractions) were stored at 280uC and
the pellets were resuspended in 50 mL of IP buffer (50 mM Tris-
Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 0.2%
Triton X-100, 0.3% NP-40) containing protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN) and incubated
on ice for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged at 10 000 6g for
5 min at 4uC and the supernatants (mitochondrial fractions) were
stored at 280uC until use in further experiments.
Immunoblot analysis
Cells were detached, centrifuged, and lysed in lysis buffer
(10 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton
X-100,
1 mM
PMSF,
protease
inhibitor
cocktail).
Protein
concentrations were determined with the Bradford assay and
30 mg of protein was separated with SDS-PAGE, followed by
electrotransfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL;
Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were probed with
primary antibodies at optimized concentrations followed by
horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The
enhanced
chemiluminescence
system
(ECL;
Amersham/GE
Healthcare) followed by exposure to chemiluminescence film was
used to visualize proteins.

Measurement of ROS
Intracellular ROS were evaluated through staining cells with
H2DCFDA. Cells were incubated in 10 mM H2DCFDA for
30 min at 37uC, washed, and detached. Resuspended cells were
washed and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry using
FACSCanto. At least 10,000 cells per sample were analyzed using
CellQuest Pro acquisition and analysis software.
Mitochondrial cell-free assay
Mitochondria were isolated from 1 6 108 RAW 264.7 cells as
described previously [57]. Briefly, cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 600 6 g and resuspended in ice-cold IB buffer
(10 mM Tris-MOPS, 200 mM sucrose, 1 mM EGTA/Tris,
pH 7.4). All subsequent centrifugations were performed at 4uC.
The cells were then homogenized with 35 strokes in a glass potter
after incubation for 10 min on ice. Cell debris was removed by
centrifugation at 600 6g for 10 min, and then the supernatant was
centrifuged for 10 min at 7 000 6 g to precipitate mitochondria.
The pellet was then resuspended in EB buffer (10 mM Tris-
MOPS, 125 mM KCl, 100 mM EGTA/Tris, 1 mM KH2PO4,
pH 7.4). An aliquot of the preparation was incubated with HBHA
for 1 h at 37uC and centrifuged for 10 min at 7 000 6 g. The
pellet containing mitochondria was resuspended in the same buffer
and stained with DiOC6. An average population of 50 000
mitochondria was analyzed by flow cytometry. Alternatively, the
proteins contained in the supernatant were concentrated with by
ultrafiltration using a 3-kDa cutoff Centricon device (Amicon,
Millipore, Bellerica, MA). Immunoblot analysis for cytochrome c
was performed as described above.
Statistical analysis
The data represent the mean 6 standard deviation (SD) from at
least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were
performed using unpaired Student’s t tests with Bonferroni
adjustment. A P-value of ,0.05 was considered significant.
