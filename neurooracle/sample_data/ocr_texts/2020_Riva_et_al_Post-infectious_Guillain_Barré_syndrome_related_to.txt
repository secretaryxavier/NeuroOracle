Dear Sirs,
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2) outbreak emerged in December 2019 in South-
Eastern China and rapidly spreaded throughout the globe. 
Lombardy (and the city of Milan) is one of the hardest-hit 
regions of Italy. Although fever and respiratory symptoms 
are the core presenting features of coronavirus disease 2019 
(COVID-19), there is an increasing awareness of neurologi-
cal manifestations as an important factor for the prognosis 
[1]. We report a patient with a post-infectious Guillain–Barré 
syndrome (GBS) associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
On 13 April 2020, a man in his sixties, living in the urban 
area of Milan, referred to our emergency department com-
plaining a three-day history of progressive limb weakness 
and distal paresthesia at four-limbs. His past medical history 
was unremarkable. Twenty days before he had developed 
fever (37.7–38.5 °C), headache and myalgia followed by 
anosmia and ageusia (Fig. 1). He was, therefore, prescribed 
a home self-isolation protocol until symptom resolution. He 
recovered within about ten days, except for the persistence of 
mild ageusia. At admission, vital signs and general exami-
nation were normal. Neurological examination disclosed 
moderate proximal muscle weakness (Medical Research 
Council Grade 3–4/5) and severe vibratory sensation and 
proprioception deﬁcit at lower limbs. Deep tendon reﬂexes 
were absent. Cell blood count, C-reactive protein, creatine 
phosphokinase, arterial blood gases, renal and hepatic func-
tion tests were normal. Anti-ganglioside antibodies tested 
negative. Serum levels of interleukin-6 [93.1 pg/ml; (ref-
erence 0–7 pg/ml)], ferritin [1040 ng/ml (30–400 ng/ml)], 
lactic dehydrogenase [281 U/l (125–220 U/l)] and ﬁbrino-
gen [525 mg/dl (150–400 mg/dl)] were elevated. Chest CT 
scan showed bilateral ground-glass opacities, consistent with 
COVID-19 pneumonia. Two nasal swabs tested negative for 
SARS-CoV-2. Cervical spine MRI ruled out lesions of the 
cervical cord [2]. CSF testing (day 3) showed normal cell 
count and protein levels. Polymerase-chain reaction for EBV, 
CMV, VZV, HSV 1–2, HIV and SARS-CoV2 on CSF tested 
negative. Nerve conduction studies (day 5) showed reduced 
conduction velocities, reduced sensory action potential and 
compound motor action potential (cMAP) amplitudes with 
sural nerve sparing and abnormal temporal dispersion of 
peroneal nerves cMAP, indicating an acute inﬂammatory 
demyelinating polyneuropathy (Table 1) [3]. We started a 
5-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin at 0.4 g/kg 
daily. A thorough serological analysis ruled out other causes 
of atypical pneumonia. As soon as available, SARS-CoV-2 
IgG tested positive [DiaSorin LIAISON system: 81.2 AU/
ml (< 12 AU/ml)]. Muscle weakness worsened and rapidly 
spread distally and to thoracic and cranial nerves causing 
facial diplegia, hypophonia and dysarthria. The time from 
symptoms onset to nadir was 10 days, followed by a slow 
improvement; no ventilation or feeding tube support was 
required. 
Few cases of GBS have already been reported in con-
comitance with SARS-CoV-2 infection [4–6]. While epi-
demiological data and radiological ﬁndings guided our

presumptive diagnosis of SARS-CoV2, serological tests 
proved essential for its conﬁrmation. Therefore, despite 
the negativity of two repeated nasal swabs, we were able 
to implement appropriate isolation precautions. The timing 
of the onset of neurological symptoms, together with the 
negativity of oropharyngeal swabs and the demonstration 
of a SARS-CoV2 IgG response, are all in support of a post-
infective immune-mediated disease mechanism. Recent 
evidence suggests that although the immune response 
seems crucial to control and resolve the viral infection, an 
excessive, dysregulated inﬂammatory response may also 
be detrimental. Increased levels of IL-6, as detected in 
our patient, and other pro-inﬂammatory cytokines, referred 
to as “cytokine storm”, are considered a hallmark of this 
aberrant reaction [7]. GBS has a recognized dysimmune 
pathogenesis, mediated by the antibody response. There-
fore, we might speculate that also other neurological or 
extra-neurological SARS-CoV-2-related manifestations 
might share similar pathogenic mechanisms, suggesting 
tailored therapeutic approaches for subgroup of patients.
