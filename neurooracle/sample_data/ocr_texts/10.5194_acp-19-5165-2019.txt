Abstract. In this work we couple the HTAP_v2.2 global air
pollutant emission inventory with the global source recep-
tor model TM5-FASST to evaluate the relative contributions
of the major anthropogenic emission sources (power genera-
tion, industry, ground transport, residential, agriculture and
international shipping) to air quality and human health in
2010. We focus on particulate matter (PM) concentrations
because of the relative importance of PM2.5 emissions in
populated areas and the well-documented cumulative nega-
tive effects on human health. We estimate that in 2010, de-
pending on the region, annual averaged anthropogenic PM2.5
concentrations varied between ca. 1 and 40 µg m−3, with
the highest concentrations observed in China and India, and
lower concentrations in Europe and North America. The rela-
tive contribution of anthropogenic emission sources to PM2.5
concentrations varies between the regions. European PM pol-
lution is mainly inﬂuenced by the agricultural and residential
sectors, while the major contributing sectors to PM pollu-
tion in Asia and the emerging economies are the power gen-
eration, industrial and residential sectors. We also evaluate
the emission sectors and emission regions in which pollution
reduction measures would lead to the largest improvement
on the overall air quality. We show that air quality improve-
ments would require regional policies, in addition to local-
and urban-scale measures, due to the transboundary features
of PM pollution. We investigate emission inventory uncer-
tainties and their propagation to PM2.5 concentrations, in or-
der to identify the most effective strategies to be implemented
at sector and regional level to improve emission inventories,
knowledge and air quality modelling. We show that the un-
certainty of PM concentrations depends not only on the un-
certainty of local emission inventories, but also on that of
the surrounding regions. Countries with high emission un-
certainties are often impacted by the uncertainty of pollution
coming from surrounding regions, highlighting the need for
effective efforts in improving emissions not only within a re-
gion but also from extra-regional sources. Finally, we prop-
agate emission inventory uncertainty to PM concentrations
and health impacts. We estimate 2.1 million premature deaths
per year with an uncertainty of more than 1 million prema-
ture deaths per year due to the uncertainty associated only
with the emissions.

Introduction
Ambient particulate matter pollution ranks among the top
ﬁve risk factors globally for loss of healthy life years and is
the largest environmental risk factor (Lim et al., 2013; Ander-
son et al., 2012; Anenberg et al., 2009; Cohen et al., 2017).
The World Health Organization (WHO, 2016) reported about
3 million premature deaths worldwide attributable to am-
bient air pollution in 2012. Health impacts of air pollution
can be attributed to different anthropogenic emission sec-
tors (power generation, industry, residential, transport, agri-
culture, etc.) and sector-speciﬁc policies could effectively
reduce health impacts of air pollution. These policies are
usually implemented under national legislation (Henneman
et al., 2017; Morgan, 2012), while in Europe transbound-
ary air pollution is also addressed by the regional proto-
col under the UNECE Convention on Long-Range Trans-
boundary of Air Pollution (CLRTAP). At city and local level,
several studies have been developed to assess the contribu-
tion of sector-speciﬁc emissions to PM2.5 (particulate mat-

ter with a diameter less than 2.5 µm) concentrations with
the aim of designing air quality plans at local and regional
level (Karagulian et al., 2015; Thunis et al., 2016). Indeed,
particulate matter can travel thousands of kilometres, cross-
ing national borders, oceans and even continents (HTAP,
part A, Dentener et al., 2010). Local, regional and interna-
tional coordination is therefore needed to deﬁne air pollution
policies to improve global air quality and possibly human
health. The CLRTAP’s Task Force on Hemispheric Trans-
port of Air Pollution looks at the long-range transport of air
pollutants in the Northern Hemisphere, to identify promis-
ing mitigation measures to reduce background pollution lev-
els and their contribution to pollution in rural as well as
urban regions. Although primary PM2.5 and intermediately
lived (days-to-weeks) precursor gases can travel over long
distances, the transboundary components of anthropogenic
PM are mainly associated with secondary aerosols which
are formed in the atmosphere through complex chemical re-
actions and gas-to-aerosol transformation, transport and re-
moval processes of gaseous precursors transported out of
source regions (Maas and Grennfelt, 2016). However, the
most extreme episodes of exposure often occur under ex-
tended periods of low wind speeds and atmospheric stabil-
ity, favouring the formation of secondary aerosols close to
the source regions. Secondary aerosol from anthropogenic
sources consists of both inorganic – mainly ammonium ni-
trate and ammonium sulfate and ammonium bisulfate and
associated water, formed from emissions of sulfur dioxide
(SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ammonia (NH3) – and or-
ganic compounds involving thousands of compounds and of-
ten poorly known reactions (Hallquist et al., 2009). Exposure
to and impact from aerosols on humans can be estimated by
a variety of approaches, ranging from epidemiological stud-
ies to pure modelling approaches. The Burnett et al. (2014)
risk–response methodology is often used in models to esti-
mate premature deaths (PDs) due to air pollution exposure,
e.g. in Lelieveld et al. (2015) and Silva et al. (2016), who
report a global mortality in 2010 due to air quality issues
induced by anthropogenic emissions of 2.5 and 2.2 million
people, respectively. A higher global mortality is found in a
more recent work by Cohen et al. (2017), who account for
3.9 million premature deaths per year due to different model
assumptions. In Europe, Brant et al. (2013) estimate 680 000
premature deaths, which is twice as high as the numbers re-
ported for the CAFE (Clean Air for Europe) study (Watkiss
et al., 2005). Recently, using the same emission database as
in this study, Im et al. (2018) report a multi-model mean es-
timate of PD of 414 000 (range 230–570 000) for Europe and
160 000 PDs for the USA. At the global scale, models, in
some cases using satellite information (Brauer et al., 2015;
Van Donkelaar et al., 2016), are the most practical source
of information of exposure to air pollution. However, model
calculations are subject to a range of uncertainties related to
incomplete understanding of transport, chemical transforma-
tion, removal processes and, not least, emission information.
This work is developed in the context of the TF HTAP
Phase 2 (Galmarini et al., 2017), where a number of
models are deployed to assess long-range sensitivities to
extra-regional emissions, using the same HTAP_v2.2 an-
thropogenic emission inventory (Janssens-Maenhout et al.,
2015). Differences in model results illustrate uncertainties
in model formulations of transport, chemistry and removal
processes and are addressed in separate studies (Liang et
al., 2018), but not of uncertainties in emission inventories.
The objectives and novelties of this study are the evalua-
tion of (i) the relative contribution of anthropogenic emis-
sion sources to PM2.5 concentrations at global scale, (ii) the
emission sectors and emission regions in which pollution re-
duction measures would lead to the largest improvement on
the overall air quality, and (iii) the relevance of uncertain-
ties in regional sectorial emission inventories (power genera-
tion, industry, ground transport, residential, agriculture and
international shipping), and their propagation in modelled
PM2.5 concentrations and associated impacts on health. This
work applies the global source–receptor model TM5-FASST
(TM5-FAst Scenario Screening Tool), which is extensively
described and evaluated in this special issue (Van Dingenen
et al., 2018), and couples it to the HTAP_v2.2 global emis-
sion inventory for the year 2010 to estimate global air quality
and associated health impacts in terms of PM2.5 concentra-
tions. The regional and global scale and the focus on annual
PM2.5 and associated health metrics warrant the use of the
TM5-FASST model. However, the most extreme episodes of
pollution may occur at more local-to-regional scales, justify-
ing the need for local measures. For instance, a recent study
performed over hundreds of cities in Europe (Thunis et al.,
2017) shows that in order to comply with the standards pre-
scribed by the Air Quality Directives and the health guide-
lines by WHO, local actions at the city scale are needed.
Speciﬁcally, we show that the impact of emission inven-
tory uncertainty on mortality estimates is comparable with
the range of uncertainty induced by air quality models and
population exposure functions. We also investigate the un-
certainties in PM2.5 from within the region to extra-regional
contributions. Based on our analysis of the importance of
emission uncertainties at sector and regional level on PM2.5,
we aim at informing local, regional and hemispheric air qual-
ity policy makers on the potential impacts of sectors with
larger uncertainties (e.g. residential and agriculture) or re-
gions (e.g. developing and emerging countries).

Methodology
2.1
TM5-FASST model and emission perturbations
This work is an application of the TM5-FASST model, which
is extensively documented in a companion publication in this
special issue. Van Dingenen et al. (2018) provide an exten-
sive evaluation of the model, model assumptions and perfor-

mance with regard to the linearity and additivity of concen-
tration response to different size of emission perturbations
and future emission scenarios. Below we summarise the most
important features of relevance for this work and refer for
more detail to Van Dingenen et al. (2018).
In order to calculate PM2.5 concentrations correspond-
ing to the HTAP_v2.2 emissions, we use the native 1◦× 1◦
resolution source–receptor grid maps obtained for TM5-
FASST_v0 (Van Dingenen et al., 2018). The TM5-FASST
source–receptor model is based on a set of emission per-
turbation experiments (−20 %) of SO2, NOx, CO, NH3,
and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and CH4 using the
global 1◦× 1◦resolution TM5 model, the meteorological
year 2001 (which was also used for the HTAP Phase 1 ex-
periments) and the community emission dataset prepared
for the IPCC AR5 report (RCP, Representative Concentra-
tion Pathway) for the year 2000 (Lamarque et al., 2010).
TM5-FASST uses aggregated regional emissions (i.e. one
annual emission value per pollutant or precursor for each
of the 56 regions + shipping), with an implicit underlying
1◦× 1◦resolution emission spatial distribution from RCP
year 2000 which was partly based EDGAR methodology and
grid maps. The concentration of PM2.5 contributing from and
to each of 56 receptor regions is estimated as a linear function
of the emissions of the source regions, including the aerosol
components BC, primary organic matter (POM), SO4, NO3,
and NH4. While secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from nat-
ural sources is included in the model calculations using the
parameterisation described in Dentener et al. (2006), no ex-
plicit treatment of anthropogenic SOA is considered, since
no reliable emission inventories of SOA precursor gases was
available, and formation processes were not included in the
parent TM5 model. A recent study by Farina et al. (2010) in-
dicates a global source of 1.6 Tg, or ca. 5.5 % of the overall
SOA formation due to anthropogenic SOA. The relative im-
portance of anthropogenic SOA varies widely by region, and
is deemed higher in regions with fewer VOC emission con-
trols. Inclusion of SOA would possibly lead to a somewhat
larger role of the transboundary pollution transport (Farina et
al., 2010; Peng et al., 2016; Shiraiwa et al., 2017), mainly for
regions and sectors with large PM and VOC emissions (e.g.
residential, and to some extent transport and industry).
Under the assumption that the individual sector contribu-
tions add up linearly to total PM2.5 – this assumption is eval-
uated in Van Dingenen et al. (2018) and holds in most regions
within 15 % error – the comparison of PM2.5 concentrations
calculated for the reference and scenario case yields an esti-
mation of the contribution of each sector to total PM2.5 con-
centrations.
Speciﬁcally, the reduced-form model TM5-FASST is
computing the concentration resulting from an arbitrary pre-
cursor emission strength Ei using a ﬁrst-order perturba-
tion approach, i.e. for each PM component j, the change
in concentration dPMj resulting from a change in emission
strength Ei (x) of precursor i in source region x, relative to a
reference emission Ei,ref (x), is approximated by the ﬁrst lin-
ear term of a Taylor expansion of PM as a function of emis-
sions:
dPMj (y) ∼= Aij

is a set of independently computed source–
receptor matrices, expressing the linearised emission–
concentration response between each relevant precursor (i)
emission and PM component j concentration, for each pair
of source (x) and receptor (y) regions (Van Dingenen et al.,
2018).
In Sect. S1.2 we explain in detail how Eq. (1) can also
be applied for evaluating the attribution by sector as well
as by source region, based on the work by Van Dingenen
et al. (2018). Thus to calculate total PM2.5 concentration
in each receptor region, the 56 source regions’ individual
contributions must be summed. Using this approach, it is
possible to evaluate the PM2.5 concentrations from “within-
region” and “extra-regional” PM2.5 emissions. The extra-
regional contribution represents the RERER metric (Re-
sponse to Extra-Regional Emission Reduction) for a speciﬁc
region used across the whole HTAP experiment (Galmarini et
al., 2017), in particular focusing on the PM2.5 concentration
reduction due to the contribution of the emissions of each
anthropogenic sector (Eq. 3):
RERER =

where R represents the concentration response to each sector
emission decrease.
As depicted in Fig. S1 in the Supplement, the 56 TM5-
FASST regions cover the entire globe, but their areal extent
differs in terms of size, population, emission magnitude and
presence of neighbouring countries (e.g. Europe comprises
18 TM5-FASST regions). In order to make the evaluation
of external impacts on smaller regions (e.g. European coun-
tries) comparable to those of larger regions (like the USA,
China and India), in this work an aggregation procedure to
10 world regions (refer to Table S2 in the Supplement) has
been applied (China+, India+, SE Asia, North America, Eu-
rope, Oceania, Latin America, Africa, Russia and the Mid-
dle East). In this work we focus on particulate matter due to
its negative effects on human health (WHO, 2013; Pope and
Dockery, 2006; Worldbank, 2016). The TM5-FASST model
includes an assessment of the premature mortality due to am-
bient PM2.5 concentrations on an exposed population follow-
ing the methodology developed by Burnett et al. (2014), as
discussed in Sect. 4. Health impacts due to indoor air pollu-
tion or ozone are not evaluated in this work.

M. Crippa et al.: Contribution and uncertainty of sectorial and regional emissions
In the following, we will address the uncertainty of sector-
speciﬁc emissions from this inventory in a quantitative way
as well as the differences we observe from one region to the
other, based on the uncertainty of activity data and emission
factors. As discussed in the next section, the reason to use
HTAP_v2.2, and not for example the RCP2000 as the basis
for our assessment of emission propagation is that the TF
HTAP aims at bringing policy-relevant information, and to
this end, it has compiled a policy-relevant emission inventory
(HTAP_v2.2) for the most recently available year. While the
RCP2000 was at the basis of the FASST calculations, and
presented the best community emissions effort at the time,
the HTAP_v2.2 inventory is now much more accurate, in par-
ticular given the focus on regional emission analysis of our
work.
2.2
HTAP_v2.2 emissions
The global anthropogenic emission inventory HTAP_v2.2 for
the year 2010 (Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2015) is input to
the global source–receptor model TM5-FASST to evaluate
PM2.5 concentrations for each world region/country with the
corresponding health effects. The HTAP_v2.2 inventory in-
cludes for most countries ofﬁcial and semi-ofﬁcial annual an-
thropogenic emissions of SO2, NOx, CO (carbon monoxide),
NMVOC (non-methane volatile organic compounds), PM10
(particulate matter with a diameter less than 10 µm) PM2.5,
BC (black carbon) and OC (organic carbon) by country
and sector (Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2015). Here we focus
on the six major anthropogenic emission sectors contribut-
ing to global PM2.5 concentrations, namely the power gen-
eration (“power”), non-power industry, industrial processes
and product use (“industry”), ground transportation (“trans-
port”), residential combustion and waste disposal (“residen-
tial”), agriculture (“agriculture”), and international shipping
(“ship”). International and domestic aviation emissions are
not considered in this study due to the lower contribution
to air pollution compared to other anthropogenic sectors. It
should be noted that agricultural emissions do not include
agricultural waste burning and forest and savannah ﬁres. De-
tails on the emissions included in each aggregated sector can
be found in Janssens-Maenhout et al. (2015). In addition to
the reference HTAP_v2.2 emissions for the year 2010, a set
of emission perturbation scenarios has been created by sub-
tracting from the reference dataset the emissions of each sec-
tor.
2.3
Emission inventory uncertainties
In order to investigate how computed PM2.5 concentrations
are affected by the uncertainty of emission inventories, we
perform a sensitivity analysis testing the upper and lower
range of HTAP_v2.2 emissions including their uncertainties.
Aggregated emissions of a certain pollutant p, from a sector
i and country c, are calculated as the product of activity data
(AD) and emission factors (EFs); therefore the correspond-
ing uncertainty (σi,c,p) is calculated as following:
σEMIi,c,p =
q
σ 2
ADi,c + σ 2
EFi,p,c,
(4)
where σAD and σEF are the uncertainties (%) of the activ-
ity data and emission factors for a certain sector (i), coun-
try (c) and pollutant (p). Uncertainty values of the activity
data by sector and country are obtained from Table 2 of
Janssens-Maenhout et al. (2017) and Olivier et al. (2016).
Using this approach, the uncertainty in the global total an-
thropogenic CO2 emissions is estimated to range from −9 %
to +9 % (95 % conﬁdence interval), with larger uncertainties
of about ±15 % for non-Annex I countries, and uncertainties
of less than ±5 % are obtained for the 1990 OECD countries1
for the time series from 1990 (Olivier et al., 2016) reported
to UNFCCC. Uncertainty values for the emission factors of
gaseous pollutants are retrieved from the EMEP/EEA Guide-
book (2013) and Bond et al. (2004) for particulate matter. In
this work we assume that reported countries’ emissions are
based on independent estimations of activity data and EFs,
and hence no cross-country correlation structure is assumed.
This is in contrast to bottom-up gridded emission inventories
like EDGAR, where the use of global activity datasets may
lead to correlated errors between countries.
Therefore, we can calculate the overall uncertainty σEMIp,c
with the following equation (EMEP/EEA, 2013).
σEMIp,c =
v
u
u
tX
i

σEMIi,c,p · EMIi,c,p
EMItot,c,p
2
,
(5)
where EMIi,c,p (in kt) represents the emission of a certain
pollutant (p) in a certain country (c) from a speciﬁc sector (i)
and EMItot,c,p (in kt) the corresponding emissions from all
sectors for that country and pollutant.
Table S3 reports the overall uncertainty calculated for each
pollutant and for each TM5-FASST region. Using an addi-
tional constraint that EFs and activities cannot be negative,
a lognormal distribution of the calculated uncertainties is as-
sumed (Bond et al., 2004). Therefore we can calculate the
upper and lower range of emission estimates, multiplying
and dividing the reference emissions by (1 + σp,c), respec-
tively. We do not account for the uncertainties of the atmo-
spheric transport model and the uncertainties due to aggre-
gation, which are larger over smaller TM5-FASST regions.
Based on the upper and lower emission range per region, new
TM5-FASST model runs have been performed per source re-
gion to retrieve the corresponding range of concentrations in
receptor regions (therefore the total number of computations
is 56 · 2 for the uncertainty analysis).

TM5-FASST modelling results
In this section, we ﬁrst provide “central” estimates of re-
gional (Sect. 3.1), sectorial (Sect. 3.2) and gridded (Sect. 3.3)
contributions, whereas the corresponding uncertainty esti-
mates are discussed from Sect. 3.4 onward.
3.1
Regional contributions to PM2.5 concentrations
Figure 1 provides a global perspective on the fraction of
within-region and extra-regional PM2.5 concentrations for
10 aggregated world receptor regions using emissions of the
year 2010, with the extra-regional fraction (using the RERER
metric) broken down into source region contributions. An-
nual average population-weighted anthropogenic PM2.5 con-
centrations (refer to Van Dingenen et al., 2018, for the calcu-
lation of this metric) range from a few µg m−3 (e.g. in Ocea-
nia or Latin America), around 7–8 µg m−3 for North America
and Europe, up to 33–39 µg m−3 in China+ (including also
Mongolia) and India+ (including also the rest of south Asia).
Anthropogenic PM2.5 pollution in China+ and India+ is
mainly affected by large emission sources within the country
(98 % and 96 %, respectively; RERER 2 %–4 %), although
4 % of the Indian anthropogenic PM2.5 pollution is mainly
transported from the Gulf region and the Middle East, as was
also observed by Venkataraman et al. (2018). North America
(98 %) and Oceania (98 %) are mainly inﬂuenced by within-
regional pollution due to their geographical isolation from
other regions. TM5-FASST computations attribute 11 % of
the PM2.5 in Europe to extra-regional sources; for the Mid-
dle East and Gulf region extra-regional contributions amount
to 18 % (mainly from Europe and Russia), for Africa 25 %
(mainly from Europe and the Middle East), and Russia 28 %
(mainly from Europe, the Middle East and the Gulf region,
and China). Shipping emissions are not considered in this ﬁg-
ure due to their international origin, while inland waterway
emissions are still included in the ground transport sector.
Transboundary air pollution is known to be an important is-
sue in the rest of Asia, in particular for pollution transported
from China to North and South Korea and Japan (Park et al.,
2014) and we estimate that the contribution of transported
PM is up to 40 % in south-eastern Asia (mainly from China
and India). Within-region and extra-regional PM2.5 concen-
trations for all the TM5-FASST regions are reported in Ta-
ble S2.
Focusing on Europe, Fig. 2 shows within-region (in black)
vs. extra-regional absolute population-weighted PM2.5 con-
centrations (in µg m−3) for 16 EU countries plus Norway
and Switzerland, deﬁned in TM5-FASST, as well as the
source regions contributing to this pollution. Regional an-
nual averages of population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations
in Europe vary between 2 and 4 µg m−3 in northern Euro-
pean countries (like Finland, Norway and Sweden) up to
10–12 µg m−3 for continental Europe. Although most of the
computed annual average PM2.5 concentrations for Europe
are below the World Health Organization Air Quality Guide-
line of 10 µg m−3 PM2.5 (as annual average), these values
represent only regional averages while several exceedances
in urban areas are often observed in Europe. As further dis-
cussed in Sect. 3.2, an additional contribution to PM2.5 con-
centrations comes from the shipping sector, mainly inﬂuenc-
ing Mediterranean countries (like Italy, Spain and France)
and countries facing the North Sea, Baltic Sea and At-
lantic Ocean (e.g. Benelux, Sweden, Great Britain). Trans-
boundary air pollution from external regions contributes by
27 % to 75 % and on average by 51 % to PM2.5 pollution
in European countries. Countries surrounded by oceans are
mainly inﬂuenced by within-region pollution due to their
geographical isolation from other source regions (e.g. Italy,
Spain, Great Britain and Norway); therefore, the fraction
of extra-regional pollution ranges from 27 % to 35 %. The
largest extra-regional contributions are calculated for Hun-
gary (75 %, mainly from Austria, the Czech Republic, the
rest of central EU, Poland and Germany), the Czech Repub-
lic (67 %, mainly from Poland, Germany and Austria), Aus-
tria and Slovenia (66 %, mainly from the Czech Republic,
Germany and Italy), Sweden + Denmark (65 %, mainly from
Germany, Norway and Poland), Bulgaria (63 %, mainly from
Romania), and Greece (61 %).
The remaining EU countries are affected by both within-
region and extra-regional pollution (the latter ranging from
40 % to 59 %), highlighting the importance of transbound-
ary transport of PM2.5 concentrations. For example Switzer-
land is inﬂuenced by the pollution coming from France,
Italy and Germany; the rest of the central EU by Poland
and Germany; Germany by France and Benelux; and Poland
by the Czech Republic and Germany. Interestingly, Roma-
nia, Bulgaria, Greece and Hungary are also signiﬁcantly af-
fected by the pollution transported from Ukraine and Turkey,
which is included in the “rest of the world” contribution of
Fig. 2. Our results are consistent with the ﬁndings of the lat-
est UNECE Scientiﬁc Assessment Report (Maas and Grenn-
felt, 2016), which highlights the importance of transbound-
ary transport of organic and inorganic PM. As discussed in
Sect. 3.4, insights into the uncertainty of within-region and
extra-regional contributions to PM2.5 concentrations are pro-
vided in Fig. 5 for each TM5-FASST region.
3.2
Sectorial contributions to PM2.5 concentrations
Figure 3 shows the relative sectorial contributions to an-
thropogenic PM2.5 concentrations for the 56 TM5-FASST
receptor regions, separating the fraction of extra-regional
(RERER) (shaded colours) and within-region pollution,
while Table 1 shows regional average values of sector-
speciﬁc relative contributions. In most African regions (ex-
cept Egypt) anthropogenic PM2.5 concentrations are mainly
produced by emissions in the residential sector. Agriculture
is an important sector for Egypt, while northern Africa is
strongly inﬂuenced by shipping emissions in the Mediter-

ranean (30 %). PM2.5 concentrations in emerging economies
in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East are dominated by
the residential sector, power generation and industry. Asian
countries such as China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines
are mainly inﬂuenced by within-region pollution, with the
largest contributions coming from power, industry and res-
idential sectors. PM2.5 pollution in Japan is characterised
by the contribution of local sources like transport and agri-
culture, but it is also affected by transported pollution from
China, especially from the industrial sector. Anthropogenic
PM2.5 in the remaining Asian countries is inﬂuenced by more
than 50 % by the pollution coming from China (e.g. Viet-
nam, Malaysia, Thailand, Mongolia, South Korea, Taiwan)
or India (e.g. the rest of south Asia and south-eastern Asia)
from the power, industry and residential activities. A differ-
ent picture is seen for Europe where, according to our cal-
culations, annual PM concentrations stem mainly from the
agricultural and residential sectors, with a somewhat lower
contribution from the transport sector. In eastern European
countries noticeable contributions are also found from the
power and industrial sectors due to the relatively extensive
use of polluting fuels like coal. PM2.5 concentrations in USA
and Canada are mostly from the power, industry and agricul-
tural sectors. In Oceania industry and agriculture are the most
important sectors. PM2.5 from ship emissions mainly affects
coastal areas of northern Africa, SE Asia (e.g. in Japan,

Cambodia, Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Myan-
mar), Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan are rather polluted areas,
with PM2.5 concentration in the range of 6 to 14 µg m−3.
The highest annual PM2.5 concentrations in Africa are com-
puted in Egypt (11 µg m−3 as annual average), the Republic
of South Africa (6.1 µg m−3 as annual average) and western
Africa (4.0 µg m−3 as annual average). The highest pollution
in Europe is observed in the Benelux region, Italy and in
some of the eastern countries (e.g. Romania, Bulgaria and the
Czech Republic), while in Latin America the most polluted
areas are Chile (13.7 µg m−3 as annual average) and Mexico
(4.2 µg m−3 as annual average). The Middle East, the Gulf re-
gion, Turkey, Ukraine and the former USSR are also charac-
terised by PM2.5 concentrations ranging between 7.5 µg m−3
and 9.2 µg m−3 as annual averages. Table 2 reports annual

tainty range for each TM5-FASST region as discussed in
Sect. 3.4.
The TM5-FASST model (Van Dingenen et al., 2018) is
also validated against concentration estimates derived from
the WHO database and satellite-based measurements (van
Donkelaar et al., 2010, 2014). The TM5-FASST modelled
PM2.5 concentrations are compared to satellite products
which are based on aerosol optical depth measurements to-
gether with chemical transport model information to retrieve
from the total column the information of PM concentrations
in the lowest layer of the atmosphere (Boys et al., 2014; van
Donkelaar et al., 2010, 2014). The regional comparison of
annul mean population-weighted concentrations shows con-
sistent results with the satellite-based retrievals (e.g. rather
good agreement for the globe as a whole, EU and USA within
less than 15 % deviation, with lower agreement for develop-
ing and emerging countries). Section S4 in the Supplement
of the paper by van Dingenen et al. (2018) also reports the
comparison between the PM2.5 concentrations modelled by
TM5-FASST and the measured ones reported in the WHO
database, showing rather good agreement for Europe, North
America and partly for China due to the higher accuracy of
the measurements. The comparison for Latin America and
Africa is much less robust and the scatter possibly highlights
non-optimal modelling of speciﬁc sources relevant for these
regions by the TM5-FASST model (e.g. large-scale biomass
burning).
In our work, modelled PM2.5 concentrations are in the
range of the measurements and satellite-based estimates pro-
vided in several literature studies (Brauer et al., 2012, 2015;
Boys et al., 2014; Evans et al., 2013; Van Donkelaar et al.,
2016), reporting annual averaged PM2.5 concentrations for
all of Europe in the range between 11 and 17 µg m−3, for
Asia from 16 to 58 µg m−3, Latin America 7–12 µg m−3,
Africa and the Middle East 8–26 µg m−3, Oceania 6 µg m−3,
and North America 13 µg m−3 (note that measurements and
satellite estimates would not separate anthropogenic and nat-
ural sources of PM, e.g. dust, large-scale biomass burning,
while the concentrations in this study consider anthropogenic
emissions alone).
In order to understand the origin of global PM2.5 concen-
trations, we look at sector-speciﬁc maps (Fig. 4). The power
and industrial sectors are mainly contributing to PM concen-
trations in countries with emerging economies and fast de-
velopment (e.g. the Middle East, China and India), while the
ground transport sector is a more important source of PM
concentrations in industrialised countries (e.g. North Amer-
ica and Europe) and in developing Asian countries. The resi-
dential sector is an important source of PM all over the world,
also affecting indoor air quality (Ezzati, 2008; Lim et al.,
2013; Chafe et al., 2014). PM concentrations in Africa and
Asia are strongly inﬂuenced by this sector due to the incom-
plete combustion of rather dirty fuels and solid biomass de-
ployed for domestic heating and cooking purposes. Interest-
ingly, the agricultural sector is strongly affecting pollution in
Asia as well as in Europe (Backes et al., 2016; Erisman et
al., 2004) and North America, conﬁrming the ﬁndings of the
UNECE Scientiﬁc Assessment Report and several other sci-
entiﬁc publications (Maas and Grennfelt, 2016; Pozzer et al.,
2017; Tsimpidi et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008). The residen-
tial and agriculture sectors are less spatially conﬁned, and it
is more difﬁcult to regulate emissions effectively than point
source emissions of the industrial and power sectors (e.g. in
Europe the Large Combustion Plant Directive, the National
Emission Ceilings Directive, the Industrial Emissions Direc-
tive, the European emission standards for road transport).
Finally, shipping is mainly contributing to the pollution in
countries and regions with substantial coastal areas, and with
ship tracks on the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic, Paciﬁc
and Indian Oceans, as depicted in Fig. 4.

Uncertainty from emissions
3.4.1
Propagation of emission uncertainties to
anthropogenic PM2.5 concentrations
Table 2, as well as Fig. 5, report the annual average anthro-
pogenic PM2.5 concentrations (µg m−3) estimated by TM5-
FASST with the uncertainty bars representing the upper and
lower range of concentrations due to emission inventory un-
certainty. The extra-regional contribution to uncertainty is
also addressed as well as the contribution of the uncertainty
of primary particulate matter emissions to the upper range
of PM2.5 concentrations (Table 2). Primary PM emissions
represent the dominant source of uncertainties, contributing
from 45 % to 97 % to the total uncertainty in anthropogenic
PM2.5 concentrations for each country/region.
Figure 5 depicts the results of the propagation of the low-
est and highest range of emissions including their uncertainty
to PM2.5 concentrations in Asia (Fig. 5a) and – in more detail
– Europe (Fig. 5b), highlighting the contribution of within-
region and extra-regional PM2.5 concentrations and the cor-
responding uncertainties (error bars). Due to their large sizes,
Indian and Chinese PM2.5 concentrations and uncertainties
are mainly affected by uncertainties from the residential,
transport and agricultural sectors within these countries. In-
terestingly, in south-eastern and eastern Asia uncertainties in
PM2.5 are strongly inﬂuenced by the Indian residential emis-
sions. On the other hand, PM2.5 in Thailand, Japan, Taiwan,
South Korea, Mongolia and Vietnam are strongly affected by
the uncertainty in the Chinese residential and industrial emis-
sions. Consequently reducing the uncertainties in the Chi-
nese and Indian emission inventories will help in improving
the understanding of the long-range contribution of PM2.5
pollution in most Asian countries.
In Europe, the highest uncertainties in PM2.5 concentra-
tions are associated with the emissions from the residential,
agriculture and transport sectors. In most of the central and
eastern European countries modelled PM2.5 is strongly af-
fected by the uncertainty of transported extra-regional pollu-

tion, produced from the residential, agricultural and transport
sectors. Conversely, uncertainties in Norway are dominated
by national emissions, mainly from the residential and trans-
port sectors, and in Italy from the residential and agriculture
sectors. The remaining European countries are affected both
by within-country and imported uncertainties. Figure 5c rep-
resents the results of the propagation of the emissions range
including their uncertainty to PM2.5 concentrations for North
America, Latin America, Oceania and Russia, while Fig. 5d
displays emission uncertainties for Africa, the Middle East
and the Gulf region. The uncertainty in the USA agricul-
tural and residential emissions affect more than 50 % of mod-
elled Canadian PM2.5 concentrations and the uncertainty in
Mexico and Argentina is inﬂuenced by similar magnitudes
(30 %–50 %) from neighbouring countries. The uncertainty
in within-region emissions, especially from the residential
sector, dominates the overall levels of PM2.5 uncertainties in
Latin America. However, in addition, Chile’s own agriculture
and power sectors contribute signiﬁcantly to the overall un-
certainty levels. PM2.5 levels in most of the African regions
are strongly affected by the uncertainty in their own resi-
dential emissions, while in Egypt they are mostly inﬂuenced
by the agricultural sector uncertainties (refer to Fig. 5d). In-
terestingly, anthropogenic PM2.5 in northern Africa is inﬂu-
enced by uncertainties in Italian emissions as well as those
from shipping emissions. Conversely, the Middle East and
Turkey regions are inﬂuenced by a range of extra-regional
emission uncertainties (e.g. the Middle East is affected by
the uncertainty of Turkey, Egypt and the Gulf region, while
Turkey is affected by Bulgaria, the Gulf region and the rest
of the central EU).
3.4.2
Ranking the sector-speciﬁc contribution to
emission uncertainties
Figure 6 shows the average sector-relative contribution to
total emission-inventory-related uncertainty for the main
PM2.5 concentration precursors and world regions. These
contributions can be interpreted as a ranking of the most
effective improvements to be taken regionally to better
constrain their inventories and reduce the ﬁnal formation
of PM2.5 concentrations. The complete overview of all
TM5-FASST regions contributions is provided in Fig. S2,
where the share of each term of the sum of Eq. (5)

σEMIi,c,p · EMIi,c,p
EMItot,c,p

represents the sector contribution to
the uncertainty of each pollutant in each region. SO2 uncer-
tainties mainly derive from the power generation sector, es-
pecially in countries with dominant coal use; however, sub-
stantial contributions are also computed for the industrial
sector in South Africa, Asia, Norway, some Latin American
countries, Canada and Russia. Interestingly, for SO2 some
contributions are also observed from the residential sector
in Africa and from the transport sector in some Asian coun-
tries (e.g. North and South Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, south-
eastern Asia). Smith et al. (2011) report a range of regional
uncertainty for SO2 emissions up to 30 %, while our esti-
mates are slightly higher (up to 50 %). NOx emission un-
certainty mainly stems from the transport sector, although
some contributions are also seen from power generation in
Russia, countries strongly relying on gas (e.g. Russia), the
Middle East and the residential sector in Africa. Depending
on the region, CO uncertainty (not shown) is dominated by
either the transport or residential (particularly in Africa and
Asia) sectors and for some regions by a similar contribution
of these two sectors. NMVOC emission uncertainties mainly
derive from poorly characterised industrial, transport and res-
idential activities due to the complex mixture and reactivity
of such pollutants. As expected, NH3 emission uncertainty
is dominated by the agricultural sector which appears to be
less relevant for all other pollutants. Among all air pollutants,
primary PM2.5 represents one of the most uncertain pollutant
due to very different combustion conditions, different fuel
qualities and lack of control measures (Klimont et al., 2017).
Primary particulate matter emissions should be mainly im-
proved for the residential, transport and in particular indus-
trial sectors. Black carbon emission inventories should be
better characterised in Europe, Japan, North and South Ko-
rea, Malaysia etc. for the transport sector, where the higher
share of diesel used as fuel for vehicles leads to higher BC
emissions; in addition, BC emissions from the residential
sector require further effort to better deﬁne EFs for the differ-

ent type of fuels used under different combustion conditions.
To constrain and improve particulate organic matter emis-
sions, efforts should be made to improve residential emis-
sions estimates. Therefore, in the following section, we try
to assess one of the major sources of uncertainty in the resi-
dential emissions in Europe, which is the use of solid biofuel.
3.4.3
Assessing the uncertainty in household biofuel
consumption with an independent inventory in
Europe
The combustion of solid biomass (i.e. biofuel) for household
heating and cooking purposes is one of the major sources
of particulate matter emissions in the world. Wood products
and residues are widely used in the residential sector, but na-
tional reporting often underestimates the emissions from this
sector, due to the fact that often informal economic wood
sales are not accurately reﬂected in the ofﬁcial statistics of
wood consumption (AD) (Denier Van Der Gon et al., 2015).

Figure 6. Contribution of anthropogenic sectors to the emission uncertainty of various pollutants for different world regions.
An additional uncertainty is related to the lack of information
in the inventory regarding the EF variability, which depends
on the combustion efﬁciency and type of wood (Weimer et
al., 2008; Chen et al., 2012). In our work we estimate the
uncertainty attributable to wood combustion in the residen-
tial sector (σAD,RES_bio) by comparing it to the recent TNO
RWC (Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientiﬁc Re-
search, Residential Wood Combustion) inventory of Denier
van der Gon et al. (2015), which includes a revised biomass
fuel consumption with the corresponding EDGARv4.3.2 ac-
tivity data (Janssens-Maenhout et al., 2017), as shown in Ta-
ble S4. In the TNO RWC inventory, wood use for each coun-
try has been updated comparing the ofﬁcially reported per
capita wood consumption data (from GAINS, Greenhouse
Gas and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies, and IEA,
International Environmental Agency) with the expected spe-
ciﬁc wood use for a country, including the wood availability
information (Visschedijk et al., 2009; Denier Van Der Gon
et al., 2015). We can therefore assume that the TNO RWC
inventory represents an independent estimate of wood con-
sumption in the residential sector, allowing a more precise
uncertainty estimation of the AD for this sector. Assuming
that emissions are calculated as the product of AD and EF,
the corresponding uncertainty can be calculated with Eq. (4),
where σAD ranges from 5 % to 10 % for European countries
and Russia as reported for international statistics (Olivier et
al., 2016). We can therefore calculate the residential emis-
sion factors uncertainty of each individual pollutant (σEFp)
from Eq. (4). In addition, based on the comparison of the re-
cent estimates of wood consumption provided by TNO RWC
AD, which should match better with observations, and the
EDGARv4.3.2 data, we can evaluate the mean normalised
absolute error (MNAE) considering all N countries, follow-
ing Eq. (6) (Yu et al., 2006), which represents our estimate
of σAD,RES_bio.

We estimate a value of σAD,RES_bio of 38.9 %, which is much
larger compared to the 5 %–10 % uncertainty reported for the
fuel consumption of the international statistics (σAD). The is-
sue of biofuel uncertainty mainly affects rural areas where
wood is often used instead of fossil fuel. Then, using Eq. (4)
and the calculated σAD,RES_bio and σEFp, we can evaluate a
new σEMIp,RES_bio for the residential sector including the un-
certainty of the AD due to the use of wood as fuel for this
sector, as reported in Table S5. Comparing the results shown
in Table S5 with the factor-of-2 uncertainty values expected
for PM emissions from the residential sector (Janssens-
Maenhout et al., 2015), we derive that the uncertainty asso-
ciated with the emission factors for biomass combustion in
the residential sector is the dominant source of uncertainty
compared to the uncertainty in wood burning activity data.

has been noted in IEA energy statistics for some European
countries (IEA, 2016) and further increases are expected as
countries are shifting their methodologies to estimate biofuel
activity data away from fuel sales statistics to a modelling
approach based on energy demand. In addition, several EU
countries are increasing the use of biomass in order to accom-
plish the targets set in the context of the renewable energy di-
rective (2009/28/EC) as reported in their national renewable
energy action plans (http://ec.europa.eu/energy/node/71, last
access: April 2019). When comparing the UNFCCC and the
TNO RWC data, a higher value of σAD,RES_bio is obtained
(59.5 % instead of 38.9 %), although its effect on the ﬁnal
residential emission uncertainty is less strong, as shown in
Table S6. Table 3 shows the impact of biofuel combustion
uncertainty on PM2.5 concentrations in the residential sector.
Upper-end uncertainties indicate that PM2.5 concentrations
could be between 2.6 and 3.7 times larger than those derived
from the HTAP_v2.2 inventory.

Health impact assessment
Annual population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations represent
the most robust and widely used metric to analyse the long-
term impacts of particulate matter air pollution on human
mortality (Pope and Dockery, 2006; Dockery, 2009). As de-
scribed in Sects. 2.5 and S5 of the paper by Van Dingenen
et al. (2018), the mortality estimation in TM5-FASST is
based on the integrated exposure-response functions deﬁned
by Burnett et al. (2014). The increased risk from exposure to
air pollution is estimated using exposure-response functions
for ﬁve relevant causes of death, namely ischaemic heart dis-
ease (IHD), cerebrovascular disease (CD, stroke), chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer (LC)
and acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs). The relative
risk (RR) represents the proportional increase in the assessed
health outcome due to a given increase in PM2.5 concentra-
tions (Burnett et al., 2014).
In this section, we investigate the impact of total and
sector-speciﬁc anthropogenic population-weighted PM2.5
concentrations on health and we show comparisons with
mortality estimates provided by WHO and recent scientiﬁc
publications (Silva et al., 2016). Figure 7 represents the PD
distribution due to air pollution, using population-weighted
PM2.5 concentrations and representative for anthropogenic
emissions in the year 2010. The most affected areas are
China and India, but also some countries of western Africa
and urban areas in Europe (in particular in the Benelux re-
gion and eastern Europe). Our computations indicate that
annual global outdoor premature mortality due to anthro-
pogenic PM2.5 amounts to 2.1 million premature deaths, with
an uncertainty range related to emission uncertainty of 1–
3.3 million deaths per year. In our work we only evaluate how
the uncertainty of emission inventories inﬂuences the health
impact estimates focusing on the interregional aspects (i.e.
we do not evaluate effects of misallocation of sources within
regions) and not all the other sources of uncertainties, such
as the uncertainty of concentration-response estimates, of air
quality models used to estimate particulate matter concentra-
tions, etc. An overview of the propagation of the uncertainty
associated with an ensemble of air quality models to health
and crop impacts is provided by Solazzo et al. (2018). So-
lazzo et al. (2018) ﬁnd in their analysis over the European
countries a mean number of PDs due to exposure to PM2.5
and ozone of approximately 370 000 (inter-quantile range be-
tween 260 000 and 415 000). Moreover, they estimate that a
reduction in the uncertainty of the modelled ozone concen-
tration by 61 %–80 % (depending on the aggregation metric
used) and by 46 % for PM2.5 produces a reduction in the un-
certainty in premature mortality and crop loss of more than
60 %. However, we show here that the often neglected emis-
sion inventories’ uncertainty provides a range of premature
deaths of ±1.1 million at the global scale, which is of the
same order of magnitude of the uncertainty of air quality
models and concentration-response functions (Cohen et al.,
2017). In 2010, using our central estimate, 82 % of the PDs
occur in fast-growing economies and developing countries,
especially in China with 670 000 and India with an almost
equal amount of 610 000 PDs per year. Table 4 summarises
our estimates of premature mortality for aggregated world re-

Our results are comparable with Lelieveld et al. (2015) and
Silva et al. (2016) who, using the same Burnett et al. (2014)
methodology, estimate a global premature mortality of 2.5
and 2.2 million people, respectively, due to air quality in
2010 for the same anthropogenic sectors. However, a recent
work published by Cohen et al. (2017) estimates a higher
value of global mortality (3.9 million PDs per year) mainly
due to a lower minimum risk exposure level set in the expo-
sure response function, the inclusion of the urban increment
calculation and the contribution of natural sources. When
comparing mortality estimates we need to take into account
that several elements affect the results, like the resolution
of the model, the urban increment subgrid adjustment (in-
cluding information on urban and rural population; refer to
Van Dingenen et al., 2018), the inclusion or not of natural
components, the impact threshold value used, and RR func-
tions. In this study, we use the population-weighted PM2.5
concentration (excluding natural components) at 1 × 1◦res-
olution as the metric for estimating health effects due to
air pollution, with a threshold value of 5.8 µg m−3, no ur-
ban increment adjustment and relative risk functions accord-
ingly with Burnett et al. (2014). We also estimate that 7 % of
the global non-accidental mortalities from the Global Bur-
den of Disease (IHME, 2015, http://vizhub.healthdata.org/
gbd-compare, last access: April 2019; Forouzanfar et al.,
2015) are attributable to air pollution in 2010; 8.6 % of to-
tal mortality in Europe is due to air pollution, ranging from
less than 1 % up to 17 % depending on the country; similarly,
Asian premature mortality due to air quality is equal to 8.7 %
of total Asian mortality, with 10.6 % contribution in China
and 8.5 % in India. Lower values are found for African coun-
tries and Latin America where other causes of mortalities are
still dominant compared to developed countries.
Table 5 shows the number of premature deaths for each re-
ceptor region, highlighting the premature mortality induced
within the country itself and outside the receptor region. The
PD induced by Chinese and Indian emissions are mainly
found within these two countries; however, the annual PDs
caused by China and India in external regions contribute an
additional 700 000 and ca. 500 000 PDs per year, respec-
tively, representing more than 50 % of the global mortal-
ity. Clearly, reducing emissions and emission uncertainties in
these two regions will therefore have the largest overall ben-
eﬁt on global air quality improvement as well as on global
human health. As explained in Sect. 3.1, PDs attributed to
internal and external emissions are directly linked (propor-
tional) to the internal and external PM2.5 contributions. For
most of the TM5-FASST regions, PDs due to anthropogenic
emissions within the source region are higher than the extra-
regional contributions. However, there are marked excep-
tions, such as Hungary, the Czech Republic, Mongolia, etc.,
where the extra-regional and within-region contributions to
mortality are at least comparable. For instance, Hungary and
the Czech Republic are strongly inﬂuenced by polluted re-
gions in Poland (mainly); likewise, Mongolia is affected by
the vicinity of sources in China. The Gulf region produces
a lot of its own pollution but is also inﬂuenced by trans-
port from Africa and Eurasia as reported by Lelieveld et
al. (2009).
Detailed information on the premature deaths for each
TM5-FASST region and the contributing anthropogenic
emission sectors is shown in Fig. 8a and b. Health effects
induced by air quality in industrialised countries are mainly
related to agriculture (32.4 % of total mortality or 68 000 PDs
per year), residential combustion (17.8 % or 37 000 PDs per
year) and road transport (18.7 % or 39 000 PDs per year) for
Europe and with power generation (26.4 % or 26 000 PDs
per year), industry (19 % or 19 000 PDs per year), residen-
tial (17 % or 17 000 PDs per year) and agriculture (24.0 % or
24 000 PDs per year) for North America. The health impacts
observed in most western EU countries is due to both within-
region and extra-regional pollution, while in several eastern
EU countries the impact of neighbouring countries is even
larger compared to within-region pollution. The premature
deaths induced by international shipping emissions represent
5.5 % of total EU PD, which is in the range of the results
of Brandt et al. (2013) (ca. 50 000 PDs). PM-related mor-
tality in developing countries and fast-growing economies is
mostly affected by industrial (up to 42 % in China or 279 000
PDs per year) and residential activities (ranging from 27 %
in China and 76 % in western Africa), and also by power
generation (up to 24 % in India or 113 000 PDs per year).
Chinese emissions have a strong impact on China, Japan,
Vietnam, Mongolia + North Korea, and Thailand while the
Indian emissions impact the rest of south and south-eastern
Asia. Reducing Chinese and Indian emissions will reduce the
PM-related mortality in almost all countries in Asia. Our re-
sults are in agreement with the study of Oh et al. (2015)
where they highlight the role of transported pollution from
China in affecting the PM2.5 concentrations and health stan-

Conclusions
In this work we couple the global anthropogenic emission
estimates provided by the HTAP_v2.2 inventory for 2010
(merging national and regional inventories) with the global
source receptor model TM5-FASST, to study PM2.5 con-
centrations and the corresponding health impacts, includ-
ing an evaluation of the impacts of uncertainties in na-
tional emission inventories. Annual and regionally aver-
aged anthropogenic PM2.5 concentrations, corresponding to
the 2010 emissions, vary between ca. 1 and 40 µg m−3,
with the highest annual concentrations computed in China
(40 µg m−3, range: 22.4–76.6 µg m−3), India (35 µg m−3,
range: 16.6–73.4 µg m−3), North America (8 µg m−3, range:
4.4–14.4 µg m−3) and Europe (on average ca. 8 µg m−3,
range: 5–18 µg m−3). Anthropogenic PM2.5 concentrations
are mainly due to emissions within the source region, but
extra-regional transported air pollution can contribute by up
to 40 % (e.g. from China to SE Asia, from EU to Russia).
Moreover, due to the transport of PM between European
countries, EU-wide directives can help improve the air qual-
ity across Europe.
For our analysis we aggregate our results derived from 56
TM5-FASST source regions into 10 global regions to facili-
tate the comparison of results in regions of more equal size.
The relative contribution of anthropogenic sectors to PM2.5
concentrations varies in different regions. In Europe in 2010,
the agriculture and residential combustion sectors contribute
the most PM2.5 concentrations and these sectors are also as-
sociated with relatively large emission uncertainties. PM2.5
concentrations in China and other emerging economies are
predominantly associated with the power generation, indus-
try and residential activities.
Using the HTAP_v2.2 emission inventory and TM5-
FASST, we also evaluate how the uncertainty in sectors and
regions propagates into PM2.5 concentrations. The aim of our
analysis is to provide insights into where improvement of
country emission inventories would give the largest beneﬁts,
because of their highest uncertainty and highest contribution
to the formation of PM2.5 concentrations. The uncertainty of
PM concentrations depends in variable proportions to the un-
certainties of the emissions within receptor regions, and sur-
rounding regions. We show that reducing the uncertainties in
the Chinese and Indian emission inventories (e.g. from indus-
try and residential sectors) will be highly relevant for more
accurate quantiﬁcation of the contribution of the long-range
sources to PM2.5 pollution in most Asian countries. Here we
demonstrate how analysis of uncertainties in national and re-
gional sectorial emission inventories can further inform coor-
dinated transboundary and sector-speciﬁc policies to signif-
icantly improve global air quality. Among all anthropogenic
emission sectors, the combustion of biomass for household
purposes represents one of the major sources of uncertainties
in emission inventories both in terms of wood consumption
and emission factor estimates. Further effort is therefore re-
quired at national level to better characterise this source.
Finally, we analyse the air quality effects on health. Global
health effects due to PM2.5 concentrations calculated with

TM5-FASST and anthropogenic emissions in 2010 are esti-
mated to be ca. 2.1 million premature deaths per year, but the
uncertainty associated with emission ranges between 1 and
3.4 million deaths per year, with the largest fraction of PD
(82 %) in developing countries.
