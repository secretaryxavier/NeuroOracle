Bacterial pathogens have developed sophisticated mechanisms
of evading the immune system to survive in infected host cells.
Central to the pathogenesis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is
the arrest of phagosome maturation, partly through interference
with PtdIns signalling. The protein phosphatase MptpB is an
essential secreted virulence factor in M. tuberculosis. A combin-
ation of bioinformatics analysis, enzyme kinetics and substrate-
speciﬁcity characterization revealed that MptpB exhibits both
dual-speciﬁcity protein phosphatase activity and, importantly,
phosphoinositide phosphatase activity. Mutagenesis of conserved
residues in the active site signature indicates a cysteine-
based mechanism of dephosphorylation and identiﬁes two new
catalytic residues, Asp165, essential in catalysis, and Lys164,
apparently involved in substrate speciﬁcity. Sequence similar-
ities with mammalian lipid phosphatases and a preference for
phosphoinositide substrates suggests a potential novel role of
MptpB in PtdIns metabolism in the host and reveals new
perspectives for the role of this phosphatase in mycobacteria
pathogenicity.
Key words: bacterial phosphatase, dual-speciﬁcity, lipid phos-
phatase, protein phosphatase, signalling.
INTRODUCTION
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis,
a decimating disease affecting one third of the human population
and causing around two million deaths every year (according to
the World Health Organization, www.who.int). This intracellular
pathogen survives and replicates primarily in host macrophages
despite the antimicrobial functions of the macrophage. The pri-
mary defence against intracellular microbial pathogens is phag-
osomal
maturation
into
phagolysosomes,
leading
to
the acidiﬁcation of lysosome contents and destruction of bacterial
particles. Many pathogens have evolved sophisticated ways of
evading this innate response to extend their survival in host cells.
M. tuberculosis is a landmark example of such a strategy [1], since
it can persist in phagocytes preventing the normal maturation
to phagolysosomes and survive inside the host lungs in a latent
asymptomatic state. In recent years, a number of studies have been
directed at understanding the molecular mechanisms that allow
M. tuberculosis survival in infected macrophages (reviewed in
[2–4]).
One
proposed
mechanism
involves
the
host
phosphoinositide, PtdIns3P, responsible for recruitment of
the Rab5 effectors hVPS34 and EEA1 to endocytic organelles,
an essential step in phagosome maturation [5]. Manipulation of
phosphoinositide metabolism is emerging now as a common
theme in bacterial pathogenesis [6].
Other mechanisms correlate infection of M. tuberculosis with
disruption of several normal host signalling pathways involving
MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases), IFN-γ (interferon-
γ ), calcium signalling and apoptosis (reviewed in [4]). As
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of host proteins regulate
these intracellular processes, it is not surprising that protein
kinases and phosphatases play a role in pathogen infection and
survival [3,4]. In fact, phosphatases are major virulence factors
in other pathogenic bacteria such as Yersinia pseudotuberculosis,
and Salmonella typhimurium [7,8]. Likewise, the M. tuberculosis
secreted protein phosphatases MptpA and MptpB have been
reported to be important for persistence of mycobacterial infection
[9–10]. Disruption of the mptpB gene severely impairs the
ability of the mutant strain to survive in both IFN-γ -activated
macrophages and in guinea pigs [10]. The function of MptpB
remains unclear, although a role in dephosphorylation of protein
targets in the IFN-γ pathway has been suggested [10], the biologi-
cal substrates of MptpB have not yet been elucidated. Therefore
a true understanding of the enzymatic and substrate speciﬁcity of
this phosphatase is essential to dissect the actual biological role
of MptpB.
Bioinformatics analysis of MptpB reveals a large family
of related proteins in bacterial and fungal species, including
many pathogens. In-depth sequence analysis highlights common
features to DSPs (dual-speciﬁcity protein phosphatases) and,
surprisingly, a singular active site signature motif, reminiscent
of eukaryotic lipid phosphatases. These observations prompted
us to investigate further the biochemical and kinetic properties of
this enzyme to deﬁne its substrate speciﬁcity. In the present study
we provide experimental evidence that MptpB dephosphorylates
phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine substrates, and
importantly, phosphoinositides, thus exhibiting TSP (triple-
speciﬁcity phosphatase) activity. The report of a new completely

unexpected catalytic speciﬁcity for MptpB should be an aid in
deﬁning novel ways of addressing its mechanism of action
in vivo, its potential role in host phosphoinositide metabolism,
and to identify host targets for MptpB. In addition, this catalytic
versatility provides new insights for future rational design of
speciﬁc inhibitors of MptpB.
EXPERIMENTAL
Bioinformatics analysis
Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalX
[11], after initial identiﬁcation of MptpB-related sequences using
PSI-BLAST searches of GenBank® [12]. Analysis of the active
site motif was performed using a ScanProsite search in SwissProt
and TrEMBL (http://www.expasy.org/tools/scanprosite/).
Cloning and mutagenesis of MptpB
The open reading frame of Rv0153c, encoding MptpB, was
ampliﬁed from M. tuberculosis H37Rv DNA. The oligonucleo-
tide primers, forward (5′-CATATGGCTGTCCGTGAACTGC-
CGGGCGCG-3′) and reverse (5′-CTCGAGTCATCCGAGCAG-
CACCCCGCGCATC-3′) contained NdeI and XhoI restriction
sites and the resulting MptpB-coding sequence was cloned
into pET28a (Novagen) to generate an N-terminal His6-tagged
expression construct. Site-directed mutagenesis of the following
residues D82A, C160S, K164A, D165N and R166A were carried
out using the QuikChange® Kit (Stratagene).
Overexpression and puriﬁcation of recombinant proteins
Each construct (wild-type and mutants) was transformed into
Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) and grown in LB (Luria–
Bertani) broth at 37 ◦C to mid-log phase. Expression was induced
at 18 ◦C with 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside) and
the cells were harvested by centrifugation (4000 g for 15 min
at 4 ◦C) 16 h later. The expressed His6–MptpB (wild-type and
mutants) was puriﬁed by nickel-afﬁnity chromatography. The
supernatant from the bacterial lysate was loaded on to a 5 ml
HiTrap column (Amersham Bioscience) in binding buffer (50 mM
Hepes and 500 mM NaCl, pH 7) and the protein was recovered
following on-column cleavage of the His6-tag with thrombin
(Sigma) by washing with binding buffer. The recovered fractions
were further puriﬁed on a MonoQ column using 20 mM Tris/HCl
(pH 8) and eluted with 200 mM NaCl in the same buffer. The
phosphatase from Trypanosoma brucei TbPTP1 has been recently
characterized by our group as a tyrosine-speciﬁc phosphatase [13].
In the present study we used TbPTP1 as a control. TbPTP1 was
ampliﬁed from T. brucei DNA and cloned into pET28a (Novagen).
Recombinant TbPTP1 was expressed in E. coli strain BL21 DE3
CodonPlusTM RIPL, grown in LB broth at 37 ◦C and induced at
30 ◦C with 0.4 mM IPTG. Puriﬁcation of His6-tagged TbPTP1
was performed by nickel-afﬁnity chromatography using the same
method as for MptpB.
Phosphatase activity assays
The Malachite Green assay (Sigma) was used to determine the
amount of free phosphate during the dephosphorylation assays
with a range of substrates: phosphotyrosine peptides from
EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor; DADEpYLIPQQG)
and
insulin
receptor
(TRDIpYETDYYRK),
phosphoserine
peptide (RRApSVA), phosphothreonine peptide (KRpTIRR;
Alta Bioscience, University of Birmingham), phosphoserine,
phosphothreonine and phosphotyrosine (Sigma), IMP (inosine
monophosphate),
AMP,
pNPP
(p-nitrophenol
phosphate;
Sigma), diC8-PtdIns3P, diC8-PtdIns(3,4)P2, diC8-PtdIns(3,5)P2,
diC8-PtdIns4P, diC8-PtdIns(4,5)P2, diC8PtdIns5P and diC8-
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (all from Echelon Bioscience). Each reaction was
prepared in triplicate in a 96-well microplate, containing 50 µl
of the reaction mixture with 5 µg of enzyme (MptpB wild-type,
mutants and TbPTP1), 0.05–2 mM substrate (3–500 µM range
for phosphoinositides) and buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl, 50 mM Bis-
Tris and 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 6). The reaction mixtures
were incubated for 15 min at 37 ◦C prior to the addition of
50 µl of Malachite Green reagent (Sigma) and further incubated
for 10 min at room temperature (20 ◦C). The absorbance was
subsequently read at 620 nm and the mean values calculated.
Control reactions containing no enzyme were included to measure
the background level of phosphate. A phosphate standard curve
was produced using known amounts of phosphate (25–3000 pmol
of Sigma phosphate standard solution). Experimental points were
interpolated in the standard curve to calculate the amount of
phosphate released.
Kinetic analysis
The kinetic parameters Vmax and Km for each substrate were deter-
mined using non-linear regression ﬁt of the initial velocity
versus substrate concentration curve using Hyper32 (developed by
Dr John Easterby, Department of Biochemistry, University
of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K.). The kcat was determined by
dividing the Vmax by the molar enzyme concentration and the
means +−S.E.M. were calculated.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
MptpB-related bacterial and fungal phosphatases
A PSI-BLAST search with the full-length MptpB sequence
identiﬁed orthologues in other mycobacterium species (My-
cobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium ﬂavescens, Mycobacterium
vanbaalenii and Mycobacterium sp.MCS) and returned more
than 150 related sequences in bacteria and fungi, most of which
are currently annotated as hypothetical proteins. The multiple
sequence alignment highlights the existence of a characteristic
active site signature motif CX5R, present in the PTP (protein
tyrosine phosphatase) superfamily, which forms the P-loop
(phosphate-binding loop) (Figure 1A). The presence of the CX5R
motif suggests a classiﬁcation of these sequences as predicted
phosphatases. However, the analysis failed to identify motifs
conserved only in the tyrosine-speciﬁc phosphatases, such as the
WPD motif that contains the catalytic aspartate residue or the Q-
loop involved in catalysis [14]. Instead, the active site region of
MptpB and related proteins resembles the extended signature mo-
tif described for a subfamily of PTPs, the DSPs that can efﬁciently
dephosphorylate phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine
substrates [15]. The extended signature comprises the P-loop
motif and ﬂanking hydrophobic residues (Figure 1A). Consistent
with this observation, the overall sequence similarity of MptpB
with tyrosine-speciﬁc PTPs, such as human PTP1B is only 6%,
whereas similarity with known DSPs is 24% with VHR (vaccinia
virus VH1-related dual-speciﬁc protein phosphatase), 25.8%
with MKP3 (MAPK phosphatase 3) and 33.5% with IphP (dual-
speciﬁc phosphatase from Nostoc commune). Therefore although
MptpB is designated as a tyrosine phosphatase in the genome
databases, sequence analysis suggests otherwise.
Furthermore, all bacterial and fungal MptpB-related sequences
contain two strictly conserved residues in the P-loop: Lys164 and
Asp165 (MptpB numbering). Such a feature is unusual in both

classical tyrosine-speciﬁc PTPs and DSPs. A ScanProsite search
using the regular expression pattern HCX2GKDR[T/A] found in
the active site signature revealed eukaryotic orthologues of the
lipid phosphatases PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue
deleted on chromosome 10), TPTE (transmembrane phosphatase
with tensin homology), TPTE2 [16], MTMs (myotubularins),
and FYVE-DSP1/2 [17–18]. The alignment of the P-loop motif
from these lipid phosphatases underlines the similarities with
MptpB in this region (Figure 1B). The conserved lysine residue
is also found in PTEN and PTEN-related phosphatases and it is
important in substrate binding [19,20]. The conserved aspartate
residue, found in MTMs and FYVE-DSP1/2 acts as the general
acid in catalysis [21,22]. The combination of PTEN and MTM
features in the active site suggests that MptpB may also share
similar enzymatic properties. MTMs, FYVE-DSP1/2 and PTEN
display both DSP and phosphoinositide phosphatase activity
[17–19,23]. To test this we carried out a full investigation of
the kinetic properties and substrate speciﬁcity of MptpB.

MptpB exhibits DSP activity
Recombinant MptpB was used for kinetic analyses towards
a panel of phosphosubstrates (see the Experimental section).
The catalytic activity of MptpB towards pNPP and the EGFR
peptide was optimal at pH 6, both in the absence and presence
of dithiothreitol (results not shown). MptpB dephosphorylates
phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine/threonine substrates, with
higher catalytic efﬁciency towards phosphopeptides as indicated
by higher kcat/Km values (Table 1). A higher catalytic rate,
kcat, is observed for phosphotyrosine peptide substrates, whereas
lower Km values are found for phosphoserine/threonine peptides,
indicating enhanced binding afﬁnity (Table 1). Dephosphorylation
of phosphotyrosine peptides is approx. 3.2 times more efﬁcient
than dephosphorylation of phosphoserine/threonine peptides.
This is in good agreement with the ratio observed for other
DSPs [24], and in contrast with the rates of dephosphorylation
for tyrosine-speciﬁc PTPs commonly up to 105 times higher
for phosphotyrosine substrates than for phosphoserine/threonine
substrates [24]. Overall, the catalytic proﬁle obtained from our
kinetic analysis shows that MptpB has DSP activity with a
preference for phosphotyrosine substrates.
MptpB exhibits lipid phosphatase activity
The similarity between the active site signature from MptpB with
those of MTMs and PTEN suggested that MptpB might also dis-
play lipid phosphatase activity. To test this, the activity of the en-
zyme was assayed against different phosphoinositides (Table 2).

PtdIns3P,
PtdIns(3,5)P2,
PtdIns4P and PtdIns5P, with higher efﬁciency for PtdIns3P
and PtdIns(3,5)P2, but showed comparable Km values for the
four phosphoinositide substrates, indicating similar binding afﬁn-
ity. Phosphoinositide substrates exhibited lower Km values than
the phospho-amino acid or phosphopeptide substrates tested
(Tables 1 and 2), thus indicating that MptpB has higher afﬁnity
for lipid substrates. The kcat/Km values for phosphoinositide
dephosphorylation are also higher than for peptidic substrates.
Interestingly, MptpB appears to have a broad speciﬁcity as it
dephosphorylates single phosphate substitutions at the D3, D4
and D5 positions. However, the enzyme exhibited no activity
against PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns(4,5)P2, showing
an apparent selectivity against phosphates at the D4 position of
the inositol head when in combination with another phosphate
group at D3 or D5. This broad phosphoinositide activity is in
contrast with mammalian lipid phosphatases that exhibit a much
more restricted speciﬁcity [20,23].
Mutagenesis of the active site signature residues
Next, we wanted to explore the potential implication of conserved
P-loop residues (Cys160, Lys164, Asp165 and Arg166) in catalysis or
substrate binding. As expected, the C160S and R166A mutated
enzymes exhibit less than 1% of the wild-type activity for any of
the substrates tested, including pNPP and phosphoinositides. This
conﬁrms that these residues are essential for enzymatic activity,
presumably in a cysteine-based mechanism of catalysis similar to
PTPs and DSPs [15], where the cysteine residue is the nucleophile
and the arginine residue contributes to substrate binding.
Enzymatic assays with the D165N mutant showed that it
displays less than 0.1% of wild-type activity for pNPP or peptide
substrates (Figure 1C). Furthermore, the D165N mutant showed
<3% activity towards phosphoinositides (Figure 1D). On the
basis of this new experimental evidence we propose Asp165 as a
putative catalytic residue for MptpB. Supporting this, the ana-
logous conserved aspartate residue in MTMs and FYVE-DSP1/2
(Figure 1B) was found to be essential for catalysis in MTMR2
[21]. Interestingly, mutation of Asp82 to an alanine residue showed
similar activity to the wild-type enzyme with all substrates tested
(Figures 1C and 1D). This residue was proposed previously as
the general acid in catalysis [25], although experimental evidence
has not been reported to date. We have established that Asp82 is
not the general acid in catalysis.
The presence of Lys164 in the P-loop is intriguing. Typically,
only one basic residue, the conserved arginine residue, is
necessary in the active site to direct binding of the negatively
charged phosphosubstrates. Additional basic residues (e.g. lysine
residues) are uncommon, and only found in the lipid phosphatases
PTEN and TPTE (Figure 1B), which bind substrates with more
than one negatively charged phosphate group. To investigate the

functional role of Lys164, we mutated it to an alanine residue
and tested its activity towards substrates (Table 2, Figures 1C
and 1D). The activity of K164A is severely impaired towards
phosphotyrosine peptides, with less than 10% of the wild-type
activity (Table 2, Figure 1C), but remains unaltered towards pNPP
and phosphoserine/threonine peptides. Dephosphorylation of
lipids is also reduced in a substrate-dependent manner. The largest
reduction is observed for PtdIns(3,5)P2, with a 70% decrease in
activity with respect to wild-type, in contrast, there is little effect
on dephosphorylation of PtdIns4P (Table 2, Figure 1D). Kinetic
analysis with K164A showed that the kcat/Km values decreased
by more than one order of magnitude for all phosphoinositides
with respect to the wild-type enzyme, but Km values remained
similar. On the other hand, a signiﬁcant reduction in the catalytic
rate was observed for PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Table 2).
These results indicate a potential role for Lys164 in catalysis,
albeit in a substrate-dependent manner. The analogous lysine
residue in the lipid phosphatase PTEN, Lys128, is important in lipid
binding [20]. Docking of PtdIns(3,5)P2 to the active site of MptpB
suggests that the wide active site could easily accommodate
PtdIns(3,5)P2 (Figure 1E), and that binding might be favoured
through interactions of the D5 phosphate with a basic residue such
as Lys164. In contrast, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 would not bind in the active
site because the D4 phosphate would clash with the catalytic
Asp165 and Lys164 side chains. New insights regarding the role
of this residue should be revealed when the three-dimensional
structure of MptpB in complex with a lipid substrate is solved.
The enzymatic activity towards PtdIns3P, PtdIns4P and
PtdIns5P indicates that all three monophosphate substrates bind
in the active site, although different binding modes or alter-
native binding orientations of the phosphoinositol head must
occur. The lack of activity for PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2 and
PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 could be rationalized by the fact that contiguous
biphosphate substitutions (3,4; 4,5 or 3,4,5) would probably
result in stearic clashes with Asp165, whereas non-contiguous sub-
stitutions (3,5), may be favoured by interactions with Lys164
(Figure 1E).
Conclusions
In the present study we describe the new ﬁndings on the TSP
activity of MptpB, a virulence factor from M. tuberculosis.
Our kinetic characterization provides experimental evidence that
MptpB exhibits DSP activity and unexpected phosphoinositide
phosphatase activity for a broad range of lipids. This is the
ﬁrst report of phosphoinositide phosphatase activity for MptpB.
Previously, a partial characterization of MptpB detected tyrosine
phosphatase activity [26], although lipid substrates were not tested
in that study. The broad speciﬁcity towards phosphoinositides
observed for MptpB could be important for in vivo targeting of a
wide range of host phosphoinositides or as part of a more sophis-
ticated pleiotropic effect coupling phosphoinositide turnover with
protein-mediated cell-signalling events. The different enzymatic
activities observed in vitro may not reﬂect true relative activities in
vivo, where other factors may modulate the physiological function
of MptpB. Hence, the biologically relevant substrates of MptpB
in vivo will still need to be investigated and both protein and
lipid substrates considered. The molecular factors responsible
for controlling phophoinositide levels in mycobacterium-infected
macrophages have not yet been fully deﬁned, and from the evi-
dence presented in the present study MptpB may play an important
role. Future investigations will be directed at studying the potential
targeting of MptpB to membrane phosphoinositides and to deﬁne
the molecular basis for phosphoinositide binding. The newly
identiﬁed enzymatic activity of MptpB opens new horizons
to test its potential role in host phosphoinositide metabolism
and phagosome maturation arrest, and provides exciting new
directions for pharmacological intervention.
