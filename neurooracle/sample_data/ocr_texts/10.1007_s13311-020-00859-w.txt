Abstract
Schizophrenia (SZ) is a serious mental condition and is associated with cognitive impairments. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) is one of the learning- and memory-related molecules found in the CNS and its level was reported to be reduced in SZ
brain, while w-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (w-3PUFAs) could improve SZ symptoms, but its mechanism of action remains
unknown. Using MK801 injection—induced SZ rat model, we here found that supplementation with w-3PUFAs improved the
levels of p-CREB, BDNF, and p-TrkB in the brain of SZ rats, and restore hippocampal neuronal damage, thereby reducing
cognitive impairments in SZ rats. However, overexpression of AAV9/CREB S$133A (CREB inactivated mutation) downregu-
lated BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway and remarkably abolished the preventive effect of w-3PUFAs in MK801-induced schizo-
phrenia. Interestingly, AAV9/CREB S133D (CREB activated mutation) improved synaptic dysfunctions and cognitive defects in
MK801 rats. In conclusion, these findings indicate that MK801-induced SZ lesions dephosphorylate CREB at Ser133 site,
leading to neuron damage, and w-3PUFAs improve SZ cognitive impairments by upregulating the CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway,
which provides new clues for the mechanism of SZ cognitive impairments, and a basis for therapeutic intervention.

professional social function of patients, with serious effects on
the quality of life of patients [5, 6].
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotroph-
ic protein and together with its receptor is widely expressed in
the nervous system [7, 8]. BDNF is transported by antero-
grade mean from the axoplasm to axon tip where it binds to
its specific receptor, especially the most potent TrkB receptor,
and causes TrkB autophosphorylation, which triggers signal-
ing cascades that affect target tissues [9-11]. BDNF maintains
neuronal survival, growth, differentiation, and migration of
new neuronal precursor cells, and induces synaptic connec-
tions, to promote neuronal cell development. It was reported
that during chronic stress damage in neurons during adult-
hood, BDNF helps to protect neurons, regulates calcium con-
centration and reduces the necrosis and apoptosis in hippo-
campal neurons, positively affects neuronal plasticity, and re-
pairs. They also have been reported to be closely related to
neuropsychiatric diseases, including SZ [12, 13].
In recent years, the role of nutritional factors in neuro-
psychiatric diseases has received increasing attention [14].
Among them, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (w-
3PUFAs) are essential fatty acids for humans, including
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid
(EPA), and arachidonic acid (AA). These w-3PUFAs per-
form several important functions including cell membrane
stabilization, gene expression regulation, cytokine and
membrane protein balance maintenance, promoting
growth and development, and many other properties like
anti-cardiovascular disease, anti-inflammatory, and anti-
cancer [15, 16]. w-3PUFAs have become a hot research
topic in the field of neurological disorders including neu-
ropsychiatry because of its important influence on the
development and function of the brain. w-3PUFAs can
promote the expression of hippocampal neurogenesis—
related genes, regulate hippocampal neurogenesis, stimu-
late dendritic branches, activate related signaling path-
ways, and induce synaptic formation and long-term poten-
tiation (LTP) [17, 18]. In addition, w-3PUFAs can reduce
neuronal oxidative stress and apoptosis, and play an im-
portant role in maintaining normal cognitive function
[19]. Studies have found that w-3PUFAs can improve
the symptoms of SZ [20, 21], but the specific mechanism
of the effect of w-3PUFAs on SZ cognition is not clear.
Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the influence
of w-3PUFAs on the cognitive function impairments re-
lated to SZ. Our previous study has shown that w-
3PUFAs enhances the CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway [22].
Moreover, it has been reported that w-3PUFAs can upreg-
ulate CREB phosphorylation [23, 24], but the specific
mechanism is unknown. To elucidate the mechanism of
w-3PUFAs involvement in memory in SZ, we hypothe-
sized that by promoting CREB phosphorylation, w-
3PUFAs may influence the CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway.
va Springer
We therefore here reported that w-3PUFAs improve
BDNF/TrkB pathway alterations through Ser 133 phos-
phorylation of CREB in rat hippocampus and prevent
MK801-induced cognitive impairments in rats. These pro-
vide new clues to the mechanism of SZ cognitive impair-
ments, thereby providing an insight for therapeutic
intervention.
Material and Methods
Animals
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (2 months old, 250 +20 g) were
supplied by the Experimental Animal Central of Tongji
Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and
Technology. Rats were kept under standard laboratory condi-
tions: 12-h light and 12-h dark with water and food ad libitum.
Rats were randomly divided into groups and treated as stated
in different parts of the study. All animal experiments were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University
of Science and Technology JACUC Number: 2316).
Stereotactic Surgery
The rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and placed in a
stereotaxic apparatus. After being sterilized with iodophors
and 75% (vol/vol) alcohol, the scalp was incised along the
midline between the ears. Holes were drilled in the hibateral
skull stereotaxically at posterior 3.96 mm, lateral 3.0 mm, and
ventral 3.0 mm relative to bregma. Using a microinjection
system (World Precision Instruments), AAV-CMV-eGFP-
CREB 8133D, AAV-CMV-eGFP-CREB §8133A, or vector
(2 uL, 2.0 10'* viral genomes per milliliter) was injected
in the hippocampus CA1 region at a rate of 0.125 uL/min;
the needle was kept in place for 10 min before withdrawal, and
the skin was sutured.
Reagents
w-3PUFAs are a deep sea fish oil capsule, the main ingredi-
ents of which are DHA (110 mg) and EPA (© 170 mg).
MK801 was purchased from Sigma Company (USA),
MAP2 (1:250 millipore). For Western blotting, the primary
antibodies used were CREB (1:1000; Cell Signaling
Technology, USA), p-CREB (1:1000; Cell Signaling
Technology, USA), BDNF (1:1000; Abcam, USA), TrkB
(1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology, USA), p-TrkB (1:1000;
Cell Signaling Technology, USA), and actin (1:1000;
Abcam).

Behavior Tests
Open Field
The open field is used to assess tension, anxiety, and explora-
tion activities of experimental animals. The test equipment is a
typical open field (100 x 100 cm* PVC square arena with 70-
cm-high walls). Rats were individually trained for a single 5-
min period. Anxiety is studied by analyzing the percentage of
time spent in the middle of the arena. The total distance cov-
ered and central zone crossing were tracked and measured.
Three Boxes Social Behavioral Experiments
The experimental device consists of three boxes, each box
with a size of 19 x 45 cm. The partition between each box
is a transparent plexiglass with a channel in the middle to
make three boxes open; in the left and right boxes, we placed
a uniform metal cage in the center, enough to accommodate a
rat. Before the experiment, the rats were taken in the behavior
test room for half an hour; we put a stranger rat into the metal
cage in one side of the box, while the metal cage on the other
side of the box is empty. The three boxes are separated by a
transparent glass resin plate, and the test rat is placed in the
box on the other side for 5 min. The glass resin board sepa-
rating the boxes is then removed so that the test rat can move
freely in three boxes for 5 min. The number of exchanges and
residence time between the rats and the stranger rat was
recorded.
High Plus Maze Test
High plus maze consists of two opposite open arms, two op-
posite closed arms, and a central zone. The maze size is arm
length: 425 < arm width 120 x arm height 225 mm. At the
beginning of the experiment, the rats were placed into the
maze from the central grid facing the closed arm, and the
activity within 5 min was recorded. Observation indicators
include open arm entry times, open arm dwell time, closed
arm entry times, and closed arm dwell time.
Novel Objective Recognition Test
The rats were taken to the new object recognition room 24 h
before the test, then we put the rat into a 100 cm x 100 cm x
100 cm plastic container for 5 min, then took it back to the
arena from the same starting point; they were allowed for
5 min to be familiar with A and B objects. After each familiar
period, the arena and objects were cleaned with 75% ethanol.
Two hours after the familiarization period, the B object was
replaced by the C object, and the rats were given 5 min to
explore the two objects. After 24 h, the C object was replaced
with a D object, and the rat was given 5 min to explore two
objects.
Morris Water Maze Test
Spatial learning and memory were tested by MWM as de-
scribed in a previous study. For spatial learning, the rats were
trained in the water maze to find a hidden platform for 5 days,
four trials per day from 8:00 am to 14:00 pm. In each trial, the
rats started from one of four quadrants facing the wall of the
pool and ended when the animal climbed on the platform. If
the rats failed to find the platform within 60 s, they were
guided to the platform and allowed to stay on the platform
for 20 s uniformly. The swimming path and the time used to
find the platform (latency) were recorded by a tracking video
camera. Spatial memory was tested the next day after training.
The platform was removed and the latency of first crossing of
the platform, the number of crossing, and the time in target
quadrant were recorded for 60 s.
Western Blotting
The hippocampus was rapidly removed and homogenized at
4 °C, using a buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L NaF, 1 mmol/L Na3VOg,,
5 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mM benzamidine, and 1 mM PMSF,
while the primary hippocampal neurons were extracted on
ice in radio immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer. After
centrifugation of the tissue homogenates or cell lysate at
12000 rpm/min, the supernatants were collected. Protein con-
centrations were quantified by bicinchoninic acid (BCA) pro-
tein kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA). Proteins were separated
by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% gel) and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After immersion in
5% skim milk at 25 °C for 1 h, the membranes were incubated
ovemight with the primary antibody at 4 °C. Then, the im-
printing was conjugated to IRDye TM (800 CW) anti-mouse
or anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at 25 °C, and the image was viewed
with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR
Biosciences, USA).
Primary Hippocampal Neuron Culture
Primary hippocampal neurons were prepared from 17 to
18 days old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos. The hippocampus
was dissected and gently chopped in Hank’s buffered saline
solution and then suspended in a 0.25% (v/¥) trypsin solution
for 15 min at 37 °C. Neurons were plated in 6-well and 12-
well plates coated with 100 ug/mL poly-p-lysine and supple-
mented with 2% (v/v) B-27 and 1 x GlutaMAX. The neurons
were cultured for 9 days and then treated with MK801,
AAV9/CTR, AAV9/CREB-S133D, and AAV9/CREB-
S133A. At the end of the treatments, cells were collected

and lysed in RIPA buffer for further biological detections or
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for immunofluorescence im-
aging. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Thermo
Fisher Scientific. Sholl analysis was used to measure dendritic
complexity as reported previously [25]. Dendritic length was
analyzed and measured using semi-automatized protocol via
Imaris software (Bitplane, Inc.).
BDNF ELISA Assay
The brain and hippocampus primary neurons were lysed in
RIPA buffer and centrifuged at 3000xg for 10 min at 4 °C, and
the supernatant containing BDNF was collected. The RIPA-
available BDNF levels were determined by ELISA according
to the procedure provided by the assay kit manufacturer.
Electrophysiology
Slice Preparation The rats were perfused with 20 ml ice cold
solution of aCSF containing (in mM) 120 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 2
CaCl,-2H20, 1.25 KH»PO,4, 2 MgSO,4-7H.20, 26 NaHCOs3,
and 10 glucose, saturated with 95% O, and 5% CO, and
buffered to a pH of 7.4. Following sectioning at 360-\m thick-
ness, the slices were incubated in oxygenated aCSF at 32 °C to
recover for 40 min and at 20—25 °C to recover for 1 h. Then
slices were transferred to the recording chamber with contin-
uous oxygenated aCSF perfusion.
Recording of LTP For LTP, acute brain sections were trans-
ferred to a recording chamber and submerged in aCSF. The
sections were placed in a chamber with an 8 x 8 microelec-
trode array (Parker Technology, Beijing, China) in the bottom
plane (each 50 <x 50 mm size with an interelectrode distance of
150 um) and kept submerged in the aCSF. Stimulation signals
were provided by the MED64 system (Alpha MED Sciences,
Panasonic). Field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP) in
CA1 neurons was recorded by stimulating CA3 neurons. LTP
was induced by applying three columns of high-frequency
stimulation (HFS; 100 Hz, 1-s duration). The LTP magnitude
was quantified as a percentage change in the fEPSP slope
taken during the 60 min interval following LTP induction.
Recording of AMPAR sEPSCs Hippocampal slices were held
between nylon net in an interface chamber and then fully
submerged in the aCSF (3 ml/min) at room temperature (20-
25 °C). Pyramidal cells in the CA1 hippocampal slice were
identified by a DIC-infrared upright microscope. Glass micro-
electrodes (4-6 MQ) filled with an internal solution contained
(in mM) 140 K-gluconate, 2 MgCl5, 10 HEPES, 10 BAPTA, 2
Mg>ATP, 0.5CaCl5-H30, 0.5 Li-GTP, pH 7.2, and 290 mOsm.
Recordings were carried out at — 60 mV. Five millimolar QX-
314 was added to block voltage-gated Na* channels and
GABAB receptors. The sEPSCs of AMPAR were recorded
9) Springer
in the presence of 100 uM picrotoxin (PTX) and 50 uM dL-2-
amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (D-APV).
Paired Pulse Ratio Paired pulse ratios were calculated as a ratio
of EPSC2 to EPSC1 separated by inter-stimulus intervals of
20, 50, 100, 150, and 200 ms for EPSCs. To measure the
input-output curves for pyramidal neurons, a bipolar tungsten
electrode was place to the stratum radiatum with a bipolar
tungsten electrode ~50 um from the recording electrode in
order to test potential presynaptic effects.
Recording of NMDAR/AMPAR Ratio To record evoked
EPSCs, pipette electrodes with a resistance of 3-5 MQ
were filled with the internal solution containing (in mM)
135 CsMeSOqg, 8 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.25 EGTA, 2
Mg>ATP, 0.3 Na3GTP, 0.1 spermine, and 7 phosphocrea-
tine (pH 7.25-7.3). The AMPAR- and NMDAR-
dependent synaptic responses were evoked by a bipolar
stimulation electrode (FHC) that was located ~ 50 um ros-
tral to the recording electrode in the same layer. In the
presence of 100 uM PTX, we obtained stable synaptic
responses at a holding potential — 60 mV; the amplitude
of these responses represents the AMPAR-specific com-
ponent. At +40 mV, an amplitude of 100-ms post-stimu-
lus was identified as the NMDA-specific response.
Golgi Staining
The rats were anesthetized by isoflurane and transcardially
perfused with proximately 300 ml of normal saline containing
0.5% sodium nitrite, followed with 300 ml of 4% formalde-
hyde solution and then 500 ml staining solution (5% chloral
hydrate, 5% potassium dichromate, and 4% formaldehyde)
over 2 h. Brains were removed from the skull and incubated
in the staining solution for 3 days and in 1% silver nitrate
solution for another 3 days in the dark. The silver nitrate so-
lution was changed every day. Finally, the brains were sliced
using a vibrate microtome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) at a
thickness of 100 um.
TUNEL Assay
Cellular DNA fragmentation in either DMSO vehicle control
or MK801-treated primary hippocampal neurons was deter-
mined using TUNEL assay. Primary hippocampal neurons
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, then perme-
abilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) for 15 min. TUNEL staining was performed using a
fluorescein in situ cell death detection kit (Dalian Meilun
Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Product ID: MA0224) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions.

Statistical Analysis
All experiments were repeated at least three times. Data were
expressed as mean + SEM and analyzed using graphPad prism
statistical software. The one-way ANOVA was used to deter-
mine the differences among groups. For the comparison be-
tween two groups, the Student’s ¢ test was used. The signifi-
cance was assessed at p < 0.05.

Fig. 1 MK801-induced schizophrenia damaged cognitive impairments.
(A) Experimental design sketch. Thirty healthy SD rats were randomly
divided into 2 groups (control and model MK801). The rats in the model
group were daily injected intraperitoneally with MK801for 1 week
(0.3 mg/kg), when saline served as control for 1 week. Following the
treatment, behavioral, electrophysiological, and biochemical tests were
performed. (B, C) The open field showed no difference in the total dis-
tance covered (B), but a significant decrease in the zone crossing (C) in
the MK801 treated group. (D, E) High plus maze test showed the number
of the open-arm-entry (D) and the closed-arm-entry (E). (F) In the three
Latency (s)
were daily injected intraperitoneally with MK801for
1 week (0.3 mg/kg), when saline served as control for
1 week (Fig. 1A). We first carried open-field test after
injection and the result showed that there was no signifi-
cant difference in the total distance covered (Fig. 1B)
between the two groups, but the number of times in the
zone crossing is significantly reduced in the MK801 rats
compared with the control (Fig. 1C), implicating that
MK801 might induce anxiety. To further explore anxiety
in the rats, we employed high plus maze test and found
that the MK801 rats have shortened entries to both open
and closed arm (Fig. 1D, E) when compared with the
control ones, strongly supporting SZ-like anxiety in
MK801 rats. To examine the social interaction of the rats,
we carry out the three boxes behavioral test and found out
that the social ability was significantly impaired in the
model group (Fig. 1F). The novelty recognition experi-
ment allows to explore short-term memory capacity; the
results from this experiment showed that in the MK801
group the curiosity toward exploring new things were sig-
nificantly reduced, as the time spent for exploration of
new object in 2 h and 24 h were significantly decreased

Fig. 2 MK801-induced schizophrenia damaged synaptic plasticity. (A)
The graph of representative records of paired pulsed ratio (PPR) test in
hippocampal slices. For pairwise pulse ratio experiments, paired stimuli
(25 ms, 50 ms, 100 ms, 150 ms, 200 ms) were given and the response
were recorded; 7 = 9 cells from 5 rats for each of the MK801 and control
groups. (B—D) The representative images of short trace recordings from
representative cells of AMPA-sEPSCs (B). Frequency (C) and amplitude
(D) of AMPA-sEPSCs are unchanged in neurons from both groups. (E, F)
Ratio of NNUDAR- to AMPAR-mediated EPSCs is significantly de-
creased by MK801. Representative EPSCs recorded at -60 mV and +
(Fig. 1G, H). Finally, we tested memory and learning
abilities using Morris water maze (MWM), and observed
that the MK801 rats showed significantly increased laten-
cy to find the hidden platform (Fig. 11) compared with the
control group. On day 6, the spatial memory was tested
by removing the platform. A remarkable decrease in the
time spent in the target quadrant (Fig. 1J), as well as a
decrease in the number of target platform crossing (Fig.
1K), was observed in the SZ rats. Together, these data
demonstrate that MK801-induced SZ could cause anxiety,
social interaction alteration, and learning and memory im-
pairments in rats.
It is clear that MK801-induced SZ leads to a series of be-
havioral dysfunctions in rats. Among these behavioral alter-
ations, learning and memory impairments are commonly
shared with other neurological disorders including

neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer [29, 30]. The hip-
pocampus is an integral part of the limbic system [31] and is
known to play a crucial role in memory and spatial localiza-
tion which is the reflection of synaptic plasticity [32]. As
learning and memory were found to be impaired in this model,
we wonder whether MK801-induced SZ might alter synaptic
plasticity. To further explore how the synaptic transmission in
the CA3-CA1 Schaffer collateral (SC) is impaired, paired
pulsed ratio (PPR) which is a form of short-term synaptic
plasticity was evaluated, and the results showed that the PPR

gesting that presynaptic vesicle release was not affected (Fig.
2A). We then examined the effect of MK801-induced SZ on
AMPAR-mediated spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic cur-
rents (AMPAR-sEPSCs) (Fig. 2B). Neither the frequency
nor the amplitude of sEPSCs was affected by MK801 (Fig.

Fig. 3 MK801-induced hippocampal CREB/BDNEF/TrkB pathway
alteration in rat brains and in primary hippocampal neurons. (A—D)
Brain tissues (hippocampus) from model group and control group were
homogenized, and p-TrkB, TrkB, p-CREB, CREB, and BDNF protein
levels were detected by immunoblotting. Actin was used as a loading
control (A). Quantitative analysis of the BDNF (B), p-CREB (C), and
p-TrkB (D) levels. (E-H) Primary hippocampal neurons from MK801-
treated and control cells were homogenized, and p-TrkB, TrkB, p-CREB,
2C, D). To explore whether MK801-induced SZ influences
basal NUDAR-mediated synaptic transmission, we calculated
the NMDAR/AMPAR ratio (Fig. 2E). Interestingly, this ratio
was significantly lower in the CA1 pyramidal cells from
MK801-induced SZ rats than in the control ones (Fig. 2F),
suggesting impaired synaptic function in SZ rats. To
CREB, and BDNF protein levels were detected by immunoblotting (E).

21). When compared with the control, 1 41M MK801 resulted
in an obvious decreased dendritic arborization complexity at
all points farther than 40 um from the cell body (Fig. 2J, K).
These findings suggest that MK801/SZ-induced cognitive im-
pairments are associated with synaptic dysfunction.

hippocampal neuronal plasticity damage. (A) Experimental design
sketch. Forty-five healthy SD rats were randomly divided into 3 groups
as control (Ctr), model (Mod), and preventive (Pre). In the control group,
15 rats were orally administered with normal saline for 4 weeks, while in
the model group another 15 rats were intraperitoneally daily injected with
MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) for 1 week. In the preventive group, 15 rats were first
intragastrically administered with deep sea fish oil (400 mg/kg of w-
3PUFAs) for 4 weeks and then intraperitoneally daily injected with
MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) for last 1 week. Following the treatment, behavioral,

TrkB, it activates the intracellular region of this receptor and
leads to enhanced TrkB autophosphorylation [33, 34], which
in turn activates the Ras-MAPK pathway, and finally activates
CREB by inducing its phosphorylation at the Ser133 site.
Upon activation, CREB promotes neuronal survival and in-
creases synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis by increasing the
expression of the BDNF gene and the anti-apoptotic protein
gene BCL-2 [35]. In view of this, we speculated that the
CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway may be involved in the cogni-
tive alterations seen in SZ. To elucidate this hypothesis, we
performed Western blotting and the result from the MK801-
induced SZ (Fig. 3A) showed a significant reduction in the
protein levels of BDNF, p-CREB, and p-TrkB (Fig. 3B—D).
Similarly, Western blotting from hippocampal primary neu-
rons treated with MK801 showed similar results (Fig. 3E—
H). We also used ELISA to determine the level of BDNF
and found out that the BDNF level was decreased in both
hippocampal (Fig. 31) and primary neuron (Fig. 3J) lysates
from MK801-treated group. This result was supported by
TUNEL staining where MK801 triggers neuronal apoptosis,
as suggested by the high fluorescence of apoptotic body
staining in the MK801 treatment group when compared with
the control (Fig. 3K), implying that this effect might be asso-
ciated with the decrease in the BDNF level in the brain and
supporting that the lack of BDNF in the brain may stimulate
signaling cascades that lead to neuronal apoptosis. Together,
these data from rat and primary neurons imply that MK801-
induced SZ causes CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway dysfunction
and BDNF deficiency.
w-3PUFAs Restored MK801-Induced SZ-Like
Behavioral Alterations and Prevented Hippocampal
Neuronal Damage
The lack of w-3PUFAs has been identified as an environmen-
tal risk factor for SZ. Studies have found that w-3PUFAs can
improve the symptoms of SZ, but the molecular mechanisms
underlying the effects of w-3PUFAs on SZ cognition deficits
remain unknown. To explore the mechanism of w-3PUFA
effects in SZ, 45 healthy SD rats were randomly divided into
3 groups as control (Ctr), model (Mod), and preventive (Pre).
In the control group, 15 rats were orally administered with
normal saline for 4 weeks, while in the model group another
15 rats were intraperitoneally daily injected with MK801
(0.3 mg/kg) for 1 week. In the preventive group, 15 rats were
first intragastrically administered with deep sea fish oil
(400 mg/kg of w-3PUFAs) for 4 weeks and then intraperito-
neally daily injected with MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) for last 1 week
(Fig. 4A). Following the treatment, we performed several be-
havioral tests. The results from the novel object recognition
(NOR) test showed that in the Pre group, the curiosity of
exploring new things was significantly higher when compared
with the Mod group, as the time spent exploring new object
during a 2 h and 24 h tests were significantly increased (Fig.
4B, C). High plus maze test showed that there is no difference
in open arm time among the groups (Fig. 4D), while the time
spent in the closed arm in the Pre group was markedly de-
creased as compared with the Mod group (Fig. 4E), implicat-
ing that w-3PUFAs reduces MK801-induced anxiety. The
three boxes social experiments showed that the Pre group’s
social ability was significantly restored compared with that of
MK801 rats (Fig. 4F). In the Morris water maze, the Pre group
showed a significantly decreased latency to find the hidden
platform compared with the Mod group (Fig. 4G), while the
target platform crossing (Fig. 4H) and time spent in the target
quadrant (Fig. 41) were remarkably increased, suggesting the
restoration of spatial memory. Taken together, these data dem-
onstrate that w-3PUFAs attenuate MK801-induced SZ rat
anxiety, social ability impairments, and learning and memory
deficits.
To investigate the mechanism underlying the role of w-
3PUFAs in preventing behavioral alterations, we wonder
whether w-3PUFAs play a role in synaptic plasticity, and car-
ried out some electrophysiology and neuronal integrity tests

from hippocampal slices after behavioral tests. The PPR re-
sults showed no obvious difference between the groups (Fig.
4J), suggesting that it does not affect presynaptic vesicle re-
lease. Interestingly, when we examined the AMPAR-sEPSCs
(Fig. 4K—M), no difference was observed in its frequency
among all groups (Fig. 4L); however, the amplitude of
sEPSCs, even though not different comparing with the con-
trol, was significantly enhanced in the Pre group when com-
pared with the Mod (Fig. 4M). To explore whether w-3PUFA
has an effect on the basal NUDAR-mediated synaptic trans-
mission, we calculated the NUDAR/AMPAR ratio (Fig. 4N),
and found out that this ratio was significantly increased in the
Pre group than in the model SZ group (Fig. 40). In addition,
we further examined the spine density of hippocampal neu-
rons and observed a significant increase in the dendritic spine
density of the Pre group when compared with the SZ rats
(Fig. 4P, Q). Together, these findings strongly support that
w-3PUFAs prevent hippocampal neuronal damage in
MK801-induced SZ.
w-3PUFAs Prevented the Decreased CREB Ser133
Phosphorylation Induced by MK801
An increasing number of studies reported that supplemen-
tation with long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids is ben-
eficial in promoting brain and neuronal development, and
improving cognitive function [36]; however, the mecha-
nism remains to be elucidated. We have previously found
that MK801 induced cognitive impairments via altering
the CREB/BDNEF/TrkB pathway [22]. We therefore hy-
pothesized that the w-3PUFAs might have prevented the
cognitive impairments by inducing the phosphorylation of

<q Fig. 7 CREB S133D phosphorylation mimetic mutation attenuated the
cognitive and synaptic plasticity alterations in MK801-induced schizo-
phrenia. (A) Experimental design sketch. Forty-five healthy SD rats were
randomly divided into 3 groups. In the first group (control), 15 rats were
injected with AAV9/CTR virus in hippocampal CA1 and allowed for
4 weeks expression. Another 15 rats were daily injected intraperitoneally
with MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) for 1 week to serve as model (Mod) group,
while the last 15 rats were injected of AAV9/CREB-S133D virus in
hippocampal CA1 and at the same time were intraperitoneally daily
injected with MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) for 1 week to serve as the $133D-
therapy group. Following the treatment, behavioral, electrophysiological,
and biochemical tests were performed. (B, C) Novel object recognition
test (NOR) shows the time spent exploring new object in 2 h (B) and 24h
(C). (D-F) Morris water maze test: the spatial memory was tested by
removing the platform, the representative traces searching the removed
platform on day 6 of the training (D), the time spent in the target quadrant
(E) and number of the position of the platform crossings (F) were shown.
(G, H) Hippocampal CA3-CA1 LTP was recorded by using the MED64
system. Normalized CA3-CA1 fEPSP mean slope recorded from the
CAI dendritic region in hippocampal slices. (I-K) brain tissues
(hippocampus) were homogenized, and BDNF, p-TrkB, and TRK protein
levels were detected by immunoblotting. Actin was used as a loading
control. Quantitative analysis of the BDNF (J), and p-TrkB (K) levels.
(L-N) Rat primary hippocampal neurons at DIV 9 were treated with
DMSO, MK801, and AAV9/CREB-S133D+MK801, and representative
images after treatment (L), Sholl analysis (M), quantitative analysis of
dendritic length (4), scale bar = 10 [um. 7 = 16 hippocampal neurons. All
data represent as mean + SEM. *p <0.05, **p <0.01, and ***p < 0.001
versus model
1B-C). Moreover, the electrophysiology experiments showed
that w-3PUFAs enhanced the slope of field excitatory post-
synaptic potential (fEPSP) after high-frequency stimulation
(HFS) compared with the normal control group (sFig. 1D-
E). Next, we also performed Western blotting (sFig. 1F-D
and the result showed a significant increase in BDNF and p-
CREB in w-3PUFA group compared with the control group,
while there was an upward trend in p-TrkB with no statistical
difference. Together, these data suggest that w-3PUFAs might
be beneficial to cognitive function by upregulating BDNF/
CREB pathway and synaptic plasticity.
CREB $133A Abolished the Preventive Effects
of w-3PUFAs in MK801-Induced SZ
We have shown that w-3PUFAs could improve MK801-
induced cognitive dysfunction, an effect that may be mediated
via preventing or recovering the MK801-induced decreased
Serl133 phosphorylation/activation of CREB. To further con-
firm this hypothesis, we performed a non-phosphorylation
mimic CREB (S133A, an inactivated mutation) at the
Ser133 site to investigate the mechanism. Sixty healthy SD
rats were randomly divided into 4 groups and treated as shown
in (Fig. 6A). In the control, 15 rats were injected with AAV9/
CTR virus in the hippocampal CA1 (Fig. 6B). For the model
(Mod) group, 15 rats were daily injected intraperitoneally with
MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) for 1 week. The preventive (Pre) group
are 15 rats with a 4-week intragastric gavage of fish oil
(400 mg/kg) and intraperitoneal daily injection of MK801
(0.3 mg/kg) for 1 week. The remaining 15 rats (S133A-Pre
group) were injected with AAV9/CREB-S133A virus in the
hippocampal CA1 and were intragastrically administered fish
oil (400 mg/kg) for 4 weeks and intraperitoneally daily
injected with MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) for the last 1 week.
Following the treatment, we performed a set of behavioral
tests. NOR test showed a significant decrease in the curiosity
toward new things in the $133A-Pre group when compared
with the Pre group, as suggested by the decrease in the time
spent for the exploration of new object within 2 h and 24 h
(Fig. 6C). Moreover, MWM showed a remarkable decrease in
both the time spent in the target quadrant and the number of
target platform crossing in the S133A-Pre group as compared
to the Pre group (Fig. 6D). In view of the above data, we
wonder whether the Ser133 residue of CREB plays a role in
Pre group synaptic plasticity. We therefore carried out electro-
physiology experiments and found that w-3PUFAs enhanced
the slope of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (fEPSP)
after high-frequency stimulation (HFS) compared with the
SZ Mod group (Fig. 6E). Interestingly, we observed that in
the $133A-Pre group, the slope of field excitatory postsynap-
tic potential (fEPSP) was lower than that in the Pre group (Fig.
6F). In addition, we further examined the spine density of
hippocampal neurons (Fig. 6G). The Golgi staining showed
a significant decrease in the dendritic spine density of the
S$133A-Pre rats compared with the Pre group (Fig. 6H). We
also performed Western blotting (Fig. 6I-K) and the result
showed a significant decrease in BDNF (Fig. 6J) and p-TrkB
(Fig. 6K) in the $133A-Pre group compared with the Pre
group, further suggesting the importance of CREB Ser133 in
synaptic plasticity. These results together imply that Ser133
phosphorylation of the CREB is required for the w-3PUFA-
mediated beneficial effect in MK801-induced SZ.
CREB $133D Improved Cognitive Dysfunction
in MK801-Induced Schizophrenia
To test whether CREB Ser133 is a therapeutic site for SZ-
induced cognitive impairments, we also performed a phos-
phorylation mimic (S133D, an activated mutation) at the
CREB Ser133 site. We used 45 healthy SD rats randomly
divided into 3 groups. In the first group (control), 15 rats were
injected with AAV9/CTR virus in hippocampal CA1 and
allowed for 4 weeks expression. Another 15 rats were daily
injected intraperitoneally with MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) for 1 week
to serve as model (Mod) group, while the last 15 rats were
injected of AAV9/CREB-S133D virus in hippocampal CA1
and at the same time were intraperitoneally daily injected with
MK801 (0.3 mg/kg) for 1 week to serve as the $133D-therapy
group, and allowed for a total period of 4 weeks (Fig. 7A).
Following the treatment, we again performed a couple of

behavioral tests. The results of the NOR showed that in the
$133D group, the curiosity for exploring new things was sig-
nificantly increased, as indicated by the increased time spent
discovering a new object within 2 h (Fig. 7B) and 24 h (Fig.
7C) when compared with the Mod group. Similarly, the
MWM (Fig. 7D) revealed a remarkably increased time in the
target quadrant (Fig. 7E) and increased number of target plat-
form crossing (Fig. 7F) in the $133D group. Moreover, the
fEPSP slope following HFS was found to be higher in $133D
rats compared with the MK801 group (Fig. 7G, H). Western
blotting (Fig. 71) further validated this result as it shows a
significant increase in BDNF (Fig. 7J) and p-TrkB (Fig. 7K)
in the S133D group compared with the Mod group. Similarly,
hippocampal primary neurons were transduced with AAV9/
CREB-S133D virus and treated with MK 801 on the ninth day,
and AAV9/GFP was used to examine dendritic morphology
(Fig. 7L). CREB-S133D resulted in an obvious increase in the
dendritic complexity at all points farther than 60 um from the
cell body when compared with MK801 treated neurons (Fig.
7M, N). These data indicated that the dephosphorylation of
Ser133 residue of CREB is the mechanism whereby MK801
mediates its deleterious effect in the MK801-induced SZ,
supporting CREB Ser133 might be a potential therapeutic site
for SZ-induced cognitive alterations.
Discussion
Schizophrenia is a complex condition associated with cogni-
tive impairments [37, 38], and is increasingly becoming more
prevalent with its burden more and more heavy in China [39,
40] and the world [41]. Its etiopathogenesis is still unclear and
the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown, mak-
ing its treatment and preventive measures very limited, impos-
ing a heavy burden on patients and their families. Therefore,
actively exploring the molecular mechanism of cognitive im-
pairments in schizophrenia will pave the way toward the pre-
ventive and treatment measures which are the fundamental
ways to improve the quality of life of patients.
Cognitive impairments are more likely to affect the prog-
nosis outcome than psychotic symptoms, which impair the
professional social activities of patients and seriously affecting
their quality of life [42]. Thus, improving the cognitive func-
tion becomes imperative as it may contribute to the treatment
and prevention of schizophrenia. w-3PUFA is an essential
nutrient and has been shown to improve cognitive impair-
ments in Alzheimer disease (AD) patients [43]. So, we won-
dered whether w-3PUFAs can improve the cognitive function
in SZ and play a role in prevention. In this study, we investi-
gated the preventive effect of w-3PUFAs in MK801-induced
SZ in rats and its related mechanisms. We found that MK801
leads to the impairments of learning and memory ability of the
injected rats and that w-3PUFAs can improve cognitive

dysfunction by antagonizing the MK801-induced SZ-like al-
terations. BDNF is an important neurotrophin that play a cru-
cial role in the brain development and involved in learning and
memory via the CREB/BDNEF/TrkB pathway [22], in which
BDNF binding to TrkB enhances itself autophosphorylation
[33, 34] and in turn activates the Ras-MAPK pathway, and
finally activates CREB by inducing its phosphorylation at the
Ser133 site. CREB activation promotes synaptic plasticity and
neurogenesis by increasing the expression of the BDNF gene
[35]. Moreover, w-3PUFAs can upregulate CREB phosphor-
ylation which regulates the expression of multiple proteins
involved in memory [23]. In the present study, we found
MK801-induced SZ could cause cognitive impairments ac-
companying with CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway dysfunction,
BDNF deficiency, and synaptic dysfunction, all of which were
abrogated by w-3PUFAs, suggesting that downregulation of
CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway might mediate SZ-associated
cognitive impairments. We therefore further focus on the
CREB/BDNEF/TrkB pathway. Our study demonstrated that
MK801 reduces the protein level of p-CREB resulting in a
subsequent downregulation of BDNF and p-TrkB in the hip-
pocampus of injected rats. Interestingly, these effects were
prevented by prior administration of w-3PUFAs. CREB phos-
phorylation at Ser133 is crucial for its activation and the
downstream effects. We thus used the AAV9/CREB-S133A
(non-phosphorylation mutation) to inject the rats in the hippo-
campal CAI region and found out that the non-
phosphorylated CREB abolished the recovery beneficial ef-
fect of w-3PUFAs, resulting in behavioral and cognitive im-
pairments, and decrease protein levels of BDNF and p-TrkB.
Moreover, Golgi staining revealed a decrease in the total den-
sity of dendritic spines following AAV9/CREB-S133A injec-
tion in the rats. Next, we also used AAV9/CREB-S133D
(phosphorylation mutation) to inject the hippocampal CA1
region, and discovered that this effectively improved the cog-
nitive dysfunction and increased the protein level of both
BDNF and p-TrkB. In addition, AAV9/GFP immunofluores-
cence staining showed an increase in the dendritic complexity
in the AAV9/CREB-S133D-transduced primary hippocampal
neurons. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that w-
3PUFAs regulate CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway by inducing
the phosphorylation of CREB Ser133, thereby activating
CREB which leads to increased synaptic plasticity, and re-
duced hippocampal neuronal loss, and thus antagonizes the
MK801-induced SZ cognition dysfunction in rats. This study
provides a basis of the molecular mechanism associated with
memory and cognitive impairments in MK801-induced SZ
and gives an insight for the treatment and prevention of SZ
by w-3PUFAs.
