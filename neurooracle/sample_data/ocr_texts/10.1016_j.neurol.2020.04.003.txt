COVID-19 may induce Guillain-
Barré syndrome
Check for
updates
A 64-year-old man without medical history was admitted to
our hospital after he fell and hurt his left shoulder leading to a
tear of the rotator cuff. He had fever and cough for two days. In
the context of COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on
nasopharyngeal swab was performed and positive. Clinical
presentation was moderate with high grade fever for three
days requiring oxygen 2-3 L/min through nasal cannula for
five days. He received paracetamol, preventing thromboem-
bolism by low molecular weight heparin and lopinavir/
ritonavir 400/100 mg twice a day for ten days. Thoracic CT
scan showed only 10-25% of ground glass opacities.
Eleven days after the symptom onset, while he did not need
oxygen anymore having had no fever for five days, the patient
complained of paresthesia in feet and hands. In three days, he
installed a flaccid severe tetraparesia. MRC strength evaluation
was 2/5 in the legs, 2/5 the arms, 3/5 in the forearms and 4/5 in
the hands. Tendon reflexes were abolished in the four limbs.
The 128 Hz tuning fork test was negative in the lower limbs and
lightly felt in the upper limbs. Facial muscles were normal. The
patient complained swallowing disturbance with a risk of
suffocation as liquids took the wrong path. The patient was
admitted in ICU and mechanically ventilated because of
respiratory insufficiency. An intravenous immunoglobulin
treatment (0,4 g/kg per day during 5 days) was initiated.
Electrodiagnostic tests five days after neurological symp-
tom onset showed a demyelinating pattern in accordance with
Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) criteria (Table 1) [1]. On needle
examination, no rest activity was observed and during muscle
contraction, only one single motor unit was recorded with a
firing rate up to 25 Hz in the right tibialis anterior, the nght
vastus lateralis, the left first interosseus and the left deltoideus
muscles.
On CSF analysis, protein level was 1.66 g per liter and cell
count normal. Anti-gangliosides antibodies were absent in the
serum. Biological tests were not in favor of a recent infection
with Campylobacter jejuni, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Salmo-
nella enterica, CMV, EBV, HSV1 & 2, VZV, Influenza virus A & B,
VIH, and hepatitis E.
COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide disaster. Pulmonary
disorder and respiratory insufficiency are the main problems
linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, which explains difficulties in
ICU to treat numerous patients [2]. Recently, Zhao et al.
questioned the link between COVID-19 and GBS [3]. Our case is
the first GBS with a chronology undoubtedly in favor of a
complication of COVID-19 infection. This must be known by
clinicians as GBS may lead to ICU admission and needs to be
differentiated from a possible ICU-acquired weakness after
ICU treatments.

Covid-19 and Guillain-Barré
syndrome:
e e Check fo
More than a coincidence! Se
A 70-year-old woman, receiving 7.5mg prednisone as a
maintenance therapy for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), presented
with a rapidly, bilateral weakness and tingling sensation in all
four extremities resulting in a total functional disability within
48 hours. The patient denied any sphincter disturbances,
dyspnea or swallowing difficulties. She first received a
diagnosis of RA exacerbation but no improvement was seen
after corticosteroids increase. At admission to our Neurology
department, at the tenth day of symptom’s onset (Apmil 13),
neurological examination showed quadriplegia, hypotonia,
areflexia and bilateral positive Laségue sign. Cranial nerves
were intact. Temperature, lung and cardiac auscultation were,
also normal. On April ist, three days prior to the ongoing
symptom’s onset, the patient presented an episode of dry
cough without dyspnea or fever, spontaneously resolving
within 48 hours. Initial blood tests showed no abnormality,
except for a lymphocytopenia (520/ml, normal: 1500-5000). A
nerve conduction study (NCS), on day 10, revealed a marked
reduction or absence of electrical potentials in both motor and
sensory nerves in all four limbs, with little or no abnormalities
in conduction velocities and latencies. The needle electro-
myography (EMG) found diffuse and abundant fibrillation
potentials at rest. These findings were consistent with an
Acute Motor and Sensory Axonal Neuropathy (AMSAN) subtype
of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). CSF analysis showed
increased protein level at 1g per liter (normal range: 0,2-0,4)
with normal white blood cell count. Chest CT (day 10) revealed
ground-glass opacities in the left lung (Fig. 1). SARS-CoV-2 on
Fig. 1 - Chest computer tomography revealed a ground-
glass opacities in the upper lobe of the left lung.
RT-PCR assay was positive at oropharyngeal swab (day 10),
negative in CSF. The patient was treated with intravenous
immunoglobulin (2 g/kg for 5 days) and a combination of
Hydroxychloroquine (600mg per day) and Azithromycine
(500 mg at the first day, then 250 mg per day). No significant
neurological improvement is seen after one week of treatment.
The Covid-19 infection hides many secrets that are yet to be
revealed and little is known about its neurological manifesta-
tions. Here, we describe a case of a patient with mild
respiratory symptoms linked to a COVID-19 infection, follo-
wed by a rapidly evolving quadriplegia arguing for a SARS-
Cov-2-induced GBS. A negative PCR analysis in the CSF
supports a post infectious, dysimmune mechanism.
Zhao et al. [1] reported the case of a 61-year-old man who
presented with an Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Poly-
neuropathy (AIDP) subtype of GBS, associated with SARS-
Cov-2 infection. Being the first reported case, the authors
questioned the cause-effect relationship between both
events, since respiratory symptoms appeared after GBS’s
onset. After this first case, we found three other reports
published to date. Camdessanche et al. [2] described a case of
AIDP GBS subtype in a 64-year-old man, while the case of
Sedaghat and Karim [3] resembled ours, an AMSAN form.
Toscano et al. [4] reported a series of five patients from three
Italian hospitals. Their findings were consistent with an
axonal variant in three patients and with demyelinating
process in two patients.
We add to the literature another case of GBS related to a
Covid-19 infection. All these cases argues that SARS-Cov-2
virus could be a triggering factor of GBS. Since mild
respiratory symptoms were noted in our patient, we suggest
that allnewly diagnosed Guillain-Barré cases should be tested
for a Covid-19 infection in the current pandemic, even if they
lack respiratory complaints. This would probably result in
larger series and would help clarify the spectrum of this
neurological condition.
