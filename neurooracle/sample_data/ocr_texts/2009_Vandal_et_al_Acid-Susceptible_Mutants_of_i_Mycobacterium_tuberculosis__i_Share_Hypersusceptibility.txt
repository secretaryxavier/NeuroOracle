Mycobacterium tuberculosis can persist in macrophage phagosomes that acidify to a pH of 4.5 after activation of
the macrophage with gamma interferon. How the bacterium resists the low pH of the acidiﬁed phagosome is
incompletely understood. A screen of 10,100 M. tuberculosis transposon mutants for mutants hypersensitive to pH
4.5 led to the discovery of 21 genes whose disruption attenuated survival of M. tuberculosis at a low pH (41). Here,
we show that acid-sensitive M. tuberculosis mutants with transposon insertions in Rv2136c, Rv2224c, ponA2, and lysX
were hypersensitive to antibiotics, sodium dodecyl sulfate, heat shock, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen interme-
diates, indicating that acid resistance can be associated with protection against other forms of stress. The Rv2136c
mutant was impaired in intrabacterial pH homeostasis and unable to maintain a neutral intrabacterial pH in
activated macrophages. The Rv2136c, Rv2224c, and ponA2 mutants were attenuated in mice, with the Rv2136c
mutant displaying the most severe level of attenuation. Pathways utilized by M. tuberculosis for acid resistance and
intrabacterial pH maintenance are potential targets for chemotherapy.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an intracellular pathogen that
encounters acidic environments during the course of infection.
M. tuberculosis is able to arrest fusion of phagosomes with
acidic lysosomes so that they reside in a mildly acidic compart-
ment with a pH of 6.2 in nonactivated macrophages (1, 26,
38). After activation of macrophages with gamma interferon
(IFN-), phagosomes fuse with lysosomes, and the M. tuber-
culosis bacterium-containing compartment acidiﬁes to a pH of
4.5 (26, 35, 36, 42). M. tuberculosis is able to maintain its
intrabacterial pH (pHIB) and survive in activated macrophages
and thus possesses resistance against the acidity of the phagoly-
sosome (41).
Mechanisms of survival at a low pH have been extensively
explored in many enteric pathogens, which must resist the
harsh acidity of the stomach (pHs 2 to 3) in order to establish
infection (16, 27). Exposure of Escherichia coli and Salmonella
enterica to mildly acidic conditions protects the bacteria against
a more extreme acid challenge. Induction of this acid tolerance
response is believed to be important for virulence. In compar-
ison, little is known about acid resistance in M. tuberculosis,
and its role in virulence needs to be better understood. An M.
tuberculosis mutant lacking OmpAtb, a pH-dependent porin
(29), was sensitive to low pH in vitro and attenuated in mac-
rophages and in mice (31). M. tuberculosis requires MgtC, a
putative magnesium transporter, for growth at an acidic pH
when magnesium concentrations are limited (4). This suggests
that import of magnesium may be required at low pH; how-
ever, it has been shown that Salmonella’s MgtC does not func-
tion as an Mg2 transporter (20), and the transport function of
M. tuberculosis’s MgtC remains to be examined. The M. tuber-
culosis mgtC mutant is attenuated in macrophages and mice
(4). These reports suggest that resistance to low pH is required
for virulence; however, the mutants may also be sensitive to
other components of the host immune response, and this may
contribute to their attenuation in vivo.
Recently, we identiﬁed 21 M. tuberculosis transposon mu-
tants that are hypersensitive to pH 4.5 (41). These mutants
were attenuated in acidiﬁed 7H9 growth medium containing
Tween 80. When Tween 80 was replaced with the detergent
tyloxapol, only 5 of the 21 mutants retained sensitivity to acid.
It is possible either that Tween 80 increased the permeability
of the M. tuberculosis cell envelope to protons or that oleic
acid, which can be hydrolyzed from Tween 80, became myco-
bactericidal at low pH. The ﬁve M. tuberculosis mutants that
were hypersensitive to pH 4.5 in 7H9 medium irrespective of
the detergent utilized contained transposon insertions in the
genes Rv3671c, Rv2136c, Rv2224c, ponA2, and lysX (41). Only
two of the 21 acid-sensitive mutants, the Rv3671c and Rv2136c
mutants, were hypersensitive to acidiﬁed phosphate-citrate
buffer (pH 4.5). All ﬁve mutants grew normally in vitro in 7H9
growth medium at pH 6.6 (41). The Rv3671c mutant was
unable to maintain a neutral pHIB in vitro and in activated
macrophages and was attenuated in vivo, whereas the lysX
mutant was able to maintain its pHIB and was fully virulent
(41). Here, we characterize the Rv2136c, Rv2224c, ponA2, and
lysX acid-sensitive mutants for additional defects in vitro and
assess the virulence of the Rv2136c, Rv2224c, and ponA2 mu-
tants in mice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains and media. M. tuberculosis transposon mutants were isolated in a
screen for acid-sensitive mutants described previously (41). M. tuberculosis
strains were grown at 37°C in a humidiﬁed incubator with 5% CO2 in Middle-
brook 7H9 medium (Difco) containing 0.2% glycerol, 0.5% bovine serum albu-

min, 0.2% dextrose, 0.085% NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 80 or in Middlebrook 7H10
medium or 7H11 agar (Difco) containing 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-
catalase (Becton Dickinson). The Rv2224c mutant showed slightly reduced
growth on 7H11 agar and was cultured on 7H10 medium.
Antibiotic susceptibility assays. M. tuberculosis strains were grown to early log
phase and diluted to an optical density at 580 nm of 0.01 in enriched 7H9
medium containing Tween 80. Bacteria were then exposed to twofold dilutions of
erythromycin, rifampin, chloramphenicol, ethambutol, isoniazid, and streptomy-
cin (Sigma-Aldrich). The MIC was recorded as the minimum concentration at
which no growth was observed after 2 to 3 weeks.
Measurement of sensitivity to SDS. M. tuberculosis strains were grown to early
log phase, a 10-fold dilution series was made from optical densities at 580 nm of
0.01 to 0.0001, and 5 l was spotted onto 7H10 or 7H11 agar plates containing
10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase with or without 0.01% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS).
Measurement of sensitivity to heat, lysozyme, hydrogen peroxide, and nitric
oxide. Early-log-phase cultures were centrifuged at 3,000  g for 8 min and
washed with enriched 7H9 medium containing 0.02% tyloxapol at a pH of 7.0.
They were then centrifuged at 120  g for 10 min to remove clumps. Single-cell
suspensions were adjusted to 5  106 CFU/ml in enriched 7H9 medium
containing 0.02% tyloxapol at a pH of 7.0. The bacteria were incubated at 45°C
for 24 h to measure sensitivity to heat, at 37°C for 2 h with 2,500 g/ml lysozyme,
or at 37°C for 2 or 4 h with 5 mM H2O2 (Sigma-Aldrich). To measure sensitivity
to nitric oxide, the bacteria were incubated at 37°C with diethylenetriamine
NONOate (DETA-NO) (Cayman Chemicals) for 3 days. DETA-NO (200 M)
was added every 24 h on days 0, 1, and 2. Numbers of CFU were determined by
plating serial dilutions onto 7H10 or 7H11 agar plates. Percent survival was
calculated by dividing the number of output CFU by the mean number of input
CFU and then multiplying by 100.
Complementation. Rv2224c including the 300-bp region upstream of the start
codon was cloned on an integrative vector conferring streptomycin resistance.
The Rv2224c mutant was transformed by electroporation, and transformants
were selected with 20 g/ml streptomycin.
pHIB measurements. Measurements were performed as previously described
(41). Ratiometric pH-sensitive green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) (28) was cloned
downstream of the mycobacterial promoter Psmyc and transformed into M. tu-
berculosis strains. Bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages (BMDMs) from 8-
to 10-week-old C57BL/6 mice were differentiated in Dulbecco modiﬁed Eagle
medium (GibcoBRL) supplemented with 20% L-cell conditioned medium, 10%
fetal bovine serum, 0.58 g/liter L-glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate, and 10 mM HEPES,
providing a nearly pure macrophage population as assessed by morphology and
cell surface staining of CD14, F4/80, FcRII/III, and MHC II molecules, the last
one after IFN- activation. BMDMs were seeded at 1.5  105 cells in glass
bottom no. 1.5 thickness poly-D-lysine-coated 35-mm culture dishes (MatTek).
BMDMs were infected with single-cell suspensions of M. tuberculosis strains at a
multiplicity of infection of 2:1 (2 M. tuberculosis bacteria per 1 macrophage) for
2 h, after which extracellular bacteria were removed by washing the plates twice
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For microscopy, cells were washed twice
with PBS and placed in Dulbecco modiﬁed Eagle medium without phenol red
(GibcoBRL), supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum, 0.58 g/liter L-glutamine,
1 mM Na-pyruvate, and 10 mM HEPES. Microscopy was performed using a
Leica DMIRB inverted ﬂuorescence microscope ﬁtted with a 63 objective,
1.4-numerical-aperture lens and Chroma Technology Corp pH-sensitive GFP
ﬁlter set (exciters D410/30 and D470/20, beamsplitter 500dcxr, emitter 535/
50m). Image acquisition and analysis were performed using a Photometrics
CoolSnap HQ digital camera and MetaMorph v.6.2r6 image analysis software
(Universal Imaging Corporation, Downingtown, PA). All images within an ex-
periment were acquired and analyzed under identical conditions. For display in
histograms, average bacterial-group (1 to 5 bacteria) ratio intensities were de-
termined. The pHIB was derived by interpolating the 410/470 ratios on a standard
curve.
Mouse infections. C57BL/6 8-week-old female mice (Jackson Laboratories)
were infected by aerosol using a Middlebrook inhalation exposure system (Glas-
Col) and early-log-phase M. tuberculosis cultures as single-cell suspensions in
PBS to deliver 100 to 200 bacilli per mouse or more where stated. Serial
dilutions of organ homogenates from four or ﬁve mice per data point were plated
onto 7H10 or 7H11 agar plates to quantify CFUs. The upper left lobes of
infected lungs were ﬁxed in 10% buffered formalin. Procedures involving mice
were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Com-
mittee of Weill Cornell Medical College.
Statistics. The unpaired, two-tailed t test was used to assess the statistical
signiﬁcance of the comparison of experimental groups using GraphPad Prism
software (http://www.graphpad.com).
RESULTS
Sensitivity of mutants to antibiotics, SDS, heat shock, and
lysozyme. Figure 1 shows the genomic organization and trans-
poson insertion sites of the acid-sensitive mutants. In the
screen, we isolated six independent mutants with transposon
insertions in ponA2 and four mutants with transposon inser-
tions in lysX (41). We focused on the mutants with the most
N-terminal transposon insertions for phenotypic characteriza-
tions. We ﬁrst examined the acid-sensitive M. tuberculosis mu-
tants for defects associated with their cell wall. A cell wall
permeability defect may result in enhanced penetration of pro-
tons into the cytosol of these mutants and hence make them
susceptible to acid. We used hypersensitivity to lipophilic an-
tibiotics as a measure of a cell wall permeability defect, based
on the observation that the Mycobacterium marinum kasB mu-
tant exhibits increased cell wall permeability and also en-
hanced susceptibility to lipophilic antibiotics (18). Previously,
the Rv3671c and lysX mutants were shown to be hypersensitive
to lipophilic antibiotics (41). Compared to wild-type M. tuber-
culosis, the Rv2136c, Rv2224c, and ponA2 mutants were hy-
persensitive to the lipophilic antibiotics erythromycin (2- to
32-fold-lower MICs) and rifampin (2- to 8-fold-lower MICs)
and were either not more sensitive or at most had twofold-
lower MICs for the lipophilic antibiotic chloramphenicol and
the nonlipophilic antibiotics ethambutol, isoniazid and strep-
tomycin (Table 1). Of the three mutants tested, the Rv2136c
mutant was as sensitive to both lipophilic and nonlipophilic
antibiotics as an M. tuberculosis erp transposon mutant
(Rv3810). Erp is believed to be required for the maintenance
of mycobacterial cell wall integrity, and the M. marinum erp
mutant is also hypersensitive to lipophilic antibiotics (8, 10).
The Rv2136c and Rv2224c mutants were also hypersensitive
to the cell wall-perturbing detergent SDS, whereas the ponA2
and lysX mutants grew like wild-type M. tuberculosis in the
presence of SDS (Fig. 2A and B). The Rv2224c mutant also
grew more slowly than wild-type M. tuberculosis on 7H11 agar
plates in the absence of SDS (Fig. 2B). Complementation of
the Rv2224c mutant with a single copy of the Rv2224c wild
type restored growth of the mutant on agar (Fig. 2B), sensi-
tivity to SDS (Fig. 2B), and its survival at pH 4.5 (not shown).
The Rv2136c and ponA2 mutants were killed 11-fold and

sevenfold more, respectively, than wild-type M. tuberculosis,
after exposure to heat (Fig. 3). Sensitivity to heat may be due
to an impaired heat shock response or to an aberrant pepti-
doglycan layer, as E. coli mutants with defects in peptidoglycan
biosynthesis have been reported to be thermosensitive (9, 14,
39). Compared to wild-type M. tuberculosis, only the ponA2
mutant was killed sixfold more after exposure to lysozyme,
whereas the Rv2136c, Rv2224c, and lysX mutants were not
hypersensitive to this enzyme (Fig. 4).
Despite sensitivity to cell wall stresses, none of the mutants
displayed an evident cording or colony morphology defect, and
individual cells were morphologically similar to wild-type M.
tuberculosis when visualized by scanning or transmission elec-
tron microscopy (not shown).
Sensitivity of mutants to oxidative and nitrosative stress.
Macrophages produce both reactive oxygen and nitrogen in-
termediates (ROIs and RNIs, respectively) as defenses against
microbial pathogens. RNIs and ROIs become more potent at
an acidic pH (22, 37). To examine for increased sensitivity to
oxidative and nitrosative stress independently of the acid sen-
sitivity, the mutants were exposed to H2O2 and the nitric oxide
donor DETA-NO at a pH of 7. After exposure to H2O2, the
Rv2136c, Rv2224c, and ponA2 mutants were killed 19-, 13-,
and 11-fold more, respectively, than wild-type M. tuberculosis.
The lysX mutant survived at a rate similar to that of wild-type
M. tuberculosis in the presence of H2O2 (Fig. 5A). After expo-
sure to DETA-NO, the Rv2136c and Rv2224c mutants were
killed eight- and sevenfold more, respectively, than was wild-
type M. tuberculosis, whereas the titers of lysX and ponA2
mutants were not signiﬁcantly lower than that of wild-type M.
tuberculosis (Fig. 5B). The complemented Rv2224c mutant
also survived at a rate similar to that of wild-type M. tubercu-
losis after exposure to H2O2 and DETA-NO (Fig. 5C).
Measurement of pHIB. In our previous study, we demon-
strated that the Rv3671c and Rv2136c mutants were unable to
maintain their pHIB in buffer at pH 4.5, whereas the Rv2224c,
lysX, and ponA2 mutants had no marked defect compared to
wild-type M. tuberculosis (41). Here, we tested the Rv2136c
mutant for its ability to maintain its pHIB in macrophages by
transforming the strains with pH-sensitive ratiometric GFP
(28). Like the Rv3671c mutant, the Rv2136c mutant was un-
able to maintain its pHIB in IFN--activated macrophages but
displayed no defect in pHIB maintenance in nonactivated mac-

rophages (Fig. 6A and B). In nonactivated macrophages, the
majority of both wild-type M. tuberculosis and Rv2136c mutant
bacteria had pHIB levels of 6.76 to 7.25 (Fig. 6A). In IFN--
activated macrophages, wild-type M. tuberculosis maintained
its pHIB between 6.76 and 7.25, whereas 61% of Rv2136c
mutant bacteria were at a pHIB of 6.75 (Fig. 6B).
Growth and survival in mice. Finally we measured growth
and survival of the mutants in mice after aerosol infection. The
Rv2136c mutant was severely attenuated in mouse lungs and
spleens compared to wild-type M. tuberculosis (Fig. 7A and B).
Growth during the acute phase of infection between days 1 and
21 was severely impaired, and after day 21, the mutant was
cleared such that no bacteria were detected in lungs and
spleens at day 56 of infection (Fig. 7A and B). The Rv2136c
mutant also induced markedly reduced gross pathology in
mouse lungs (Fig. 7C). The ponA2 mutant displayed milder
attenuation (Fig. 7A, B, and C). At day 56 postinfection, ap-
proximately 16- and 10-fold-fewer ponA2 mutant bacteria than
wild-type M. tuberculosis bacteria were found in lungs and
spleens, respectively. The Rv2224c mutant was also attenuated
in mice, but only by threefold in lungs at day 56 and day 150
(Fig. 7D and E). Complementation of the Rv2224c mutant
with a single copy of the wild-type allele restored this defect in
virulence. The complemented Rv2224c strain grew to higher
titers than did wild-type M. tuberculosis; the mechanism that
caused increased replication remains to be determined.
DISCUSSION
M. tuberculosis can reside in phagosomes that fuse with lyso-
somes and acidify to a pH of 4.5 in activated macrophages (21,
34). Because M. tuberculosis survives in the acidic phagolyso-
somes of activated macrophage, we sought to identify genes
required by M. tuberculosis to resist low pH. In a previous
study, we screened 10,100 M. tuberculosis transposon mutants
and isolated 21 mutants that were hypersensitive to a pH of 4.5.
The majority of these mutants exhibited reduced survival at pH
4.5 in 7H9 medium only in the presence of Tween 80. How-
ever, ﬁve mutants with transposon insertions in Rv3671c,
Rv2136c, lysX, Rv2224c, and ponA2 were attenuated at pH 4.5
in 7H9 growth medium containing either the detergent Tween
80 or tyloxapol. In the present study, we report the further
characterization of the Rv2136c, Rv2224c, ponA2, and lysX
mutants.

biotics, displaying the same degree of sensitivity as an M. tu-
berculosis erp mutant, and was also attenuated after exposure
to SDS, heat, H2O2, or DETA-NO. In an earlier report, we
observed that this mutant was unable to maintain its pHIB in
acid in vitro (41), and here, we show that it is also unable to
maintain its pHIB in IFN--activated macrophages. The hyper-
sensitivity of the Rv2136c mutant to low pH, oxidative and
nitrosative stress, and a possible cell wall defect may explain its
severe attenuation in vivo. The Rv2136c protein is a homolog
of Escherichia coli BacA (7). BacA has now been named UppP
because it is an undecaprenol pyrophosphate phosphatase (13)
and not an undecaprenol kinase as was originally thought (5).
Undecaprenol pyrophosphate serves as a lipid carrier and
binds to disaccharide-pentapeptide peptidoglycan subunits to
form lipid II. The subunits are transported across the lipid
bilayer for polymerization into mature peptidoglycan. Unde-
caprenol pyrophosphate is then dephosphorylated by UppP
and recycled for use in the pathway. These steps of peptidogly-
can biosynthesis are considered to be attractive drug targets,
and lipid II is targeted by at least four classes of natural prod-
uct antibiotics (3). Deletion of BacA homologs in Staphylococ-
cus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae attenuates the bac-
teria in the mouse model of infection (6). A Mycobacterium
smegmatis mutant deﬁcient in the Rv2136c homolog was also
attenuated for virulence in a mouse model of smegma devel-
opment (33). We were unable to complement the Rv2136c
mutant with a single copy of the gene or the putative operon
(Rv2133 to Rv2137). Rose et al. (33) were also unable to fully
complement all phenotypes of the M. smegmatis Rv2136c mu-
tant, suggesting that optimal expression of the single gene or
operon is required for restoration of phenotypes. We con-
ﬁrmed that the Rv2136c mutant contains a single transposon
insertion by Southern blotting (not shown), but it is possible
that a secondary mutation on the chromosome may be causing
the defects we observed. However, it is tempting to speculate
that the aforementioned pathways of peptidoglycan biosynthe-
sis are required for resistance to low pH because a Streptococ-
cus mutans strain deﬁcient in an undecaprenol kinase was also
sensitive to acid (24, 43).
Flores and colleagues isolated a 	-lactam-hypersensitive M.
smegmatis mutant in expA, an Rv2224c homolog, that had
swollen termini and showed increased sensitivity to lysozyme
(15). It was proposed that ExpA is either directly or indirectly
involved in cell wall remodeling and may regulate autolysis
(15). In M. tuberculosis, Rv2224c protein is detected in the cell
envelope (25), and its expression is upregulated during nutri-

ACID RESISTANCE IN MYCOBACTERIUM TUBERCULOSIS

ent starvation (2) and in THP-1 macrophage-like cells (12). In
the absence of Rv2224c protein, M. tuberculosis elicited lower
levels of proinﬂammatory cytokines and chemokines from
macrophages and exhibited reduced growth in macrophages
(32). Rv2224c protein was also shown to be important for M.
tuberculosis virulence in mice (25, 32). Although Rv2224c pro-
tein is annotated as a putative protease, Lun and Bishai were
unable to observe cleavage of protein substrates in vitro and
demonstrated that Rv2224c protein possesses esterase activity
(25). Rengarajan et al. observed reduced processing of the cell
wall heat shock protein GroEL2 in the Rv2224c mutant, but
whether GroEL2 is directly processed by Rv2224c protein re-
mains to be examined (32). We found that the Rv2224c mutant
was sensitive to antibiotics, SDS, heat, and oxidative and ni-
trosative stress and conﬁrmed that the mutant is attenuated in
vivo. The Rv2224c mutant displayed normal cell morphology
by scanning and transmission electron microscopy and was not
markedly susceptible to exposure to lysozyme.
PonA2 is predicted to have transglycosylase and transpepti-
dase activities, and it is believed to be involved in peptidogly-
can biosynthesis (7). Flores et al. isolated an M. tuberculosis
mutant with a transposon insertion in ponA2 that was hyper-
susceptible to 	-lactam antibiotics, suggesting that the mutant
has a deﬁciency in its peptidoglycan layer (15). Mycobacteria
have two types of peptide cross-links in their peptidoglycan,
the 433 (diaminopimelic acid [DAP]-Ala) linkage and the
more unusual 333 (DAP-DAP) linkage. It has been predicted
that PonA2 may be involved in the formation of the 333
meso-diaminopimelate linkage (15, 19). The 333 linkage may
be required during periods of slow growth, such as stationary
phase, because the number of these cross bridges increases
over 433 linkages in slow-growing E. coli and in M. tubercu-
losis during stationary phase (11, 23, 40). We found that al-
though the M. tuberculosis ponA2 mutant was not markedly
sensitive to antibiotics or SDS, it was more sensitive to heat,
H2O2, and NO than was wild-type M. tuberculosis and attenu-
ated in mouse lungs and spleens.
M. tuberculosis possesses two genes, lysS and lysX, annotated
as lysine tRNA synthetases, LysS and LysX (7). Unlike LysS,
LysX contains a predicted N-terminal transmembrane domain.
LysX may contribute to peptidoglycan peptide bridge forma-
tion, as has been shown for tRNA synthetases of other bacteria
(30). Alternatively, a deﬁciency in lysX may lead to accumula-
tion of lysine and feedback inhibition of the lysine biosynthetic
pathway. As diaminopimelate is an intermediate in this path-
way and also a key component of M. tuberculosis’s peptidogly-
can pentapeptide bridge, a blockage in lysine biosynthesis may
lead to peptidoglycan defects. Compared to the other mutants
studied in this report, the lysX mutant showed only moderately
increased sensitivity to SDS, heat, H2O2, and DETA-NO. The
lysX mutant was, however, hypersensitive to the lipophilic an-
tibiotics erythromycin and rifampin but was not attenuated in
mice (41).
All of the acid-sensitive mutants studied in this report ap-
pear to have some defect in the function of their cell wall, as
they were sensitive to certain lipophilic antibiotics and SDS.
Three of the four mutants were also hypersensitive to oxidative
or nitrosative stress at neutral pH. These data indicate that
some mechanisms that confer resistance to acid also provide
cross protection against other forms of extracellular stress and
reinforce the important role of M. tuberculosis’s cell wall in
protection against diverse stresses. In Salmonella, acid shock
induces cross protection against a variety of other stresses,
such as heat, oxidative stress, and osmotic stress (17). The
Rv2136c mutant was unable to maintain a neutral pHIB in
acidic buffer in vitro (41) and in IFN--activated macrophages
and was severely attenuated in vivo. The same was observed for
the Rv3671c mutant (41), suggesting that the inability to main-
tain a neutral pHIB is associated with severe attenuation in
mice. Phagolysosomal acid synergizes with various components
of the host immune response, such as lysosomal hydrolases and
reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The ponA2, Rv2224c,
and Rv2136c mutants may be attenuated during infection be-
cause they succumb to the low pH of the phagosome, cell wall
damage, and/or nitrosative and oxidative defenses issued by
the host. Thus, pathways utilized by Mycobacterium tuberculosis
for acid resistance and pHIB homeostasis are attractive che-
motherapeutic targets.
