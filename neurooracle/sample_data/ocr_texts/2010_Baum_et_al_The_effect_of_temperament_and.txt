Abstract
The present study is part of a larger project that seeks to identify factors that predict children’s
behavioral, social, and cognitive adaptation to epilepsy. Children with seizures are more likely to
have internalizing and externalizing behavior problems than either healthy children or children
with other chronic illnesses. The present research examines risk factors for behavior problems.
Early temperament and neuropsychological functioning, specifically executive function and
language abilities, are evaluated as unique and moderating predictors of adverse behavioral
outcomes in 229 children with a first recognized seizure. Parents assessed temperament, children
were administered neuropsychological tests, and teachers evaluated behavior 36 months after
seizure onset. Results revealed that early temperament and neuropsychological functioning,
specifically executive function, predicted behavioral outcomes three years after seizure onset.

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders in childhood and is associated
with an increased risk for problems with adjustment, including behavioral and cognitive
deficits [1,2]. Children with seizures are nearly five times more likely to have behavior
problems than control children and they have more behavior problems than children with
other chronic conditions that do not involve the central nervous system [3-6]. This increased
risk has been shown to precede the first recognized seizure [7,8]. Children with epilepsy
tend to have more attention and internalizing behavior problems than externalizing problems
[9-11].

Temperament refers to early-appearing, biologically based characteristic patterns of
emotional reactivity and self-regulation [12]. Specific temperamental factors have been
shown to be risk factors for internalizing and externalizing problems both in healthy children
and in children with seizures [13-16]. In an earlier study of the present sample of children
with new-onset seizures, 72.6% of whom have epilepsy, we showed that retrospectively-
assessed infant temperamental characteristics, such as difficultness (negative emotionality),
unadaptability (negative reaction to novelty), and resistance to control (unmanageability)
were related to both total and internalizing behavior problems, whereas only difficultness
and resistance to control were associated with externalizing behaviors [14]. Although
temperament was shown to be predictive of behavior at the time of seizure onset, it is
unclear whether it remains predictive years after seizures have developed.
Children who have a chronic illness not involving the brain have less adaptive temperaments
than healthy children [17]. Recent research has described the distinctive temperament and
character patterns of children with epilepsy, including higher harm avoidance, and lower
persistence, self-directedness, and cooperativeness than healthy age- and sex-matched
controls [18]. Seizure type had the greatest influence on temperament, with children with
generalized seizures having higher scores on self-directedness, cooperativeness, and self-
transcendence. The existing research describing temperament in populations with chronic
conditions has not addressed how the onset of a child’s chronic illness may affect the child’s
temperament, or the parent’s perception of the child’s temperament.
Temperament components, such as effortful control, serve as an early reactive mechanism of
controlling behavior [19]. As a child ages, this more reflexive means of control is affected
by cortical development and increase in cognitive control capacities. Research has explored
the relationship between self-regulatory behaviors that are related to temperament, such as
effortful control, and those identified through neurocognitive models, such as attention and
executive abilities [20,21]. The development of executive skills is impacted by effortful
control. Dysfunction in these cognitive control and attention abilities is implicated in the
development of negative behavioral outcomes such as clinically significant attention
problems and delinquent behaviors [22,23].
Although neuropsychological deficits in children with epilepsy have long been recognized
[8,24], recent research has sought to identify risk factors for neuropsychological dysfunction
at the time of seizure onset. Using the sample of children from the present study, Fastenau et
al. [25] identified multiple risk factors including recurring seizures, use of AEDs, a
symptomatic/cryptogenic seizure type, and EEG abnormality. Compared to sibling controls,
children with a new-onset seizure performed more poorly in all areas of neuropsychological
functioning [25].
Executive functioning (EF) is a neuropsychological construct that refers to attention and
behavioral control, among other cognitive capacities [26]. Children with seizures, including
those with recent onset seizures, score significantly lower than controls on nearly all
measures of EF [6,27] and were rated by parents as having more EF problems [6]. Poor
performance on EF tasks was related to 1) overall cognitive functioning, 2) depressive
symptoms, and 3) seizure variables, including seizure syndrome, age at onset, and AED
treatment [27]. Even after accounting for overall cognitive functioning, children with
seizures still had lower EF abilities [27]. This reduced cognitive ability may be related to
poor behavioral outcomes. In a study of female adolescents with conduct problems, their EF
mediated the relationship between temperament and aggressive behaviors; the combination
of a difficult temperament and low executive functioning was strongly related to aggressive
behaviors [28], supporting a potential moderating effect of neuropsychological functioning
on temperament and behavior. Development of age-appropriate cognitive abilities,

especially those that serve a self-regulatory function such as EF, may lessen the behavioral
risk associated with negative temperaments.
Other neuropsychological constructs, such as language, may also play a role in the
development of behavioral difficulties. Children with identified language impairments have
a higher rate of behavioral and attention difficulties than children without these deficits [29].
In addition, children with complex partial seizures who had poorer verbal abilities also had
more behavior problems [30]. Matheny [31] argued that children with specific temperaments
may be more vulnerable to language impairments, thus affecting cognitive development in
the area of verbal intelligence, and ultimately behavior. In a model proposed by Austin and
Caplan [32], individual deficits in cognitive and linguistic abilities, along with epilepsy and
family factors, have both direct and indirect effects on behavioral outcomes.
The present study has two aims: 1) to investigate the unique contributions of retrospectively-
assessed infant temperament and neuropsychological functioning assessed at seizure onset,
specifically executive abilities and language, on behavior problems three years after the
onset of seizures, and 2) to investigate the potentially moderating effect of
neuropsychological functioning on the infant temperament-behavior relationship. Although
other neuropsychological domains may contribute to later behavior problems, previous
research suggests that the two constructs of executive functioning and language are likely to
be the most predictive. It is hypothesized that more negative temperaments and lower
neuropsychological functioning scores will be associated with more behavior problems. It is
also hypothesized that the negative impact of an early negative temperament on later
behavior problems is either enhanced when a child obtains low scores on tests of language
and EF, or reduced when the child has high language and EF test scores.
Method
Participants
Children between the ages of 6 and 14 (M = 9.5 years, SD = 2.6) with a first recognized
seizure were recruited as part of a three-year longitudinal study to identify factors that
predict children’s behavioral, social, and cognitive adaptation to epilepsy. The 350 children
in the larger study were recruited from child neurology clinics in Cincinnati and Indianapolis
(68.9%), from private neurologists in the community (10.5%), and through referrals from
school nurses (20.6%). Children were excluded if their seizure was associated with a recent
head injury, malignant brain tumor, toxic or metabolic condition, meningitis, or encephalitis.
Additional exclusion criteria were: prior antiepileptic medication; complex febrile seizures;
and other chronic health problem requiring long-term care. The IQ estimates in the larger
study sample covered a broad range spanning from mild deficiency to the superior range
with a mean and median that fall in the middle of the average range, which has been
observed in other studies [2]. Children who were judged to be mentally handicapped (based
on available IQ score < 80 or on placement in a full-time special education program) were
excluded from this study’s sample. Of the original 350 children in the large cohort, 264
(75.4%) were eligible for the current analysis by meeting the intellectual criteria and
completing the 36-month behavioral measure. Of these 264, 229 (86.7%) were included in
the sample for the present study because they had participated in the baseline
neuropsychological assessment and completed the temperament measure, as well as the 36-
month interview and behavioral assessment.
Parents of the participants had a mean of 14.1 years of education with a range of 9-20 years.
The sample represents many seizure types, with 89.5% of children having only one seizure
type. Eighty-nine percent of the selected sample had an MRI of the brain within six months

of their first recognized seizure (FRS). Of those, fewer than 15% had significant MRI
abnormalities. Additional demographic and seizure data are presented in Table 1.
Clinical and neuropsychological data were collected at baseline, which was within three
months of the FRS, and at 18- and 36-months following the FRS. In an initial clinical
interview at baseline, the primary caregiver (94.0% of whom were mothers) completed a set
of questionnaires about current behavioral functioning, mood, emotional regulation, and
retrospective infant temperament. They also provided the neurodevelopmental health
history, and seizure history of their child. Interviews were also conducted every nine months
after baseline to gather seizure and behavior information from primary caregivers. All
medical records pertinent to the child’s seizures and treatment were obtained after signed
release of information was obtained from the parent. Informed consent was obtained from
the primary caregiver of each participant, and assent was obtained from each child.
Permission to contact the child’s teacher was also obtained from each child’s primary
caregiver. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both Cincinnati
Children’s Hospital Medical Center and Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis,
and is therefore, in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration
of Helsinki.
Measures
Infant Temperament—During the initial clinical interview, the child’s primary caregiver
completed the Infant Characteristics Questionnaire – Retrospective Form (RICQ) to rate,
retrospectively, the child’s early temperament [33]. The RICQ is a shorter, retrospective
version of the ICQ, which is a widely used parent-perception instrument [13]. The RICQ is a
brief measure that consists of 16 items related to early temperament. These items are rated
using 7-point Likert-type rating scales, with higher scores reflecting more negative
temperaments. Three subscale scores are obtained: difficultness, unadaptability, and
resistance to control. More detailed descriptions of these subscales are provided in Table 2.
Cronbach’s alpha was calculated for each of these subscales using data from the larger
sample, and they ranged from 0.83 to 0.87. Scores for each dimension were the averages of
the items they included. The RICQ is shown to be a valid measure, as it adequately
estimates temperamental characteristics during infancy [13]. In the study by Bates and
colleagues [13], mothers of typically-developing children completed the ICQ when their
children were between 6 and 24 months of age; then, ten years later, the same mothers
retrospectively assessed their children’s infant temperament via the ICQ – Retrospective
Form (RICQ). They found that the two reports, separated by 10 years, were significantly
correlated in all three dimensions.
Behavior Problems—The child’s teacher was asked to complete the Child Behavior
Checklist Teacher’s Report Form, TRF [34] based on the child’s current behavior at
baseline, 18, and 36 months following the child’s FRS. To assess how baseline
neuropsychological functioning and temperament predict later behavior problems, only the
36-month behavioral data were analyzed in the present study. Each item is rated on a 3-point
scale: (0) not true, (1) somewhat/sometimes true, and (2) very/often true. Scores are
computed for the three broadband scales: Total Behavior Problems, Internalizing Problems,
and Externalizing Problems. Items measuring anxious/depressed behavior, withdrawn/
depressed behavior, and somatic complaints together form the broadband dimension of
internalizing behavior, whereas items measuring aggressive and rule-breaking behavior form
the broadband dimension of externalizing behavior. The Total Behavior Problems dimension
consists of the internalizing and externalizing subscales, as well as thought problems,
attention problems, social problems, and other problems. For all three scales, a T score of 65
or above (≥93rd percentile) is considered significantly elevated [34]. The TRF and the parent

report form, the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), have been shown to have high reliability
and validity. They show stability over time and provide standardized scores for age and
gender [34]. The TRF has also been used extensively in children with epilepsy [35].
Past studies relied upon parents to rate their child’s behavior problems [3,36-38]. In the
present study, behavioral data were available from both the teacher and parent, although
retrospective temperament data were only available from the parent. The parent’s
recollection of the child’s early temperament may have been influenced by the child’s
present behavior. Therefore, to reduce the possibility of the shared variance between
temperament and behavior problems being due to the informant, the parents’ ratings of the
child’s infant temperament and the teachers’ ratings of the child’s behavior in the school
setting1, were used.
Neuropsychological Functioning—Child participants completed a comprehensive
three-hour neuropsychological test battery that included standardized clinical measures of
intelligence, language, immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory, executive
functions, speeded fine motor dexterity, and academic achievement. Neuropsychological
tests were administered at baseline, 18, and 36 months, although only the baseline
assessment data were analyzed in the present study. The aim of the study was to identify
baseline factors that predict later adverse behavioral outcomes. Baseline neuropsychological
data are less confounded by the adverse effects of high seizure frequency and use of
antiepileptic medication, allowing for identification of early cognitive risk factors for
negative behavior. Testing was administered in a neurology or neuropsychology clinic by
psychometrists who were trained, observed, and certified on the test battery by a pediatric
neuropsychologist.
All instruments are well-established in the field and have high reliability and validity. Each
instrument was administered according to the standardized procedures for each test and
scores were converted to age-corrected standardized scores using the best available national
norms for all tests except WRAML Design Copy, which was designed by this study’s
research group and for which no norms are available. The battery included the following
tests: Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, 3rd Edition, CELF-3 [39];
Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing, CTOPP [40]; Conners’ Continuous
Performance Test, 2nd Edition, CPT-II [41]; Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, K-BIT [42];
Coding and Symbol Search Subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 3rd
Edition, WISC-III [43]; Wide Range Assessment of Memory and Learning, WRAML [44];
WRAML Design Copy; and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST [45].
Based on a prior factor analysis of the present neuropsychological test data [46], the battery
of neuropsychological measures used was distilled into four primary factors: (1) Language,
(2) Processing Speed, (3) Executive/Attention/Construction, which will hereafter be referred
to as EF for the sake of clarity, and (4) Verbal Memory and Learning [46]. Verbal concept
formation, phonological awareness, and phonological memory loaded onto the first factor
labeled as Language. The Processing Speed factor consisted of measures of psychomotor
speed and rapid naming. Factor 3, EF, consisted of measures of sustained attention, problem
solving, and visual-construction. The fourth factor, Verbal Memory and Learning, consisted
of measures of rote verbal learning and story recall [46]. Higher factor scores indicate
greater neuropsychological ability.
1There were significant positive correlations between each of the teacher reports of behavior problems and the parent reports on the
CBCL (all p < .0001).

Analyses
For each of the three TRF broadband behavior subscales, a predictive model was developed
that included the infant temperament variables and the neuropsychological factors as
predictors. The three regressions, one for each behavior subscale, included the component
main effects of all predictor variables. To reduce the number of predictors in each model,
only two temperament subscale variables were used in each model. These variables were
identified based upon theoretical considerations and previous research describing their
association with specific behavioral outcomes [14]. For internalizing problems, difficultness
and unadaptability were the temperament variables entered, whereas for externalizing
problems, difficultness and resistance to control were included. All three temperament
variables were included in the model of total behavior problems. The models were also run
as moderated models including the temperament and neuropsychological functioning
(Language and EF) two-way interaction term. To reduce the effects of multicollinearity
between the component main effects and the interaction terms, the interaction terms were
centered [47]. Means for the individual independent variables were calculated and this mean
was subtracted from each individual’s score. Statistical tests were always two-sided, with α
= .05.
Results
As a group, the children in the present sample did not have overtly problematic infant
temperaments, as judged by inspection of the mean scores on these measures [13]. For all
three temperament dimensions, the means fell between 3 and 4 on the 7-point scale, with a
score of 7 indicating a more negative temperament. Their IQ scores, as estimated by the K-
BIT, were average (M = 104.32, SD = 12.66). Similarly, the participants had
neuropsychological factor scores that were in the average range. Child behavior problems
were average compared to children in the normative sample of the TRF (mean total behavior
T-score = 49.14). The percentage of children with clinically elevated behavior problems, T
scores ≥ 60 [34], was slightly less than sixteen percent for internalizing problems, about
12% for externalizing problems, and about 16% for total behavior problems. Means and
standard deviations for infant temperament scores, neuropsychological factors, and behavior
problems scores, are presented in Table 3.
All three models are presented with all main effects and the interaction terms.
Infant Temperament
The three temperament subscales were significantly positively correlated. As reported
previously [14], temperamental factors were significantly positively associated with later
behavior problems in the present sample of children with seizures; however, the present
study builds upon the earlier research by describing temperament characteristics that
contribute to behavior three years after seizure onset. Specifically, the temperamental
dimension of unadaptability made a unique contribution to the prediction of internalizing
behavior problems with children with higher scores on unadaptability having higher
internalizing behavior problems scores. Unadaptability was not significant in the prediction
of total behavior problem scores. Resistance to control was a significant positive predictor in
both the externalizing behavior problems and total behavior problems models. Difficultness
was not significant in predicting internalizing, externalizing, or total behavior problems (see
Table 4).
Neuropsychological Functioning
The hypothesis that neuropsychological functioning would uniquely contribute to the
prediction of child behavior problems was partially supported. With internalizing behavior

problems as the dependent variable, only EF was significant, such that high EF was
associated with higher behavior problem scores. Similarly, in the models predicting
externalizing and total behavior problems, the EF factor was again a positive predictor. The
Language factor did not make a unique contribution in any of the three behavioral models.
The Moderating Effect Of Neuropsychological Functioning
The hypothesis that neuropsychological functioning would moderate the relationship
between retrospective infant temperament and child behavior problems was not supported.
Discussion
Results revealed that negative temperamental characteristics were significant in predicting
behavior problems three years after seizure onset. Unadaptability (novelty distress, perhaps
an early marker of anxiety) predicted internalizing problems; resistance to control
(unmanageability, perhaps an early marker of impulsivity) predicted externalizing problems,
as well as total behavior problems. The previous study on the present sample of children
found that all three temperament characteristics predicted internalizing and total behavior
problems at the time the child presented with seizures, and difficultness and resistance to
control predicted externalizing behavior [14]. Therefore, although children who are rated
high on difficultness, thus described as negatively emotional, are at risk early in the course
of the disorder, they are not at risk for behavior problems years later. Unadaptability and
resistance to control may represent early characteristics that put children at risk for relatively
longer term poor behavior outcomes.
Children who were rated as unadaptable as infants experienced distress when confronted
with new experiences, like foods, people, or places. Children experiencing novelty distress
likely are fearful in various situations and adopt a pattern of behavioral inhibition to
minimize these negative reactions [48]. This inhibited behavior can manifest as anxious
tendencies as the child gets older. The more inhibited pattern of responding that is
characteristic of internalizing children may partly buffer children from the problematic
behavioral tendencies associated with externalizing problems [49]. In addition, these
children may react more negatively to the novel onset of a seizure disorder, further
increasing their risk for internalized behaviors later. A resistant-to-control temperament,
found to put a child most at risk for aggressive and delinquent behaviors, can be
characterized by impulsivity, reward-seeking, and non-compliance, thus increasing the risk
for conflict with others. This type of temperament and related variables, such as impulsivity,
is not only predictive of externalizing behaviors in this sample of children with seizures, but
is also associated with externalizing behaviors in a typically-developing sample [49,50]. In
the present study, temperaments described as resistant-to-control were also predictive of
total behavior problems, indicating that these children may be more likely to experience
difficulties maintaining their attention and engaging with others socially. The increased
behavioral risk associated with this early temperamental characteristic could be exacerbated
by the onset of seizures. The present study builds upon the existing knowledge by examining
which early temperament factors predict behavior three years after seizures are first
recognized, and if they are affected by the child’s neuropsychological functioning.
The study also found that children who scored lower on executive (EF) abilities were at
greater risk for internalizing, externalizing, and total behavior problems. Children with
seizures perform poorly on measures of executive functioning, and this is even true for
children with recent onset epilepsy, despite scores in the average range on intellectual
functioning [6,27]. This impairment of executive abilities supports an existing tendency for
cognitive self-regulatory problems in children with seizures. Difficulty in planning,
modulating one’s attention, or inhibiting behaviors appears to be related to later aggressive
Baum et al.

and rule-breaking behaviors [28]. Children who are not as responsive to instruction, tend to
be ‘self-driven’, and difficult to control are likely to exhibit negative behaviors in multiple
settings. Cognitive and emotional dysregulation, related to EF deficits, make an individual
vulnerable to internalizing behaviors, such as depressive and anxious mood symptoms. Low
EF neuropsychological scores also predicted higher total behavior problems in this sample.
A child with lower executive abilities may be more at risk for the additional behaviors
included in the total behavior problems score, such as attention, thought, and social
problems.
There were no significant interactions between any of the temperament characteristics and
any of the neuropsychological factors in predicting internalizing, externalizing, or total
behavior problems, indicating that the association between infant temperament and behavior
problems does not vary based on the child’s neuropsychological scores.
It is important to note that the neuropsychological functioning of the children in this sample
was assessed within 4.2 months of their first recognized seizure. With the exclusion of
children with intellectual disabilities, the present sample consists of children who are
generally healthy and of normal intelligence. Additionally, the cognitive difficulties that can
result from increased seizure activity and use of antiepileptic medication are not likely to
have had an effect at this early stage of the disorder. Although it has been found that
children with new-onset epilepsy perform more poorly than healthy children on a number of
cognitive measures [51,52] their lower scores on the measures are within normal limits and
do not represent a significant deficiency. The present study similarly found that the
neuropsychological scores of the children with seizures were within approximately two
standard deviations of the mean factor scores. Overall the sample does not have executive
deficits; however, a small percentage of children within the sample had some executive
difficulties with 10.0% having EF factor scores greater than one standard deviation below
the mean, and 5.7% have EF factors more than 1.5 standard deviations below the mean.
The current study has certain limitations. Children excluded from the analyses due to
missing baseline data or low IQ may have more behavior problems than those in the
remaining subsample. The findings from the present subsample could be assumed to
underestimate the severity of behavior problems in children with seizures. Another potential
limitation is that the resulting R2s are relatively low. Although temperament and
neuropsychological functioning, specifically EF, contribute to the prediction of behavior,
they do not fully explain behavior problems three years after seizure onset. The
heterogeneity of the sample, with regard to seizure type, seizure syndrome, and MRI
abnormalities, is representative of children presenting with a first seizure. Therefore, the
generalizability of the results in that respect represents a relative strength. However, it could
be argued that investigation of the unique contribution of seizure variables may contribute to
the understanding of adverse behavioral outcomes. While this may be true, given the number
of different seizure types in our heterogeneous sample, follow-up analyses could not be
conducted. The retrospective nature of the temperament measure inherently presents a
limitation. Parents’ recollections will not perfectly represent their perceptions of
temperament in infancy, but the evidence suggests that what they recollect later corresponds
to what they would have reported at the time [13]. Even if it is assumed that the
temperament variables used in this study reflect concurrent ratings of temperament, the
findings are informative. The child’s current behavior may influence a parent’s perception of
infant temperament and result in a negative bias. However, teacher ratings of behavior three
years after seizure onset were evaluated, thus reducing the likelihood that the shared
variance between the ratings is attributable to informant effects alone.

The results of the present study are based on a heterogeneous sample of children who first
present with seizures, allowing for a description of baseline functioning. The longitudinal
design of the study permits identification of baseline risk factors that may contribute to
adverse outcomes, such as behavior, three years later. Different domains of temperament
were found to differentially predict behavior problems over a three-year period. EF was also
found to be predictive of behavior problems. Risk factors and outcomes were all measured
using reliable and valid instruments, indicating a relative strength of the study. Future
studies should simultaneously explore multiple causative factors in the development of
internalizing and externalizing behavior problems in this population. Specifically, factors
related to seizure type, caregiving behaviors, and family environment, may help identify
those children most at risk for behavioral problems. Identifying these factors associated will
lead to improved recognition, treatment, and quality of life for these children.

For the internalizing and externalizing models, only two of the three temperament variables were included, as noted in Method section.
The Standardized b’s are standardized beta weights that indicate that as the predictor variable increases by one SD, all other variables held
constant, the dependent variable increases by the b. For example, as unadaptability increases by one SD, internalizing problems increase by two-
tenths of a SD.
