Abstract
The ‘‘enhanced intracellular survival’’ (eis) gene of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is involved in the intracellular survival of
M. smegmatis. However, its exact effects on host cell function remain elusive. We herein report that Mtb Eis plays essential
roles in modulating macrophage autophagy, inflammatory responses, and cell death via a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-
dependent pathway. Macrophages infected with an Mtb eis-deletion mutant H37Rv (Mtb-Deis) displayed markedly
increased accumulation of massive autophagic vacuoles and formation of autophagosomes in vitro and in vivo. Infection of
macrophages with Mtb-Deis increased the production of tumor necrosis factor-a and interleukin-6 over the levels produced
by infection with wild-type or complemented strains. Elevated ROS generation in macrophages infected with Mtb-Deis (for
which NADPH oxidase and mitochondria were largely responsible) rendered the cells highly sensitive to autophagy
activation and cytokine production. Despite considerable activation of autophagy and proinflammatory responses,
macrophages infected with Mtb-Deis underwent caspase-independent cell death. This cell death was significantly inhibited
by blockade of autophagy and c-Jun N-terminal kinase-ROS signaling, suggesting that excessive autophagy and oxidative
stress are detrimental to cell survival. Finally, artificial over-expression of Eis or pretreatment with recombinant Eis
abrogated production of both ROS and proinflammatory cytokines, which depends on the N-acetyltransferase domain of
the Eis protein. Collectively, these data indicate that Mtb Eis suppresses host innate immune defenses by modulating
autophagy, inflammation, and cell death in a redox-dependent manner.

Introduction
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an intracellular pathogen that
can survive and even multiply within host macrophages [1,2]. Mtb
can persist within phagosomes by interfering with intracellular
membrane trafficking and by arresting phagosome maturation in
infected host cells [3]. Pathogenic mycobacteria have developed
several strategies for surviving and growing under nutrient-limited
conditions [4]. Autophagy, or the removal of aged organelles, plays a
central role in regulating important cellular functions [5,6] and
aids in innate and adaptive immune defense against Mtb and other
intracellular pathogens [5,7–9]. Physiological or pharmacological
induction of autophagy in macrophages results in increased co-
localization of mycobacterial phagosomes and the autophagy
effector LC3, and the fusion of the former with lysosomes, which
overcomes the blockade of membrane trafficking and increased
bactericidal activity [7].
Although autophagy plays key roles in host innate and adaptive
immune defenses, it can, under certain circumstances, result in type II
programmed cell death [10,11]. Autophagic processes are activated
in response to cellular stresses, such as oxidative stress, and can
influence several types of cell death, including autophagy-related cell
death [12]. Recently, we showed that the mycobacterial BCG cell
wall triggers autophagy-induced cell death in radiosensitized colon
cancer cells [13]. Additionally, several viral gene products may be
involved in autophagy-induced cell death [14]. However, the genetic
basis for mycobacterial induction of autophagy, and its implications
for host cell viability, remain to be elucidated.
The ‘‘enhanced intracellular survival’’ (eis) gene and its protein
product, Eis, a unique protein of 42 kDa, of Mtb H37Rv enhance
the survival of the saprophytic M. smegmatis during repeated
passage through the human macrophage-like cell line U-937 [15].
Bioinformatic analyses showed that Eis is a member of the GCN5-
related family of N-acetyltransferases [16]. Recent studies have

December 2010 | Volume 6 | Issue 12 | e1001230

revealed that kanamycin resistance is associated with eis promoter
mutations that increase Eis transcript and protein levels [17].
Additionally, regulation of eis expression by SigA enhanced
intracellular growth of the W-Beijing Mtb strain in monocytic
cells [18]. Moreover, Eis inhibited the proliferation of mitogen-
activated T cells and, by blocking the phosphorylation of
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), reduced the produc-
tion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-4 [19].
Despite being implicated in host-pathogen interactions during Mtb
infection, the precise role of Eis in innate immune regulation
remains to be determined.
In an effort to gain further insight into the role of Eis in host
responses, we examined autophagy, inflammatory cytokine produc-
tion, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in macrophages
infected with wild-type (Mtb-WT), eis-deletion (Mtb-Deis), or comple-
mented (Mtb-c-eis) Mtb strains. Infection with Mtb-Deis significantly
increased autophagy, inflammatory responses, and ROS generation in
macrophages. NADPH oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria were found
to be the major sources of ROS, which contributed to the induction of
autophagy and inflammatory responses in Mtb-Deis-infected cells.
Increased and excessive activation of autophagy in macrophages
infected with Mtb-Deis had no effect on antimicrobial responses, but
stimulated caspase-independent cell death (CICD). Mtb-Deis-induced
host cell death was regulated by autophagic pathways and influenced
by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent ROS generation.
Furthermore, we show that the N-acetyltransferase domain of Eis is
responsible for its modulation of ROS generation and proinflamma-
tory responses in macrophages.
Results
Mycobacterium tuberculosis Eis Inhibits Autophagy in
Macrophages
Previous studies identified a role for the eis gene in enhancing
the survival of mycobacteria in human monocytic cells [15].
However, the role of eis in autophagy activation in macrophages,
which plays a key role in defense and cellular homeostasis [5], is
not fully understood. We first infected bone marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDMs) with the Mtb-WT, Mtb-Deis, and Mtb-c-
eis
strains
of
Mtb
H37Rv
and
examined
the
kinetics
of
autophagosome formation by immunostaining for LC3. As shown
in Figure 1A, in BMDMs infected with Mtb-Deis we observed the
recruitment of endogenous LC3 in punctate structures the
formation of which peaked 24 h after infection, before decreasing
substantially by 48 h post-infection (Fig. 1A, right). In contrast,
autophagosome formation was not increased in BMDMs infected
with Mtb-WT or Mtb-c-eis (Fig. 1A). Additionally, RAW 264.7
macrophages transfected with green fluorescent protein (GFP)
fused to the autophagosome protein LC3 (GFP-LC3) [20] showed
a significant increase in GFP-LC3 puncta formation when infected
with Mtb-Deis at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 (over levels
in cells infected with Mtb-WT or Mtb-c-eis at the same bacterial
load; Fig. S1A). Moreover, Mtb-Deis-induced formation of LC3
punctae in BMDMs (Fig. 1B) and RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. S1B) was
abrogated by treatment for 4 h with 3-methyladenine (3-MA), a
classical inhibitor of autophagy [21].
Cleavage of soluble LC3 (LC3-I) to form LC3-II, which
correlates with the extent of autophagosome formation [20], was
further examined by Western blotting. As shown in Figure 1C,
Mtb-Deis significantly induced LC3-II formation, whereas Mtb-
WT and Mtb-c-eis did not. We next monitored Mtb-Deis-induced
autophagy through detection of autophagic vacuoles or organelles
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Ultrastructural
analysis of BMDMs treated with Mtb-Deis for 24 h revealed the
presence of multiple cytosolic autophagic vacuoles resembling
autophagosomes (Fig. 1D). Additionally, TEM analyses revealed
the presence of bacilli within characteristic double-membrane
autophagosomes and multiple membrane structures (Fig. 1D), a
pattern
characteristic
of
the
induction
of
autophagy
and
autophagic death [22–24]. From 12 h post-infection, we observed
Mtb-Deis within autophagic vacuoles (Fig. 1D, middle), which
fused with multivesicular structures [25]. At 24 h post-infection,
multiple late or degradative autophagic vacuoles [25] were clearly
visible, in which partially degraded cytoplasmic materials and
bacteria were evident (Fig. 1D, bottom).
We also examined whether autophagic vacuoles formed in cells
infected with Mtb-Deis were able to mature to autolysosomes [25].
Confocal analysis showed that BMDMs infected with Mtb-Deis
exhibited co-localization of the autophagosomal marker LC3 and
the lysosomes marker Lamp-1 (Fig. S1C). We also observed that
levels of LC3-II and LC3 puncta formation in Mtb-Deis-infected
BMDMs were increased by pretreatment with the vacuolar H+-
ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A (Baf-A) [20,26] (Fig. 1E, LC3-II;
Fig. S1D, LC3 puncta formation). These findings indicate that
Mtb-Deis induced both autophagy and autophagosome-lysosome
fusion in macrophages.
Mtb-Deis Infection Up-Regulates Proinflammatory
Cytokine Production and ROS Generation in BMDMs
The interaction of Mtb with innate receptors in phagocytes
triggers an oxidative burst and activates intracellular signaling
cascades that induce proinflammatory responses [27,28]. We thus
examined the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the
generation of ROS in BMDMs infected with Mtb-WT, Mtb-Deis,
or Mtb-c-eis. As shown in Figure 2A, BMDMs infected with Mtb-
Deis at increasing bacterial loads (MOI = 0.1, 1, 10) produced
greater amounts of TNF-a and IL-6 than cells infected with Mtb-
WT or Mtb-c-eis. Levels of TNF-a and IL-6, which peaked at
18 h, were significantly higher in BMDMs infected with Mtb-Deis
Author Summary
Tuberculosis is a global health problem: at least one-third
of the world’s population is infected with Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb). Mtb is a successful pathogen that
enhances
its
own
intracellular
survival
by
arresting
phagolysosomal fusion. Recently, autophagy has emerged
as a host defense strategy against Mtb infection, through
stimulation of the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes.
However, excessive and uncontrolled autophagic activity
can be detrimental to host cells and can result in their
death. The Mtb ‘‘enhanced intracellular survival’’ (eis) gene
has been implicated in the intracellular survival of M.
smegmatis. However, its exact role and how it regulates
host innate immune responses have not been fully
explained. Here, we provide evidence that Eis suppresses
macrophage autophagy, inflammation, and cell death
through the inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
generation. Although it has previously been demonstrated
that autophagy is a key host defense response to
mycobacterial infections, our data indicate that excessive
autophagy, and the resulting cell death, do not signifi-
cantly affect host defense responses to mycobacteria.
Additionally, our data reveal that Eis’s ability to regulate
ROS generation and proinflammatory responses depends
on its N-acetyltransferase domain. These results under-
score a previously unrecognized role of Eis in modulating
host inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, and cell
survival/death during mycobacterial infection.

than those infected with Mtb-WT or Mtb-c-eis (Fig. 2B; P,0.05,
TNF-a; P,0.01, IL-6). We next examined whether autophagy
played a role in the regulation of proinflammatory cytokine
production in macrophages infected with Mtb-WT, Mtb-Deis, or
Mtb-c-eis. As shown in Figure S2, the secretion of TNF-a and
IL-6 was significantly increased in RAW264.7 cells transfected
with siRNA specific for Beclin-1 (siBeclin-1) or Atg5 (siAtg5),
suggesting a negative regulatory role for autophagic pathways in
proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages infected
with Mtb-Deis.
We further examined whether ROS levels differed between cells
infected with the WT, Deis, and c-eis strains of Mtb H37Rv. We
measured the production of ROS by flow cytometry, using 2,79-
dichlorofluorescein-diacetate (DCFH-DA) and dihydroethidium
(DHE) as probes for H2O2 and O2
2, respectively (Fig. 2C).
Compared with BMDMs infected with Mtb-WT or Mtb-c-eis
strains, cells infected with Mtb-Deis displayed markedly increased
intracellular DCFH-DA and DHE fluorescence (Fig. 2C). To
exclude the involvement of reactive nitrogen species (RNS) in
detecting ROS generation, we pre-treated BMDMs with the
specific nitric oxide synthase inhibitors nitro-L-arginine methyl
ester (L-NAME) or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) prior
to Mtb-Deis infection and examined ROS generation. Pre-
treatment with nitric oxide synthase inhibitors had no significant
effect on ROS generation in BMDMs infected with Mtb-Deis (Fig.
S3), suggesting that up-regulated DCFH-DA and DHE fluores-
cence intensities were due principally to increased ROS generation
in Mtb-Deis-infected macrophages. Notably, flow cytometric
analysis showed that infection with Mtb-Deis yielded a stronger
MitoSOX
Red signal,
which

for
mitochondrial
superoxide [29], than infection with the Mtb-WT or Mtb-c-eis
strains (Fig. 2D). These data suggest that Mtb-Deis more strongly
induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS in
BMDMs than do Mtb-WT or Mtb-c-eis.

ROS Generation Is Required for the Induction of
Autophagy and Inflammatory Responses in Macrophages
Infected with Mtb-Deis
Recent studies have shown that NOX-derived ROS are involved
in the activation of autophagy [30]. Additionally, we have shown
that NOX2/gp91phox, the main catalytic component of NOX,
interacts with TLR2, a key effector of Mtb-induced proinflamma-
tory responses [28]. Because ROS generation was significantly
elevated in Mtb-Deis-infected cells, we hypothesized that increased
ROS production during Mtb-Deis infection might be a trigger for
autophagy activation and proinflammatory responses. As anticipat-
ed, pretreatment with the ROS scavengers [N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC), diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), catalase and tiron (4,5-
dihydroxy-1,3-benzene disulfonic acid-disodium salt); for 1 h before
infection] prevented Mtb-Deis-induced autophagosome accumula-
tion in BMDMs (Fig. 3A) and RAW 264.7 cells transfected with
GFP-LC3 (Fig. S4A). Additionally, the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-
II in Mtb-Deis-infected cells was suppressed by catalase and tiron
(Fig. 3B). We further examined whether ROS generation was
involved in the induction of proinflammatory cytokines in Mtb-Deis-
infected BMDMs. ROS scavengers reduced the TNF-a and IL-6
levels in BMDMs infected with Mtb-Deis (Fig. 3C).
We
next
determined
the
Mtb-Deis-induced
activation
of
autophagy and proinflammatory responses in NOX2-deficient
macrophages. ROS induction was abolished in NOX2-deficient
macrophages infected with Mtb-WT, Mtb-Deis, or Mtb-c-eis (Fig.
S4B). Infection of NOX2-deficient BMDMs with Mtb-Deis
resulted in a dramatic reduction in autophagy, as assessed by
LC3 puncta formation (Fig. 3D) and LC3-II conversion (Fig. 3E)
at 18 h. However, neither starvation- nor rapamycin-induced
autophagy was dependent on NOX2 expression (Fig. S4C).
Proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression at 6 h (Fig. S4D)
and protein levels at 18 h (Fig. 3F) following infection with Mtb-
Deis were significantly reduced in BMDMs taken from NOX2 KO
mice. The release of proinflammatory cytokines in response to WT
or c-eis Mtb was similarly reduced in NOX2-deficient macro-
phages (Fig. 3F). Collectively, our data suggest that NOX2-derived
ROS are centrally involved in the up-regulated autophagy and
proinflammatory responses in BMDMs infected with Mtb-Deis.
Infection with Mtb-Deis Increases Caspase-independent
Cell Death
Autophagy serves as a cell survival mechanism in some contexts,
but triggers cell death in others [31]. To examine whether the eis

gene can modulate host cell survival/death in macrophages, we
infected BMDMs with Mtb-WT, Mtb-Deis, or Mtb-c-eis and
examined host cell viability. When BMDMs were infected with
these three strains at an MOI of 10, Mtb-Deis-infected cells showed
a significant decrease in cell viability after 24 h, whereas Mtb-WT-
and Mtb-c-eis-infected cells displayed only low rates of cell death
(Fig. 4A). Infection with either Mtb-WT or Mtb-c-eis tended to
reduce BMDM viability, dose-dependently, above an MOI of 25
(Fig. S5A).
We next assessed whether apoptosis played a role in the cell
death induced by Mtb-Deis using the TUNEL assay (Fig. 4B). At
36 h post-infection, there was a marked increase in total cell death
in BMDMs infected with Mtb-Deis. However, only a slight
increase in the number of apoptotic cells was observed (Fig. 4B).
Additionally, microscopic examination of Mtb-Deis-infected cells at
36 h post-infection revealed morphological changes associated
with cell death that were not observed in Mtb-WT- or Mtb-c-eis-
infected cells (Fig. 4C). http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/content/
full/179/2/939 - F1#F1To further examine the mechanism of
cell death in Mtb-Deis-infected cells, we cultured BMDMs infected
with Mtb-WT, Mtb-Deis, or Mtb-c-eis (MOI = 10) in the presence
or absence of the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk
(administered 1 h prior to infection). We found that z-VAD-fmk
only partially blocked Mtb-Deis-mediated cell death (Fig. 4D).
Also, caspase-3 enzyme activities did not differ significantly
between Mtb-WT-, Mtb-Deis-, and Mtb-c-eis-infected macrophag-
es (data not shown), suggesting that the reduction in macrophage
viability caused by Mtb-Deis infection did not result primarily from
caspase activation.
We further assessed the role of autophagy in modulating cell
death induced by Mtb-Deis. BMDMs were pretreated with a
known inhibitor of autophagy, 3-MA, prior to Mtb-Deis infection.
Pretreatment with 3-MA effectively prevented Mtb-Deis-induced
macrophage cell death, but had no such effect on Mtb-WT- or
Mtb-c-eis-infected cells (Fig. 4D)http://www.jimmunol.org/cgi/
content/full/180/1/207 - F6#F6. To further assess the role of
autophagy in Mtb-Deis-induced cell death, we depleted Beclin-1 or
Atg5 by siRNA transfection of Mtb-Deis-infected RAW 264.7 cells.
Transfection of RAW 264.7 cells with siBeclin-1 or siAtg5
significantly inhibited Mtb-Deis-induced cell death, as assessed by
propidium iodide (PI) staining (Fig. S5B). Moreover, a trypan blue
exclusion assay showed that blockade of autophagy increased the
survival of Mtb-Deis-infected BMDMs (Fig. S5C). Collectively,
these results support the concept that Mtb Eis actively inhibited
CICD.
Macrophage Death and ROS Generation Induced by Mtb-
Deis Depend on JNK Signaling
It is known that ERK and JNK mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways are important in oxidative
stress-induced cell death [32–34]. No significant difference in
activation kinetics of phosphorylated p38 and ERK1/2 was
detected between cells infected with Mtb-WT-, Mtb-Deis-, and
Mtb-c-eis (Fig. 5A). In contrast, a significant increase in JNK/

infected macrophages. (A–C) BMDMs were infected with Mtb-Deis (MOI = 10) for 18 h in the presence or absence of DPI (10 mM), NAC (20 mM),

SAPK phosphorylation was observed in cells infected with Mtb-
Deis, this response preceding similar responses in macrophages
infected with Mtb-WT or Mtb-c-eis (Fig. 5A). Densitometric
quantification of phosphorylated p38, ERK1/2, and JNK band
intensities showed that the active form of JNK was uniquely
increased in macrophages infected with Mtb-Deis (Fig. 5B). These
results indicate that differences in JNK signaling may be
responsible for differences in the responses to different bacterial
strains.
To further explore the link between MAPK signaling and Mtb-
Deis-induced ROS generation and cell death, cells were pretreated
with specific inhibitors of JNK (SP600125), p38 (SB203580), and
MEK (U0126) for 1 h prior to infection with Mtb-Deis. Inhibition
of JNK, but not the other two kinases, dose-dependently reduced
Mtb-Deis-induced ROS generation, as measured by flow cytom-
etry (Fig. 5C). Additionally, inhibition of JNK signaling, but not
p38 or ERK1/2 signaling, dose-dependently reduced Mtb-Deis-
induced macrophage death (Fig. 5D). Moreover, transfection of
RAW264.7 cells with siRNA specific for JNK (siJNK) markedly
reduced cell death induced by Mtb-Deis (Fig. 5E). Together, these
data suggest that Eis modulated macrophage survival through
JNK-dependent regulation of ROS signaling.

granulomatous inflammation were approximately 35–50% at 4
weeks post-infection (data not shown). Similar to the in vitro results
(Fig. 1), numerous lamellar structures with cytoplasmic autophagic
vacuoles were observed in the cytosol of alveolar macrophages
isolated from the lungs of mice 4 weeks after infection with Mtb-
Deis, but not Mtb-WT or Mtb-c-eis (Fig. 6A and other data not
shown). These ultrastructural features demonstrated the presence
and degradation of bacteria within autophagic vesicles in the lungs

of Mtb-Deis-infected mice (Fig. 6A). Additionally, quantitative RT-
PCR analysis demonstrated that TNF-a and IL-6 mRNA levels
were significantly higher in lung tissues from Mtb-Deis-infected
mice than in those from Mtb-WT- or Mtb-c-eis-infected mice
(Fig. 6B). Moreover, rates of cell death, measured by PI staining,
were significantly higher in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells
isolated from Mtb-Deis-infected mice than those from Mtb-WT- or
Mtb-c-eis-infected mice (Fig. 6C). There was no significant
difference in the number of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells in
lung tissues from Mtb-WT-, Mtb-Deis-, and Mtb-c-eis-infected
mice (data not shown).
To analyze bacterial survival in vivo, five mice per group were
sacrificed 4 weeks post-challenge and bacterial counts were
determined from lung and spleen homogenates. Numbers of
viable bacteria in lung and spleen did not differ among mice
infected with the three Mtb strains (Fig. 6D). Furthermore, we
determined the in vitro intracellular growth of Mtb-WT, Mtb-Deis,
and Mtb-c-eis in macrophages. The three strains grew in
macrophages at almost identical rates (Fig. 6E), consistent with
our previous observations [16]. Collectively, these data suggest
that numbers of autophagic vacuoles, the strength of the
inflammatory response, and rates of cell death were significantly
increased during in vivo infection with Mtb-Deis, although there was
no obvious effect on bacterial elimination.

Generation and Proinflammatory Cytokine Production
We previously showed that Mtb-infected macrophages release
Eis into the cytosol and the culture supernatant [16]. Thus, the

mycobacterial antigens, such as the recombinant 85A (30 k)
antigen of Mtb (Fig. 7A). Eis is a member of the GCN5-related
family of N-acetyltransferases [16]. To test whether the acetyl-
transferase domain of Eis was required for the induction of ROS,
we transfected THP-1 cells with an Eis-WT (WT-eis-expressing) or
Eis-DAT (N-acetyltransferase domain deletion mutant) construct,
or a mock control plasmid, and infected them with Mtb-Deis. Eis-
WT, but not Eis-DAT, blocked the induction of superoxide and
H2O2 generation by Mtb-Deis (Fig. 7B).

production
in
Mtb-Deis-infected
BMDMs. Pretreatment with Eis, but not 85A antigen, dose-
dependently inhibited Mtb-Deis-induced secretion of TNF-a and

expressing Eis-WT or Eis-DAT plasmids on proinflammatory
cytokine responses in THP-1 cells infected with Mtb-Deis. Cells
over-expressing wild-type Eis secreted 2.6-fold less TNF-a and 2.7-

contrast, JNK inhibition did not significantly affect Mtb-Deis-
induced ROS production (Fig. 7E) or cytokine secretion (Fig. 7F)
in THP-1 cells over-expressing Eis-WT constructs. These data
suggest that the N-acetyltransferase domain of Eis is critical to Eis’s
modulation of host cell ROS generation and proinflammatory
cytokine responses through the JNK pathway.
Discussion
Earlier studies demonstrated that the eis gene of Mtb can
enhance survival of the non-pathogenic M. smegmatis in macro-
phages [15]. Moreover, Eis protein was detected in Mtb-
containing phagosomes and the cytoplasm of parasitized cells, as
well as in cell culture supernatants of Mtb-infected macrophages
[16,35]. Studies have demonstrated the presence of anti-Eis
antibodies in TB patients, indicating that Eis is produced during
human infection [35]. Eis also modulates TNF-a secretion and T
cell responses [16,19]. However, its precise role in innate immune
responses has not been clearly determined. The present study
provides evidence that Eis plays an essential role in modulating
host innate responses and cell death through ROS-dependent
pathways.
Our
demonstration
that
Mtb-Deis
increased
the
production of proinflammatory cytokines by BMDMs (i.e., Eis
production alters patterns of cytokine production) is consistent
with our previous findings [16]. Additionally, we provide evidence
that Eis performs previously unrecognized functions in modulating
specific types of cell death, dependent on autophagy and ROS-
mediated signaling. Although autophagic pathways have been
widely explored as a strategy for overcoming mycobacterial escape
from phagosomal maturation, excessive activation of autophagy,
and the resulting cell death (caused by a robust increase in ROS
generation), did not apparently directly impact host defenses in
Mtb-Deis-infected cells.
Autophagy is a well-organized homeostatic cellular process
responsible for the removal of damaged organelles and the
elimination of intracellular pathogens [5]. Induction of autophagy
is critical to the eradication of Mtb from murine and human
macrophages [7,8]. Recent reports have emphasized the role of
autophagy in host defense against human tuberculosis caused by
Mtb [36]. Prolonged or excessive autophagy can result in non-
apoptotic type II programmed cell death [10]. We recently
reported that mycobacterial BCG cell wall induced autophagic cell
death in radiosensitized cancer cells [34]. Indeed, it is known that
several cytokines, including TNF-a, can activate autophagy
pathways [5]. Thus, because they have been shown to be potent
inducers
of
cytokine
production
[37],
it
is
possible
that
mycobacterial proteins and/or other cell components increase
the activation of autophagy by inducing the production of TNF-a.
In our recent study, we found that mycobacterial LpqH can
trigger the activation of autophagy [38]. Additionally, various
mycobacterial components, including ESAT6 [39], PE_PGRS 33
[40], and nuoG [41], have been reported in modulating host cell
death, i.e., apoptosis or necrosis. Moreover, a recent report
showed that Mtb mutation of nuoG or KatG leads to ROS
accumulation in phagosomes, with subsequent induction of host
cell apoptosis [42]. However, the genetic basis of mycobacterial
induction of autophagy-dependent cell death in normal macro-
phages has not been characterized. Macrophages that died after
Mtb-Deis infection displayed morphological features of autophagic
(type 2) cell death, characterized by the accumulation of
autophagic vacuoles (autophagosomes) in the cytoplasm [43].
Massive autophagic vacuolization may be the consequence of a
failed attempt by Mtb to adapt to its cellular environment, which
ultimately results in cell death [43].
Macrophages infected with Mtb-Deis at a relatively low MOI
(5–10) displayed higher rates of CICD and autophagy activation
than did cells infected with wild-type or complemented strains of
Mtb H37Rv. These data partly correlate with the previous finding
that infection with Mtb H37Rv at the same MOI slightly increased
macrophage cytotoxicity over control levels [44]. It has also been
shown that attenuated strains of mycobacteria at an MOI#10
trigger TNF-a-induced apoptosis, which is associated with innate
host defenses against intracellular mycobacteria [45]. Macrophag-
es infected with Mtb-Deis showed a modest, but significant,
increase in the rate of apoptosis, as assessed by the TUNEL assay.
Additionally, we observed no prominent sign of necrosis [46], such
as intracellular vesicular swelling, rupture of plasma membranes,
or dilation of cytoplasmic organelles, in macrophages infected with
Mtb-Deis. Thus, our data show that Mtb Eis is involved in the
control of a novel type of cell death, characterized by massive
autophagic vacuolization. This type of cell death was modulated
by inhibitors of autophagy: 3-MA (see Fig. 4).
After showing that Eis is involved in autophagy-dependent cell
death, we considered the possibility that Eis may affect the
intracellular survival of bacteria. We previously reported that an eis
deletion mutant of Mtb had no growth defect in human monocytic
U937 cells or in mice [16]. The current study confirms our
previous findings [16] that an eis deletion mutant of H37Rv
multiplies at a rate similar to WT or complemented strains in the
lungs and spleen of infected mice (see Fig. 6D). In contrast, a
recent study reported that deletion of eis reduced the growth of the
clinical Mtb strain TB294 in Mono Mac 6 cells [18]. This clinical
strain was found to express 20-fold higher levels of Eis than
H37Rv [18]. This discrepancy may be the result of strain-specific
differences in the production of Eis and/or the use of different host
cells [18]. Recent findings showed that an eis promoter mutation
that increases Eis expression conferred resistance to kanamycin in
clinical Mtb strains, by increasing its acetylation and inactivation
[17]. We thus suggest that overproduction of Eis may enable some
clinical Mtb strains to modulate autophagy and cell death,
especially those with eis promoter mutations. It will be interesting
to determine whether clinical strains overproducing Eis exhibit
altered
intracellular
growth
and
disease
outcomes
through
subversion of autophagy, cell death, and host defense.
Activation of an exacerbated inflammatory response during
Mtb-Deis infection may explain the lack of effect on bacterial
elimination despite the induction of autophagy. Indeed, our
previous [16] and current studies showed that inflammatory
responses
are
profoundly
up-regulated
in
Mtb-Deis-infected
monocytes/macrophages. Here, proinflammatory cytokine pro-
duction was negatively regulated by autophagy activation in Mtb-
Deis-infected
macrophages
(Fig.
S2).
Despite
the
potential
contribution of autophagy to this inflammatory balance, increased
ROS and subsequent organelle damage by Mtb-Deis infection may
trigger an amplifying positive feedback loop and in so doing
induce massive autophagy and cell death. If production of pro-
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines during mycobacterial
infection is excessive or inappropriate, it may hinder protective
immunity and exacerbate the pathology [47].
Our data show that significant up-regulation of ROS produc-
tion (for which NOX and mitochondria are largely responsible) is
required for Mtb-Deis to increase macrophage inflammatory and
autophagic responses, which are normally controlled by Eis. These
findings partially agree with our previous studies showing that
NOX2-dependent ROS generation played a key role in TLR2-
dependent inflammatory signaling and cathelicidin production in
macrophages [28]. Selective autophagic degradation of catalase
and subsequent ROS accumulation cause lipid membrane damage

and autophagic cell death, indicating the complex nature of the
relationship between ROS and non-apoptotic programmed cell
death [48]. Additionally, overproduction of ROS contributed to
CICD in macrophages treated with lipopolysaccharide and the
pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD [48]. At the molecular level, ‘‘Toll/
IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFN-b’’
(TRIF) and ‘‘receptor-interacting protein 1’’ (RIP-1) operate
upstream of ROS production and are involved in inducing
autophagy and CICD [49]. In starvation-induced autophagy,
ROS serve as signaling molecules that induce autophagy and
regulate cysteine protease HsAtg4 [50]. Moreover, previous
studies showed that activation of TLRs or Fcc receptors induced
autophagy through NADPH oxidase-derived ROS [30].
Regarding the signaling pathways linking ROS and cell death,
our data provide evidence for the involvement of JNK signaling in
macrophages infected with Mtb-Deis. Recent studies have shown
that JNK pathways contribute to the induction of non-canonical
autophagy by activating Atg7 [51]. Additionally, other studies
showed that increased oxidative stress results in the induction of
endoplasmic reticulum stress, which, in turn, can lead to
autophagy and cell death through activation of a JNK/p38
signaling pathway [52]. Moreover, JNK signaling has been shown
to play an important role in autophagic cell death [53]. We found
that the activation of JNK was required for Mtb-Deis-induced
ROS generation and cell death. Thus, it appears that oxidative
stress and JNK/SAPK constitute a positive feedback loop that
contributes to the induction of cell death with autophagy by Mtb-
Deis.
Given the specific pathologic events that occur in Mtb-Deis-
infected macrophages, several mechanisms could explain the
observed excessive autophagy and resulting cell death. First,
excessive ROS generation (for which NOX and mitochondria are
primarily responsible), may contribute to increased activation of
autophagy. Data generated using ROS inhibitors and NOX2-
deficient mice show that excessive ROS generation is responsible
for the induction of autophagy and inflammation by Mtb-Deis.
The marked induction of autophagy by Mtb-Deis may be
attributed to the expected need for increased protein/organelle
turnover in injured cells undergoing oxidative stress, such as those
with damaged mitochondria [54]. Second, our findings suggest
that Eis regulates a key player in host innate immunity through its
N-acetyltransferase domain. This idea is supported by the
observations that Mtb-Deis-mediated ROS generation and inflam-
matory cytokine production were inhibited by pretreatment with
Eis and realized in an N-acetyltransferase domain-dependent
manner (see Fig. 7). Finally, the phenotype of Mtb-Deis-infected
macrophages may depend on their activation state. When
macrophages were primed using interferon-c and lipopolysaccha-
ride prior to exposure to Mtb-Deis, they showed a significant
decrease in overall cell death, but a concurrent increase in the rate
of apoptosis (data not shown). These data indicate that the
activation of macrophages may alter their mechanism of cell death
during subsequent Mtb-Deis infection. Thus, excessive activation
of autophagy appears to play an important role in cell death,
although cell death with autophagy does not affect the ability of
host cells to efficiently eliminate invading bacteria.
Our data provide evidence that Eis plays an essential role in
regulating both the early generation of ROS and inflammatory
responses in macrophages. These activities are dependent on the
acetyltransferase moiety of Eis. Previously, we reported that Eis is
a member of the GCN5-related family of N-acetyltransferases, as
determined through bioinformatics analyses [16]. Members of this
family of proteins are involved in a variety of activities, ranging
from transcriptional activation to antibiotic resistance [55]. The
well-characterized effector YopJ from Yersinia spp. acetylated
critical serine and threonine residues in the activation loop of
MAPKK6, thereby blocking its phosphorylation [56]. This
resulted in the inhibition of MAPK and nuclear factor-kB
signaling and, thus, the innate immune responses to Yersinia
infection [56,57]. The current data suggest that the mycobacterial
effector Eis regulates eukaryotic cell function through the direct
modification of target proteins, effected by its N-acetyltransferase
domain.
Together, our results provide novel insights into the roles of
mycobacterial Eis in controlling and suppressing host inflamma-
tory responses and cell survival/death, which it achieves by
modulating ROS-dependent JNK activation. Excessive activation
of autophagy was shown to cause cell death, as well as inefficient
bacterial clearance, in macrophages infected with Mtb-Deis. Eis
itself regulated oxidative stress and inflammation through its
acetyltransferase domain. Our present characterization of the
mycobacterial effector Eis as a modulator of autophagy and cell
death presents a previously unknown paradigm for understanding
host-pathogen interactions in mycobacterial infection.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Recombinant Eis Protein
Mtb-WT, Mtb-Deis, and Mtb-c-eis strains were generated and
used in these experiments. The eis gene was disrupted in H37Rv
by means of a two-step gene replacement strategy using a pMJ10
allelic exchange vector (ts oriM; sacB counterselection; KanR,
GentR) as described previously [58]. A vector was constructed that
contained the eis gene disrupted by a hygromycin cassette (eis:hyg/
pMJ10). This vector (5 mg) was introduced into electrocompetent
Mtb H37Rv cells. Transformants were first selected by growth on
7H10-OADC-Tween 80 plates containing hygromycin B (50 mg/
mL) at 37uC for 3–4 weeks. Individual antibiotic-resistant colonies
were selected and subcultured onto fresh plates. Several clones
were then picked and grown in 50 mL of 7H9-ADC broth
containing hygromycin B at 37uC for 48 h. Cells from the broth
cultures were then diluted in 7H9-ADC broth and plated on 2%
sucrose-7H10-OADC-hyg and incubated at 39uC for 3–4 weeks.
The double-resistant (sucR/hygR) clones were selected and shown,
by Southern blotting, to be Deis mutants (data not shown). The
H37RvDeis mutant was complemented using an integration vector
(pMV306) containing a single copy of the eis gene (mycobacterial
integration vector; integrates into the attB site; KanR) [59]. To
obtain purified Eis protein, N-terminally His-tagged Eis was
induced, harvested and purified from, E. coli expression strain BL-
21 DE-3 pLysS, as described by Samuel et al. [16] following
standard protocols recommended by Novagen. Mtb strains were
grown as described previously [13]. The bacterial cultures were
divided into 1-mL aliquots in cryovials and stored at 270uC prior
to use. Representative vials were thawed, and viable CFUs were
counted on Middlebrook 7H10 agar. Single-cell suspensions of
mycobacteria were prepared as described previously [60].

were maintained under barrier conditions in a BL-3 biohazard
animal room at Yonsei University Medical Research Center.
Animals were fed a sterile commercial mouse diet and water ad
libitum. NOX2 (C57BL/6 background) mice were kindly provided
by Y. S. Bae (Iwha University, Seoul). Mice used as a source of
cells for in vitro experiments were housed in specific pathogen-free
conditions. Those used in individual experiments were age- and
sex-matched mice (and 5–8 weeks of age). BMDMs were isolated
and then differentiated by growth for 5–7 days in medium
containing M-CSF (25 mg/mL; R&D), as described previously
[13]. RAW 264.7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, as
described previously [13]. Human THP-1 (ATCC TIB-202)
monocytic cells were grown in RPMI 1640/GlutaMAX, supple-
mented with 10% FBS [8]. Cells were treated with 20 nM PMA
(Sigma-Aldrich,
St.
Louis,
MO)
for
24 h
to
induce
their
differentiation into macrophage-like cells and then washed three
times with PBS.
Mtb Infection and Bacterial Counts In Vitro and In Vivo
In vitro macrophage infection was performed as described
previously [13]. Briefly, cells were infected with mycobacteria at
different MOIs and incubated for 4 h at 37uC in a 5% CO2
atmosphere. After allowing time for phagocytosis, cells were
washed four times with fresh PBS to remove extracellular bacteria
and then incubated with complete DMEM without antibiotics. As
controls, cultures of uninfected macrophages (UI) were maintained
under the same conditions. The infection rates for the three strains
were approximately 35–45% when BMDMs were infected at an
MOI of 5. Rates of infection were increased in infected
macrophages when the MOI was increased. There was no
significant difference in infection rates between the three strains.
To test the capacities of the Mtb-WT, Mtb-Deis, and Mtb-c-eis
strains to survive intracellularly, BMDMs were infected with each
strain at MOIs of 1 and 5. Then, 4 h later, cells were washed with
PBS three times, and the majority of extracellular bacteria (.99%)
were removed, as determined through staining with auramine-
rhodamine (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). After washing, the cells
were incubated in fresh medium for a further 3 days. They were
then lysed in autoclaved distilled water to allow intracellular
bacteria to be collected [8]. The lysates were then re-suspended
and sonicated for 5 min in a preheated 37uC water bath sonicator
(Elma, Singen, Germany). Aliquots of the resulting sonicates were
serially diluted in 7H9 broth, plated separately on 7H10 agar
plates, and incubated at 37uC in 5% CO2 for 12 d. Colony
counting was then performed in triplicate.
Mice were challenged by aerosol exposure with Mtb-WT, Mtb-
Deis, or Mtb-c-eis using an inhalation device (Glas-Col, Terre
Haute, IN, USA) calibrated to deliver approximately 50 bacteria
into the lungs. Five mice per group were sacrificed at 4 weeks post-
challenge, and bacteria in lung and spleen homogenates were
counted.
Numbers
of viable
bacteria
in lung/spleen
were
determined by plating serial dilutions of whole organ homogenates
on Middlebrook 7H11 agar (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA). Colonies
were counted after 3–4 weeks of incubation at 37uC.
Reagents, DNA, Abs, and Transfection
DPI (a NOX inhibitor), NAC (an antioxidant), catalase, and z-
VAD-fmk (a pan-caspase inhibitor) were purchased from Calbio-
chem (San Diego, CA, USA). 3-MA, tiron (a commercial
deflocculant), and DAPI were purchased from Sigma. DMSO
(Sigma) was added to cultures at a concentration of 0.1% (v/v) as a
solvent control (SC). The plasmid that encoded EGFP-LC3 [20]
was a gift from Tamotsu Yoshimori (Osaka University, Japan).
pCMV-Eis-WT and pCMV-Eis-DAT constructs were created by
subcloning the whole eis gene (WT), or an acetyltransferase
domain-deletion mutant (lacking the sequence encoding residues
61–137 of the 402-amino-acid Eis protein) from pET21a. This was
achieved by cutting at the BamHI and SacI restriction sites and
then ligating the resulting inserts into the pCMV-Tag1 mamma-
lian expression vector (Stratagene Co., USA).
Anti-LC3 antibodies (Abs) used for Western blotting and
immunofluorescence analysis were purchased from Novus Biolog-
icals and MBL International (Woburn, MA, USA), respectively.
Anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa488 and IgG-TRITC, and anti-mouse IgG-
Cy2, were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove,
PA, USA). siRNAs specific for mBeclin 1 (sc-29798), mAtg5 (sc-
41446), and mJNK1 (sc-29381), each a pool of five target-specific
19–25 nt siRNAs, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). Cells were transfected with plasmids
and/or siRNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Measurement of ROS Production
Intracellular ROS levels were measured by DCFH-DA and
DHE assays as described previously [61]. Briefly, BMDMs were
differentiated in culture dishes and infected with bacterial strains
(MOI = 10) for 30 min. Cells were then incubated with either
DCFH-DA (5 mM) or DHE (10 mM; Molecular Probes) for
30 min at 37uC in 5% CO2 and then washed with Krebs-Hepes
buffer (for DHE staining) or HBSS (for DCFH-DA staining). Total
intracellular levels of ROS were determined by FACS analyses of
the oxidative conversion of cell-permeable DCFH-DA (Molecular
Probes) to fluorescent DHE (Molecular Probes), using the
FACSCanto II system (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA).
A mitochondrion-specific hydroethidine-derivative fluorescent
dye (MitoSOX; M36008; Calbiochem) was used to determine
relative
mitochondrial
O2
2
levels
in BMDMs. Cells
were
incubated for 30 min in PBS containing 5 mM MitoSOX. They
were then washed twice and analyzed using the FACSCanto II
system. All FACS data were collected using 50,000 to 100,000 cells
and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR,
USA).
Cell Viability and Apoptosis Assays
Cell viability was assessed by PI staining and then examined by
fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometric analysis. Trypan blue-
stained cells were counted using a ViCell counter (Beckman
Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA). Apoptosis was examined by TdT-
mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL; Promega), accord-
ing
to
the
manufacturer’s
instructions.
Labeled
cells
were
examined under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (model
LSM 510; Zeiss). Each condition was assayed in triplicate, and at
least 200 cells per well were counted. To analyze in vivo cell death,
single-cell suspensions were prepared in RPMI 1640 medium by
passing cell populations through a nylon mesh with 50 mm pores
and were subjected to further analysis.
Western Blotting, RT-PCR and ELISA
Treated BMDMs were processed for analysis by sandwich
ELISA, Western blotting, and RT-PCR as described previously
[2]. For Western blot analysis, primary Abs were diluted 1:1000.
Membranes were developed using a chemiluminescent reagent
(ECL; Pharmacia-Amersham, Freiburg, Germany) and subse-
quently exposed to film (Pharmacia-Amersham). Supernatant
TNF-a and IL-6 levels were measured by sandwich ELISA using
Duoset Ab pairs (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) [2].

To provide RNA for RT-PCR analysis, paraffin-embedded
tissue sections were first deparaffinized in octane [62]. After
vigorous vortexing, 150 mL of methanol were added. Samples
were vortexed again and the tissue was pelleted by centrifugation
(10,0006g, 2 min). Supernatants were removed, and the remain-
ing tissue was vacuum-dried for 20 min. Next, pellets were
resuspended in digestion buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5%
N-laurylsarcosine, 1 M guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mM 2-mercap-
toethanol) containing proteinase K (5 mg/mL; Sigma). After
overnight digestion at 55uC, RNA was extracted using TRIzol
(Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For
quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed by using SYBR
Green (Molecular Probes) PCR core reagents (Applied Biosys-
tems), and transcript levels were quantified by using an ABI 7900
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). The mean value
of triplicate reactions was normalized against the mean value of b-
actin. Primers were used at 400 nM.
Autophagy Analysis
Autophagosome formation was measured by LC3 punctate
staining, as described previously [8]. To quantitate autophagy, we
used fluorescence microscopy to count the percentages of GFP-
LC3-positive autophagic vacuoles in transfected cells or the
numbers of endogenous LC3 punctate dots in primary cells. Each
condition was assayed in triplicate, and at least 200 cells per well
were counted. LC3 conjugation was evaluated by Western blot
analysis using an antibody raised to LC3-I/II.
Transmission Electron Microscopy
Infected and stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophages were washed
with PBS and then fixed with 3% formaldehyde, 2% glutaralde-
hyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h. They
were then post-fixed in 1% osmium tetroxide, 0.5% potassium
ferricyanide in cacodylate buffer for 1 h; embedded in straight
resin; and cured at 80uC for 24 h. Ultrathin sections (70–80 nm),
cut using an ultramicrotome (RMC MT6000-XL), were stained
with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined using a Tecnai
G2 Spirit Twin transmission electron microscope (FEI Company,
USA) and a JEM ARM 1300S High Voltage electron microscope
(JEOL, Japan).
Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence analysis was performed as described
previously [8]. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS at 4uC for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.01% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 10 min. Cultures were then stained for 2 h at
room temperature with primary antibodies, including rabbit anti-
mouse LC3 (1:400; MBL International). After washing, to remove
excess primary antibody, cultures were then incubated for 1 h at
room temperature with an anti-rabbit IgG-Alexa488 secondary
antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch). Nuclei were stained by
incubation with DAPI for 5 min. Slides were examined using a
laser-scanning confocal microscope (model LSM 510; Zeiss).
Statistical Analyses
Data obtained from independent experiments (presented as
mean6SD) were analyzed by the paired Student’s t-test with
Bonferroni correction or analysis of variance (for multiple
comparisons). A p value,0.05 was deemed to indicate statistical
significance.
Accession Numbers
The GenBank accession number for the eis gene is AF144099.
