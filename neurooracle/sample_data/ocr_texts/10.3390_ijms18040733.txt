Abstract: Schizophrenia is a highly heritable, chronic, severe, disabling neurodevelopmental brain
disorder with a heterogeneous genetic and neurobiological background, which is still poorly
understood. To allow better diagnostic procedures and therapeutic strategies in schizophrenia
patients, use of easy accessible biomarkers is suggested. The most frequently used biomarkers in
schizophrenia are those associated with the neuroimmune and neuroendocrine system, metabolism,
different neurotransmitter systems and neurotrophic factors. However, there are still no validated and
reliable biomarkers in clinical use for schizophrenia. This review will address potential biomarkers
in schizophrenia. It will discuss biomarkers in schizophrenia and propose the use of speciﬁc
blood-based panels that will include a set of markers associated with immune processes, metabolic
disorders, and neuroendocrine/neurotrophin/neurotransmitter alterations. The combination of
different markers, or complex multi-marker panels, might help in the discrimination of patients with
different underlying pathologies and in the better classiﬁcation of the more homogenous groups.
Therefore, the development of the diagnostic, prognostic and theranostic biomarkers is an urgent and
an unmet need in psychiatry, with the aim of improving diagnosis, therapy monitoring, prediction of
treatment outcome and focus on the personal medicine approach in order to improve the quality of
life in patients with schizophrenia and decrease health costs worldwide.

1. Vulnerability and Resilience in Mental Disorders
There are numerous environmental and biological factors that interact with genetic factors and
contribute to vulnerability or resilience with respect to the development of mental disorders [1].
Most psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, develop in vulnerable subjects who failed
to cope with stress and do not achieve positive outcomes when faced with adversities and
stressors [2]. Resilience is modulated by diverse systems (neurotransmitters, neurotrophic factors,
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, immune system, autonomic nervous system, oxidative
stress and metabolic markers), working together to recover from various stressors and stressful
experiences and to achieve a positive adaptation after exposure to stressors that are presenting
as threats to homeostasis [3,4]. Resilience may help understanding the heterogeneous therapeutic
outcomes in schizophrenia [4]. One of the major systems involved in the regulation of the stress is
the HPA axis, which shows enhanced activity (i.e., increased release of corticotrophin releasing
factor (CRH), adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol) as a response to stress [5,6].

The HPA axis is self-regulated, with a negative feedback mechanism which inhibits HPA axis activity;
and after the system responses to stress or challenge, the HPA axis returns to its “normal” activity,
i.e., homeostasis [5,6].
2. Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia is highly heritable, chronic, severe, disabling neurodevelopmental brain disease
with heterogeneous genetic and neurobiological background. Symptoms of schizophrenia include
positive, negative, cognitive and mood symptoms. Positive symptoms consist of psychotic symptoms,
such as hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior. Negative symptoms include
reduced emotions, poverty of speech, and loss of interests and drive, while cognitive symptoms
comprise of deﬁcits in working memory, attention and in executive functions, such as the ability to
organize and abstract. Mood symptoms consist of depressive, cheerful or sad moods. Schizophrenia
is a complex, multifactorial and polygenic mental disorder, estimated to affect 1% of population
worldwide [1,2,7]. Stress, which modiﬁes the HPA function, has been strongly implicated in the
etiology of schizophrenia [8].
The neural-diathesis stress model of schizophrenia hypothesizes
that schizophrenia develops as a consequence of the HPA axis dysregulation, and that different
neurotransmitters and neuroimmune factors, neuroanatomical structures, pathways and connectivity,
and genetic, epigenetic, neurodevelopmental and environmental factors modulate the main stress
system (i.e., HPA axis activity) in vulnerable subjects exposed to stress [9–11].
The development of schizophrenia is mediated by numerous risk factors [2]: prenatal and perinatal
complications, paternal older age, male gender, living in the urban environment, migration status,
drug abuse (especially cannabis, amphetamine, methamphetamine and cocaine), and exposure to
stressors (physical abuse, sexual abuse, maltreatment and bullying). The etiology of schizophrenia
is far from clear, but family, twin and adoption studies all point to the major role of genetic factors,
among other contributing factors, in its etiology [1].
Genetic factors might be associated with
vulnerability to the disorder (i.e., they represent risk factors) in the presence of negative environmental
inﬂuences (gene x environment interaction), and are proposed to be called plasticity variants,
since they moderate susceptibility to both negative as well as positive environmental inﬂuences [1].
However, like in other complex mental disorders, it is assumed that development of schizophrenia
is associated with complex interactions between various genetic risk factors, environmental factors,
and exposure to early traumatic experiences, which all together modulate/inﬂuence the long-lasting
neurodevelopmental changes in the neural circuits and neural pathways of the central nervous
system (CNS) and alter homeostasis. When these factors overcome resilient defense mechanisms,
schizophrenia will develop in vulnerable subjects. Therefore, genetic predisposition in accord with
negative environmental stimuli will trigger development of schizophrenia; while on the other hand,
without adverse environmental stimuli, genetic predisposition alone will not be responsible for
development of the disease [1].
3. Biomarkers
Due to diverse clinical phenotypes, symptoms and presentation, and heterogeneity of the
overlapping symptoms and functional deﬁcits in schizophrenia [2,12], its underlying biological
background is poorly understood.
Therefore, studies are focused on investigations of smaller,
more subtle, stable characteristics of the disease such as phenotypes, endophenotypes or intermediate
traits, associated with schizophrenia. To allow better diagnostic procedures, therapeutic strategies
and prediction of therapies [13], the use biomarkers that can be measured or determined from the
easily available body ﬂuids such as plasma/serum, urine or cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) is suggested
(Figure 1). Biomarkers have three general functions: to improve diagnostic procedure as diagnostic
biomarkers, to predict development of the disease as prognostic biomarkers (predisposition screening),
and to be used in therapy monitoring as potential predictors of good or poor therapeutic response
as theranostic biomarkers [13,14]. Biomarkers should be used in complex psychiatric disorders such

as schizophrenia, since their use could facilitate diagnosis, prognosis (risk), prediction of disease,
identiﬁcation of speciﬁc symptoms, or pathological behaviors such as suicidal/aggressive/violent
behavior, treatment response, and development of adverse events [7,13,15–17].
 
Figure 1. Biomarkers that can be measured or determined from the post-mortem brain or using
in vivo neuroimaging studies, as well as from peripheral cells and easily available body ﬂuids such as
plasma/serum, urine or cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF).
To facilitate deeper understanding of the molecular, cellular and systems alterations in
schizophrenia, the use of diagnostic, prognostic but also theranostic biomarkers (i.e., novel tests
or indicators or biomarkers used to identify the individual patient who will beneﬁt from the most
appropriate, efﬁcacious treatment, given in the optimal dose, without toxic side effects and predict
treatment response) is strongly recommended [13,16–18]. The term “theranostics” is deﬁned as
an answer to the unmet needs in medicine and in psychiatry to achieve personalized medicine
approach in treatment; to improve diagnoses and to combine diagnostic processes with the best
possible therapeutic strategies [18].
Biomarkers of schizophrenia may be divided into peripheral and central biomarkers. However,
since schizophrenia is a disease of systemic nature, some biomarkers (i.e., analytes from the post
mortem brains of patients with schizophrenia) are related to changes found in the blood, suggesting
that brain/CNS and periphery are interconnected and therefore blood-based biomarkers are useful
tools to reveal some processes in the brain [19].
These ﬁndings were recently conﬁrmed and
reviewed, since alterations in gene expression and epigenetic changes, together with alterations
in proteomic and metabolic markers are detected in the CNS as well as in periphery [17]. This was
explained by the reciprocal interactions that exist between the brain and the periphery, modulated
by the neurotransmitters, hormones and cytokines, which affect gene expression of the peripheral
indicators. On the other hand, the same molecules (hormones, neurotransmitters, or cytokines) might
modulate central i.e., brain functions [17]. Biomarkers might be divided into those associated with the
neuroimmune system (inﬂammatory biomarkers), neuroendocrine system (neuroendocrine related
biomarkers), metabolism (metabolic biomarkers), neurotrophic factors (neurotrophic biomarkers),
and neurotransmitters (neurotransmitter biomarkers), shown in Figure 2 [17].

3.1. Inﬂammation Biomarkers in Schizophrenia
Severe infectious illnesses are often accompanied by speciﬁc symptoms of schizophrenia, such as
psychotic symptoms, mood disturbance and cognitive dysfunction [20]. A signiﬁcant amount of
evidence suggests that inﬂammation is a contributing factor to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia,
and in agreement, changes in immunological markers have been found in blood, such as C-reactive
protein (CRP) or different interleukins (IL) of patients with schizophrenia [21,22].
In addition,
there are also data showing an association of different perinatal inﬂammatory cytokines with the
development of schizophrenia later in life [23]. Some epidemiologic studies imply a connection
between increased risk of schizophrenia and severe infection or autoimmune disease in anamnesis [24].
Besides, several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) emphasize a possible involvement of the
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) locus and other immune regulatory regions in schizophrenia
susceptibility [25].
CRP, as an acute-phase marker of inﬂammation, is found in higher concentrations in patients with
schizophrenia than in healthy control subjects [26,27]. More speciﬁcally, higher CRP levels are shown
to be associated with the severity of schizophrenia symptoms evaluated by the Positive and Negative
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) [28,29]. Since elevated CRP levels are in correlation with an increased risk of
metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia [30], there is an unmet need for researchers to control their results
for possible confounding factors such as body mass index (BMI), gender or smoking. Perhaps this
could be one of the explanations for inconsistencies between studies reporting elevated serum CRP
levels in patients with schizophrenia and those reporting no association between CRP levels and
schizophrenia [31]. CRP levels were determined in patients with chronic schizophrenia treated with
different types of antipsychotics and switched to olanzapine treatment [32]. An increase of serum CRP
concentration after 8 weeks of olanzapine treatment was reported [32].
Other potential markers of schizophrenia are different types of cytokines, proteins that modulate
inﬂammatory processes and have an important role in development of CNS. A meta-analysis included
14 studies dealing with cytokine concentrations in serum of the ﬁrst episode schizophrenia patients
and reported increased concentration of interleukin IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α,
transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, interferon (IFN)-γ and soluble IL-2-receptor (sIL-2R) [33].
The same study suggested IL-1β, IL-6 and TGF-β as schizophrenia state markers, since they were
elevated in both the ﬁrst episode and the relapse of the disease, but these markers were decreased after
antipsychotic treatment [33]. On the other hand, IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF-α and sIL-2R were presented as
potential trait markers that do not normalize after the treatment [33]. Some other interleukins, such as
IL-1RA, IL-10 and IL-15 [34], were also found to be increased in schizophrenia, while IL-6R, cluster of
differentiation 5-like protein (CD5L), also known as apoptosis inhibitor expressed by macrophages,
and IL-17 were even proposed to be a differentiating factor between pre-onset schizophrenia and

bipolar disorder [35]. Besides, tumor growth factor (TGF)-α, CD5L, cluster of differentiation 40 (CD40),
macrophage-derived chemokine and TNF receptor like 2 protein showed potential as predicting
markers of schizophrenia relapse [36].
Interleukins and their role in the etiology of schizophrenia are investigated through the observed
association between infections during pregnancy and risk for schizophrenia among offspring.
Rather broad literature data, although inconsistent, indicate a higher risk of schizophrenia in people
whose mothers were infected during pregnancy with inﬂuenza [37], rubella [38], polio [39], measles [40],
herpes simplex virus-type 2 [41], or Toxoplasma gondii (toxoplasmosis) [42]. Since placenta acts as
impermeable barrier for most infections, it is assumed that negative outcomes of maternal infections
are caused by maternal and fetal responses to infection, which are primarily mediated by cytokines [43].
For example, there are studies reporting elevated levels of TNF-α and IL-8 in perinatal period of adult
patients with schizophrenia [44,45]. More precisely, fetal exposure to increases in maternal IL-8 was
found to be signiﬁcantly associated with increased ventricular cerebrospinal ﬂuid volume [46], a most
commonly found brain disturbance in schizophrenia [47].
Schizophrenia shares similarities with some autoimmune diseases. In patients with schizophrenia,
there are reports on increased levels of different auto-antibodies such as lupus anticoagulants,
rheumatoid factors and antibodies against cardiolipin, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,
DNA and dopamine receptor, with anti-NMDA receptor antibodies as the differentiating factor
between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder [48]. Additionally, typical schizophrenia symptoms,
cognitive deﬁcits and acute psychosis could be found in autoimmune diseases, such as systemic
lupus erythematosus [49]. Studies of autoantibodies in schizophrenia will hopefully contribute to
understanding the neurobiological basis of disorder and ﬁndings of new treatment solutions.
Genetic studies estimate approximately 50% contribution of genetics to schizophrenia [50].
GWAS revealed a possible involvement of MHC region in genetic background of schizophrenia [51].
The MHC region consists of over 200 genes, including the TNF superfamily, human leukocyte antigen
genes and complement cascade genes, and has an extremely important role in the regulation of immune
system [52]. Further, GWAS covered ﬁve major psychiatric disorders (autism spectrum disorder,
attention deﬁcit-hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia)
and reported that particular polymorphisms (for example rs2021722) within the MHC region are
speciﬁc only for schizophrenia [53]. Additionally, alternate expression rates of the class I major
histocompatibility complex genes in postmortem hippocampus samples of patients with schizophrenia
were reported [54].
There are indications about the more effective treatment of schizophrenia symptoms with
antipsychotics combined with nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs) [55] or aspirin
as adjuvant therapy [56]. A study on mouse model of schizophrenia reported an attenuated
amphetamine-induced behavioral impairment in mice treated with risperidone in combination with the
NSAID celecoxib [57]. Additionally, in patients with ﬁrst-episode psychosis, strong inﬂammation partly
interfered with the effectiveness of antipsychotic drugs, with higher levels of IL-6 and IFN-γ associated
with worse response to antipsychotic treatment [58]. In patients with schizophrenia seropositive for
Toxoplasma gondii, treatment with antipsychotics with anti-toxoplasmic activity showed better results
than treatment with antipsychotics without anti-toxoplasmic activity [59]. Meta-analysis including
23 follow-up studies found an increase of sIL-2 and decrease of IL-1β levels and IFN-γ after the
treatment with antipsychotics, concluding that antipsychotic drugs show anti-inﬂammatory effects
in schizophrenia [60]. Similarly, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNFα levels in serum of drug-naïve patients with
ﬁrst-episode psychosis were reduced after risperidone treatment [61].
Based on the current ﬁndings, the conclusion is that although predictive value of inﬂammatory
biomarkers is still not completely deﬁned, they still show great potential. Besides, these new ﬁndings
represent a great contribution to some promising new therapeutic approaches such as biological
immunotherapy in schizophrenia.

3.2. Neuroendocrine-Related Biomarkers in Schizophrenia
3.2.1. The HPA Axis-Related Biomarkers in Schizophrenia
The HPA axis is important in development of schizophrenia since the HPA axis and
sympatho-adrenal medullary system both modulate response to stress, which is one of the factors
associated with its etiology. Besides stress, inﬂammation also signiﬁcantly affects the HPA axis.
Biomarkers in schizophrenia are related to hormones of the neuroendocrine systems, and also hormonal
systems regulating metabolic system [14]. The HPA axis abnormalities and dysfunction are well
recognized in schizophrenia, offering potential biomarkers, since patients with schizophrenia usually
have elevated basal cortisol levels compared to values in healthy subjects [62–68]. These ﬁndings,
showing either no effect or a small-to-medium increase in morning cortisol levels in patients
with schizophrenia compared to controls, were conﬁrmed in the recent meta-analyses [66,69].
These controversial results might be explained by the presence of various symptoms or different phases
of schizophrenia [70]. Besides basal levels, patients with schizophrenia usually show altered response
to challenge tests such as dexamethasone suppression test (DST) [62,63,65], CRH test [71], or DST/CRH
test [72]. Namely, these tests assess the negative feedback of the HPA axis after administration of
a challenge, and cortisol escape from suppression after DST is frequently seen in these patients [63,65].
DST non-suppression ranges from 0 to 81% [70]. In addition, HPA abnormalities are documented also
by the ﬁndings showing glucocorticoid receptor downregulation associated with altered and reduced
HPA axis system negative feedback mechanism, and increased cortisol secretion frequently related to
reduced hippocampal volume in schizophrenia [10,11].
However, these data are not in harmony, and the results from the studies show both HPA
hyper- and hypofunction in schizophrenia [70]. Patients with schizophrenia usually show diminished
cortisol awakening response (CAR), i.e., cortisol concentration immediately after awakening [64].
In addition to morning alterations, diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion is altered in the afternoon and
evening in subjects with schizophrenia [73]. However, contradictory results can also be found [3,66,74].
Some recent reviews and meta-analyses were published to solve these contradictions: a meta-analysis
of the 44 studies (n = 2613) showed only a moderate increase in morning cortisol levels in patients with
schizophrenia compared to controls [66]. In a systemic review, in drug-naïve ﬁrst-episode patients,
elevated cortisol secretion was detected [70]. In patients receiving antipsychotic medication, atypical
antipsychotic treatment (i.e., olanzapine, quetiapine and clozapine) usually decreases ACTH and
cortisol levels [70]. We have previously reported that the typical antipsychotic ﬂuphenazine increases,
while the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine decreases, cortisol levels in patients with schizophrenia [75].
Therefore, a meta-analysis including a large group of medicated patients with schizophrenia (n = 1328)
concluded that cortisol levels did not differ from the values in control subjects, while in medicated
patients, most frequently treated with typical antipsychotics, cortisol is slightly increased compared to
values in healthy subjects [66]. These results suggest that careful consideration of present medication
use, type and doses is needed in the studies of the HPA axis biomarkers in schizophrenia. To exclude
these confounding factors, ﬁrst-episode patients or drug-naïve patients should be used. However,
due to the complicated clinical picture of schizophrenia, biomarkers should be used also in patients
with a chronic course of schizophrenia. Therefore, abnormal response of the HPA axis in schizophrenia
is present, but cortisol is affected by numerous factors, such as body ﬂuid (saliva or blood), time of
sampling, stage of the illness, various symptoms, antipsychotic medication and stress induced by
psychological and other environmental stressors [66,70]. Besides these factors, cortisol is under the
inﬂuence of development and age [11]. Therefore, components of the HPA axis such as moderately
increased cortisol, non-suppression to DST, altered diurnal rhythm of cortisol, and blunted or altered
cortisol response to physiological stressors might be used as neuroendocrine diagnostic biomarkers of
patients with schizophrenia, but should be compared to either drug-naïve patients or patients with
a ﬁrst episode of psychosis [70].

Genetic studies in neuroendocrine biomarkers of schizophrenia target most frequently two
genes, and their single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): a gene for FK506 binding protein-5
(FKBP5), encoding the protein FKBP51, and a gene for corticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor 1
(CRHR1), encoding the CRH type 1 receptors. FKBP5 is a protein (i.e., a co-chaperone) important
in the stress response, and its genetic variants are involved in stress response since they affect
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function and GR complex and therefore modulate negative feedback.
A risk variant of the FKBP5 associated with higher FKBP5 induction may provoke prolonged cortisol
release after stress, since it impairs the binding of cortisol to GR complex and inhibits its afﬁnity
to GR, decreases translocation, and impairs the negative feedback mechanism, leading to different
psychopathologies and personality traits, altered responses to stress, disrupted homeostasis, epigenetic
changes (FKBP5 SNP rs1360780), and changes in the neural pathways, brain function and synaptic
plasticity [1,76]. The rs1360780 risk allele of the FKBP5 inﬂuences different regions of the brain
associated with response to fear, threat and stress (amygdala and hippocampus), and in combination
with exposure to early traumatic experience affects the amygdala and other brain regions connected to
reactivity, emotional memory, and emotion processing. All these changes are associated with impaired
reactions to threat and activated HPA axis. This particular gene x environment interaction induces
altered responses to fear and stress associated with different psychopathological phenotypes [1,76].
FKBP5 overexpression was found in different regions of the postmortem brains, which are associated
with Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia [76]. Different SNPs of the FKBP5 and their risk genotypes
(rs3800373, rs9296158, rs1360780, and rs9470080) interacted with early traumatic experiences and were
associated with aggressive and violent behaviors [77]. FKBP5 SNPs (rs9296158, rs1360780, rs1043805,
and rs4713916) were also found to interact with childhood trauma to predispose to development of
psychotic symptoms [78]. Besides these aberrant behaviors frequent in psychiatric disorders, FKBP5
was reported to be increased in human adipose tissue after dexamethasone, implicating its role in
metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance [79]. These results all suggest that FKBP5 disinhibition
might be used to characterize endophenotypes sensitive to stress, associated with various stress-related
disorders, and therefore the blockade of the FKBP5 might be used in the treatment of different
phenotypes induced by stress [76].
Another genetic component of the HPA axis that is frequently investigated is a gene for
CRHR1. These CRHR1 regulate HPA axis activity and its negative feedback, and therefore its genetic
variants modulate CRH transmission, and under other environmental factors such as childhood
trauma may induce changes in CRHR1 signaling and HPA axis disruption, and altered stress
response [1]. Gene coding for the CRH binding protein (CRHBP) was investigated in schizophrenia.
The heterozygous genotype of the CRHB (rs1875999) was signiﬁcantly associated with suicidal
attempts, while the rare variant of BclI polymorphism in the glucocorticoid receptor gene (NC3R1)
11 was associated with protection from suicidal attempt in schizophrenic patients [80]. In addition,
the interaction between the two genes related to HPA axis, CRHR1 and CRHBP was detected in patients
who attempted suicide and with severity of suicidal behavior in schizophrenia [80]. The association
between CRHR1 and CRHBP genes with severity of suicidal behavior was found in patients with
schizophrenia [80]. All these genetic studies point to the importance of the gene x environment
interactions, and suggest that genes coding for proteins important in the regulation of the HPA axis
and stress response may contribute to long-lasting changes in the HPA axis function, and may alter
and disrupt negative feedback mechanism, homeostasis and emotion regulation, leading to different
mental disorders and altered behaviors [1].
3.2.2. Metabolic Biomarkers
Somatic disorders such as metabolic disorders as well as metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes,
insulin resistance and different cardiovascular diseases are frequent in schizophrenia [67,81].
Patients with schizophrenia have increased risk of having higher than normal body mass index
(BMI), being smokers, having increased glucose levels, and developing diabetes, hypertension and

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 733
8 of 38
dyslipidemia, all risk factors for cardiovascular disease, compared to healthy people [82]. Expression
of various hormones was found to differ signiﬁcantly between patients with schizophrenia and control
subjects: insulin, prolactin, pancreatic polypeptide, progesterone and chromogranin A (a protein of
the granin family composed of 439 amino acids that is located in the large dense-core vesicles of
the neuroendocrine cells) were increased, while growth hormone was decreased in patients with
schizophrenia compared to control subjects [67]. These results might explain how chronically elevated
insulin levels affect brain function and contribute to neuroinﬂammation, altered phosphorylation
and promote deposition of amyloid plaques, leading to changes characteristic of dementia [14].
Neuroendocrine biomarkers, such as cortisol, insulin, leptin, pro-opiomelanocortin, prolactin and
growth hormone were similarly altered in the brain and in the blood in patients with schizophrenia [19].
Other neuroendocrine biomarkers altered in schizophrenia are gonadal hormones estradiol and
testosterone, suggesting gender differences in schizophrenia [14], as well as hormones of the
thyroid gland such as decreased thyroxine, tri-iodothyronine, and thyroid-stimulating hormone [83],
suggesting that these biomarkers might represent peripheral plasma markers of oxidative stress and
thyroid dysfunction in schizophrenia.
There are controversial ﬁndings of the levels of the neurosteroids dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
and DHEA sulphate (DHEAS), collectively known as DHEA(S), in schizophrenia [84]. They have
neuroprotective and neuromodulatory effects, and were reported to be increased, decreased or similar
in schizophrenic patients compared to healthy control subjects [84]. In addition, there are also ﬁndings
showing the augmentation strategies using DHEA(S) in the treatment of schizophrenia: in studies
performed on a small number of patients, addition of DHEA(S) as the augmentation strategy improved
somatic health, decreased insulin resistance and inﬂammatory markers and had positive effects on the
quality of life or physical disability [84].
These results conﬁrm that some indicators of metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance, or the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal–gonadal axis are present in patients with schizophrenia, and that
these neuroendocrine and/or metabolic biomarkers might be used to discriminate between patients
with or without the risk for metabolic disorder, improve the understanding of the pathophysiological
processes associated with schizophrenia, advance the development of treatments focused on these
endocrine and metabolic disorders and consequently help in personalized medicine strategies [14,67].
3.3. Neurotrophins as Candidate Biomarkers in Schizophrenia
3.3.1. Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor
Neurotrophins play a signiﬁcant role during the development of the nervous system by promoting
neuronal growth and differentiation, but they are also very important in the adult brain since they
modulate neuronal plasticity and function. Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), neurotrophin (NT)-3 and NT-4/5 are the members of neurotrophin family which are
located in the mammalian brain. All of these neurotrophins are synthetized as pro-neurotrophin
precursors which are then proteolytically cleaved to yield mature proteins [85]. Binding to
an appropriate tyrosine kinase receptor (Trk) or pan neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) activates
different signaling pathways leading to speciﬁc and diverse biological effects of neurotrophins [86].
Lately, neurotrophins and their precursors have aroused great interest as the possible players in
the pathophysiology of several psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia. According to the
neurodevelopmental hypothesis, schizophrenia is considered to be the result of pathologic processes
that began during pre- and post-natal development of the CNS [87]. Since BDNF has an important role
in the processes of CNS development and maintenance, it is considered to be one of the main players
in light of the neurodevelopmental hypothesis.
Studies have shown signiﬁcantly reduced expression of BDNF gene, gene coding for TrkB
receptor, and signiﬁcantly decreased BDNF protein concentration in the hippocampus of patients with
schizophrenia [88,89]. However, a study by Durany and colleagues further pointed out an increased

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 733
9 of 38
BDNF concentration in cortex of individuals with schizophrenia [89]. Meanwhile, there is also evidence
of lower BDNF levels in prefrontal cortex and in CSF of subjects diagnosed with schizophrenia [90].
In the last decade, many research strategies have focused on the peripheral BDNF as a potential
biomarker in psychiatry.
The sources of the peripheral BDNF are platelets and immune and
vascular endothelial cells [91,92], but there are also indications that BDNF is able to cross the
blood–brain barrier [93]. Studies of BDNF as a peripheral biomarker in psychiatric disorders, including
schizophrenia [94], are supported by a strong positive correlation between peripheral BDNF levels
and BDNF levels in the CNS [95,96]. Low serum BDNF protein levels were determined in drug-naïve
patients with schizophrenia [97–100], but also in schizophrenic patients who were treated with
different antipsychotics [101–105]. These results were conﬁrmed by a meta-analysis, which included
16 individual studies [106]. A signiﬁcant correlation between serum BDNF levels and clozapine daily
dose was found, suggesting also that the treatment with clozapine can lead to cognitive enhancement
in patients with schizophrenia [107]. Another study, which drew attention to the existence of three
different isoforms of BDNF in the serum, (i.e., precursor, mature and truncated forms of BDNF),
suggested that individuals with schizophrenia have lower levels of truncated isoform, compared
to other forms of BDNF [108]. The biological role of the truncated isoform of BDNF has not yet
been clariﬁed. Animal studies demonstrated a signiﬁcant effect of antipsychotic treatment on BDNF
brain levels. Treatment with haloperidol decreased BDNF messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein
levels in different brain areas, including hippocampus and prefrontal cortex [109–111], and a similar
effect was observed for risperidone administration [109]. In addition, a switch from haloperidol,
which negatively affects the expression of BDNF, to olanzapine treatment, restored BDNF levels to
normal values [112]. Findings by Chlan-Fourney and colleagues demonstrated that hippocampal
BDNF mRNA expression is affected by chronic, but not acute treatment with antipsychotics [113].
The observed effect was most likely a result of long-term changes in gene regulation, rather than
blockade of the serotonergic receptors type 2 (5-HTR2) and dopaminergic receptors type 2 (DRD2).
Even though existing studies have failed to irrefutably prove the effect of treatment with antipsychotics
on peripheral BDNF concentration and mRNA expression, there is a need for additional investigations,
which will help to further clarify the role of neurotrophins in the response to treatment with different
atypical antipsychotics.
The association studies between genetic polymorphisms of BDNF and schizophrenia resulted in
contradictory ﬁndings. Literature search usually yields results concerning two of the most common
SNPs of the BDNF gene, Val66Met (rs6265) and C270T (rs56164415). Polymorphism Val66Met is
functional since it affects the BDNF mRNA intracellular trafﬁcking and the activity-dependent
secretion of BDNF protein by disturbing the interaction of BDNF with transport molecules like
sortilin [114,115]. The C270T polymorphism is assumed to modulate the BDNF gene expression
and post-transcriptional regulation of this expression, due to its position in the 5′ untranslated
region and the assumptions that it is located within CpG islands [116].
Some studies have
shown that the BDNF Met allele or the Met/Met genotype is associated with the increased risk
of developing schizophrenia [117,118]. However, it was also reported that the BDNF Val allele
could be related to lower hippocampal volume [119] and be one of the genetic risk factors for
schizophrenia [120,121]. Most of the studies linking BDNF Val66Met to schizophrenia found no
association between this polymorphism and development of schizophrenia [122–126]. Even though
a meta-analysis conducted by Zintzaras found no evidence for the association between BDNF Val66Met
polymorphism and schizophrenia, it suggested a possible association between schizophrenia and
the other SNP, BDNF C270T polymorphism [126]. This association was conﬁrmed in the East Asian
population by another meta-analysis based on 13 case-control association studies [127], suggesting
that the T allele may contribute to predisposition to schizophrenia. Some other authors also observed
a higher frequency of the T allele carriers and C/T heterozygotes in subjects with schizophrenia,
compared to healthy individuals [128,129]. However, there are studies that did not conﬁrm these
results [123,124,130]. Genetic variants of BDNF were also reported to be signiﬁcantly associated

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 733
10 of 38
with response to treatment with antipsychotics. Few studies reported association between BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism and treatment response in schizophrenic patients, indicating a higher
frequency of the Val/Val homozygotes in clozapine treatment responders [131,132], and olanzapine
treatment responders [133], compared to non-responders. However, there are studies that failed to
conﬁrm the above mentioned associations between the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and clozapine
treatment response [134,135]. Study by Zai and colleagues also suggested an over-representation
of the rs11030104 T/T genotype and the T allele in responders compared to non-responders,
and an association between the marker rs1519480 and antipsychotic-induced weight gain [132].
Another genetic BDNF marker, dinucleotide microsatellite repeat polymorphism (GT)n, was associated
with treatment response and chlorpromazine-induced extrapyramidal reverse effects in Chinese
patients with schizophrenia [136]. Other studies have linked antipsychotic-induced weight gain
with BDNF genetic variants, including BDNF Val66Met polymorphism [137], rs11030101 [138],
and rs1519480 [132]. A systematic review and a meta-analysis by Cargnin and colleagues, which
included nine different studies, found no evidence that would irrefutably support the involvement of
BDNF gene variants in the antipsychotic drug response [139]. However, these authors suggested that
future studies should focus on haplotype combinations, which include BDNF Val66Met polymorphism
with other BDNF SNPs.
Different epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for activity-dependent regulation of BDNF gene
expression [140,141], implicating the possible role of the regulation of BDNF expression in several
psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia [142–144]. There are only a few studies that investigated
the promoter methylation frequency in patients with schizophrenia. Mill and colleagues found no
difference in DNA methylation proﬁles between patients with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,
compared to healthy controls [145]. A study by Igekame and colleagues revealed the hypermethylation
of one CpG site in the BDNF promoter I and no difference in the BDNF promoter IV methylation
frequency between schizophrenic patients and healthy individuals [146]. However, the results from
the other study suggested a difference in the promotor IV methylation frequency and BDNF gene
expression between patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and control subjects [147]. Yet the question
remains as to whether the alterations in methylation status of speciﬁc genes are directly associated
with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, or are a consequence, at least in part, of an antipsychotic
treatment. Global DNA hypomethylation was reported in the leukocytes of patients diagnosed with
schizophrenia [148], which could be related to the chronic treatment with different antipsychotics
demonstrating DNA-demethylation activity [149].
3.3.2. Other Neurotrophins
There are only few studies that have addressed the role of other neurotrophins in pathophysiology
of schizophrenia.
Decreased NT-3 levels in the cortex of schizophrenia patients compared to
non-psychotic individuals were detected [89].
Different gene association studies suggested an
association between dinucleotide repeat polymorphism in the promoter region of gene coding for
NT-3 and schizophrenia [150,151], but these results were not conﬁrmed [152]. However, the carriers of
A3/147-bp allele in a dinucleotide repeat polymorphism were reported to have earlier age of onset and
more serious extrapyramidal symptoms [153]. Another NT-3 polymorphism, Gly63Glu, which results
in an amino acid substitution of glycine by glutamic acid at position 63, has also been associated with
schizophrenia, earlier age of onset and the duration of illness [154].
A few recent studies demonstrated reduced NGF blood levels in the ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia
patients compared to healthy individuals [155,156]. Decrease in NGF and NGF receptor (NGFR) blood
levels was conﬁrmed in drug-naïve schizophrenia patients and patients treated with haloperidol [157].
In addition, an association between different NGF (rs6330, rs4839435) and NGFR (rrs11466155,
rs2072446, rs734194) polymorphisms and schizophrenia were also found [157].
There is convincing evidence of an association between BDNF and schizophrenia. Even though
changes in the mRNA expression and protein concentration of BDNF and other neurotrophins in the

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 733
11 of 38
brain and at the periphery are not speciﬁc only for schizophrenia patients, further studies are needed
to determine if these systemic alterations are the cause or consequence of the neurodevelopmental
changes in schizophrenia.
3.4. Neurotransmitter Biomarkers
3.4.1. Dopaminergic System
Various findings demonstrated the hyperfunction of dopaminergic system in the mesolimbic system
of patients with schizophrenia creating the “dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia” [158–162].
This classical DA hypothesis of schizophrenia was mostly concerned with the hyperactivity of DA
signaling in subcortical regions such as striatum [162–166], and with signiﬁcant role of DRD2 in
the development of positive symptoms [167–170]. This dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia
has been also supported by the correlation between efﬁcacy of antipsychotic drugs in treating
schizophrenia and their potency to antagonize the binding of DA to DRD2 [171–173], as well as
by the ability of dopaminergic agents, such as psychostimulant amphetamine, to induce excessive
release of striatal DA and stimulate schizophrenia-like psychosis [174–176]. However, enduring
negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, resistant to DRD2 antagonist treatment, suggested
that they might be due to a deﬁcit in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) DA transmission at DRD1 [177–180].
According to this hypothesis of cortical/subcortical imbalance in schizophrenia, hypoactive DA
neurotransmission in PFC, resulting in hypostimulation of DRD1, and negative and cognitive
symptoms, leads to disinhibition of subcortical mesolimbic DA activity, resulting in hyperstimulation
of DRD2 and positive symptoms of schizophrenia [159,181–183]. Therefore, the optimal schizophrenia
treatment should increase DA activity in the mesocortical regions and decrease mesolimbic DA
activity [184]. These ﬁndings also stimulated further research investigating the risk genes involved in
the pathophysiology of schizophrenia [185]. These genetic studies also included the polymorphisms
in the genes coding for various DA receptors and their association with schizophrenia [186–189],
as well as with antipsychotic treatment response [190–193], however with contradictory results.
Various markers of dopaminergic function have been also investigated in the blood of subjects with
schizophrenia [194], in order to ﬁnd peripheral biomarkers. For instance, DA uptake by platelets was
shown to correlate with delusional state in subjects with schizophrenia [195]. Tyrosine hydroxylase
(TH), the enzyme involved in the synthesis of DA, has been reported to be increased in lymphocytes of
schizophrenia patients [196]. Although elevated lymphocyte mRNA levels of DA transporter (DAT)
were demonstrated in patients with schizophrenia [197], reduced density of the lymphocyte DAT
proteins was reported in psychosis [198]. The plasma or CSF levels of homovanillic acid (HVA),
the principal DA metabolite, were found to be elevated in schizophrenia [199–202], and to predict
response to antipsychotics drugs [203–205]. Some authors reported the up-regulation of DRD2 mRNA
expression and DRD2 binding in lymphocytes from schizophrenia patients [206,207], although other
studies have not conﬁrmed these ﬁndings [197,208]. In addition, DRD2 mRNA levels in lymphocytes
are suggested to correlate with positive symptoms of schizophrenia [197], whereas lymphocyte DRD2
binding was reduced after treatment with antipsychotic drug loxapine [209]. The results regarding
DRD3 were also conﬂicting, demonstrating increased [208,210,211], as well as decreased [212] levels of
lymphocyte DRD3 mRNA in schizophrenia. DRD4 mRNA in lymphocytes was found to be lower [208],
or un-changed [197] in patients with schizophrenia compared to control subjects. The changes in
lymphocyte DRD3 and DRD5 mRNA seem to be associated with schizophrenia symptom severity [211],
with increased levels observed following antipsychotic treatment [211,212]. Moreover, some studies
demonstrated the increased binding of DA antagonists in lymphocytes of subjects with schizophrenia
in comparison to control group [206,213], as well as in responders to antipsychotic treatment as
compared with treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients [214].
Genes associated with schizophrenia and antipsychotic drug response include the catechol-O-
methyl transferase (COMT) gene, coding for an enzyme involved in the catabolism and regulation of

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 733
12 of 38
DA levels in the PFC [215,216]. Various studies linked schizophrenia with a region on chromosome
22q11.2, where the COMT gene has been located [217,218]. Many association studies investigated
Val158/108Met (rs4680) functional polymorphism in the COMT gene. The Val/Val genotype of this
polymorphism, which results in the higher COMT activity compared to Met/Met genotype, may lead
to a decreased DA neurotransmission in PFC [219,220], characteristic for schizophrenia [221]. However,
the studies yielded inconsistent results, associating both the high activity “Val”, and low activity
“Met” alleles with schizophrenia [215,222–226], or failing to detect any association [227,228]. The more
recent meta-analysis found only a weak association of this polymorphism with schizophrenia [229].
Inconsistent associations of Val158/108Met in subjects of Asian origin have been attributed to another
COMT gene polymorphism, Ala72Ser (rs6267) [230]. Other reports also demonstrated the association
of additional COMT polymorphisms and haplotypes with schizophrenia [231–234], as well as the
synergistic effects of COMT gene with genes involved in other neurotransmitter systems [235,236].
In addition, the hypomethylation of the COMT gene promoter, which leads to over-expression
of COMT, has been found in post-mortem brains [237], as well as in peripheral blood cells of
schizophrenia patients [148,238,239].
As COMT hyperactivity in schizophrenia might result in
decreased dopaminergic neurotransmission in the PFC, and consequently to the development of
negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia [215], different COMT inhibitors have been
investigated for potential treatment [240–246]. It has been demonstrated that COMT inhibition
potentiates the increase in extracellular DA in PFC elicited by the antipsychotic drug clozapine [247].
Regarding antipsychotic response, the ﬁndings of the studies investigating the role of COMT
Val158/108Met polymorphism were also conﬂicting, showing that schizophrenia patients with
Met/Met genotype have poor [248], as well as good response to antipsychotic treatment [233,249–253].
However, some authors found no association of this polymorphism with the therapeutic response
to antipsychotic drugs [254–256]. In addition, higher daily antipsychotic doses seem to be needed in
schizophrenia patients, homozygous for the Met allele [257,258]. Other polymorphisms and haplotypes
in the COMT gene have been also associated with response to antipsychotic treatment [233,251,259].
3.4.2. Serotonergic System
The involvement of the serotonergic system in schizophrenia was suggested from the studies
demonstrating that lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), structurally similar to serotonin (5-HT), produces
various schizophrenia-like symptoms [260], as well as from the ability of some atypical antipsychotics,
such as clozapine, to improve symptoms of schizophrenia by modulating the 5-HT concentration [261].
It has been suggested that dopaminergic hypofunction, observed in schizophrenia, might be due
to the up-regulation of ascending serotonergic pathways [262]. The disturbed interconnectivity
between serotonergic and dopaminergic [263], as well as between serotonergic, cholinergic and
gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)ergic systems in the cortex and hippocampus [264,265], might play
an important role in the complex pathophysiology of schizophrenia [266]. The decrease in the density
of the 5-HT transporter (5-HTT), increase in 5-HTR1A number and reduction of 5-HTR2 levels in
the brain have been most frequently reported evidence of the involvement of serotonergic system
in schizophrenia [260]. Various 5-HT receptors have been particularly associated with cognitive
impairment in schizophrenia [267]. Reports from post-mortem studies have shown reduction in the
5-HTT number [268,269]. Moreover, a recent meta-analysis reported increased 5-HTR1A binding in
PFC, but diminished or unchanged in the amygdala [270]. Since stimulation of 5-HTR1A was found to
promote the release of dopamine in PFC, it is possible that the effects of antipsychotic drugs such as
clozapine, ziprasidone and aripiprazole are partly achieved by their agonistic action via 5-HTR1A [271].
Increased hippocampal 5-HTR1B mRNA levels were also observed in subjects with schizophrenia [272].
In spite of the conﬂicting results obtained in vivo [273,274], reduced density of prefrontal 5-HTR2A
has been found in the post-mortem studies of schizophrenia [270]. Concerted 5-HTR1B up-regulation
and 5-HTR2A down-regulation could result in decreased GABAergic and increased glutamatergic
activity in the hippocampus of schizophrenia patients [272]. Although no changes in the number of

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 733
13 of 38
5-HTR3 and 5-HTR4 were found in the brain of schizophrenia patients [275,276], the associations of
5-HTR3E and 5-HTR4 gene variants with schizophrenia have been reported [277,278]. Various studies
also supported the role of 5-HTR7 in the neurobiological basis in schizophrenia, including reduction in
the 5-HTR7 expression in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex [279,280], the association of 5-HTR7
gene haplotype with development of schizophrenia [281], the afﬁnity of some antipsychotic drugs for
5-HTR7 [279,282], and the up-regulation of 5-HTR7 following antipsychotic treatment [279]. Studies
measuring peripheral serotonergic biomarkers found contradictory results. Increased platelet 5-HT
concentration has been demonstrated in schizophrenia patients [283–285]. However, lower baseline
5-HT concentrations in plasma and platelets were observed in poor responders to antipsychotic drugs
in comparison to control subjects and increased signiﬁcantly during treatment [286]. On the other
hand, Kaneda and colleagues reported lower platelet 5-HT in the subjects with schizophrenia receiving
antipsychotic treatment [287]. Potential association of genetic variations of 5-HT receptors and 5-HTT
with schizophrenia and therapeutic response to antipsychotics has been intensively investigated in
a large number of studies [288–290]. Genetic polymorphisms of 5-HTR2A and 5-HTR2C, at which
act many antipsychotic drugs, have been the main targets of pharmacogenetic analyses [192,291,292].
However, some studies found no associations between polymorphisms in genes encoding 5-HT
receptors and 5-HTT with antipsychotic treatment response [190,293]. Regarding the involvement of
serotonergic system in the development of side effects of antipsychotics, pharmacogenetic research has
focused primarily on weight gain [294–297], while relatively small number of studies has investigated
the extrapyramidal side effects [298]. Although some authors reported the associations between tardive
dyskinesia and 5-HTR2A and 5-HTR2C gene polymorphisms, the results are not uniform [299,300].
In addition to genetic research, some epigenetic studies have demonstrated DNA methylation changes
such as hypermethylation of HTR1A gene [301], and differential methylation of the HTR1E gene [238] in
peripheral blood cells of schizophrenia patients. Based on current ﬁndings, different authors suggested
agents modulating 5-HTR2C [302,303], 5-HTR3 [304], and 5-HTR6 [305], as potential schizophrenia
drug targets.
3.4.3. Norepinephrine System
A number of studies supported the norepinephrine hypothesis of schizophrenia [306], suggesting that
elevated norepinephrine signaling may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia [307–310].
Increased concentrations of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), the metabolite of norepinephrine,
were demonstrated in plasma of subjects with schizophrenia [205], but not in CSF [311]. On the other
hand, decrease in plasma MHPG was observed during treatment to antipsychotic treatment [312,313].
However, antipsychotic drugs risperidone and clozapine have been shown to elevate plasma
norepinephrine levels, whereas risperidone produced a smaller effect [314]. Therapeutic approaches
using norepinephrine drugs, especially α-2A agonists, in combination with antipsychotics have been
proposed for treatment of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia [315].
3.4.4. Cholinergic System
The cholinergic system has been associated with schizophrenia in various reports [316], mainly
suggesting down-regulation of cholinergic activity [317]. Decreased mRNA levels for α-7 acetylcholine
receptors have been found in the post-mortem brain [318], as well as in lymphocytes of subjects with
schizophrenia [319]. Post-mortem studies demonstrated lower α-7 nicotinic receptor binding in the
hippocampus and thalamic nuclei [320,321], as well as reduced α-7 receptor protein expression in
the frontal cortex of subjects with schizophrenia [322]. Disturbed cholinergic function, particularly
involving nicotinic receptors, has been linked with higher smoking frequency among schizophrenia
patients in comparison to general population [323]. Some studies also suggested a nicotinic cholinergic
α-7 receptor as a promising target for therapy of cognitive deﬁcits in schizophrenia [324,325].
An increasing body of evidence has also implicated muscarinic system as contributing to a number
of symptoms of schizophrenia, especially related to cognitive impairment [326]. Down-regulation

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 733
14 of 38
of muscarinic receptors has been observed in large areas of the post-mortem brain of patients with
schizophrenia [327,328]. Allosteric modulation of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor has been
proposed as a potential target for therapeutic interventions in schizophrenia [329].
3.4.5. Glutamatergic System
Different schizophrenia susceptibility genes and various schizophrenia-related environmental
factors inﬂuence glutamatergic neurotransmission [330–334]. However, one of the main ﬁndings
supporting the glutamatergic hypothesis, based on the glutamate-dopamine dysbalance in
schizophrenia, is that phencyclidine and ketamine produce psychosis, with positive, negative and
cognitive symptoms, resembling those in subjects with schizophrenia [335–337]. Treatment with
these N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists induce schizophrenia-like dopaminergic
dysregulation in human subjects [338], as well as in animal models [339]. Post-mortem studies
have shown variable changes in the expression of NMDAR in the brain of schizophrenia
patients [340–342]. On the other hand, some studies indicated greater sensitivity of NMDAR in
patients with schizophrenia [343]. The involvement of abnormal glutamate transmission in various
impaired neurophysiological measures, observed in schizophrenia, has been suggested by Javitt and
colleagues [344]. In agreement with the proposed role of glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology
of schizophrenia [173], many researchers investigated the peripheral levels or functions of various
amino acids that activate glutamate receptors and modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission [343].
In addition to reduced markers of glutamatergic neuronal integrity in the plasma and CSF of
schizophrenia patients [345], lower concentrations of glutamate [346], glycine [332,347], and D-serine
were observed [348]. However, some studies demonstrated increased concentrations of glutamate [349],
agmatine [350], glutamine [351], D-serine and glycine [352] in plasma or blood from subjects
with schizophrenia, in comparison to control subjects. Lower plasma D-serine and D-/L-serine
ratio were found in the treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients, whereas glycine levels and
glycine/L-serine ratio were increased following clozapine treatment [353]. In addition, D-serine
plasma levels were associated with improvements in positive [352], but not in cognitive symptoms of
schizophrenia [354]. Agonists acting via glycine-site of NMDAR induced improvements in negative
and cognitive symptoms, whereas D-serine and sarcosine, administered together with antipsychotics,
reduced positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia [355–357]. In addition to NMDAR, the
potential glutamatergic drug targets for schizophrenia treatment include also metabotropic (mGluR2/3)
glutamate receptors [358–360].
3.4.6. GABAergic System
Various research evidence support abnormal GABAergic neurotransmission in schizophrenia [361–367].
One line of findings came from the post-mortem studies demonstrating a decrease in the density, as well
as specific abnormalities of GABAergic interneurons, in the hippocampus and PFC of schizophrenia
patients [362,366], regions important for the somatosensory information processing. The hypothesis of
dysfunctional GABAergic interneurons is supported by the observed hypermethylation in cortex and
basal ganglia of subjects with schizophrenia [368–373], resulting in a down-regulation of GABAergic
genes and GABAergic neuronal circuit dysregulation [369,374,375]. Such hypermethylation has been
observed also in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with schizophrenia [376]. One of such
hypermethylated genes is the gene coding for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting
enzyme in GABA biosynthesis, for which expression is found to be generally lower in post-mortem
brain of schizophrenia patients compared to controls [361,377–381]. In accordance with this hypothesis
of GABAergic hypofunction in schizophrenia, GABAA receptor agonists might have beneﬁcial effects
when administered alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs. Some of the other results
suggesting GABAergic neuropathology in schizophrenia include lower GABA levels in plasma
of subjects with schizophrenia [199], down-regulation of prefrontal GABAA receptor α5 subunit
mRNA [382], and the associations of different polymorphisms and haplotypes in the GABAA receptor

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 733
15 of 38
β2 subunit gene (GABRB2) with schizophrenia [383]. Moreover, the density of the peripheral-type
benzodiazepine receptors in platelets is suggested as a possible predictor for aggressive behavior in
schizophrenia patients [384].
4. Conclusions
Schizophrenia is a complex disease associated with different alterations in the brain circuits
and molecular pathways, characterized with different signs and completely different symptoms [2].
This review described the potential of the use of speciﬁc markers associated with immune processes,
or with metabolic disorders or neuroendocrine/neurotrophin/neurotransmitter alterations that might
help in discrimination of patients with speciﬁc, different underlying pathology or treatment response.
Better classiﬁcation or deﬁnition of the more homogenous groups will improve understanding of
the biological underpinning of schizophrenia, and consequently improve treatment strategies and
personal medicine approaches. This was recently conﬁrmed in ﬁrst episode psychosis patients, where
non-responders to treatment had signiﬁcantly lower CAR and signiﬁcantly higher IL-6 and IFN-γ
levels than responders to treatment [58]. These data suggested that blunted CAR in combination with
proinﬂammatory IL-6 and IFN-γ levels that were elevated in non-responders could be used as trait
markers, and as predictors of the poor treatment response [58]. The combination of selected cytokines
(sIL2—increased by antipsychotics, and IL-1β and IFN-γ—decreased by antipsychotics) could be used
as marker of the treatment response, since antipsychotic treatment corrected the inﬂammation in
schizophrenia [60].
The neurotrophin BDNF is an interesting candidate in the search for biomarkers that could improve
diagnosis and therapy monitoring in patients with schizophrenia. Most of the studies reported reduced
expression of BDNF gene and significantly decreased BDNF protein concentration in different brain areas,
and decreased concentration of plasma BDNF in patients with schizophrenia [88–90,97–100]. In contrast
to neuroendocrine and immune markers that were associated with treatment response, BDNF was
conﬁrmed to be signiﬁcantly reduced in plasma samples of schizophrenia patients, either in medicated
or in drug-naïve patients [106]. Chronic treatment with antipsychotics affected BDNF mRNA and
protein expression in both the CNS and at the periphery [106]. Signiﬁcant association was reported for
BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and antipsychotic treatment response, showing that better therapeutic
response was found in carriers of the Val/Val homozygous genotype and suggesting that this genotype
might be used to predict good treatment response in schizophrenia [131–133]. Future studies should
focus on linking speciﬁc BDNF haplotype combinations with treatment response in patients with
schizophrenia [139].
However, confounding factors, such as sex, the use of oral contraceptive pills, or pre-and
postmenopausal status or phases of the menstrual cycle should be controlled, since they present
sources of variation that might signiﬁcantly impact biomarker ﬁndings [385]. Besides these hormonal
variables, biomarkers should be adjusted for age, BMI, medication, but also other demographic,
lifestyle, and health variables [385]. Opposed to previous criteria [386] that included paranoid,
disorganized, catatonic, residual and undifferentiated subtypes of schizophrenia, new diagnostic
DSM-5 criteria [387] removed schizophrenia subtypes as they were associated with poor reliability,
low stability over time, and had insigniﬁcant prognostic value, and therefore did not contribute to
improved treatment or better prediction of the treatment response [388]. Due to the reduced utility
of schizophrenia subtypes and their poor diagnostic and prognostic values [388], this review did not
focus on markers or the combinations of markers that could be best suited to differentiate between
different forms or subtypes of schizophrenia.
At present, there are still no validated laboratory tests, biomarker(s) or a panel of combined
markers for schizophrenia diagnosis, prognosis or the prediction of the treatment response. Selected
serum analytes (among the 34 analytes betacellulin, bone morphogenic protein 6, eotaxin 3,
follicle stimulating hormone and epidermal growth factor were signiﬁcantly altered in ﬁrst-onset
antipsychotic naïve patients with schizophrenia compared to control subjects), were suggested to

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 733
16 of 38
indicate a reproducible biological signature, but these studies need replication in larger population
and in longitudinal studies [389].
Despite intensive research, due to many inconsistencies among studies, no neurotransmitter
markers have been considered as valid theranostic biomarkers for schizophrenia which could
soon enter the clinical routine [390]. In addition to the components of monoamine systems,
other candidate neurotransmitter biomarkers recently received increased attention [391]. However,
there is still a limited evidence of their validity and speciﬁcity in schizophrenia, as so far these
ﬁndings have not been sufﬁciently reproduced in larger cohorts and independent samples [392].
Although neurotransmitter changes observed in the brain are often not accompanied with the
same patterns in the periphery, evidence suggests that they can be used as potential biomarkers
of schizophrenia treatment efﬁcacy [17]. This refers especially for the peripheral monoamine-related
molecules that, due to their strong association with the pharmacological properties of antipsychotic
drugs, might represent good indicators of treatment response, instead of being stable trait markers
suitable for straightforward diagnosis of schizophrenia [17].
Recently [393], schizophrenia was postulated to represent altered homeostasis of immune/
inﬂammatory, oxidative stress, endocrine and metabolic signaling processes that mediate and affect
dopaminergic, serotonergic, glutamatergic, GABA-ergic and cholinergic neurotransmission and
white matter-associated neural connectivity. This review conﬁrmed that neuronal connectivity is
modulated by the cross-talk among molecular markers of these systems associated with disturbances
in stress signaling, and vice versa [393].
Numerous molecular substrates, responsible for the
imbalance in homeostatic signaling, should be used to discover validated biomarkers or biomarker
test in schizophrenia.
Therefore, the future use of diagnostic, prognostic and theranostic biomarkers will improve
diagnosis, therapy monitoring, and prediction of treatment outcome [13–17]. These biomarkers,
when validated and approved for clinical practice, will improve the quality of life in patients with
schizophrenia and decrease health costs worldwide.
