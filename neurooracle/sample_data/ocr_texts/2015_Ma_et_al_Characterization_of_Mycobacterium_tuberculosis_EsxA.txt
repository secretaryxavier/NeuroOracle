Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis EsxA exhibits a pH-dependent membrane-interacting activity.
Results: Both the N- and C-terminal flexible arms are required for membrane disruption, and the central helix-turn-helix motif
of EsxA inserts into the membrane.
Conclusion: EsxA forms a membrane-spanning pore at low pH.
Significance: An understanding of EsxA membrane insertion facilitates development of novel therapeutics against tuberculosis.
EsxA (ESAT-6), an important virulence factor of Mycobacte-
rium tuberculosis, plays an essential role in phagosome rupture
and bacterial cytosolic translocation within host macrophages.
Our previous study showed that EsxA exhibits a unique
membrane-interacting activity that is not found in its ortholog
from nonpathogenic Mycobacterium smegmatis. However, the
molecular mechanism of EsxA membrane insertion remains
unknown. In this study, we generated truncated EsxA proteins
with deletions of the N- and/or C-terminal flexible arm. Using a
fluorescence-based liposome leakage assay, we found that both
the N- and C-terminal arms were required for membrane dis-
ruption. Moreover, we found that, upon acidification, EsxA con-
verted into a more organized structure with increased -helical
content, which was evidenced by CD analysis and intrinsic tryp-
tophan fluorescence. Finally, using an environmentally sensitive
fluorescent dye, we obtained direct evidence that the central
helix-turn-helix motif of EsxA inserted into the membranes and
formed a membrane-spanning pore. A model of EsxA mem-
brane insertion is proposed and discussed.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects one-third of the world’s
population and kills over 1 million people each year (1).
Although significant progress has been made over decades of
research efforts, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of
M. tuberculosis pathogenesis are still not fully understood. It is
widely believed that after being internalized into host macro-
phages, M. tuberculosis establishes latent infection and remains
inside the phagosomes through inhibiting phagosome matura-
tion (2–4). Transition of latent infection to active tuberculosis
requires M. tuberculosis to rupture the phagosomal mem-
branes and translocate into the cytosol, where it replicates for
cell-to-cell spreading (5–7). The ability of the pathogen to
arrest phagosome maturation and to translocate from the pha-
gosome to the cytosol has been attributed, at least in part, to a
type VII secretion system named ESX-1 (5–9). Comparative
genomic studies have revealed that the esx-1 locus is present in
the genome of M. tuberculosis but is absent in the genome of
the attenuated vaccine stain Mycobacterium bovis bacillus
Calmette-Guérin (10, 11). Deletion of esx-1 from M. tuberculo-
sis results in attenuation of virulence (12–14), whereas transfer
of esx-1 into bacillus Calmette-Guérin partially restores viru-
lence (15, 16). The esx-1 locus comprises 11 genes that encode
the ESX-1 secretion system and two secreted proteins: ESAT-6
(6-kDa early secreted antigenic target; also called EsxA or
Rv3875) (17, 18) and CFP-10 (10-kDa culture filtrate protein;
also called EsxB or Rv3874) (19). EsxA and EsxB are secreted by
the ESX-1 system in a codependent manner (20). Mutants of
M. tuberculosis with either gene deletions or defects in secre-
tion of EsxA and/or EsxB are not translocated into the cytosol
and show reduced host cell lysis and cell-to-cell spreading (5–7,
12, 14, 21). Recently, it has been shown that apoptosis induction
in host cells is clearly restricted to virulent M. tuberculosis
strains and is associated with the capacity of M. tuberculosis to
secrete EsxA (22). Biochemical analysis has shown that EsxA
and EsxB form a 1:1 heterodimeric complex (23, 24), and EsxA
exhibits membrane-lysing activity (12, 25). However, direct evi-
dence that EsxA inserts into the membrane is lacking, and the
molecular mechanism of EsxA membrane interaction has not
been defined.
In our previous study, we characterized the pH-dependent
membrane interactions and conformational changes of M.
tuberculosis EsxA, and we showed that M. tuberculosis EsxA
exhibits a unique membrane-interacting activity that is not
found in its ortholog from nonpathogenic Mycobacterium
smegmatis (26). To investigate the mechanism of EsxA mem-
brane insertion further, in this study, we generated EsxA pro-
teins with N- and/or C-terminal deletions and found that both
the N- and C-terminal flexible arms were required for mem-
brane disruption. Moreover, we used the environmentally sen-
sitive fluorescent dye N,N-dimethyl-N-(iodoacetyl)-N-(7-ni-

trobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol)ethylenediamine (NBD)2 and the
liposome-based NBD fluorescence assay to provide direct evi-
dence that, upon acidification, the central helix-turn-helix
motif of EsxA inserted into the liposomal membranes and
formed a membrane-spanning structure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Genes, Constructs, and Site-directed Mutagenesis—The full-
length esxA gene (WT, residues 1–95) immediately followed by
a C-terminal His6 tag was cloned into pET22b at the NdeI/XhoI
sites as described previously (26). An esxA gene fragment with
C-terminal residues 86–95 deleted (C) and also immediately
followed by a His6 tag was obtained by PCR and cloned into
pET22b at the NdeI/XhoI sites. esxA gene fragments with
N-terminal residues 1–10 deleted (N) or both N-terminal res-
idues 1–10 and C-terminal residues 86–95 deleted (NC)
and immediately followed by a C-terminal His6 tag were
obtained by PCR and cloned into the pGEX4T-1 vector at the
BamHI/XhoI sites. All truncated constructs were confirmed by
DNA sequencing.
To generate cysteine mutations for NBD labeling, pET22b-
EsxA(WT) was used as the template. The selected residues of
EsxA were mutated to cysteine by site-directed mutagenesis
using a QuikChange kit (Agilent). All cysteine mutations were
confirmed by DNA sequencing.
ExpressionandPurificationoftheRecombinantProteinsofEsxA
WT, N, C, and NC—WT EsxA and C were expressed and
purified from bacterial inclusion bodies as described previously
(26). Briefly, pET22b-EsxA(WT) and pET22b-EsxA(C) were
expressedinBL21(DE3)cells.Theinclusionbodywasisolatedand
thensolubilizedin8 Murea.Theproteinswererefoldedonanickel
columnandelutedwithanimidazolegradient.Theelutedproteins
were further clarified by size exclusion chromatography to 90%
purity. N and NC were expressed as GST fusion proteins
following a similar protocol to that described previously for puri-
ficationofGST-EsxB(26).Briefly,GST-NandGST-NCwere
expressed as soluble proteins in BL21(DE3) cells. The fusion pro-
teins were purified on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. The
purified GST fusion proteins were cleaved with thrombin, and
His-tagged N and NC were purified on a nickel column, fol-
lowed by size exclusion chromatography.
Liposome Preparation—Liposomes were prepared as described
previously (26–30). Briefly, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phos-
phocholine (20 mg/ml in chloroform) was dried under nitro-
gen gas to form a lipid film, followed by vacuum overnight to
remove residual solvent. For liposomes containing the dye/
quencher
pair
8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic
acid
(ANTS)/p-xylene-bispyridinium bromide (DPX), the resulting
dry lipid film was rehydrated by six freeze-thaw cycles in 50 mM
ANTS, 50 mM DPX, and 5 mM HEPES (pH 7.3), followed by
extrusion through a 200-nm Nucleopore filter in a mini-ex-
truder (Avanti Polar Lipids). Subsequently, the liposome solu-
tion was applied to a Sephadex G-25 desalting column equili-
brated with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4) and 150 mM NaCl for buffer
exchange. The resulting liposome solution had ANTS/DPX
inside the liposomes, whereas there was no fluorescent dye out-
side the liposomes. For liposomes used for NBD fluorescence, a
regular buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl and 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.3)) was
used to rehydrate the lipid film, and the liposomes were pre-
pared with similar freeze-thaw cycles and extrusion but without
desalting.
Time-lapse Intensity Measurements of ANTS/DPX Dequench-
ing—ANTS fluorescence dequenching was measured in an ISS K2
multiphase frequency and modulation fluorometer with excita-
tion at 380 nm and emission at 520 nm as described previously
(26). Briefly, 100 l of the liposomes containing ANTS/DPX after
desalting was diluted into 1.3 ml of 50 mM sodium acetate and 150
mM NaCl (pH 5.0) with continuous stirring. After the baseline was
stabilized, 100 l of purified proteins (total of 100 g) was injected
into the cuvette, and the fluorescence signal was monitored in real
time. Crossed polarizers on excitation and emission beams and a
395-nm-long path filter were used to reduce the background
scatter.
Time-lapse Intensity Measurements of NBD Emission—The
EsxA proteins carrying a cysteine mutation at the indicated
positions were labeled with NBD (Invitrogen) as described pre-
viously (27, 28). The NBD-labeled proteins (10 M) were incu-
bated with the liposomes for 30 min, and the protein/liposome
mixtures were transferred to a cuvette with a stirring bar in the
ISS K2 fluorometer. NBD was excited at 488 nm, and emission
was recorded at 544 nm. Crossed polarizers on excitation and
emission beams and a 520-nm-long filter were used to reduce
the background scatter. After the addition of 0.1 volume of 1 M
sodium acetate (pH 5.0) to the cuvette, the shift in the NBD
label from a polar (solution) to a nonpolar (liposomal mem-
brane) environment was monitored.
Intrinsic Tryptophan Fluorescence—The purified EsxA pro-
teins (WT, N, C, and NC; 10 M) were incubated in
either a neutral pH buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl and 100 mM NaCl
(pH 7.0)) or an acidic buffer (20 mM sodium acetate and 100 mM
NaCl (pH 5.0)) for 30 min. The intrinsic tryptophan fluores-
cence was measured in the ISS K2 fluorometer with excitation
at 295 nm and emission at 310–450 nm. A 305-nm-long path
filter was applied in the emission channel to reduce the back-
ground scatter. The emission spectra of the proteins were cali-
brated with the emission spectra of the same pH buffers with-
out proteins using VINCI software.
8-Anilino-1-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) Fluorescence—The
purified EsxA proteins (WT, N, C, and NC; 5 M) were
incubated with 100 M ANS in either pH 7.0 or 5.0 buffer for 30
min in the dark. The ANS emission spectra of the samples were
measured in the ISS K2 fluorometer with excitation at 380 nm
and emission at 400–600 nm. A 395-nm-long path filter was
placed in the emission path to reduce the background scatter.
The emission spectra of the samples were calibrated with the
same pH buffers without proteins using VINCI software.
Circular Dichroism—The purified EsxA proteins (WT, N,
C, and NC; 0.3 mg/ml) were incubated in 10 mM sodium
phosphate buffer at either pH 7.0 or 5.0. The CD spectra were
acquired from 190 to 300 nm at room temperature using a Jasco

RESULTS
Expression and Purification of the Truncated EsxA Proteins
with Deletions of the N- and/or C-terminal Flexible Arm—In
the reported solution structure of the EsxA/EsxB heterodimer,
EsxA is featured as a major helix-loop-helix motif with two
flexible arms at both the N and C termini (Fig. 1A) (23). To
investigate the role of the N- and C-terminal arms in membrane
disruption, we generated truncated EsxA proteins with dele-
tions of the N- and/or C-terminal flexible arm: N, C, and
NC (Fig. 1B). The deletions were generated based on the
available structural information from both the solution struc-
ture and crystal structure of the EsxA/EsxB heterodimer (23,
31). C was expressed from the pET22b vector in Escherichia
coli and purified using a similar protocol to that described pre-
viously for purification of WT EsxA (26). Interestingly, how-
ever, N and NC were not expressed from the pET22b vec-
tor even if the ATG start codon was present. Thus, we
expressed both N and NC as N-terminal GST fusion pro-
teins. GST-N and GST-NC were purified as described
previously for purification of GST-EsxB (26), followed by
thrombin cleavage and affinity chromatography on a nickel-
Sepharose column. Finally, N, C, and NC were further
clarified on a size exclusion column. The purified WT EsxA and
truncated mutant proteins were examined by SDS-PAGE, and
all of the purified proteins were shown to be pure and stable
proteins (Fig. 1C).
Both the N- and C-terminal Flexible Arms Are Required for
Membrane Disruption—To test the effects of N- or C-terminal
deletions on EsxA membrane disruption, we applied the puri-
fied proteins to the ANTS/DPX fluorescence dequenching
assay to measure liposome leakage. ANTS/DPX, the anion/cat-
ion fluorophore/quencher pair, is widely used for membrane
leakage. ANTS fluorescence is quenched by DPX inside the
liposomes, and it is dequenched upon release into the medium.
We successfully used this assay previously to measure pH-de-
pendent EsxA membrane disruption (26). Consistent with the
previous results, at pH 7.0, WT EsxA and the truncated pro-
teins were inactive in membrane disruption (data not shown).
At pH 5.0, relative to WT EsxA, both N and C exhibited an
40% reduction in membrane disruption, and NC exhib-
ited a significant 80% reduction (Fig. 2, A and B). These data
strongly suggest that both the N- and C-terminal flexible arms
are required for membrane disruption at low pH.
Deletion of Either the N- or C-terminal Flexible Arm Reduces
Solvent-exposed Hydrophobicity at Low pH—The extrinsic
fluorescence dye ANS is weakly fluorescent in an aqueous envi-
ronment but becomes highly fluorescent when it binds to
hydrophobic sites of proteins (32). In our previous report, we
successfully used ANS to measure the solvent-exposed
hydrophobicity of EsxA proteins upon acidification (26).
Here, we used ANS to measure the solvent-exposed hydro-
phobicity of WT EsxA and its truncated mutants at either pH
7.0 or 5.0 (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistent with the previous
results, at pH 5.0, WT EsxA demonstrated an increase in
ANS fluorescence that was significantly higher than that at
pH 7.0, suggesting that, upon acidification, WT EsxA under-
goes a significant conformational change that results in
increased solvent-exposed hydrophobicity. Upon acidifica-
tion, the truncated proteins also showed an increase in ANS
fluorescence to various degrees. Relative to WT EsxA, how-
ever, the ANS fluorescence intensity of N, C, and NC
exhibited reductions of 50, 22, and 75%, respectively.
This result is consistent with the result obtained in the
ANTS dequenching assay, suggesting that both the N- and
C-terminal
flexible
arms
are
required
for
membrane
disruption.
Upon Acidification, EsxA Converts into a Structure with
Increased -Helical Content—To rule out the possibility that
deletions of the N and/or C terminus may cause protein unfold-
ing, we analyzed the CD spectra of WT EsxA and the truncated
proteins at both pH 7.0 and 5.0 (Fig. 4). In the reported solution
structure and crystal structure of the EsxA/EsxB heterodimer,
residues 11–43 and 49–85 of EsxA form two stable helices (23,
31), and a previous CD analysis showed that EsxA has a high
helical content (24). Consistent with these studies, the CD spec-
trum of WT EsxA indicated a typical -helical protein. As
expected, the CD spectra of N, C, and NC also showed
typical -helical proteins at pH 7.0, suggesting that all of the
truncated proteins are folded. Interestingly, WT EsxA, N, and
NC became even more helical at pH 5.0. Quantification of
the secondary structure content showed that WT EsxA had an
increase in -helical content from 81 to 94% and that both N

and NC had an increase from 68 to 94% (Table 1). The data
suggest that, upon acidification, EsxA converts into a more
folded and organized molecule by adopting more -helical
structure.
Intrinsic Tryptophan Emission Spectra of WT EsxA and the
Truncated Proteins Are Blue-shifted at Low pH—To further inves-
tigate the acidification-dependent conformational changes in WT
EsxA,N,C,andNC,wemeasuredtheintrinsicTrpfluores-
cence of these proteins at either pH 7.0 or 5.0 (Fig. 5). The Trp
emissionspectrumishighlysensitivetosolventpolarity.Theemis-
sion of Trp may be blue-shifted (shorter wavelength) if the residue
is buried within a native protein, and its emission may be red-
shifted (longer wavelength) when the protein is unfolded (33).
Consistent with our previous report (26), the Trp fluorescence
spectrumofWTEsxAwasblue-shifteduponacidification.Similar
to WT EsxA, all of the truncated EsxA mutants exhibited a blue
shiftintheirTrpfluorescencespectra.Thisresultisinlinewiththe
CD data, and together, they strongly suggest that, upon acidifica-
tion, EsxA undergoes a significant conformational change and
converts into a more folded structure with increased -helical
content.
Upon Acidification, Both Helices 1 and 2 Insert into Lipo-
somal Membranes—Although both the N- and C-terminal flex-
ible arms are required for membrane disruption, it is not clear
which part(s) of the molecule inserts into the membranes. To
directly determine the membrane insertion domains(s) of
EsxA, we performed the liposome-based NBD fluorescence
assay. NBD is an environmentally sensitive dye that emits a
strong fluorescence at 544 nm upon a shift from a polar to a
nonpolar environment. Previously, we used NBD to monitor
insertion of anthrax toxin into liposomal membranes (27, 28).
In this study, we replaced 15 residues in EsxA with cysteine, one
at a time, using site-directed mutagenesis. The cysteine muta-
tions were randomly and widely distributed in the esxA gene.
However, six EsxA cysteine mutants failed in expression, puri-
fication, or NBD labeling, presumably because these positions
are critical to EsxA structure (Table 2). To test if the remaining
nine NBD-labeled proteins were functional in membrane dis-
ruption, we applied them to the ANTS/DPX assay. The results
showed that all of the NBD-labeled proteins disrupted lipo-
somal membranes to a similar level as the non-NBD-labeled
WT EsxA protein (data not shown). Thus, they were eligible for
FIGURE 2. Both the N- and C-terminal arms of EsxA protein are required
for membrane disruption. Liposomes containing the dye/quencher pair
ANTS/DPX were diluted into either pH 5.0 or 7.0 buffer with continuous stir-
ring. Once the fluorescence baseline was stabilized, the purified EsxA protein
(WT, N, C, or NC) was injected into the solution (final concentration of
10 M). The dequenching of ANTS fluorescence due to leakage of the mem-
brane vesicles was recorded with emission at 520 nm and excitation at 380
nm. Only the representative recordings of ANTS dequenching at pH 5 are
shown in A. The fluorescence intensity at 200 s post-injection was quantified
from three independent measurements and is shown in B.
FIGURE 3. Both N- and C-terminal deletions exhibit reduced ANS fluores-
cence. The EsxA protein (WT, N, C, or NC; 5 M) was incubated with 100
M ANS in either pH 7.0 or 5.0 buffer for 30 min. The samples were excited at
380 nm, and the emission fluorescence intensity of ANS was recorded at 400–
600 nm. The emission spectra of the samples were calibrated with the same
buffers without proteins. The representative results are shown in A. The peak
emission intensity at 468 nm was quantified from at least three independent
measurements (B).

the NBD fluorescence assay. Of the nine NBD-labeled EsxA
proteins, three (S35C, G45C, and A60C) showed rapid strong
NBD emissions at low pH in the presence of liposomes but not
in their absence (Fig. 6A). This clearly demonstrated that the
NBD label at these positions inserted into the liposomal mem-
branes and had direct contact with the lipid molecules. Ser-35,
Ala-60, and Gly-45 are located in Helix 1, Helix 2, and the turn
region between Helices 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 7, A and B).
Combined with the available structural data (see “Discussion”
for more details), the NBD data confirm that both Helices 1 and
2 insert into the membranes and form a membrane-spanning
pore (Fig. 7B).
DISCUSSION
EsxA was first discovered as a potent T-cell antigen (17, 18)
and has recently been identified as an important virulence fac-
tor in tuberculosis infection (12, 14, 24, 34). An understanding
of the molecular mechanism of EsxA-mediated virulence is of
great significance in the development of novel therapeutics
against tuberculosis. Our previous study showed that EsxA
undergoes
a
pH-dependent
conformational
change
and
induces leakage of membrane vesicles, suggesting that EsxA
contributes to the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis through
acidification-triggered disruption of host membranes (26).
However, the molecular details of how EsxA inserts into the
membrane and forms a membrane-spanning pore remain
unclear.
The solution structure of the EsxA/EsxB heterodimer shows
that EsxA contains N- and C-terminal flexible arms and a cen-
tral helix-turn-helix motif (Fig. 1A) (23). We measured the
length of Helices 1 and 2 at 50 Å, which is equivalent to the
depth of a typical lipid bilayer. Therefore, it is reasonable to
believe that both Helices 1 and 2 insert into the membrane and
form a membrane-spanning pore, whereas the N- and C-termi-
nal arms play a role in anchoring and supporting this interac-
tion on the membrane surface (Fig. 7B). In this study, we have
provided evidence that supports this model of EsxA membrane
insertion.
Using nine functional and NBD-labeled EsxA cysteine mu-
tants, we obtained essential evidence that supports the pro-
posed model of EsxA membrane insertion. Ser-35 and Ala-60
are located in Helices 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 7, A and B).
When NBD was used to label S35C or A60C, it showed a rapid,
strong, and liposome-dependent emission (Fig. 6), demonstrat-
ing that both Ser-35 and Ala-60 are lipid-facing residues. Inter-
estingly, although Gln-34 and Thr-37 are adjacent to Ser-35,
the NBD label in Q34C or T37C did not emit fluorescence (Fig.
6), suggesting that Gln-34 and Thr-37 are not lipid-facing res-
idues. This result is in line with the fact that in the solution
structure of EsxA, Gln-34 and Thr-37 are located on different
helical faces from Ser-35 (Fig. 7B). Similarly, relative to Ala-60,
FIGURE 4. CD spectra of WT EsxA and the truncated proteins at pH 7.0 and 5.0. The purified EsxA proteins (WT (A), N (B), C (C), and NC (D); 0.3 mg/ml)
were incubated in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer at either pH 7.0 or 5.0. The CD spectra were acquired from 190 to 300 nm at room temperature using the
Jasco J-810 CD spectropolarimeter. The CD spectra were obtained from integration of three consecutive measurements.

Val-54 is negative in NBD fluorescence and is located in a dif-
ferent face of Helix 2 (Fig. 7B). More interestingly, NBD emis-
sion in G45C was moderate, 2–3-fold lower compared with
S35C and A60C, suggesting that Gly-45 is partially embedded
in the membrane. This result is consistent with the predicted
position of Gly-45 after membrane insertion, which is at the
edge of the membranes (Fig. 7B).
It is worth mentioning that Ser-35 is located in the contact
interface between EsxA and EsxB in the heterodimer structure
(23, 35). Thus, these data provide indirect evidence supporting
the notion that, upon acidification, EsxB is dissociated from
EsxA, allowing EsxA to insert into the membranes (25). How-
ever, current data from the literature are conflicting as to
whether or not the EsxA/EsxB heterodimer dissociates at acidic
pH. Using the native proteins extracted from the culture filtrate
of M. tuberculosis, de Jonge et al. (25) showed that EsxA and
EsxB dissociated at low pH. In our previous study, however, the
recombinant heterodimer was inactive in membrane disrup-
tion and showed no aggregation at acidic pH, suggesting that
EsxA and EsxB did not dissociate at low pH (26). Consistent
with our results, the CD study by Lightbody et al. (35) showed
that the complex formed by EsxA and EsxB (proteins purified
from E. coli) was too stable to dissociate at low pH. One possible
explanation for this discrepancy could be that the mycobacte-
rium-produced proteins possess unique properties that are not
present in the E. coli-produced proteins, allowing EsxA and
EsxB to dissociate at low pH. These properties might include
post-translational modifications, such as N--acetylation of
Thr-2 in EsxA. It has been shown that acetylated and non-
acetylated EsxA differentially bind to EsxB (36). Moreover, a
recent study showed that homeostasis of N--acetylation of
EsxA correlates with virulence of Mycobacterium marinum
(37). Although N--acetylation of Thr-2 in EsxA might play a
role in dissociation of EsxA and EsxB at low pH, other post-
translational modifications and other bacterial and/or cellular
factors may be involved in this process.
A striking feature of EsxA structure is the flexible N- and
C-terminal arms, in which a number of hydrophobic and aro-
matic residues play no structural role (23). The data showing
FIGURE 5. Trp fluorescence spectra of WT EsxA and the truncated proteins show a blue shift at pH 5.0. The purified EsxA proteins (WT (A), N (B), C (C),

that N, C, and NC were defective in membrane disrup-
tion (Fig. 2) demonstrated that both the N- and C-terminal
flexible arms were required for EsxA to disrupt the membranes.
Because the NBD label in Q4C, G10C, or G88C did not emit
liposome-dependent fluorescence (Fig. 6), the N- and C-termi-
nal arms are not likely to insert into the membranes. However,
we do not exclude the possibility that parts of the N- or C-ter-
minal arm have transient dynamic contacts with the lipid mem-
branes to anchor the molecule on the membranes and/or sup-
port insertion of Helices 1 and 2 into the membranes. Current
data from our laboratory and others suggest that EsxA forms a
pore on the membranes (26, 38). Because the EsxA monomer
has a limited molecular size, one can image that EsxA must
assemble into an oligomeric complex to form a membrane-
spanning pore on the membranes. In this scenario, both the N-
and C-terminal arms might play an essential role in intermo-
lecular interactions within the oligomeric pore complex.
One interesting finding in this study is that unlike many
other pore-forming proteins, which usually become unfolded
(at least in part) upon acidification, EsxA became more folded
with increased -helical content. This finding was evidenced by
CD analysis (Fig. 3 and Table 1) and Trp fluorescence (Fig. 4).
Upon acidification, the -helical content of EsxA increased
from 81% (pH 7.0) to 94% (pH 5.0). The increase in -helical
content was dependent on the presence of the C-terminal arm
because C did not show any increase in -helical content. By
calculation, a 13% increase in -helical content represents
12–13 amino acids adopting -helical structure. Coinci-
dently, a recent study suggested that EsxA and other WXG100
proteins have a C-terminal conserved residue pattern (residues
83–95 in EsxA, MASTEGNVTGMFA) (31). The underlined
residues are spaced about three residues apart and correspond
to a turn of the -helix, placing them all on the same face of the
helix. Our data are consistent with this prediction and suggest
that although these residues are shown as a disordered arm in
the solution structure of EsxA at pH 7.0, they may adopt -hel-
ical structure upon acidification.
It is also worth mentioning that compared with WT EsxA,
both N and NC showed a decrease in -helical content
from 81 to 68% at pH 7.0 (Table 1). This may be explained by
fact that the N-terminal deletion caused partial unfolding of the
adjacent helical structure. This may also explain why N and
NC were not expressed in the pET22b vector. Thus, the
N-terminal flexible arm appears to have effects on the stability
of the EsxA molecule. However, at pH 5.0, the -helical content
FIGURE 6. The NBD label at Ser-35, Gly-45, and Ala-60 of EsxA proteins
exhibits a rapid, strong, and membrane-dependent fluorescence emis-
sion. The EsxA proteins were labeled with NBD at the indicated positions and
incubated with or without liposomes (Lip) in pH 7.0 buffer for 30 min. Subse-
quently, the pH was rapidly lowered by adding 0.1 volume of 1 M sodium
acetate (pH 4). The solution was continuously stirred in the cuvette. NBD
fluorescence emission was recorded as a function of time (excitation at 488
nm and emission at 544 nm). The representative NBD fluorescence curves of
S35C, G45G, and A60C are shown in A. The NBD emission at 20 s post-acidifi-
cation was calculated from three independent measurements and then nor-
malized to that of G45C (set as 1). The relative NBD emission at the indicated
positions is shown in B.

of both N and NC increased up to 94%, suggesting that
the majority of the molecules adopted -helical structure.
In summary, this study provides, for the first time, direct
evidence that, at low pH, EsxA converts into a membrane pro-
tein, with the central helix-turn-helix motif inserting into the
membrane and forming a membrane-spanning pore. We have
also shown that both the N- and C-terminal flexible arms are
required for EsxA membrane disruption. Upon acidification,
EsxA converts into a more organized helical structure, with the
C-terminal flexible arm adopting -helical structure. This
study has provided a foundation for in-depth characterizations
of the EsxA pore on membranes in the future. An understand-
ing of the mechanism of EsxA pore formation and the structure
of the EsxA pore will facilitate development of novel therapeu-
tics against tuberculosis. Moreover, EsxA is the prototype of the
WXG protein family, which includes hundreds of bacterial pro-
teins without known structure and function (31). The knowl-
edge obtained from EsxA can be applied to the study of other
WXG proteins.
