Abstract
Changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) level are implicated in the pathophysiology
of cognitive decline in depression and neurodegenerative disorders in older adults. We aimed to
evaluate the longitudinal association over two years between BDNF and persistent cognitive
decline in individuals with remitted late-life depression and Mild Cognitive Impairment (LLD
+MCI) compared to either individuals with remitted LLD and no cognitive decline (LLD+NCD)
or never-depressed, cognitively normal, elderly control participants. We additionally evaluated the
effect of double-blind, placebo-controlled donepezil treatment on BDNF levels in all of the
remitted LLD participants (across the levels of cognitive function). We included 160 elderly
participants in this study (72 LLD+NCD, 55 LLD+MCI and 33 never-depressed cognitively
normal elderly participants). At the same visits, cognitive assessments were conducted and blood
sampling to determine serum BDNF levels were collected at baseline assessment and after one and
two years of follow-up. We utilized repeated measure, mixed effect models to assess: (1) the
effects of diagnosis (LLD+MCI, LLD+NCD, and controls), time, and their interaction on BDNF
levels; and (2) the effects of donepezil treatment (donepezil vs. placebo), time, baseline diagnosis
(LLD+MCI vs. LLD+NCD), and interactions between these contrasts on BDNF levels. We found
a significant effect of time on BDNF level (p=0.02) and a significant decline in BDNF levels over
2 years of follow-up in participants with LLD+MCI (p=0.004) and controls (p=0.04). We found
no effect of donepezil treatment on BDNF level. The present results suggest that aging is an
important factor related to decline in BDNF level.

Introduction
Late-life depression (LLD) is a common psychiatric disorder in older adults. It is associated
with significant functional and cognitive impairment and is an important risk factor for
dementia, in particular Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Vascular Dementia (VaD) (Diniz et
al., 2013). Persistent cognitive impairment is common even after successful antidepressant
treatment and may be a marker of risk for progression to dementia (Bhalla et al., 2009; Lee
et al., 2007). In a recent double-blind randomized clinical trial, our group evaluated whether
long-term donepezil treatment was associated with cognitive improvement in patients with
LLD (Reynolds et al., 2011). We found that patients with remitted LLD and MCI who were
treated with donepezil showed significant improvement on memory performance and
reduced risk of Dementia/AD over two years compared with patients on placebo. Similar
findings have been reported by others, suggesting that donepezil treatment can have a
protective effect against cognitive impairment and progression to dementia in LLD (Lu et
al., 2009).
The pathophysiologic mechanisms of cognitive impairment in LLD are not clear, but may
involve cerebrovascular burden, dysfunction of the Hypothalamus-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA)
axis, inflammatory status, and decreased neurotrophic support (Butters et al., 2008; Caraci et
Diniz et al.

al., 2010). BDNF is the most abundant neurotrophic factor in the brain. It is involved in
several functions including the maintenance of neuronal homeostasis, synapse development
and strengthening via glutamate activity-dependent pathways, cell proliferation, memory
consolidation and resilience against insults (Tapia-Aranciba et al., 2008). BDNF is also
found in the periphery (e.g. serum and platelets) and can be assessed in relation to
psychiatric disorders and brain function (Teixeira et al., 2010). Serum BDNF levels can be
modulated by antidepressant pharmacotherapies (Sen et al., 2008). Treatment with
cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil), which are approved for the treatment of AD, can
also modulate peripheral BDNF levels. In a preliminary, open study, including a small
sample of 19 subjects diagnosed with AD and treated with 10 mg of Donepezil over 15
months, Leyhe & colleagues (2009) showed a significant increase in serum BDNF levels
after donepezil treatment. The results suggest increasing increments in BDNF levels as a
possible mechanism of action of donepezil (Leyhe et al., 2008).
Changes in the BDNF system has been associated with LLD. The presence of the Met allele
in position 66 of the BDNF gene confers an increased risk of LLD, and is associated with
greater whiter matter hyperintensity lesion burden in these individuals (Taylor et al., 2008;
Pei et al., 2012). Reduced BDNF levels may be a putative mechanism of cognitive decline in
LLD, as a similar pattern of changes in BDNF levels is observed among LLD, MCI and AD
patients (Diniz et al., 2010; Diniz et al., 2011). In addition, there is evidence that BDNF is
negatively correlated with age-related reduction in hippocampal volume (Erickson et al.,
2010). Nonetheless, the cross-sectional design of these studies limits the ability to interpret
the effect of LLD, cognitive impairment, and aging on BDNF levels. To date no study has
evaluated whether persistent cognitive impairment in individuals with remitted LLD is
associated with lower BDNF levels, or whether BDNF continues to decline over time. A
better understanding of the relationship between changes in BDNF and cognitive function in
LLD is important to develop more specific treatments for these associated conditions.
We aimed therefore to evaluate the association between BDNF and persistent cognitive
decline in participants with remitted LLD (LLD+MCI) compared to either participants with
remitted LLD and no cognitive decline (LLD+NCD) and to healthy control subjects over
two years of follow-up. We further evaluated the impact of long-term donepezil treatment
on BDNF levels in these patients. We hypothesized that BDNF would be reduced in subjects
with LLD+MCI and would decline faster in these subjects compared to LLD+NCD and to
healthy controls. Additionally, we hypothesized, based on prior preliminary data (Leyhe et
al., 2008), that long-term donepezil treatment would significantly increase BDNF levels in
everyone.
Methods
This study is based upon a previously published double-blind, randomized, placebo-
controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of donepezil on cognitive performance,
instrumental activities of daily living and prevention of depressive episode recurrence in
patients with recently remitted LLD. Patients’ recruitment, methodology, and primary
outcomes of this clinical trial have been reported by Reynolds et al. (2011).
In brief, a total of 299 older adults were initially screened for this study. Two hundred
twenty qualified for participation and provided consent, 158 responded to open
antidepressant pharmacotherapy and completed assessment for the randomized controlled
trial, and of these, 130 eligible participants agreed to randomization to receive donepezil or
placebo in addition to continuing two years of maintenance antidepressant medication after
remission of the index depressive episode. Following antidepressant response during the
first phase, participants had baseline neuropsychological and cognitive instrumental

activities of daily living (C-IADL) assessment (baseline assessment) and independent
ascertainment of cognitive status (normal, MCI, dementia) by the University of Pittsburgh
Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (ADRC).
At baseline, 73 of 130 LLD participants who had responded to antidepressant treatment
were cognitively normal and 57 were found to have MCI. The participants were then
randomized to receive placebo or donepezil treatment and had repeated neuropsychological
and C-IADL assessment 12 and 24 months later. Donepezil / placebo treatment was
provided throughout the 24 month duration of the trial. Of note, the randomization process
was stratified by cognitive status (No Cognitive Disorder vs. Mild Cognitive Impairment);
thus, the placebo and donepezil treatment arms were balanced in the proportion of
participants with and without cognitive impairment at baseline.
In order to provide a benchmark to assess change over time in depressed participants, 36
older adults with no evidence of lifetime cognitive or psychiatric disorders were included in
a control group. They had the same clinical and neuropsychological and C-IADL
evaluations as participants with depression in the clinical trial at 12 and 24 month follow-up.
Blood sampling and BDNF analysis
Blood samples from depressed and control subjects were drawn in the morning at baseline
(and prior to randomization in the case of LLD participants), 12 and 24 month assessments.
Serum was separated by centrifugation and serum aliquots were frozen and stored at −80°C
until anal ysis. Serum BDNF levels were measured using a high-sensitivity quantitative
enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). All samples were
measured in duplicate and the average intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation
were 6.2% and 11.3%, respectively.
Statistical analysis
We followed the intention-to-treat principle for all analyses. Thus, all randomized LLD
participants and control subjects were considered in the analyses if they had at least one
BDNF measurement available and were analyzed according to the intervention group that
the subjects were assigned at the time of randomization (e.g. maintenance phase of the trial
(in the case of LLD participants). Therefore, the analysis focused on data from the 160
participants who had a BDNF measurement (72 LLD+NCD, 55 LLD+MCI and 33 controls).
There were no differences in socio-demographic and clinical variables between participants
with and without baseline BDNF levels (data not shown). For all analyses, we utilized a
repeated measure, mixed model analysis with an unstructured covariance structure (Laird
and Ware, 1982). The mixed model analysis allows for missing data and the modeling uses
all available data for the estimates. Linear contrasts were used to examine patterns of change
over time.
In the first set of analyses, we evaluated the association between persistent cognitive
impairment and changes in BDNF level over two years of follow-up. We tested the main
effect of baseline diagnosis (LLD+MCI, LLD+NCD, controls) and time (baseline, 12
months and 24 months of follow-up), and diagnosis X time interaction on BDNF levels. We
carried out an additional exploratory analysis to evaluate the pattern of change on BDNF
levels on the subjects whose cognitive diagnosis did not change during course of follow-up.
In the second set of analyses, we evaluated the effect of long-term donepezil treatment on
BDNF in participants with remitted LDD. We tested the main effect of treatment (donepezil
vs. placebo), time (baseline, 12 months and 24 months of follow-up), and cognitive status at
baseline (LLD+MCI, LLD+NCD), and all interactions between these contrasts. For this

analysis, we included only the LLD participants (LLD+NCD, 72 subjects; LLD+MCI, 55
subjects).
We used the SPSS v. 14 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and SAS version 9.3 statistical
software (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) for all analysis. Statistical significance
was set at α < 0.05.
Results
Table 1 shows baseline (that is, following remission of depression, at the point of
randomization to donepezil or placebo) socio-demographic, depressive symptoms and
cognitive performance according to diagnostic groups. As expected, participants with LLD
+MCI had significantly worse scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and
the Dementia Rating Scale (DRS) with less years of education than both LLD +NCD and
controls. Both LLD groups had higher depressive scores than the control subjects at time of
baseline BDNF measurement with LLD+MCI having highest scores. LLD+NCD were
younger than the LLD+MCI and controls.
Baseline BDNF levels did not differ among diagnostic groups both looking at unadjusted
and adjusted models controlling for baseline age and HDRS scores given that participants
differed in age and HDRS scores at baseline (F(2,148)=1.97, p=0.14, and F(2,146)=1.64,
p=0.20 respectively). Repeated measure, mixed model analyses were run using baseline age
and HDRS scores as covariates (Table 2, model 1). Neither age nor HDRS scores were
significant covariates. We found a main effect for time on BDNF level; but no significant
effect of diagnosis, or interaction between diagnosis and time. Figure 1A shows the BDNF
level over time for each of the 3 groups.
As the diagnosis of MCI may change over a short period of time, with some participants
resuming normal cognitive performance, while others with no evidence of cognitive
impairment showing cognitive decline (Diniz et al., 2009), we focused the analysis only on
participants who retained the same diagnosis at all observable time points.. These analyses
showed that mean BDNF levels decreased in LLD+MCI participants between baseline and
24 months of follow-up (estimated difference = −6.04(se=2.06), t(114)=2.93, p=0.004), and
in healthy controls (estimated difference=3.77 (se=1.82), t(114)=2.07, p=0.04). We did not
find a significant change in mean BDNF level in LLD+NCD between baseline and 24
months of follow-up (estimated difference = 0.15 (se=1.25), t(114)=−0.12, p=0.90).
Interaction between diagnosis and time was not significant F(4,114)=1.99, p=0.10.(Figure
1B). We did additional analyses in the whole sample examining whether an individual's
trajectory of BDNF change correlated with his/her trajectory of cognitive change. We did
not find a significant correlation between individual changes in BDNF and cognitive
changes over one year (rho=0.07, p=0.48, n=100) nor over two years of follow-up
(rho=0.13, p=0.24, n=89).
Effect of donepezil treatment on BDNF level in remitted LLD participants
In the parent study, participants with remitted LLD participated in a double-blind placebo
controlled clinical trial to evaluate whether donepezil treatment improves cognitive
performance and reduces progression to dementia. Mixed model analysis for repeated
measures tested for the main effects of donepezil treatment (donepezil vs. placebo), time,
baseline diagnosis (LLD+MCI vs. LLD+NCD), and the interactions between these terms on
BDNF levels. We also included baseline age and HDRS scores as covariates in this analysis.
Neither age nor HDRS scores were significant covariates. There were no significant main
effects of treatment, time, baseline diagnosis or interactions on BDNF levels (Table 2,
model 2).

Discussion
This is the first study to describe longitudinal changes in serum BDNF levels in both older
adults with LLD and healthy control subjects. We found that BDNF levels significantly
decline over 2 years of follow-up in the whole sample. Exploratory analyses showed that the
decline in BDNF levels was largely driven by participants with LLD+MCI and controls. On
the other hand, we did not find a significant effect on BDNF levels after long-term donepezil
treatment. Overall, the present findings suggest that aging is an important factor related to
the decline of BDNF levels.
Cross-sectional studies suggest that BDNF levels are negatively correlated with age-related
hippocampal volume changes and cognitive impairment (Erickson et al., 2010; Lee et al.,
2007). Previous studies have consistently shown a significant reduction of BDNF levels in
subjects with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and amnestic mild
cognitive impairment (Forlenza et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2009). Recent studies suggest that the
molecular changes associated with depression may lead to accelerated brain aging and
changes in the expression of the BDNF gene might play an important role in this process
(McKinney and Sibille, 2013). In a recent post-mortem study, Douillard-Guilloux et al.
(2013) found that the expression of BDNF mRNA was negatively correlated with age;
moreover, the mean reduction was significantly higher in participants with history of major
depression. In addition, lower BDNF expression is found in the brain of subjects with
Alzheimer’s disease, in particular in areas with high Tau protein levels (Murer et al., 1999).
BDNF significantly declined over time in healthy controls and did so with higher intensity
in participants with LLD+MCI. Such declines may suggest that changes in the neurotrophic
system are related to the aging process, but may be accelerated or intensified in subjects
with LLD and persistent cognitive impairment, possibly indicating the emergence of
neurodegenerative changes in the latter group.
In addition, we evaluated the effect of long-term donepezil treatment on BDNF levels in
participants with LLD. Contrary to our hypothesis, we observed no long-term donepezil
treatment effect on serum BDNF levels. In the primary analysis of this clinical trial, patients
with LLD and comorbid MCI showed a significant improvement on memory performance
over two years (Reynolds et al., 2011). In the light of the present results, we hypothesize that
memory improvement after donepezil treatment is not due to changes in BDNF.
Nonetheless, donepezil can modulate BDNF-related cascades by mechanisms other than by
directly increasing serum BDNF levels. For example, donepezil can rapidly induce the
phosphorylation of the neurotrophin receptors TrkA and TrkB and increase the
phosphorylation of transcription factor CREB in mature mouse hippocampal neurons; these
effects are independent of the increased synthesis and release of BDNF (Autio et al., 2011).
The activation of TrkB and CREB, by phosphorylation, acts as the main down-stream
effector of BDNF functions in neurons. Therefore, donepezil treatment can significantly
modulate BDNF-related cascades without directly affecting BDNF protein synthesis and
release. On the other hand, the present results are consistent with the evidence that donepezil
and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors mainly have effects on symptomatic, cognitive, and
behavioral expression of dementia (both vascular and AD) and MCI (Doody et al., 2001;
Erkinjuntti et al., 2002; Petersen et al., 2005).
The pathophysiology of cognitive impairment may involve changes in several biologic
cascades other than BDNF and changes in individual cascades may have small overall
effects on cognitive impairment in LLD (Butters et al., 2008; Caraci et al., 2010). Thus, the
positive effect of donepezil on memory and global cognitive performance reported in the
primary analysis of this clinical trial (Reynolds et al., 2011) may be secondary to the effects
Diniz et al.

of this drug on biologic cascades other than BDNF. Additional studies are needed to
disentangle the biologic mechanisms by which donepezil improves cognitive performance in
patients with LLD and cognitive impairment.
The present study has several limitations. The original trial was not designed to evaluate the
effects of donepezil on serum BDNF levels, and thus the present findings should be
considered more exploratory or hypothesis-generating than confirmatory or hypothesis-
testing. We also observed a high dropout rate in the LLD+MCI group that might have
influenced the present results. Furthermore, given the large number of tests, there is a high
chance of false positive findings. In addition, we did not evaluate BDNF levels prior to
antidepressant treatment. Thus, we cannot reliably state that individuals with LLD and
cognitive impairment after depressive episode remission had lower BDNF levels compared
to patients with LLD and no cognitive impairment. Finally, some studies have failed to show
a significant correlation between BDNF levels in the CNS and in the periphery in older
individuals (Laske et al., 2007). Hence, we need to be cautious about interpreting the extent
to which changes in serum BDNF may reflect changes in brain levels of BDNF.
Nonetheless, the positive correlations observed between serum BDNF levels and both
cognitive and depressive symptoms in the elderly are in line with other research using
BDNF serum as a marker of brain integrity (Erickson et al., 2010). The large sample size,
the longitudinal measures of BDNF levels, and the inclusion of healthy controls in the
analysis are major strengths of the present study.
In conclusion, serum BDNF levels significantly decline over time in healthy controls and in
participants with LLD and persistent cognitive impairment, though the intensity of decline in
greater in the latter group. Additionally, we did not find a significant effect of long term
donepezil treatment on serum BDNF concentration, suggesting that the benefit of donepezil
on memory and cognitive performance is not secondary to the modulation of BDNF in these
individuals. Further studies are necessary to disentangle the biologic mechanisms by which
donepezil improves cognitive performance in patients with LLD, with the aim of
discovering new biologic targets for the treatment of cognitive impairment in individuals
with LLD.
