ABSTRACT 
 
We simultaneously collected 85 pairs of 24-h PM1.0 and PM2.5 samples from a new urban area 
in Hanoi, Vietnam, and analyzed their chemical compositions with particle-induced X-ray emission 
(PIXE) and ion chromatography (IC) to obtain input data for source apportionment via positive 
matrix factorization (PMF). Sulfate, ammonium, and black carbon (BC) composed the majority of 
the mass in both size fractions, and the PMF models clearly differentiated the contribution of 
long-range transport (LRT) aerosols, which accounted for more than two-thirds of the measured 
PM-bound sulfate and ammonium concentrations, from those of the six in situ sources, viz., 
resuspended road dust, primary vehicular emissions, coal fly ash, biomass burning emissions, 
construction dust, and sea salt. Whereas LRT aerosols, coal fly ash, and primary particulate vehicular 
emissions mainly occurred in the PM1.0, resuspended road dust and biomass-burning fly ash 
tended to appear in the PM1.0-2.5; hence, we can characterize the anthropogenic emissions in this 
area by examining the profile of the PM1.0 rather than the PM2.5. Additionally, air masses with 
inland trajectories originating in northern China and countries northwest and southwest of 
Vietnam contained more ammonium, sulfate, and BC than those that passed over the East Sea. 
Finally, the LRT aerosols exhibited high acidity in the PM1.0 but neutrality in the PM2.5.

1 INTRODUCTION 
 
Ambient fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter smaller than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) is 
among the criteria air pollutants and its mass concentration is regulated with ambient air quality 
standards by many countries. Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 1.0 µm 
(PM1.0) contributes greatly to PM2.5, accounting for 50 to 90% of its mass concentration in the 
urban atmosphere (Lee et al., 2006; Deshmukh et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2018). 
PM1.0 comprises many harmful substances emitted from fuel combustion either as primary 
emissions (such as diesel black carbon [BC] and trace metals) or as secondary aerosols from gaseous 
precursors by nucleation or by condensation on existing particles (Whitby, 1978; Hildemann, 1991; 
Huang et al., 2003). PM1.0 has been regarded as a better indicator for vehicular emissions in 
roadside environments than PM2.5 because it minimizes the interference from natural sources 
(Lundgren et al., 1996; Lee et al., 2006). Exposure to PM1.0 has also been shown to have a more 
significant association with health effects (hospital admission, cardiovascular diseases, and 
mortality rate) than exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 (Lin et al., 2016; Hu et al., 2018; Yin et al., 2020). 
However, studies on the physicochemical characteristics and sources of ambient PM1.0 are fairly 
limited compared to the number of studies on PM2.5 and PM10. 
In this work, we characterize chemical species and sources of PM1.0 in an area of Hanoi under 
rapid urbanization, where the air quality is affected by increasing emissions from traffic, coal

briquette burning for cooking, biomass burning, and construction activities. We compared the 
contents of trace elements and water-soluble ions (WSI) in PM1.0 with those in PM2.5 collected 
simultaneously at the site to identify the differences in chemical compositions between the two 
size fractions. The chemical composition data were then used to characterize the sources 
affecting the site using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) method. Based on the PMF model, 
the differences between PM1.0 and PM2.5 in the compositions and contributions of both local and 
remote sources could be identified. The transport pathways and the contributions to PM1.0 and 
PM2.5 of remote emissions that affect the site through long-range transport of air pollutants were 
identified by backward-trajectory analysis.  
We hope the results of the comparative analysis in this work will shed more light on the 
characteristics of PM1.0 and PM2.5 sources in Hanoi and provide a basis for developing abatement 
and pollution control measures. 
 
2 METHODS 
 
2.1 Sample Collection 
The sampling site was located in a residential area within Hanoi’s Cau Giay district, approximately 
5 km northwest of the city center. This district has a population density of 14,000 persons km–2 
and a road density of 3.33 km km–2 (JICA, 2007). Motorbikes are the dominant form of transportation 
in Hanoi, accounting for 81% of all trips versus 11% and 4% trips by buses and cars, respectively 
(World Bank, 2011). Two bus routes are running within 100 m of the sampling site. Coal-fired 
industrial and power plants are located far to the south, but burning coal briquettes is popular 
for cooking in households and eateries in this area.  
The air sampling instruments were set up in a shelter erected on the rooftop of the three-story 
office of the Institute for Nuclear Science and Technique. Particulate matter was collected with 
0.4 µm pore filters using a dichotomous air sampler (Zambelli Twin Dust; Aquaria Tech s.r.l., Italy). 
The air sampler had two collection channels that can be paired with two different sampling heads 
that work alternately. The U.S.-made sharp-cut cyclone collector SCC-2.229 (BGI, Inc.) and the 
EU-PM2.5 sampling head were used to collect PM1.0 and PM2.5, respectively. The airflow rate was 
automatically adjusted to 16.7 L min–1 based on ambient temperature and barometric pressure 
in the controller’s operating mode. Due to high PM mass loading at the sampling site, the cyclone 
system could not be run continuously for a full 24 h because of filter clogging. Thus, the sampler 
was operated alternating time on and time off (2 h on followed by 2 h off) throughout the 24-h 
period to provide a representative sample during that day. The sampling duration was 23.5 h 
starting from 9:00 a.m. local time to 8.30 a.m. on the following day. The Nuclepore polycarbonate 
filters were pre- and post-weighed to determine the gravimetric mass of the collected materials 
using a Mettler Toledo balance of 1 µg readability placed in a dedicated room with controlled 
temperature (25°C) and relative humidity (40%). The filters were pre- and post-conditioned in 
this controlled environment for 2 days before and after sampling. An electrostatic charge eliminator 
was used to neutralize charges accumulated on the filters before weighing. After being weighed, the 
loaded filters were kept in a refrigerator at 4°C to minimize the evaporation of volatile components 
until further analysis. 
85 pairs of PM1.0 and PM2.5 samples were collected from November 2015 through June 2016, 
encompassing three seasons, i.e., winter (November–February), transitional and spring (March–
April), and early summer (May–June). The sample collection was stopped in June–August because 
it was too hot at the sampling station. Four types of air masses that govern the meteorological 
conditions in northern Vietnam during the sampling period and drive the temporal variations in 
particulate pollution and source impacts at the sampling site are described in Section 3.3. 
 
2.2 Chemical Analysis 
The loaded filters were analyzed for BC, elemental components, and WSI using optical reflectance, 
ion chromatography (IC), and particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) methods, respectively. The 
BC content was measured using a smoke stain reflectometer provided by the International 
Atomic Energy Agency as part of the Asia-Pacific Regional Cooperation Agreement (RCA) for air 
pollution (Hopke et al., 2008). The BC content was operationally defined based on the amount of

reflected light that is absorbed by the filter sample and a mass absorption coefficient recommended 
by RCA to convert the measured reflectance to µg m–3 (Hien et al., 2004; Hopke et al., 2008).  
After BC measurement, the filter was cut into two halves. The first half was analyzed by IC at 
the Institute for Nuclear Science and Technique in Hanoi, and the other half was reserved for 
elemental analysis by the PIXE method using the 3 MeV proton 5SHD2 Pelletron at Hanoi University 
of Natural Sciences. 
A Dionex DX-600 system with chemical suppression and conductivity detection was used for 
the IC analysis. In the IC method, the filters were extracted ultrasonically by deionized water with 
the resistivity of 18 MΩ cm–1 in 20 min and then were filtered to remove insoluble residues. The 
weak base eluent (1.7 mm NaHCO3 + 1.8 mm Na2CO3) with a flow rate of 2.5 mL min–1 and the 
weak acid eluent (22 mm H2SO4) with a flow rate of 2 mL min–1 were used for anion and cation 
detection, respectively. The detection limits were about 5 ng m–3 for SO42–, NH4+, Na+, and Ca2+ 
and 10 ng m–3 for Cl–, NO3–, K+, and Mg2+. For the PIXE analysis, the filter samples were exposed 
to the 3 MeV proton beam of the 5SHD2 Pelletron accelerator and the X-rays emitted were 
detected using an Si(Li) detector. Measurement values were well above the detection limits for 
the species of Fe, Si, S, K, Pb, and Zn that were included in the input data for receptor modeling. 
The detection limits for these elements were 10–20 ng m–3. As and Cr, the good tracers for coal 
burning, were detected in several samples, but in most samples, the measured values were lower 
than the detection limits. Blank Nuclepore filters were analyzed and the measured concentrations 
of species were blank-corrected accordingly. 
 
2.3 Methodology and Input Data 
In this work, the sources of PM1.0 and PM2.5 were derived from the measured concentrations 
of species using the PMF modeling method. PMF was developed by Paatero and Taper (1994) 
and has become the most common tool for source apportionment in studies of ambient air 
particulate matter (Belis et al., 2013; Norris and Brown, 2014). As in other receptor modeling 
methods, the goal of PMF is to derive the source profiles and source contributions from the 
measured concentrations of species by solving the chemical mass balance (CMB) equation:  
 
X(n × m) = G(n × p)∙F(p × m) + E(n × m) 
(1) 
 
where X(n × m) is the concentration matrix of m species in n samples, G(n × p) is the source 
contributions matrix of p sources in n samples, F(p × m) is the source composition matrix of m 
species in p sources, and E(n × m) is the model uncertainties. 
In PMF, the elements of G and F are constrained to be non-negative. For this purpose, the 
influence of each input concentration value is weighted based on its measurement uncertainty 
(Paatero and Taper, 1994; Norris et al., 2009). The factors resolved by the PMF model are interpreted 
as representing sources that impact the sampling site. The PMF results for a different number of 
factors and multiple values of Fpeak were explored to obtain the optimal factor solution. For this 
purpose, a number of criteria were applied, including the comparison between Q(robust) and 
Q(true) and between the measured and PMF modeled species mass, but the key criterion was 
extracting realistic and reasonable source profiles and contributions. 
In this study, the U.S. EPA PMF V5 software (Norris and Brown, 2014) was used to build the 
PMF model. The input data for PM1.0 and PM2.5 consisted of 8 WSI (SO42–, NO3–, Cl–, NH4+, Na+, K+, 
Ca2+, and Mg2+) and 7 elements (BC, Al, Fe, Si, Mg, K, Pb, Si, and Zn). There are no missing values 
in the input array. Sulfur was not included in the input data to avoid double-counting its mass (Belis 
et al., 2014) because S almost perfectly correlates with sulfate (Table 2). PM mass concentration 
was also included as an independent variable to provide estimated source contributions to the 
observed PM masses. However, to avoid the influence of the uncontrolled PM mass errors 
associated with, e.g., sampling loss of nitrate and water bound to aerosols, the PMF model was 
obtained from the base run using input data without PM mass. The experimental uncertainties 
uij were composed of a measurement error and a concentration-dependent component to 
account for the model error associated with, e.g., the variation in source profiles and chemical 
transformations of species in the atmosphere (Norris and Brown, 2014; Belis et al., 2014).  
The factor model with the optimal number of extracted factors and minimum rotational 
ambiguity was chosen among numerous solutions of the PMF base run following recommendations

in Norris and Brown (2014). The physical consistency requirements on the PM1.0-to-PM2.5 ratio 
(Section 3.1.2) and on the ion-versus-element relationships (Section 3.1.3) were also used to help 
obtain the optimal solution of the PMF base run. Finally, the PMF bootstraps were run to estimate 
the stability and uncertainties of the factor model. 
 
3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
3.1 Measurement Results, Data Validation, and Interpretation 
3.1.1 PM mass concentrations 
The mean (± standard deviation) 24-h mass concentrations of PM1.0 and PM2.5 were 30.1 
(± 13.9) µg m–3 and 44.5 (± 21.0) µg m–3, respectively (Table 1). PM2.5 levels exceeded the WHO 
24-h guideline of 25 µg m–3 on 69 of the total 85 sampling days (81%). The monthly mean PM2.5 
mass concentration was highest in January 2015 (52.1 µg m–3) and lowest in May 2016 (32.1 µg m–3), 
reflecting the influence of the atmospheric conditions governed by the East Asian monsoon 
regime with northeast monsoon in winter and southeast monsoon in summer (Hien et al., 2004). 
 
3.1.2 Validation of the measured values based on the PM1.0-to-PM2.5 
concentration ratio 
The measured data can be validated by consistency tests based on the requirement that the 
PM1.0-to-PM2.5 concentration ratio should not exceed 1 (with tolerance to account for measurement 
uncertainties). The statistics in Table 1 and the PM1.0-to-PM2.5 concentration ratios displayed in 
Fig. 1 are consistent with this requirement, except for several cases related to BC, Cl–, and NH4+, 
which are present predominantly in PM1.0. These extreme cases were flagged, but not removed 
from the data set. 
The consistency test based on the PM1.0-to-PM2.5 ratios helped provide information on the 
partitioning of chemical constituents between the two fractions. The major crustal elements of 
Fe, Al, and Si were found to be depleted in PM1.0, accounting for only 13–38% of the PM1.0

concentration mass, and more concentrated in the PM1.0-2.5 fraction. Conversely, another major 
crustal species K (K+) accounts for 81% (94%) of the PM1.0 mass, suggesting an anthropogenic 
origin, i.e., biomass burning. Trace metals Pb, Cu, and Zn from primary vehicular emissions occurred 
mainly in submicron particles. Sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium also occurred mainly in the 
submicron size range, but the much lower PM1.0-to-PM2.5 ratios for sulfate and nitrate than for 
BC and ammonium suggest significant contributions from absorption of sulfuric and nitric acids 
on the surface of coarse particles (Section 3.2.2). 
Thus, like in the highly polluted cities of Beijing and Changzhou, China (Ye et al., 2017; Zhang 
et al., 2018), in Hanoi, anthropogenic components are more accumulated in PM1.0 while natural 
components contributed more to PM2.5. 
 
3.1.3 Relationship between soluble ion and total element 
The measurement values were also validated by another physical constraint, i.e., the 
concentration of any soluble ion should be less than that of the respective element. The 
proportion of a chemical element E occurring in aerosols as a soluble cation or anion I can be 
estimated based on the coefficient a in the following linear regression relationship (Hien et al., 
2005; Watson et al., 2008):  
 
[I] = a[E] + b  
(2) 
 
where the square brackets denote the concentration of the species inside. The regression 
parameters a, b, and the coefficient of determination R2 are shown in Table 2. 
In the case of sulfate versus total sulfur, the ratio of SO42– to S is 3:1 if all the S is present in the 
aerosols as SO42–. This was almost the case in this work with a slope of 3.01 ± 0.06, a close to zero 
intercept (0.08 ± 0.15), and a significant correlation between SO42– and S (R2 = 0.97). Thus, 97% 
of sulfur was present in PM1.0 as sulfate, and both PIXE and IC measurements were valid. A similar 
situation was found for PM2.5. The regression parameters showed that 91% of potassium occurred

in PM1.0 as soluble K+ ions with an average proportion of a = 0.93. The corresponding figures for 
PM2.5 were 90% and a = 0.79. 
 
3.1.4 Chemical compositions of PM1.0 and PM2.5 
Sulfate, BC, and ammonium were the most abundant species with a combined contribution of 
50.3% of the PM1.0 mass. These species remain the most abundant in PM2.5 but with a lower 
combined contribution of 38.4%. Next was potassium and calcium, which were more abundant 
than their major crustal counterparts of Si, Al, Fe, and Mg, indicating the strong impact of biomass 
burning and construction dust. Zn originating from traffic was also more abundant than the major 
crustal elements of Fe and Al in both fractions. Meanwhile, nitrate was depleted in both the PM 
fractions with concentrations much lower than those reported in other Asian cities (Table 3). 
Nitrate could be lost due to evaporation of semi-volatile ammonium nitrate (Cabada et al., 2004), 
but this sampling artifact could not be quantified. 
 
3.2 Source Apportionment by Positive Matrix Factorization 
3.2.1 Results and interpretation 
The optimal PMF solutions were achieved with an Fpeak parameter of approximate zero and 
seven factors, representing seven sources for each PM fraction. The alternative six- and eight-
factor solutions have also been explored. However, the six-factor solution explained much less 
variances of most species while in the eight-factor solution, the PM1.0/PM2.5 requirement was 
violated for many species.  
In Figs. 2(a) and 2(b), the profiles of these sources were plotted as the percent of each species 
apportioned to the factor (the sum of the species concentrations for the seven factors is 100). 
The contributions of these sources to the observed average concentrations of the most abundant 
species of sulfate and ammonium are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 for PM2.5 and PM1.0, respectively. 
The source name is assigned based on the source fingerprints that have a high percent 
apportioned to the factor (Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)). Thus, mineral elements Al, Fe, and Si were the 
fingerprints for resuspended road dust (Factor 1), mineral elements for coal fly ash (Factor 2), 
Ca2+ and Mg2+ for construction dust (Factor 3), Cl– and Na+ for sea-salt aerosols (Factor 4), Zn and 
Pb for traffic (vehicle tire and brake wear; Factor 5), and K and K+ for biomass burning (Factor 6). 
Coal fly ash was distinguished from resuspended road dust due to the high enrichment in K relative 
to other major crustal elements (Al, Fe, and Si) in coal. Pb and Zn were also enriched in coal like 
what was observed by Hsu et al. (2016). K and K+ were mostly associated with the biomass burning 
factor, in which BC was abundant. BC was also associated with the road dust factor indicating the 
presence of BC in surface soil, which comes from the incomplete combustion of plant materials and 
fossil fuels (Schmidt and Noack, 2000). Concerning sea-salt aerosols, it is worth noting the high 
Cl–-to-Na+ concentration ratio in Factor 4, i.e., 1.7 and 3.6 for PM1.0 and PM2.5, respectively, as 
compared to the ratio for seawater of 1.8, suggesting other sources of chloride (Faxon and Allen, 
2013) existed but were not resolved from the sea-salt factor in the PMF model. 
The sources assigned to Factors 1–6 represent primary emissions and are common to those 
reported elsewhere (e.g., Belis et al., 2013; Hsu et al., 2016; Crilley et al., 2017). The secondary 
inorganic aerosols of nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium resulting from the gas-to-particle conversion

of gaseous precursors SO2, NO2, and NH3 in the atmosphere are associated with these primary 
sources, but most sulfate and ammonium are associated with Factor 7, which will be assigned as 
regional or LRT aerosols. 
Nitrate was predominantly associated with coal fly ash followed by sea-salt and construction 
factors in both the PM fractions. The presence of nitrate in the sea-salt factor indicates the 
formation of sodium nitrate on sea-salt particles during transport from the sea as a result of the 
substitution of chloride by nitrate (Pathak et al., 2003). Additionally, the association of nitrate 
with alkaline ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, and K+) in coal fly ash and construction factors indicated that nitrate 
was formed through uptake and heterogeneous reactions of nitrogen gases, HNO3, and other 
trace gases on the surface of mineral dust particles (Zhang and Carmichael, 1999; Hien et al., 
2005; Perez et al., 2008). 
Similarly, the uptake and heterogeneous reactions of H2SO4 and sulfur gases on the surface of 
Ca-rich dust particles explained the presence of sulfate in the construction and road dust factors 
(Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)). Factor 2 (coal) contained sulfate and nitrate but some sulfuric and/or nitric 
acids were presumably also present in this factor to maintain the balance with large amounts of 
alkaline ions and ammonium. In contrast, sulfate in Factor 7 was completely neutralized by 
ammonium (in PM2.5), indicating aerosols had a long atmospheric lifespan after having traveled 
far from the sources. 
Factor 7 was nearly free from mineral dust and other species related to in situ emissions and 
was almost uncorrelated with the six remaining factors, as shown by the G-space (source 
contribution) analysis results (Norris et al., 2014). Therefore, sulfate and ammonium associated 
with Factor 7 were not related to in situ emissions but came from long-range transport with air

mass arrived at the site on the sampling day. The dependence of Factor 7 contributions on the 
air mass trajectory type found in Section 3.3 justified this argument.  
On average, about 60% (range: 0–87%) of observed sulfate concentrations in PM2.5, equivalent 
to an average of 5204 µg m–3, came from long-range transport (Fig. 3). In PM1.0, the LRT component 
was stronger, constituting 67% (range: 0–99%) of the observed sulfate, equivalent to an average 
of 4152 µg–3 (Fig. 4). Nitrate was insignificant in Factor 7 (Fig. 3) possibly because ammonium 
nitrate may have evaporated during long-range transport before reaching the sampling site 
(Pathak et al., 2003). 
The mean molar ratio of sulfate to ammonium in PM2.5 is slightly above 1, suggesting sulfate 
was fully neutralized and existed as ammonium sulfate [(NH4)2SO4]. Meanwhile, in PM1.0 a 16% 
cation equivalent deficit was found, indicating some portion of sulfate (30%) may have existed as 
ammonium bisulfate (NH4HSO4), a precursor of ammonium sulfate (Chen et al., 2019). Besides 
sulfate and ammonium, the LRT aerosols carried large amounts of BC, accounting for 34% and 
20% of observed concentrations in PM1.0 and PM2.5, respectively. 
 
3.2.2 Contributions of sources to PM mass 
As expected, all the sources resolved by PMF for PM1.0 existed in PM2.5 with little differences 
between source profiles (Figs. 2(a) and 2(b)). However, there were apparent differences in the 
contributions of sources to the species concentrations, especially to the PM masses, as shown in 
the pie charts of Fig. 5. Resuspended road dust was a leading source in PM2.5 but was much 
depleted in PM1.0. Meanwhile, LRT aerosols were most abundant in PM1.0 followed by coal fly ash 
and primary traffic emissions, suggesting the advantage of the characterization of these sources 
with little interference from road dust by studying PM1.0, instead of PM2.5. 
Primary vehicular emissions moderately contributed to the PM masses, but particulate matter 
related to road traffic (primary emissions, secondary sulfate, and resuspended road dust) is 
overwhelming in PM2.5. The primary vehicular emission and road dust contribute 16.2% to the 
PM1.0 mass, but vehicular emissions are expected to be the largest in situ contributor to PM1.0 if 
the missing sources related to the unmeasured organic carbon (OC) were included in the PMF 
modeling. 
The seven sources extracted in the PMF models could explain approximately 78% of the PM 
mass loadings. The unexplained mass may come from unmeasured OC and water bound to particles. 
OC was not measured in the experiment, but the OC content can be roughly estimated at 5–9 µg m–3 
using the OC-to-EC ratio (0.8–1.4) in the literature (Lee et al., 2006; Tao et al., 2012). 
 
3.2.3 PMF model performance 
A comparison between observed (input data) concentrations and model-predicted values 
shown the best fit for many species. The linear regression plots of modeled versus observed 
concentrations show that SO42–, NH4+, K+, K, Zn, and Si were well modeled with an R2 greater than 
0.95 and a slope well above 0.90. For Al, Fe, Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, and Cl–, R2 ranged from 0.8 to 0.9.

The accuracy of the PMF model and its stability with regards to rotational ambiguity and input 
data uncertainties were checked by bootstrapping (Norris et al., 2014). The relative uncertainties 
(standard deviation/mean) of factor profiles were ~5% for SO42– and NH4+ in the LRT factor; ~10% 
for source fingerprints, such as Zn in traffic, K+ in biomass burning, and Ca2+ in construction dust; 
15–40% for other species; and ~20% for the PM masses (Fig. 5). 
 
3.3 Air Mass Trajectories and LRT 
The temporal variations in the contributions of LRT to the observed sulfate and ammonium 
reflect the variations in the trajectories and properties of air masses that arrive at Hanoi on the 
sampling days. The 4-day HYSPLIT backward trajectories of air masses (Stein et al., 2015) that 
arrived in Hanoi in the middle of each sampling day (20:00 UTC) at 500 m above ground can be 
classified into four types, namely, 1) northerly (N) continental air masses originating from northern 
China, traveling through inland China and crossing the Vietnam-China border before arriving in 
Hanoi; 2) northwesterly (NW) continental dry air masses originating from India and traveling over 
Myanmar, northern Laos, and northwestern Vietnam; 3) southwesterly (SW) tropical humid air 
masses originating from the equatorial Pacific and traveling over Thailand, Cambodia, southern 
Laos, and central Vietnam; and 4) easterly (E) maritime air masses originating from western 
Pacific and passing over the East Sea before embarking on northern Vietnam via the Gulf of 
Tonkin (Fig. 6). The different abundances of SO2 and NH3 in the above regions could drive the 
trajectory dependence of the LRT impact at the receptor site. Thus, the northerly air mass may 
take up abundant SO2 and BC as it travels over industrial areas and megacities in southern China. 
Intensive burning of agricultural residues and forest fires in the regions under the NW trajectories 
(Lasko et al., 2018) may be significant sources of NH3, BC, and K. In contrast, the atmosphere 
beneath the East Sea may be polluted by emissions from ships and inland outflows associated 
with the northeast monsoon in the north and southeast monsoon in the south (Ding et al., 2018; 
Fan et al., 2015).

The monthly distributions of trajectory types (Fig. 7) show that northerly and some easterly 
trajectories occurred mainly in winter in association with the northeast and southeast monsoons, 
southwesterly trajectories associated with the southwest monsoon occur mainly in summer, and 
northwesterly trajectories were found in the transition period (Hien et al., 2004). 
The N, NW, SW, and E trajectory types occurred on 15, 18, 35, and 17 sampling days, 
respectively. The modeled LRT sulfate concentrations for the sampling days were displayed in the 
box-and-whisker plots of Fig. 8. LRT ammonium concentrations follow similar patterns (not shown). 
The concentrations of LRT ammonium sulfate exhibited large variations within each trajectory type, 
reflecting the influence of meteorological factors on the formation and scavenging of secondary 
aerosols taking place during transport on the trajectory. The 2-tailed Kolmogorov-Smirnov test 
was used to compare the LRT sulfate contributions associated with different trajectory types. 
The easterly air masses passing over the East Sea were found to bring in the least sulfate and 
ammonium with p < 0.04 and p < 0.05 for PM1.0 and PM2.5, respectively. On the other hand, no 
statistically significant difference was found among the three remaining trajectory types.

4 DISCUSSION 
 
Sulfate, ammonium, and BC were predominant constituents of PM1.0 and PM2.5. Nitrate 
represented only a minor component in both particulate fractions. The PMF model resolved 
inorganic aerosols related to in situ emissions and those coming from LRT. 
In situ sulfate and nitrate were formed mainly from uptake and reactions of gaseous sulfur and 
nitrogen species on the surface of mineral dust particles (Zhang and Carmichael, 1999; Perez et 
al., 2008). The levels of SO2 and NO2 in the area under study were 30 µg m–3 and 40 µg m–3, 
respectively (Hien et al., 2020). However, only small fractions of the aerosol precursor gases had 
been converted into in situ sulfate and nitrate. The ratio of molar sulfate/nitrate to total molar 
sulfur/nitrogen (Kaneyasu, 1995) was equal to 0.065 for SO2 and even much smaller for NO2—
0.003. If the amounts of in situ sulfate and nitrate incorporated in the PM2.5–10 (coarse PM10) 
fraction were added up using the data from our previous study (Hien et al., 2005), these ratios 
would increase to 0.12 and 0.06, respectively. The loss of nitrate during sampling and the 
evaporation of ammonium nitrate due to high temperature may have reduced the nitrate level 
to some extent. However, the deficiency of NH3 in the ambient condition may have been the 
main reason for the very low ammonium nitrate formation rate because NH3 prefers to react 
with H2SO4 to form ammonium sulfate rather than react with HNO3 to form NH4NO3. Ge et al. 
(2017) show that NH4NO3 starts to form when the molar ratio of NH4+ to SO42– is larger than 1.5 
which is about one order of magnitude higher than the ratio in our case. Further studies are 
needed to elucidate the reasons for the observed low nitrate conversion rate. 
LRT aerosols, comprising most of the observed sulfate and ammonium, were produced from 
SO2 and NH3 through reactions involving other gases in the atmosphere with subsequent gas-to-
particle conversion processes. As a result, sulfate forms in the ultrafine nucleation mode with 
sizes less than 0.1 µm and the two modes in the submicron range, namely, the condensation and 
droplet modes with mass median aerodynamic diameters of ~0.2 µm and ~0.7 µm, respectively 
(John et al., 1990; Meng and Seinfeld, 1994). Located mainly beyond the 1 µm cutoff, the droplet 
mode accounts for the difference between the properties of PM1.0 and PM2.5. Sulfate in the 
condensation mode, formed by gas-phase homogeneous reactions of precursor gases, was acidic. 
Meanwhile, aerosols in the droplet mode, formed by heterogeneous reactions mainly in clouds 
after traveling far from the source location, were fully neutralized by ammonium (John et al., 
1990), which is consistent with the model-predicted molar ratio of LRT sulfate to ammonium in 
the two fractions (Section 3.2.1). 
LRT secondary aerosols and their gas precursors come from far away so their impact largely 
reflected the pollution status of the region under their trajectory. Thus, the N air mass was 
expected to have a high impact as it traveled over highly urbanized southern China. Indeed, 
Pathak et al. (2003) found that 40% of the PM2.5 sulfate and ammonium measured in Hong Kong 
was brought in by the cold continental air masses that arrived in the area after passing over inland 
China in winter. In our PMF receptor modeling study of PM2.5 acquired from Hanoi in 2000–2001, 
the concentrations of LRT ammonium sulfate were also highest in the northeast monsoon’s N air 
masses passing over inland China (Hien et al., 2004). 
 
5 CONCLUSIONS 
 
The PMF models clearly differentiated the contribution of LRT aerosols, which accounted for 
more than two-thirds of the measured PM-bound sulfate and ammonium concentrations, from 
those of the six in situ sources, namely, resuspended road dust, primary vehicular emissions, coal 
fly ash, biomass burning emissions, construction dust, and sea salt. LRT aerosols, coal fly ash, and 
primary particulate vehicular emissions mainly occurred in the PM1.0, whereas resuspended road 
dust and biomass-burning fly ash tended to appear in the PM1.0–2.5; thus, we can characterize the 
anthropogenic emissions in this area by examining the profile of the PM1.0 rather than the PM2.5. 
Furthermore, air masses with inland trajectories originating in northern China and nations 
northwest and southwest of Vietnam contained more ammonium, sulfate, and BC than those 
that had traveled over the East Sea. Also, the LRT aerosols displayed high acidity in the PM1.0 but 
neutrality in the PM2.5.

Overall, our comparative analysis of PM1.0 and PM2.5 characterizes the sources of the former, 
which typically remain unaddressed in studies of the latter. This information is essential to 
developing effective pollution control measures for the airborne submicron PM in Hanoi.
