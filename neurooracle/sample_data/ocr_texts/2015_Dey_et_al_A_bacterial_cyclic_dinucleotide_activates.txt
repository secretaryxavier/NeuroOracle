Abstract
Detection of cyclic-di-adenosine monophosphate (c-di-AMP), a bacterial second messenger, by 
the host cytoplasmic surveillance pathway (CSP) is known to elicit Type I interferon responses 
critical for antimicrobial defense1–3. However, the mechanisms and role of c-di-AMP signaling in 
Mycobacterium tuberculosis virulence remain unclear. Here we show that resistance to 
tuberculosis (TB) requires CSP-mediated detection of c-di-AMP produced by M. tuberculosis and 
that levels of c-di-AMP modulate the fate of infection. We found that a di-adenylate cyclase (disA 
or dacA)4 over-expressing M. tuberculosis strain that secretes excess c-di-AMP activates the 
interferon regulatory factor (IRF) pathway with enhanced levels of IFN-β, elicits increased 
macrophage autophagy, and exhibits significant attenuation in mice. We show that c-di-AMP-
mediated IFN-β induction during M. tuberculosis infection requires stimulator of interferon genes 
(STING)5-signaling. We observed that c-di-AMP induction of IFN-β is independent of the 
cytosolic nucleic acid receptor cyclic-GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS)6–7, but cGAS 
nevertheless contributes substantially to the overall IFN-β response to M. tuberculosis infection. In 
sum, our results reveal c-di-AMP to be a key mycobacterial pathogen associated molecular pattern 
(PAMP) driving host Type I IFN responses and autophagy. These findings suggest that 
modulating the levels of this small molecule may lead to novel immunotherapeutic strategies 
against TB.

The innate immune system is crucial for the early detection of invading pathogens and 
functions by recognizing specific PAMPs via germ line-encoded PRRs8. Downstream 
signaling following PRR and ligand binding leads to elicitation of innate immune responses 
and subsequent modulation of the adaptive responses thereby orchestrating a complex 
network of host defenses8. Cyclic di-nucleotides (CDNs), which are either produced by 
invading bacterial pathogens (such as, c-di-AMP and c-di-GMP) or produced endogenously 
in response to foreign DNA (cyclic GMP-AMP, cGAMP) represent one such category of 
small molecules that, during infection, act as triggers for innate immune responses leading to 
induction of Type I interferons (IFN-α/β)2,6,9. CDNs triggers Type I IFN induction through 
TLR-independent pathways9 that include direct interaction with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 
membrane protein STING or the cytosolic receptor DDX41, which complexes with STING 
followed by signal activation via phosphorylation of Tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and 
Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3)5,10. While the potency of cytosolic signaling induced 
by CDNs and dsDNA appears comparable9, the sensors for these molecules may be unique 
with minimal redundancy10–11. Of the several putative mammalian cytosolic DNA sensors 
that signal through STING12, cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) has recently been shown 
to be essential for DNA-mediated immune responses irrespective of cell type and nucleic 
acid sequence11. On detection of foreign nucleic acid, cGAS synthesizes a non-canonical 
CDN, cGAMP, which subsequently binds to STING leading to induction of Type I IFNs via 
the same signaling axis as that used by bacterial CDNs11. The production of a host-
generated CDN in response to foreign nucleic acid may account for the apparent overlap of 
the responses to the structurally distinct ligands.
Like several pathogenic bacteria, the M. tuberculosis genome encodes a di-adenylate cyclase 
enzyme (disA or dacA, Rv3586, MT3692) which synthesizes c-di-AMP from ATP or ADP4,. 
Orthologues of disA exist in all mycobacterial genomes with the exception of M. leprae. 
However, the role of c-di-AMP in M. tuberculosis physiology and mechanism of its 
interaction with the host immune system is poorly understood13–14. Evidence from other 
intracellular bacterial infections strongly suggests that both microbial DNA and CDNs 
stimulate the secretion of Type I IFNs2,15. However, the existing model for M. tuberculosis 
infection hypothesizes that extracellular mycobacterial DNA is the only ligand for CSP 
activation within macrophages, which leads to increased autophagy and bacterial clearance 
in an Esx-1 secretion system dependent manner excluding any role of bacterial CDNs in 
CSP activation16–17. Here we report that c-di-AMP, not cytosolic DNA alone, is a critical 
ligand for CSP activation leading to induction of Type I IFNs and autophagy during M. 
tuberculosis infection.
To confirm that M. tuberculosis produces and secretes c-di-AMP, we first detected and 
quantified bacterial c-di-AMP production in 7H9 broth culture and found considerable levels 
in both the intracellular and extracellular compartments by employing highly sensitive LC-
MS/MS MRM methods (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). We also observed that intracellular c-di-
AMP levels increase during late-log and stationary phases of growth of M. tuberculosis 
compared to early log phase growth (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Further M. tuberculosis-
produced c-di-AMP was also detected in the infected macrophage cytosol (Supplementary 
Fig. 1d). Next, we constructed a recombinant M. tuberculosis strain over-expressing its

endogenous di-adenylate cyclase gene, disA (Mtb-OE) (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Analysis 
of the transcriptome by mRNA sequencing revealed a 95-fold over-expression of disA in the 
Mtb-OE strain compared to the M. tuberculosis CDC1551 wild type (WT) control strain 
(Supplementary Fig. 2c) with a resultant increase in the production of c-di-AMP by ~20 fold 
(Supplementary Fig. 2d). The absence of any c-di-AMP in the mutant bacterial strain 
(Supplementary Fig. 3) with a transposon insertion disrupting the di-adenylate cyclase 
domain of disA (JHU-3586, http://webhost.nts.jhu.edu/target/) confirms that c-di-AMP is 
produced by a single di-adenylate cyclase in M. tuberculosis. Complementation of the 
mutant bacteria with its endogenous disA gene and native promoter reconstituted c-di-AMP 
production (Mtb-COMP) (Supplementary Fig. 4).
To investigate whether perturbations of c-di-AMP levels in M. tuberculosis influence host 
Type I IFN responses, we infected J774.1 mouse macrophage cells with M. tuberculosis 
strains expressing different c-di-AMP levels, and measured IFN-β levels by ELISA at 24 
hours post-infection. As shown in Fig. 1a, b, infection with the Mtb-disA-KO strain resulted 
in a significant reduction in IFN-β induction by J774.1 cells compared to infection with the 
Mtb-CDC1551. Conversely, infection with the Mtb-OE strain resulted in an enhanced 
induction of IFN-β by both resting and activated J774.1 cells. Notably, Mtb-OE infected 
cells also secreted significantly higher levels of TNF-α compared to the Mtb-WT infected 
cells, whereas Mtb-disA-KO infected cells produced lower TNF-α levels compared to other 
groups (Fig. 1c, d). Moreover, the patterns of IRF pathway activation in THP1-human 
monocyte cells (Supplementary Fig. 5) and IFN-β responses in mouse primary bone marrow 
derived macrophages (BMDM) and dendritic cells (BMDC) (Fig. 1e, f) were comparable 
further confirming our hypothesis. However, we noticed that mouse BMDCs are a 
comparatively better IFN-β producer than BMDMs in response to M. tuberculosis infection, 
which has also been reported by others18. Induction of IFN-β was further confirmed by real 
time RT-PCR of the BMDC cells infected with various M. tuberculosis strains (Fig. 1g). We 
also observed induction of significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
including IL-1α, IL-6 and TNF-α by both BMDMs and BMDCs following infection with 
the c-di-AMP over-expressing M. tuberculosis strain (Supplementary Fig. 6). These 
observations suggest that perturbation of c-di-AMP levels in M. tuberculosis not only 
influences the CSP mediated Type I IFN response but also plays a critical role in modulating 
the pro-inflammatory cytokine signature of the infected cells.
Taking into account the ambiguous role of the Type I IFN response in host control of TB, 
we monitored the growth patterns of these M. tuberculosis strains in resting and IFN-γ/LPS 
activated J774.1 cells. While all M. tuberculosis WT and recombinant strains exhibited 
identical growth rates in 7H9 broth culture (Supplementary Fig. 7), the Mtb-OE strain 
exhibited significantly diminished intracellular growth compared with the other M. 
tuberculosis strains (Fig. 1h, i). We did not notice any growth attenuation of the Mtb-disA-
KO strain. These observations reveal that over-expression of c-di-AMP by M. tuberculosis 
results in significant attenuation of the intracellular growth of the Mtb-OE strain.
In light of reports indicating that CDNs are potent autophagy inducers16,19, we investigated 
whether enhanced macrophage autophagy might account for the attenuation of the c-di-AMP 
over-expressing M. tuberculosis strain by examining the auto-phagosome membrane

specific marker LC3 in M. tuberculosis infected J774.1 cells. Fluorescence confocal imaging 
demonstrated a considerably higher percentage of cells (~15%) exhibiting LC3 puncta 
formation in the case of Mtb-OE infection compared to Mtb-CDC1551 (~10%) and Mtb-
disA-KO infections (~6%) (Fig. 2a, b). In addition, Western blot analysis of endogenous 
LC3 revealed an increase in conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II in the Mtb-OE infected cells, 
indicating hyper-activation of autophagy (Fig. 2c). We also observed a considerably higher 
percentage of cells exhibiting pTBK1 positivity suggesting activation of IRF pathway5,10 in 
the Mtb-OE infected J774.1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 8). These observations strongly 
suggest that hyper-induction of autophagy by macrophages may be one of the contributing 
factors that restricts the intracellular growth of Mtb-OE strain.
Next we examined the virulence and pathogenicity of the M. tuberculosis strains in mouse 
aerosol infection models. Remarkably, compared to WT infection (median time to death 
[MTD] of 150 days), we observed a significant increase in the survival of Mtb-OE infected 
mice (MTD 321 days). In contrast, the Mtb-disA-KO strain which is c-di-AMP deficient 
showed reduced survival with an MTD of 77 days (Fig. 3a). Concomitantly, the Mtb-OE 
strain also exhibited growth attenuation as evidenced by significantly reduced lung and 
spleen bacillary loads (Fig. 3b, c). Gross and histo-pathological findings of mouse lungs and 
spleens correlated well with the bacterial organ burden observations (Fig. 3d, e). The lungs 
of Mtb-OE infected-mice showed significantly fewer and smaller tubercle-like lesions 
compared to other groups. Concordantly, while Mtb-CDC1551, Mtb-disA-KO, and Mtb-
COMP strain-infected mice exhibited considerable splenomegaly, spleens of the Mtb-OE 
infected mice appeared normal in size (Fig. 3d). Altogether, these observations clearly 
demonstrate attenuation of virulence in the c-di-AMP over-expressing M. tuberculosis 
strain.
Next, we compared the mouse serum cytokine levels between these groups at an early stage 
of disease: 2 weeks post-infection. Consistent with our in vitro studies in mouse and human 
cells, we observed increased IFN-β levels in the serum of Mtb-OE infected mice compared 
to the Mtb-CDC1551 and Mtb-disA-KO group (Fig. 3f). In addition, the Mtb-OE group 
exhibited significantly higher serum levels of TNF-α (Fig. 3g). Since Type I IFN (IFN-β) is 
known to counter-regulate Type II IFN (IFN-γ) responses20, we measured IFN-γ levels in 
the serum of infected mice (Fig. 3h). We observed a strong inverse relationship between 
IFN-β and IFN-γ in these mice corresponding to the ability of the M. tuberculosis-strains to 
produce c-di-AMP.
Our studies reveal that bacterial c-di-AMP levels are strongly associated with the 
immunopathological outcome of M. tuberculosis infection in mice. Hence, we next 
examined the host cytosolic sensors that may detect M. tuberculosis-derived c-di-AMP 
starting with helicase DDX41, a cytosolic DNA and CDN receptor that signals via 
STING10,21. We performed shRNA-mediated knocked down of DDX41 using RAW-Blue™ 
ISG cells (InvivoGen) that allow colorimetric measurement of the induction of the IRF 
pathway. Knockdown of DDX41 caused a significant defect in activation of the IRF 
pathway and reduced IFN-β induction following infection with all the M. tuberculosis 
strains (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b, c). We also observed a significantly reduced TNF-α 
production by the DDX41 knock-down cells (Supplementary Fig. 9d). These results suggest 
Dey et al.

that DDX41 is a key pattern recognition receptor for both DNA and c-di-AMP, and that 
DDX41 regulates the induction of Type I IFNs as well as TNF-α following M. tuberculosis 
infection.
We then investigated the contribution of STING to the c-di-AMP-mediated IFN-β response 
during M. tuberculosis infection. A partial knock-down of STING in human THP1 cells 
showed considerably lower IFN-β induction than control cells (Supplementary Fig. 10). 
Moreover, all M. tuberculosis strains failed to activate the IRF pathway or induce IFN-β in 
mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage IRF reporter cells lacking STING (STING-KO) (Fig. 4a, b, 
c, d). However, LPS, which stimulates Type I IFN through STING-independent pathways, 
induced elevated IFN-β response even in STING-KO cells (Fig. 4a, b). These results 
confirm that, in addition to its role in bacterial DNA mediated responses, STING is an 
essential component for c-di-AMP-mediated activation of the IRF pathway during M. 
tuberculosis infection17. Furthermore, infection of macrophages with M. bovis bacille 
Calmette–Guérin (BCG), which is known to lack the Esx-1 secretion system, also showed 
activation of the IRF pathway at levels 20–60% of those seen following infection with either 
the Mtb-CDC1551 or the Erdman strain, a WT M. tuberculosis strain considered to be 
highly virulent (Fig. 4a, b). Importantly, the c-di-AMP over-expressing M. bovis BCG strain 
(BCG-OE) produced a significantly higher IRF and IFN-β response than M. bovis BCG 
itself, thus strongly suggesting that bacterial-derived c-di-AMP gains access to the host cell 
cytosol despite the absence of an Esx-1 secretion system (Fig. 4a, b). These experiments 
indicate that, while contributory to overall type I IFN response, Esx-1 may not be essential 
for c-di-AMP-triggered IRF pathway activation. However, further studies with ESX-1 
deleted M. tuberculosis strains may provide direct evidence for contribution of ESX-1 
secretion system in c-di-AMP mediated responses during M. tuberculosis infection.
Next we evaluated the role of cGAS in the detection of bacterial c-di-AMP. We infected 
primary BMDMs (Fig. 4e) and BMDCs (Fig. 4f) from WT and cGAS-KO mice22 with these 
mycobacterial strains and measured IFN-β protein levels. While loss of cGAS resulted in a 
considerably reduced IFN-β response compared to cells with intact cGAS (WT), all c-di-
AMP overproducing strains continued to show significantly higher induction of IFN-β in 
cGAS-KO cells compared to their respective WT mycobacterial strains (Fig. 4e, f). Further, 
both WT and cGAS-KO BMDMs produced comparable levels of IFN-β following 
stimulation with synthetic c-di-AMP (Fig. 4g). Real time RT-PCR for IFN-b in BMDCs 
further confirmed these results (Fig. 4h). These experiments show that while c-di-AMP is a 
key ligand for IFN-β induction irrespective of cGAS, a significant part of the overall IFN-b 
response during M. tuberculosis infection is cGAS dependent and hence is probably due to 
bacterial DNA.
Our data thus reveal the involvement of c-di-AMP as an M. tuberculosis PAMP that triggers 
host cell IFN-β secretion and autophagy. These observations expand upon earlier studies 
which suggested that mycobacterial DNA is the exclusive ligand for inducing the Type I 
IFN response and that the bacterial Esx-1 secretion apparatus is required for CSP 
activation17. Our findings, which employed multiple bacterial strains (the M. tuberculosis 
CDC1551 and Erdman strains, and M. bovis BCG) each modified to overexpress c-di-AMP 
and a variety of host phagocytic cells including those defective in important mediators of the

CSP (STING, DDX41, and cGAS), consistently demonstrated that c-di-AMP, not bacterial 
DNA alone, is a key mediator of Type I IFN responses. Supplementary Table 1 lists major 
differences in our methods compared with those of earlier studies and reveals that strain, 
host cell, and methodological differences may have allowed the importance of c-di-AMP to 
have been overlooked in earlier studies.
We considered the possibility that c-di-AMP-mediated changes in other bacterial antigens 
might affect Type I IFN response through NOD signaling as reported by Pandey et al.23. 
However, a recent study demonstrated that the enhanced Type I IFN response caused by 
accumulation of c-di-AMP in a c-di-AMP phosphodiesterase mutant of M. tuberculosis is 
independent of NOD signaling24. This report thus further supports our observations and 
highlights induction of Type I IFN response by c-di-AMP. Moreover, several publications 
have also demonstrated that NOD signaling is dispensable for IRF activation during M. 
tuberculosis infection17. Thus, we feel that indirect effects of c-di-AMP on other bacterial 
PAMPs are unlikely to account for the IFN-β responses we observe. Moreover, absence of 
any difference in the intra-bacterial cAMP level amongst different M. tuberculosis strains 
further ruled out any off target effect of perturbed disA expression or c-di-AMP levels on 
cAMP-a known inducer of TNF-α25.
The enhanced Type I IFN response consequent to over-production of c-di-AMP observed in 
this study significantly extends correlative observations in several studies with laboratory as 
well as clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria24,26–27. While Type I IFNs are absolutely 
critical for resistance to viruses, there are conflicting reports as to whether the IFN-α/β 
response is beneficial or detrimental to the host during tuberculosis28–29. For example, loss 
of the IFN-α receptor in knockout mice confers resistance to tuberculosis suggesting that 
Type I IFN responses are counterproductive in TB30. In contrast, IFNα/β responses have 
been shown to enhance antigen cross-presentation in DCs and activation of cytolytic CD8 T 
cells, which are critical for M. tuberculosis clearance31–32, and the Type I IFN response has 
also been shown to limit lung infectivity of M. tuberculosis in animals devoid of Type II 
IFN33. Importantly, human TB transcriptome analysis of peripheral blood also revealed 
upregulation of both Type I and Type II IFN gene profiles suggesting overlapping and 
dynamic roles of both types of IFN in TB pathogenesis34. Beyond induction of Type I IFN, 
our study also found enhanced induction of several pro-inflammatory cytokines including 
IL1-α, TNF-α and IL-6 which are believed to play protective roles during M. tuberculosis 
infection35.
Autophagy is increasingly appreciated as a key mechanism by which macrophages kill 
intracellular M. tuberculosis36, and autophagy inducers such as Vitamin D have also been 
identified as potential candidates for the treatment of HIV-TB co-infection37. Indeed, certain 
first-line TB drugs, isoniazid (INH) and pyrazinamide (PZA), may act in part by stimulating 
autophagy38. Mounting evidence also suggests that mycobacterial DNA17, bacterial CDNs 
such as c-di-AMP16,19, and induction of the Type I IFN39 response itself are inducers of 
autophagy. Our observation of CDN-activation of IRF signaling and autophagy is consistent 
with the emerging appreciation of crosstalk between these two pathways.

While altered virulence and antibiotic resistance has been associated with mutation in c-di-
AMP cyclase and phosphodiesterase genes of several bacterial pathogens28, modulation of 
bacterial c-di-AMP levels has yet to be linked to variables in the clinical presentation of 
human TB. However, differences in the induction of IFN-β by clinical isolates of M. 
tuberculosis40 and the presence of mutations in the adenylate cyclase (Rv3586) as well as 
phosphodiesterase (Rv2837c) genes in clinical strains of M. tuberculosis (http://
www.tbdb.org/) suggest a potential association of c-di-AMP levels with forms of human TB 
disease. This study revealing that c-di-AMP produced by M. tuberculosis is a PAMP that 
modulates Type I IFN response during infection may prompt future correlative human 
studies.
Our findings highlight the importance of c-di-AMP detection in the host’s innate resistance 
to TB and reveal a previously unappreciated mechanism of CSP activation by bacterial 
CDNs during M. tuberculosis infection. The ability of a small molecule, c-di-AMP, to 
govern the outcome of intracellular infection suggests novel approaches for the treatment 
and prevention of TB as well as related diseases.
