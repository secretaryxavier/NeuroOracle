Abstract
Objective—To gain an understanding of the current state of the evidence for management of
attention problems after traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children, determine gaps in the literature,
and make recommendations for future research.
Type—Focused Systematic review
Literature Survey—PubMed/Medline and PsychINFO databases were searched for relevant
articles published in English over the last 20 years. Keywords included “attention” “
deficit and disruptive behavior disorders”, and “brain injuries”. Studies were limited to children.
attention
Methodology—Titles were examined first and eliminated based on lack of relevancy to attention
problems after brain injury in children. This was followed by an abstract and full text review.
Article quality was determined based on the United States Preventative Services Task Force
recommendations for evidence grading.
Synthesis—Four pharmacological and ten cognitive therapy intervention studies were identified.
These studies varied in level of evidence quality but were primarily non-randomized or cohort
studies.
Conclusions—There are studies that demonstrate benefits of varying pharmacological and
cognitive therapies for the management of attention problems after TBI. However, there is a
paucity of evidence available to definitively guide management of attention problems after
pediatric TBI. Larger randomized controlled trials and multicenter studies are needed to elucidate
optimal treatment strategies in this population.

Introduction
Methods
Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children,
leading to almost half a million emergency department visits, 35,000 hospitalizations, and
over 2,000 deaths per year in the United States [1]. TBI results in numerous physical and
cognitive sequelae. Cognitive deficits following TBI in children involve problems with
attention, behavioral regulation, and executive function that worsen with increasing TBI
severity [2-7]. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) that develops post-injury
without evidence of pre-injury ADHD is often referred to as secondary ADHD (S-ADHD).
The prevalence of S-ADHD after TBI is estimated to be 14.5-19% [8, 9]. Developmental or
primary ADHD (P-ADHD) has a higher prevalence in the TBI population at approximately
20% versus 4.5% in the general population [8]. S-ADHD is strongly associated with severity
of TBI and children with severe TBI have a higher risk for developing post-injury attention
problems than those with mild or moderate TBI [10]. When combining these percentages,
almost half of children who sustain a TBI will have persisting, worsening, or new attention
problems after injury. The consequences of attention problems extend beyond school and
learning, and can have negative impacts on a child’s social relationships, emotional well-
being, and quality of life [11].
Because of the high prevalence of attention deficits in children after a TBI and their far-
reaching negative effects, there is a critical need to optimize treatments to maximize
recovery and function. To date, the majority of intervention studies that have evaluated
attention problems after TBI are adult-focused [12— 26]. While the results of these studies
are starting points for identifying therapies for children, adult and pediatric brains are very
different. Children’s brains rapidly develop throughout childhood and adolescence, and have
high degrees of plasticity compared to adults [27]. Differences between pediatric and adult
brains are likely associated with differential recovery and beneficial treatments may vary
between the two groups.
The objective of this review is to describe the current literature specific to interventions,
both pharmacologic- and behavioral-based, for attention problems in children after TBI.
Previous review articles have primarily described studies in adults and have focused on
pharmacologic interventions [13, 14, 17-22, 25, 26]. This article fills a critical gap by
describing the state of the science of the current treatment options for attention problems
after pediatric TBI. Due to the high prevalence of TBI in children and risk of developing
new or worsening attention problems, it is imperative that evidence-based treatments are
implemented to allow optimal management of attention problems in children after TBI. A
discussion of the findings includes recommendations for current treatment based on the
evidence and suggestions for future research.
A literature search was conducted using PubMed/MEDLINE and PsychINFO databases.
MeSH search terms were used in PubMed and altered for use in PsychINFO. The MeSH
search terms used were “attention” or “attention deficit and disruptive behavior disorders”
combined with “brain injuries”. “Brain injuries” was designated as the major topic in the
PM R. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2015 September 01.

Results
search. In the PsychINFO search “attention deficit and disruptive behavior disorders” was
changed to “attention deficit” and “brain injuries was changed to “brain injury”. The search
was limited in both databases to articles published in the last 20 years (January 1993 — July
2013), human studies, articles published in English, and the age range was defined as
childhood (0-18 years).
The initial search returned 651 results. Results were not considered if they were a book,
dissertation, or review article. After reviewing titles, 604 articles were excluded because the
titles were not related to attention problems after brain injury. Review of the 47 abstracts
eliminated 19 articles. After review of the remaining 28 full articles, a further 14 articles
were excluded, leaving the 14 articles that are included in this review (Figure 1). Articles
were excluded during the abstract or full text review if a primary or secondary outcome
measure specific to attention was not used, the article was a case study, the study population
was composed entirely or primarily of adults (e.g., average age of study population was over
18 years), the study was not an intervention study, the article was a review that had not been
previously identified, or the study did not measure attention before the intervention was
administered. Because of the specificity of this review and the small number of studies
identified, articles with mixed study populations of children with TBI and other acquired
brain injuries (ABI) were also included. The results also contain studies that include young
adults provided that children under 18 comprised the majority of the study population.
The studies were rated for quality of evidence as per the guidelines provided by the US
Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) as follows: Level I: Evidence obtained from at
least one properly designed randomized controlled trial, Level II-1: Evidence obtained from
well-designed controlled trials without randomization, Level II-2: Evidence obtained from
well-designed cohort-or case control analytic studies, preferable from more than one center
or research group, Level II-3: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without
the intervention, Level III: Opinions of respected authorities, based on clinical experience,
descriptive studies, or reports of expert committees [28].
The identified studies were grouped into three categories: pharmacologic intervention (Table
1), cognitive therapy/attentional training studies (Table 2), and mixed injury studies (Table
3). The mixed (TBland ABI) brain injury studies were all in the cognitive therapy/
attentional training category, but are discussed separately given the wider variety of
etiologies. In the second group, two of the identified studies used the same treatment cohort,
but one of the papers reported outcomes immediately after treatment while the other
reported six-month follow-up data, so they will be discussed as one study. Several studies in
both groups had other cognitive outcome measures in addition to attention, but the focus in
this article is placed on the results of attention-specific testing.
Medication Therapy
Four of the studies examined pharmacologic interventions. Three of the studies looked at
methylphenidate, a drug primarily used for treatment of P-ADHD [17]. Two of the studies
were composed of double-blind, placebo controlled, crossover designs. In a level I study

Williams, et al. studied 10 children with mild to severe head trauma [29]. Outcome measures
specific to attention were the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), Continuous
Performance Test (CPT), and the Sentence Repetition Task (SRT). No significant
differences were detected between placebo and methylphenidate conditions for attention or
any of the domains measured in the study [29]. In the other level I methylphenidate study
Mahalick, et al. studied 14 children with TBIs of varying severity [30]. The Gordon
Diagnostic System, Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Test Battery Revised, and the
Ruff 2 and 7 cancellation test were used as attention-specific outcomes. The
methylphenidate treatment resulted in significantly higher scores on all tests when compared
to placebo. Despite similar methodologies, several differences between the studies could
have led to the dissimilar results. In the Williams study, subjects were given
methylphenidate based on weight (e.g. subjects weighing < 20 kg received 5 mg
methylphenidate twice a day, 7.5 mg if 21-29 kg, 10 mg if >30 kg). In the Mahalick study,
all subjects received a dose of 0.3 mg/kg. Specific information on injury severity was not
provided with the Williams paper, so it is unknown if the two study populations have
comparable injury severity. In the Williams study, subjects received methylphenidate for 4
days while in the Mahalick study methylphenidate was administered for 2 weeks. It could be
that the longer treatment course and more specific dosing regimen contributed to the
presence of significant differences between the groups in the Mahalick study.
Hornyak, et al. performed a level II-3 study with a retrospective chart review [31]. They
found qualitative improvements in attention and behavior as reported by those involved in
the subjects’ care when subjects were on methylphenidate, and worsening in these areas if
the methylphenidate was weaned or stopped [31]. Despite retrospective reviews being
subject to numerous biases, the results indicate that methylphenidate has the potential to
improve post-TBI attention deficits.
The final drug intervention study is a level II-2 study by Zavadenko and Guzilova on the
effects of piracetam on cognitive functioning. Children with TBI received piracetam while a
control group of children with TBI received no drug. Two or 3 patients in each group were
also receiving acetazolamide as part of their treatment but this was not factored into
analysis. Outcome measures specific to attention were the correction test (Bourdon-Vos) for
directed attention and Stroop test for distributed attention. The authors found significant
improvements for both measures of attention in both the number of errors and the time it
took to take the test for the piracetam treatment group [32]. The study also found that the
piracetam treatment group had significant improvements in motor function and coordination
[32]. There were no other studies identified examining the effects of piracetam on attention
after TBI in children or adults, so more investigation is required before piracetam could be
integrated into treatment protocols for attention deficits. However, the study indicates that
piracetam is potentially useful for treatment of attention and other executive function
deficits after TBI, especially in the context of corresponding motor or coordination deficits.
Cognitive Therapy/Attentional Training
Galbiati, et al. performed a level II-1 controlled study of intensive attention specific training
in 65 children post-severe TBI [33]. The training was composed of tasks that targeted

different areas of attention, and tasks that stimulated meta-attention. The Continuous
Performance Test IT (CPT IT) was used to measure attention at baseline, upon completion of
training, and one year after training. Subscores used for the CPT II were omission,
commission, hit reaction time (RT), standard error of RT, hit RT across interstimulus
intervals (ISD, hit RTxblock (measuring change of RTs across cues), risk taking, and overall
index (whether or not an attention deficit is present). There were significant improvements
in attention measures within the control group from baseline, but scores remained in the
pathological range so these improvements were attributed to natural recovery after TBI. The
treatment group had significant in-group gains in attention as well as significantly higher
scores than the control group. At follow-up testing, IQ and attention scores for the treatment
group improved into the low-normal range. The experimental group maintained their gains
at the one year follow up with between group analysis showing the experimental group
scoring significantly higher than controls in all CPT II subtests except for Hit RT and Hit
RT ISI [33].
Thomas-Stonell, et al. performed a level I study that used the TEACHwareTM program to
train various aspects of cognition. The TEACHwareTM program was designed to train 5
different skill areas: attention, memory and word retrieval, comprehension of abstract
language, organization and reasoning/problem solving [34]. Significant within and between
group improvements were limited primarily to tests examining word retrieval and problem
solving/reasoning and no significant improvements were seen on the attention test, the Paced
Auditory Serial Addition Task (PASAT)[34].
In a level III case series Catroppa, et al. used an executive functioning training program in
three individuals [35]. The training consisted of 6 sessions, with each session focusing on
different areas of executive functioning, including an attention-specific session. Attention
specific testing for this study was the Number-Letter Trails test which measures divided
attention. There was no significant change for any of the individuals in the test of attention
from pre- to post-intervention[35]. Similarly to the Thomas-Stonell, et al. study, these
results suggest that attention needs to be trained separately rather than part of a broader
executive function intervention. However, these studies were limited by their relatively
small sample sizes.
The final two studies, while not intervention studies in the traditional sense, examined
aspects of cognition that could be used to shape cognitive therapy for children with S-
ADHD. Sinopoli, et al. and Konrad, et al. both examined the effects of reward on attention
in children with TBI [36, 37]. Sinopoli, et al. compared Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT)
and percent inhibition in children with P-ADHD, S-ADHD, children with TBI, but without
S-ADHD, and healthy controls [36]. Children in the P-PADHD group showed the most
impaired inhibitory control, while children with S-ADHD fell between the other groups. The
S-ADHD group did not differ significantly from either the controls or the P-ADHD group,
indicating some impairment, though not to the same degree as P-ADHD. Only one subject in
the S-ADHD group had sustained a severe TBI; therefore, the S-ADHD group may not be
representative [36]. Konrad et al. compared response to reward in healthy controls, children
with P-ADHD, and children with TBI (with S-ADHD and without S-ADHD in the same
group) [37]. They found that while the SSRT improved during the reward condition for all

groups, the TBI group did not improve to the same degree as the P-ADHD group. Similar to
the Sinopoli, et al. study, this study indicates that treatments for P-ADHD may be translated
to the TBI population to some extent, but will likely need modification [37]. Although more
research is needed to determine the exact effects of reward in children with S-ADHD and
how this can be translated to therapy, a well-defined reward/consequence system is already a
part of treatment for children with P-ADHD [38, 39]. Because children with S-ADHD have
similar defects in response inhibition and similar responses to reward as children with P-
ADHD, integrating reward/consequence systems into the treatment of S-ADHD may be
beneficial. However, confirmatory studies are needed.
Injury
Ho, et al. performed a level II-2 study that used diaries and self-instructional training in 15
children with mild, moderate, or severe ABI (9/15 subjects had TBI). Although the training
focus and primary outcome measure in this study was memory, significant secondary gains
were made on the Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEAch) compared to pre-
treatment scores [40].
Two of the identified studies used the Amsterdam Memory and Attention Training for
Children (AMAT-C) as their treatment intervention. This training program is given over
several weeks. A different skill is worked on each week and tasks increase in difficulty over
time. The program focuses primarily on attention and memory training, but also includes
training for other skills (e.g. behavior modification). Sj6 et al. performed a level II-2
prospective cohort study in 7 children (3/7 subjects had TBI) where they measured
neuropsychological aspects before and after 18-20 weeks of AMAT-C intervention [41].
After training, scores for the Test of Everyday Attention in Children (TEAch) showed
significant improvement in one of 11 subtests: however, the majority of improvements were
on tests of learning and memory [41].
Van’t Hooft, et al. used a level I randomized, controlled study with 17 weeks of AMAT-C
intervention in 38 children (21/38 subjects had TBI). Attention tests used were the Visual
and Auditory Reaction Time Test, Vigilance Test of the Gordon Diagnostic System, Stroop
Test, Binary Choice test, Coding test, and Trail Making Test (TMT). Immediately following
the treatment intervention there weresignificant increases for the treatment group compared
to controls in sustained attention (Gordon Diagnostic System) and selective attention (TMT,
Binary Choice Reaction Time Test, Stroop test 1, and coding test) [42]. At six-month
follow-up the gains made by the treatment group remained intact, with the treatment group
scoring significantly higher in sustained attention (Gordon Diagnostic Test) and selective
attention (Binary Choice Reaction Time Test). Significant improvements were also noted 6
months after treatment completion within the intervention group in selective attention
(Stroop 1 and Coding test) [43]. The results of these two studies are conflicting. The $j6, et
al. study indicates that AMAT-C training is more beneficial for learning and memory skills
while the Van’t Hooft, et al. studies show that AMAT-C improves attention skills as well as
memory. These inconsistencies may be secondary to the differing methodologies, sample
sizes, and heterogeneity of brain injury etiologies of the groups.

De Kloet, et al. performed a Level I-2 study that looked at the use of video games in
recovery from ABI [44]. After 12 weeks of individualized therapy in 45 subjects (22/45
subjects had TBI) using the Nintendo Wii, subjects saw significant improvement in a
number of areas, including attention as measured by Baseline Speed and the Shifting
Attentional Set — Visual[44]. Although the lack of a control group makes it difficult to
determine the effects of the training versus natural recovery after injury, this study shows
that video game therapy has the potential to be a useful treatment for a variety of sequelae
after ABI.
Discussion
Despite the high prevalence of attention problems in children after TBI, there is a paucity of
studies evaluating treatments for attention problems in this population. The current literature
demonstrates that both pharmacologic and attention specific therapy have promise for
management of attention problems after TBI in children. The influence of injury severity,
characteristics of attention problems after injury, pre-injury history of attention problems
and individual factors like age, gender, and genetics on the efficacy of interventions is
unclear. A lack of common outcome measures across studies and measures that evaluate
daily function make it difficult to determine broader effectiveness. Larger, prospective
studies are needed to develop individualized evidence-based recommendations.
Methylphenidate is used as a first-line treatment of P-ADHD. I and our review indicated that
methylphenidate may be effective for attention problems in children after TBI.. The
discrepancies between the two prospective methylphenidate studies described above could
be due to different dosing and treatment times. More studies are needed to determine its
effectiveness for management of attention problems after pediatric TBI. The potential
benefit of other stimulant and non-stimulant medications used for management of P-PADHD
should also be evaluated in children with attention problems after TBI. While it was an
isolated study, the evidence in the piracetam trial indicates that other classes of medications
may be beneficial.
In terms of cognitive training, it appears that a variety of methods have the potential to
improve attention problems after TBI. The best regimen is intensive attentional training as
demonstrated in the Galbiati study. When multiple cognitive domains are targeted at the
same time, attention shows minimal to no improvement. However, memory appears to be
closely linked to attention, and training programs designed to improve memory in this
population have led to gains in attention scores as well. Once the training program extends
beyond attention and/or memory, its efficacy appears to decrease.
Of the four studies that had ABI populations, three demonstrated improvement in attention
scores with the various interventions. Since these studies showed similar benefits to the TBI
studies, results may be generalized to both ABI and TBI. The ABI and TBI outcomes were
not evaluated separately; therefore, we are unable to determine if there were differential
effects.

There are a number of limitations common among the studies that prevent drawing
definitive conclusions about optimal treatment methods. One of the primary limitations is
small sample size. Larger, multi-center studies are needed to inform the development of
evidence-based treatment protocols. Another limitation is the heterogeneity of subject
populations in terms of injury type and severity. Children with non-traumatic acquired brain
injury also suffer from attention problems; however, they have different mechanisms of
injury that likely affect their outcome and response to treatments. Most studies also include
children with TBI of varying severities. Increasing severity of TBI is correlated with higher
incidence of attention problems post-injury, so children with severe TBI might need more
intensive or long-term treatment than children with mild TBI. It was not possible to
differentiate the effects of treatments in children with a severe versus mild injuries from
these studies. Future studies need to analyze for differential effects by injury severity. Most
of the studies have different treatment interventions and outcomes, making it difficult to
compare efficacy among them. Collaborative multicenter studies are needed to further
elucidate the optimal treatment of attention problems in children and adolescents after TBI.
There is also a need for more randomized, controlled, trials for both pharmacological and
attention training interventions. Though it is difficult to blind subjects to treatment in
attentional training studies, Couillet, et al. avoided this issue by using a cognitive training
that did not target attention as a control condition, and referred to it with the subjects as an
old versus new treatment method [45]. Another factor that should be considered when
designing treatment plans is ADHD subtype [46]. In P-ADHD, there is debate in the
literature as to the effect subtype (inattentive versus combined or hyperactive) has on
treatment response [47-52]. The subtype of attention problems that develop after pediatric
TBI may also influence treatment response and needs to be evaluated in future studies.
Additionally, pre-injury diagnosis of ADHD was not assessed in the studies reviewed and
may influence treatment response. About half of the studies used P-ADHD or other
psychiatric disorders as an exclusion criterion while the others did not mention it explicitly.
It is critical that future studies evaluate the influence of subtype and pre-injury ADHD
diagnosis in the context of S-ADHD on treatment response.
The extent to which cognitive outcomes used in these studies can be applied to real world
functioning is unclear. While various neuropsychological tests make good, objective
measurements for research, they may not be the best predictors of daily functioning. Future
studies should include ratings of behavior, attention, and executive function in typical
settings, including the school, home, and community to get a complete picture of the effects
of an intervention on TBI rehabilitation [53].
Combined behavioral and medication treatment have been explored for management of P-
ADHD and evidence suggests that combining behavioral and medication management may
be more beneficial [54]. To date, studies evaluating combined pharmacologic and attention
training interventions in children with attention problems after TBI have not been
performed. Since the studies examined in this review provide some promising results for the
efficacy of each kind of intervention individually, studies of combined behavioral and
medication treatments should be considered in the future.

Limitations
In the last decade, pharmacogenomics has been a growing field and is beginning to be
applied to the treatment of PPADHD [55-57]. Catecholaminergic-related genes are of
particular interest because their end products are influenced by stimulant medications
commonly used for management of P-ADHD and they are integral to the modulation of
memory, attention, and executive function after TBI [58-60]. These systems are also
susceptible to injury and altered regulation after TBI[59, 61, 62] and are associated with
neural recovery[62, 63]. Investigation of the influence of these genes on treatment response
for attention problems after TBI should be considered in the future.
The review was restricted to the last 20 years, omitting relevant articles that were published
before 1993. Limiting the search to articles in English also excludes potentially relevant
articles that were published in other languages. Restricting the review to articles published
in peer-reviewed journals may have subjected our findings to publication bias. Additionally,
the heterogeneity of the study populations and wide variety of outcome measures used
across studies, make it difficult to make definitive management recommendations.
Conclusion
Traumatic brain injury is among the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in
children. Development or worsening of attention problems occurs in close to half of children
after significant TBI; however, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the benefit of
pharmacologic or cognitive/behavioral interventions for attention problems after TBI in
children [8, 9]. Overall, the findings are mixed. Methylphenidate is recommended as a first-
line treatment for P-ADHD and demonstrates benefits in S-ADHD. Cognitive training
appears to be beneficial when targeting attention or attention and memory specifically rather
than mixing with other behavioral or cognitive interventions. Larger multi-center studies are
needed to determine which interventions or combinations of interventions are most likely to
improve S-ADHD. Additionally, future research should evaluate factors that may influence
treatment response, ultimately leading to targeted individualized management.
