BDNF and schizophrenia: from neurodevelopment to
neuronal plasticity, learning, and memory
j
t
Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin that has been related not only
to neurodevelopment and neuroprotection, but also to synapse regulation, learning, and
memory. Research focused on the neurobiology of schizophrenia has emphasized the rel-
evance of neurodevelopmental and neurotoxicity-related elements in the pathogenesis
of this disease. Research focused on the clinical features of schizophrenia in the past
decades has emphasized the relevance of cognitive deﬁcits of this illness, considered a
core manifestation and an important predictor for functional outcome. Variations in neu-
rotrophins such as BDNF may have a role as part of the molecular mechanisms underlying
these processes, from the neurodevelopmental alterations to the molecular mechanisms
of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients.

INTRODUCTION
The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the most widely
distributed neurotrophin in the brain, and it has been asso-
ciated with several psychiatric disorders. Evidence increasingly
suggests that schizophrenia is a subtle disorder of brain devel-
opment and plasticity. Considering the role BDNF in neurode-
velopment, synapse regulation, and synaptic plasticity, it has been
proposed as a candidate to explain part of the pathogenesis of this
disease.
Alterations in neurotrophic factors such as BDNF at the pro-
tein and gene level may contribute to altered brain develop-
ment, synaptic disconnectivity, and failures in neuroplasticity, and
explain at least in part some of the morphological and neu-
rochemical abnormalities found in the brains of patients with
schizophrenia.
This article reviews different elements that provide evidence
that BDNF may play a role in pathogenesis of schizophrenia, but
also reviews the evidence suggesting that it may play a role in
the pathophysiology of cognitive deﬁcits, which can be considered
core symptoms of this disease.
BDNF ROLE AS A NEUROTROPHIN
NEUROTROPHINS IN NEURODEVELOPMENT AND NEUROPROTECTION
Duringthedevelopmentof thecentralnervoussystem,neuralcon-
nections are established and redeﬁned through a series of devel-
opment programs involving speciﬁcation of axons and dendrites,
growth processes,innervation of target cells,cell death,and synap-
togenesis. Many of these developmental processes are regulated by
proteins derived from the target cells, which signal in a retro-
grade manner through long distances from the distal axons to the
neuronal bodies. Neurons depend for their survival on these inter-
actions with target cells, which release speciﬁc proteins that play
a crucial role in these interactions (Leibrock et al., 1989; Zweifel
et al., 2005). These speciﬁc proteins are called neurotrophins, a
family of proteins that include the brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF).
TheﬁrstneurotrophintobediscoveredwasNGF,about50 years
ago. Several studies demonstrated its involvement in the regula-
tion of neuronal death, both in response to subsequent damage
to the nervous system as well as during development (Perez-Polo
et al., 1990). The dependence of many neurons on their target cells
for normal development and the restricted neuronal speciﬁcity of
NGF (mainly peripheral nervous system), suggested the existence
of other neurotrophic factors.
The structure of BDNF was reported in 1990, a neurotrophin
that promotes the survival of neuronal populations located in the
central nervous system, or neuronal populations directly con-
nected to it (Barde, 1990). In the following years other neu-
rotrophins with similar functions were identiﬁed, such as NT-3
(Hohn et al., 1990; Maisonpierre et al., 1990) and NT-6 (Gotz
et al., 1994).
Neurotrophins are all small, basic, secretory proteins that allow
the survival of speciﬁc neuronal populations. In its biologically
active forms together show about 50% amino acid identity. The
genes encoding neurotrophins are expressed not only during
development but also in the adult, in a variety of tissues including
the central nervous system.
Each neurotrophin can signal through two different cell surface
receptors: the Trk tyrosine kinase receptor and the p75 neu-
rotrophin receptor. Each Trk receptor is preferentially activated by
one or more neurotrophin: TrkA by NGF,TrkB by BDNF,and TrkC
by NT-3. Although the long-term trophic effects of neurotrophins
depend on gene regulation, the cytoplasmic effectors activated
by neurotrophins also exert a wide range of more rapid actions,

BDNF and schizophrenia: neurodevelopment, neurocognition
including morphogenetic and chemotropic effects on developing
neurons, and modulation of neuronal excitability and synaptic
transmission (Poo, 2001; Chao, 2003).
BDNF AS SYNAPTIC MODULATOR
Once the role of the neurotrophins as regulatory factors of neu-
ronal survival and differentiation was properly described, new
evidence indicated that they also acted as synaptic modulators.
Synaptic activity regulates the synthesis, secretion, and action of
neurotrophins. These, in turn, induce changes in the morphol-
ogy and synaptic efﬁcacy. Thus, the neurotrophins are involved in
activity-dependent synaptic plasticity,and with long-term changes
in the synaptic connections at a structural and a functional level
(Poo, 2001).
Neurotrophins seem to be necessary for the maintenance of
functional synapses, because their removal produces a reduction
in synaptic connectivity between cultured neurons. In the cen-
tral nervous system neurons, BDNF can increase the number
of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, regulating axonal mor-
phology, or directly promoting synapse formation. Additionally,
BDNF promote the maturation and stabilization of the cellular
and molecular components of neurotransmitters release, and this
subsequently leads to an increase in the number of functional
synapses. Therefore, neurotrophins regulate synapse maturation
at the morphological,molecular,and functional levels. This role of
BDNF in synapses is crucial not only during development but also
for synaptic plasticity in the adult (Vicario-Abejón et al., 2002).
In addition to their classic effects on neuronal cell survival,
neurotrophins can also regulate axonal and dendritic growth
and guidance,synaptic structure and connections,neurotransmit-
ter release, long-term potentiation, and synaptic plasticity. Neu-
rotrophin receptors may act as a point of convergence that might
be involved in the integration of many environmental inputs. This
can lead to alterations in neuronal circuitry and, ultimately, in
behavior. Neurotrophins can produce long-term changes in the
functionality of adult neurons through changes in transcription
(Chao, 2003).
Activity-dependent synaptic plasticity models, whether in the
context of development or in the context of learning and memory,
have long postulated the existence of extracellular signaling mol-
ecules which reinforce and stabilize the active synapses. The work
of many laboratories has shown that neurotrophins such as BDNF
met the two major criteria to be considered a mediator of this type:
the production is regulated by neural activity, and neurotrophic
factors themselves have potent effects on signaling properties of
target neurons (Lo, 1995).
BDNF IN NEURONAL PLASTICITY, LEARNING, AND MEMORY
In relation to the cellular and molecular biology underlying cogni-
tive functioning,several studies support the conclusion that BDNF
plays a key role, given its participation in the processes of synaptic
plasticity and learning. An increased expression of BDNF can have
a positive effect on the generation of LTP and memory (Lee and
Silva, 2009).
The role of BDNF in learning and memory was ﬁrst demon-
strated in studies at the cellular and molecular level. It has been
shown that BDNF secretion is required for long-term potentiation
(LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), which are the cellular
mechanisms underlying learning and memory (Poo, 2001; Aicardi
et al., 2004). In relation to long-term memory, is noteworthy that
BDNF is sufﬁcient to induce the transformation of early phase
LTP to late phase LTP, even in the presence of protein synthesis
inhibitors (Lu et al., 2005).
In animal models, the role of BDNF in cognition has also been
shown in studies with BDNF mutant mice that show learning
deﬁcits and hippocampal-dependent altered pattern discrimina-
tion (Korte et al., 1996; Gorski et al., 2003). Inhibition of the
signaling of BDNF also alters long-term memory in animal models
(Lu et al., 2005).
NEUROBIOLOGY OF SCHIZOPHRENIA (RELEVANT TO
NEUROTROPHIC FACTORS)
SCHIZOPHRENIA: ROLE OF NEURODEVELOPMENT AND
NEURODEGENERATION
Primary alterations in the activity of neurotrophins could lead to
inappropriate alterations in cortical circuitry and synaptic trans-
mission in the developing brain, which could then translate into
the neural dysfunction underlying psychiatric disorders such as
schizophrenia (Favalli et al., 2012).
Evidence increasingly suggests that schizophrenia is a subtle
disorder of brain development (Ross et al., 2006). Considering the
neurodevelopmental hypothesis about schizophrenia, BDNF has
been proposed as a candidate to explain part of the pathogenesis
of this disease.
An inadequate neurotrophic support during brain develop-
ment could lead to a structural disorganization of networks in
which neural connections are established in a sub-optimal man-
ner.Therefore,alterationsinBDNFmaycontributetoalteredbrain
development, failures in neuroplasticity, and synaptic disconnec-
tivity, and explain at least in part some of the morphological,
neurochemical, and cytoarchitectonic abnormalities found in the
brains of patients with schizophrenia (Durany and Thome, 2004;
Shoval and Weizman, 2005; Buckley et al., 2007a).
Subsequently, an inadequate neurotrophic support in the adult
may be an underlying mechanism for a reduced brain’s ability to
make adaptive changes and increased vulnerability to neurotoxic
damage (Angelucci et al., 2005).
Long duration of untreated psychosis has been associated
with poorer prognosis in patients with schizophrenia. Such a
relationship of untreated psychosis to outcome may indicate a
neurodegenerative process and may have important implications
for understanding the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Rizos
et al. (2010) ﬁndings indicate that low serum BDNF levels at
the onset of schizophrenia were associated with a long dura-
tion of untreated psychosis, and this could be related to an
acute neurodegenerative reaction during the untreated phase of
psychosis.
Ho et al. (2007) studied the relation between BDNF val66met
polymorphism and progressive brain volume changes in schiz-
ophrenia. Signiﬁcant genotype effects were observed on within-
subject changes in volumes of frontal lobe gray matter, lateral
ventricles, and sulcal CSF. Met allele carriers had signiﬁcantly
greater reductions in frontal gray matter volume, with recip-
rocal volume increases in the lateral ventricles and sulcal CSF

than Val homozygous patients. Therefore, BDNF variants may be
among several factors affecting progressive brain volume changes
in schizophrenia.
SYNAPSE DEREGULATION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA
Over the last decades, convergent ﬁndings from various areas of
investigation have suggested that alterations of synaptic trans-
mission and neuronal connectivity might be the core feature of
schizophrenia (Frankle et al., 2003). There is evidence for altered
neurotransmission at glutamatergic, GABAergic, dopaminergic,
cholinergic, and possibly serotonergic synapses in schizophrenia.
Susceptibility genes that have a role in neural development and
in synaptic plasticity may contribute to pathogenic mechanisms
of schizophrenia in these synaptic pathways (Ross et al., 2006;
Keshavan et al., 2008; Yin et al., 2012).
Considering BDNF functions described above, it is reasonable
to think that an abnormal BDNF signaling can inﬂuence neu-
ronaldifferentiationandsynapticfunction,leadingtoalteredbrain
functioning in the synaptic systems implicated in schizophrenia
(Palomino et al., 2006). Actually, BDNF has a proven role in neu-
ronal survival and plasticity of dopaminergic neurons, cholinergic
and serotonergic neurons, and all of these are pathways involved
in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (Angelucci et al., 2005;
Buckley et al., 2007a).
Although the neurochemical origins of schizophrenia do not
necessarily lie in dopamine dysregulation, this operates as the ﬁnal
common pathway underlying positive psychotic symptoms and
may also play a role in negative and cognitive symptoms. In a
plausible model schizophrenia can be seen as the consequence
of the actions of a number of component causes, such as genes or
early environmental hazards that subtly alter subsequent neurode-
velopment, thereby predisposing the subject to later dopamine
dysregulation (Di Forti et al., 2007).
Antipsychoticdrugsactbyblockingthedopaminetransmission
at the dopamine D2-like receptors. BDNF controls the expression
of one of these D2-like receptors, the dopamine D3 receptor. This
raises the hypothesis of a link between cortical area, via BDNF,
and the dopamine neurotransmission pathway in schizophrenia
and its treatment (Guillin et al., 2007).
The neurodevelopmental hypothesis and the dopamine
hypothesis theories are beginning to be integrated through
the growing evidence that all the developmental risk factors
which increase risk of schizophrenia appear to act by facilitating
dopamine dysregulation (Murray et al., 2008).
Early models for the etiology of schizophrenia focused on
dopamine neurotransmission because of the powerful antipsy-
chotic action of dopamine antagonists. Nevertheless, recent evi-
dence increasingly supports a primarily glutamatergic dysfunction
in this condition, where dopaminergic disbalance is a secondary
effect. A current model for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia
involves a dysfunctional mechanism by which a NMDA recep-
tor hypofunction leads to a dysregulation of GABA fast-spiking
interneurons,consequently disinhibiting pyramidal glutamatergic
output, and disturbing the signal-to-noise ratio. This mechanism
might explain better than other models some cognitive deﬁcits
observed in this disease, as well as the dopaminergic alterations
and therapeutic effect of antipsychotics (Gaspar et al., 2009).
In patients with schizophrenia, a deﬁciency in BDNF signaling
mediated by the receptor TrkB may result in a reduction of the syn-
thesis of GABA in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This can lead
to an alteration in perisomatic inhibition of pyramidal neurons,
contributing to a decreased capacity for frequency synchronized
gamma neuronal activity, which is required for working memory
(Lewis et al., 2005).
COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA
t

t
Cognitive deﬁcits are a core manifestation of schizophrenia, and
cognitive dysfunction has been identiﬁed as a major determinant
of the long-term quality of life. The difﬁculties of patients with
schizophrenia to live independently and to gain a competitive
employment is largely due to cognitive dysfunction. Cognitive
impairment has emerged as an important new target in schizo-
phrenia therapeutics in light of evidence that cognitive deﬁcits are
critically related to the functional of disability that is characteristic
of the illness (Sharma, 2003; Gold, 2004).
The level and pattern of cognitive deﬁcits in schizophrenia
has been documented using comprehensive neuropsychological
batteries in dozens of studies over the past decades. There is a
characteristic pattern of cognitive deﬁcits that occur with very high
frequency, the deﬁcits are relatively stable over time, and cognitive
deﬁcits are relatively independent of the symptomatic manifesta-
tions of the illness. Thus, cognitive impairment appears to be a
well-deﬁned, reliable, and distinct dimension of the illness (Gold,
2004).
Virtually all areas of cognition in schizophrenia are altered to
some degree. Measurements of working memory, episodic mem-
ory, and ideational ﬂuency complex care issues seem to be most
affected by the disease. The measures of semantic knowledge and
visuoperceptual skills seem to be the least impacted. Cognitive
deﬁcits are present in other types of psychotic disorders, but are
more severe and widespread in schizophrenia (Zanelli et al.,2010).
In one of the ﬁrst cross-sectional studies that characterized
this deﬁcit, Bilder et al. (2000) conducted an extensive battery of
neuropsychological assessments to 94 patients with ﬁrst-episode
schizophrenia after initial management of their clinical psychotic
and a control group of 36 healthy volunteers. Patients showed a
large generalized neuropsychological deﬁcit (1.5 standard devi-
ations compared to healthy volunteers). Additionally, this gen-
eralized deﬁcit patients had subtle relative deﬁcits (less than 0.5
standard deviations compared to their own average proﬁle) in
assessments of memory and executive functions. The learning
and memory dysfunction was the best distinguished patients from
healthy individuals followed by motor deﬁcits. Patients with bet-
ter neurocognitive performance had only memory deﬁcits, while
patients with lower cognitive performance were affected in both
memory deﬁcits and executive functions. Deﬁcits in executive
functions and attention were most related to difﬁculties in global
functioning and worse prognosis (Bilder et al., 2000).
According to Sponheim et al. (2010), research has only recently
begun to determine when cognitive dysfunction develops in indi-
viduals with schizophrenia. The available evidence provides evi-
dence to support the existence of signiﬁcant cognitive deﬁcits prior
to disease onset, but there is less information about the course of

Nieto et al.
BDNF and schizophrenia: neurodevelopment, neurocognition
cognitive dysfunction from the onset and the chronic phase of
schizophrenia. Although longitudinal studies would be optimal
to determine the stability of cognitive deﬁcits, treatment effects
are often confounding factors and there is no studies based on
large and representative samples of patients who have been fol-
lowed for a long time. These authors evaluated the cross-sectional
41 patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and 106 patients with
chronic schizophrenia, suggesting that some measures of prob-
lem solving and ﬁne motor skills could decrease chronic patients
beyond what would be expected as a result of aging. However,
the ﬁndings indicate that the cognitive impairment is similar
in patients with recent-onset schizophrenia and in patients with
chronic schizophrenia.
Jahshan et al. (2010) followed in a period of 6 months 48
patients considered at risk of developing schizophrenia and 20
patients in their ﬁrst episode of this disease. At-risk patients
showed an improvement in the overall assessment of intelligence.
In contrast, patients after a ﬁrst-episode showed improved verbal
learning but a deterioration in the working memory and process-
ing speed. According to the authors, these inconsistent trajectories
suggest that some cognitive domains may beneﬁt from stabiliza-
tion in the early phases of clinical psychotic, while others may
worsen with disease progression.
Despite the central role of the cognitive manifestations of schiz-
ophrenia, it is important to note that there are some schizophrenic
patients who have a standard neuropsychological performance.
Estimatesof thenumber of patients withthis diagnosisshowingno
alteration in neurocognitive tests varies considerably between dif-
ferent studies, but it has been estimated that in the range between
16 and 45% of patients with schizophrenia (Reichenberg et al.,
2009).
Social cognition is described as the higher mental processes that
are engaged while people store,process,and use social information
to make sense of themselves and others.Aspects of social cognition
include emotion perception, social cue interpretation, attribution
style,and theory of mind,all of which appear disordered in schizo-
phrenia (Kucharska-Pietura and Mortimer, 2013). According to a
recent meta-analysis by Savla et al. (2012), the evidence for deﬁcits
across multiple social cognitive domains (theory of mind, social
perception, social knowledge, attributional bias, emotion percep-
tion, and emotion processing) in schizophrenia is clear. Emotion
identiﬁcation deﬁcits are associated with functional impairments
in schizophrenia (Irani et al., 2012).
One of the limitations of studies evaluating neurocognitive
function in patients with schizophrenia is the wide variety of
tests used. Some initiatives to determine consensus batteries to
evaluate cognition have been developed in recent years, such as
CNTRICS and MATRICS. The CNTRICS initiative aims to sys-
tematically address barriers to translating paradigms developed
in the basic neuroscience ﬁeld for use in translational research
(Carter et al., 2008). To support the development of pharmaco-
logical agents to improve neurocognitive deﬁcits of schizophrenia,
NIMH launched an initiative called“Measurement and Treatment
Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia”(MATRICS). As
a result this initiative developed a consensus neurocognitive bat-
tery for use in clinical trials to study the pharmacological effects
on neurocognition (Green and Nuechterlein, 2004).
t
f
While such initiatives developed a consensus on the core cognitive
deﬁcits of schizophrenic patients and recommended a standard-
ized test battery to evaluate them, more recently work has begun
to identify speciﬁc rodent behavioral tasks with translational rel-
evance to speciﬁc cognitive domains affected in schizophrenia.
Developing reliable, predictive animal models for complex psychi-
atric disorders, such as schizophrenia, is essential to increase our
understanding of the neurobiological basis of the disorder and
for the development of novel drugs with improved therapeutic
efﬁcacy (Jones et al., 2011).
All available animal models of schizophrenia ﬁt into four dif-
ferent induction categories: developmental, drug-induced, lesion,
or genetic manipulation. Most rodent models have behavioral
phenotype changes that resemble “positive-like” symptoms of
schizophrenia, probably reﬂecting altered mesolimbic dopamine
function, but fewer models also show altered social interaction,
and learning and memory impairment, analogous to negative,
and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia respectively (Jones et al.,
2011).
Considering drug-induced animal models of schizophrenia,
since phencyclidine (PCP) induces several symptoms in humans
similar to those seen in schizophrenia, it has been used to attempt
to produce a pharmacological rodent model of schizophrenia.
Morphological changes in PCP rats including decreased hip-
pocampal volume and neuronal number, and decreased synapto-
physin mRNA all support the suggestion of synaptic dysfunction
(Jones et al., 2011). Neonatal PCP also produces a sustained eleva-
tion in hippocampal and entorhinal BDNF in 8-week-old rats,
similar to clinical observations in the corticolimbic system of
patients with chronic schizophrenia (Takahashi et al., 2006).
In one of the developmental animal models of schizophrenia,
treatmentof pregnantratdamswithmethylazoxymethanolacetate
(MAM), an anti-mitotic and anti-proliferative agent that methy-
lates DNA) does not affect litter size or pup body weight, but
selectively affects brain development. The behavioral alterations
seen in MAM offspring vary according to the gestational day (GD)
of MAM administration in a sequential manner: at GD17 changes
similar as those seen in schizophrenia have been observed, with
impaired acquisition of learning at GD17 or later. The observation
of disorganization, sporadic density, and heterotopias within the
pyramidal CA3 region of the hippocampus with GD17 admin-
istration, which has also be observed in schizophrenia patients,
lends weight to the use of GD17 MAM exposure as a preclinical
model for schizophrenia (Jones et al., 2011). Interestingly, GD17
MAM offspring show reduced nerve growth factor (NGF) and
brain-derived nerve growth factor (BDNF) in the parietal cor-
tex at adulthood, but whether this is a cause or consequence of
the neurodevelopmental changes observed is unclear (Fiore et al.,
2004).
A model that simulates many of the cognitive and sensory
deﬁcits of the schizophrenia disorder is the use of random vari-
able prenatal stress (PS) in the rat. To study both hippocampal
gene expression changes in offspring of prenatally stressed dams
and to address genetic variability, Neeley et al. (2011a) used a
random array of prenatal stressors in three different rat strains
with diverse responses to stress: Fischer, Sprague–Dawley, and

Lewis rats. Expression of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus was
increased after an acute stress in all controls of each strain, yet a
decrease was seen after acute stress in the PS Sprague–Dawley and
Lewis rats. In both Sprague–Dawley and Lewis male rats, PS also
decreased the amount of available proBDNF and mature BDNF
protein in the hippocampus, and changed the activation of TrkB
and its downstream signaling cascade. This reduction in BDNF
the hippocampus can be related to the learning and memory
deﬁcits observed in these animal models. However, PS in the male
Fischer rats did not elicit these changes, suggesting that the Fis-
cher genetic background encodes a developmental environment
that is protective during prenatal stress. Differential processing of
BDNF after prenatal stress in the three rat strains has implica-
tions for human subjects, where genetic differences may protect
or exacerbate the effects of an environmental stressor during fetal
development (Neeley et al., 2011b).
Using mutant mice [TrkB-PV(−/−)] in which the gene for the
BDNF receptor, tyrosine kinase B receptor (trkB), has been specif-
ically deleted in parvalbumin-expressing, fast-spiking GABAergic
(PV+) interneurons, Zheng et al. (2011) showed that TrkB is
structurally and functionally important for the integrity of the
hippocampal network. The amplitude of glutamatergic inputs to
PV+ interneurons and the frequency of GABAergic inputs to exci-
tatory pyramidal cells were reduced in the TrkB-PV(−/−) mice.
Functionally, rhythmic network activity in the gamma-frequency
band (30–80 Hz) was signiﬁcantly decreased in hippocampal area
CA1. This decrease was caused by a desynchronization and over-
all reduction in frequency of action potentials generated in PV+
interneurons of TrkB-PV(−/−) mice. These results show that the
integration of PV+ interneurons into the hippocampal microcir-
cuit is impaired in TrkB-PV(−/−) mice, resulting in decreased
rhythmic network activity in the gamma-frequency band. These
ﬁndings highlight the role of BDNF and its receptor in a cru-
cial aspect of the neuronal circuitry of schizophrenia that is
particularly related to alterations in cognitive functioning.
BDNF GENETIC VARIATIONS
BDNF POLYMORPHISMS AND SCHIZOPHRENIA
Several studies have looked for association of this gene and
schizophrenia, with different results. One of the ﬁrst authors
to report an association between functional polymorphisms of
BDNF (Val66Met and C-207T) and schizophrenia were Kunugi
et al. (2004) and Hong et al. (2003), in different populations of
Asian origin. However, other studies did not ﬁnd this association,
including studies in similar populations (Chen et al.,2006; Tochigi
et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007). At least two meta-analyzes have ruled
out this association in Asian populations, such as the study of
Naoe et al. (2007) and a publication by Kawashima et al. (2009),
that included results of Japanese population and a meta-analysis
with other studies from Asian populations.
In Caucasian population, some of the positive results that can
be mentioned include the study of Szekeres et al. (2003) for C-
207T and study Skibinska et al. (2004) for Val66Met. However, in
this population some studies have also failed in their attempt to
prove an association for both Val66Met (Golimbert et al., 2008)
and for C-270T (Galderisi et al., 2005), (Szczepankiewicz et al.,
2005).
Jonsson et al. (2006) conducted a study in Swedish population
and found no signiﬁcant difference between cases and controls
for different BDNF polymorphisms. However, they analyzed their
data in combination with results from other studies and conducted
a meta-analysis,inwhich theyfound thatboth the Talleleof BDNF
270 and the homozygous state for Val66Met are associated with
the presence of schizophrenia. This meta-analysis selected mainly
studies in Caucasian population, including U.S. subjects (Egan
et al., 2003), Finland (Anttila et al., 2004), Poland (Skibinska et al.,
2004), Scotland (Neves-Pereira et al., 2002), the Netherlands (de
Krom et al.,2005),Germany (Schumacher et al.,2005),and France
(Gourion et al., 2005).
Ingeneral,itisthoughtthatsomevariantsof thepolymorphism
may lead to memory impairment and susceptibility to neuropsy-
chiatric disorders (Bath and Lee, 2006). A 2007 meta-analysis of
case-control studies found a relationship between BDNFVal66Met
SNP and substance-related disorders, eating disorders, and schiz-
ophrenia (Gratacos et al., 2011). However, another 2007 meta-
analysis could not ﬁnd any association between this SNP and
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (Kanazawa et al., 2007).
Schizotypal personality traits have been associated with schizo-
phrenia in several studies. Regarding BDNF and schizotypal traits,
Ma et al. (2007) found a weak association between Val66Met
and measurement of schizotypal personality questionnaire (SPQ).
However, Tochigi et al. (2006) found no signiﬁcant association.
The pharmacogenetic relationship between the BDNF gene and
response to antipsychotic treatment with risperidone has been
studied by Xu et al. (2010). Individual and combinatorial genetic
variants in the BDNF gene might have a role in the therapeutic
response to risperidone in the Han Chinese population.
There is a relationship between genetic variations of BDNF
gene, such as Val66Met polymorphism, and BDNF serum lev-
els. Ozan et al. (2010) demonstrated that met allele carriers are
associated with lower levels of serum BDNF (23.08 vs. 26.87,
P ≤0.002).
BDNF POLYMORPHISMS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION
In the adult human brain, the site of higher expression of BDNF is
the hippocampal formation (Barde,1990). Studies on human sub-
jects indicate that BDNF genetic alterations, such as the Val66Met
SNP,arerelatedtodeﬁcitsincognitivefunctions,particularlyinthe
hippocampus-dependent memory (Egan et al., 2003; Dempster
et al., 2005).
HealthyvolunteerswhocarrytheMetallelehaveimpairedfMRI
hippocampal activity when performing a declarative memory task
(Hariri et al., 2003), and reduced gray matter volumes at hip-
pocampal and prefrontal levels (Pezawas et al., 2004; Szeszko et al.,
2005).
In a review of the molecular genetics of cognition, Savitz et al.
(2006) concluded that it is likely that val66met BDNF variant
exerts an effect on memory performance and executive function,
considering studies that have demonstrated that the met allele
is associated with both lower hippocampal volume or functional
activity and weaker performance on tests of memory and executive
function.
The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism has also been associ-
ated with emotion processing. Mukherjee et al. (2011), studied

the effect of genetic variation in the BDNF gene on a common
attribute such as fear processing. They used functional magnetic
resonance imaging to examine the effect of the BDNF Val66Met
genotype on neural activity for fear processing. Forty healthy par-
ticipants performed an implicit fear task during scanning, where
subjects made gender judgments from facial images with neutral
or fearful emotion. Subjects were tested for facial emotion recog-
nition post-scan. Functional connectivity was investigated using
psycho-physiological interactions. Subjects were genotyped for
the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and the measures compared
between genotype groups. Met carriers showed overactivation in
the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), brainstem, and insula bilater-
ally for fear processing,along with reduced functional connectivity
from the ACC to the left hippocampus, and impaired fear recog-
nition ability. According to the authors, these results show that
during fear processing,Met allele carriers show an increased neural
response in regions previously implicated in mediating autonomic
arousal. Further, the Met carriers showed decreased functional
connectivity with the hippocampus, which may reﬂect differential
retrieval of emotional associations. Together, these effects show
signiﬁcant differences in the neural substrate for fear processing
with genetic variation in BDNF.
Although limited by a small sample, a recent study by Outhred
et al. (2012) contributes novel and preliminary ﬁndings relating to
a functional epistasis of the 5-HTTLPR and BDNFVal66Met genes
in emotion processing, and provides guidance on appropriate
methods to determine genetic epistasis in fMRI.
BDNF POLYMORPHISMS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN
SCHIZOPHRENIA
Rybakowski et al. (2006) investigated the relationship between
Val66Met polymorphisms of the BDNF gene and prefrontal cog-
nitive function in 129 patients with schizophrenia. Cognitive tests
included the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), with such
domains as number of perseverative errors, non-perseverative
errors, completed corrected categories, conceptual level responses,
and set to the ﬁrst category, and the N-back test, where mean
reaction time and percent of correct reactions were measured.
No relationship between Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF
gene and the results of the WCST was observed, but patients with
Val/Val genotype had a higher percentage of correct reactions in
the N-back test than those with the remaining genotypes.
Morerecently,Luetal.(2012)foundthatschizophrenicpatients
with Met allele showed more percent WCST perseverative errors
than those without Met allele. After stratiﬁcation based on gen-
der, an association between the Met allele and a higher percentage
of perseverative errors was found in male patients, but not in
females. According to these authors, the effect of Val66Met poly-
morphism involvement in impaired executive function may have
gender-speciﬁc characteristics.
Zhang et al. (2012a) evaluated a group of schizophrenic inpa-
tients with the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsy-
chological status (RBANS),and assessed the presence of the BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism and serum BDNF levels. They found
an association between the BDNF Met variant and poor visu-
ospatial/constructional performance and attentional decrements
in schizophrenic patients. They also found that the association
between decreased BDNF serum levels and cognitive impair-
ment in schizophrenia is dependent on the BDNF Val66Met
polymorphism.
Eisenberg et al. (2013) studied 47 medication-free patients with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 74 healthy compar-
ison individuals with genotyping for the Val(66)Met SNP and
[(15)O]H(2)O positron emission tomography (PET) to measure
resting and working memory-related hippocampal regional cere-
bral blood ﬂow (rCBF). In patients, harboring a Met allele was
associated with signiﬁcantly less hippocampal rCBF. This ﬁnd-
ing was opposite to the genotype effect seen in healthy partici-
pants,resulting in a signiﬁcant diagnosis-by-genotype interaction.
Exploratory analyses of interregional resting rCBF covariation
revealed a speciﬁc and signiﬁcant diagnosis-by-genotype interac-
tion effect on hippocampal-prefrontal coupling. A diagnosis-by-
genotype interaction was also found for working memory-related
hippocampal rCBF change, which was uniquely attenuated in Met
allele-carrying patients. Thus, both task-independent and task-
dependent hippocampal neurophysiology accommodates a Met
allelic background differently in patients with schizophrenia than
in control subjects.
BDNF LEVELS IN THE BRAIN AND PERIPHERAL BLOOD
BDNF LEVELS AND SCHIZOPHRENIA
Some studies have focused in brain BDNF levels in postmortem
studies of schizophrenic patients. Durany et al. (2001) found a
signiﬁcant increase in BDNF concentrations in cortical areas and
a signiﬁcant decrease of this neurotrophin in hippocampus of
patients when compared to control. Takahashi et al. (2000) found
that levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were ele-
vatedspeciﬁcallyintheanteriorcingulatecortexandhippocampus
of schizophrenic patients,and that the expression of TrkB receptor
were reduced signiﬁcantly in the hippocampus or the prefrontal
cortex. Nevertheless, Weickert et al. (2003) detected a signiﬁcant
reduction in BDNF mRNA and protein in the DLPFC of patients
with schizophrenia compared to normal individuals.
These ﬁndings are important to lend further evidence for the
understanding of the neurotrophin hypothesis of schizophrenic
psychoses. However, this approach lack the possibility to have
a dynamic study of changes in BDNF levels in relation to the
schizophrenic process and its clinical evolution.
A valid approach for studying the role of BDNF in schizophre-
nia patients is the measurement of plasma or serum levels. BDNF’s
ability to cross the blood-brain barrier suggests that BDNF levels
measured in peripheral blood may reﬂect levels in the brain (Pan
et al., 1998). The relation between peripheral and brain BDNF has
been demonstrated by a recent study that showed parallel changes
in BDNF levels in plasma and CSF in patients with schizophrenia,
indicating that plasma BDNF levels reﬂect the brain changes in
BDNF levels (Pillai et al., 2010).
Reports of BDNF plasma levels in patients with chronic schiz-
ophrenia in comparison to control subjects have been somewhat
inconsistent. Despite most studies describe lower levels in patients
(Toyooka et al., 2002; Tan et al., 2005; Grillo et al., 2007), some
even found higher levels in patients(Jockers-Scherubl et al., 2004).
In studies with treatment-naive patients who had their ﬁrst psy-
chotic episode,Buckley et al. (2007b) found a signiﬁcant reduction

BDNF and schizophrenia: neurodevelopment, neurocognition
inplasmalevelsof BDNF (135 ± 21.77 pg/ml)comparedwith con-
trol subjects (290.5 ± 38.8 pg/ml). In a similar population, Rizos
et al. (2008) also found BDNF levels in serum signiﬁcantly lower
in patients with ﬁrst-episode schizophrenia (23.92 ± 5.99 ng/ml)
compared with control subjects (30, 0 ± 8.43). However, a pre-
vious study comparing the cross section of BDNF levels in
antipsychotic-naive patients, medicated patients, and control sub-
jects, with no differences between these groups (Shimizu et al.,
2003).
Chen da et al. (2009) also found signiﬁcantly lower BDNF lev-
els in ﬁrst-episode patients with schizophrenia in comparison to
healthy control subjects (9.0 ± 4.2 ng/ml vs. 12.1 ± 2.2 ng/ml),and
observed a signiﬁcant positive correlation between BDNF levels
and PANSS positive subscore. Furthermore, higher BDNF levels
were observed in patients with paranoid subtype of schizophre-
nia. They concluded that low BDNF levels at the onset of psychosis
suggest that it may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia
and perhaps, could be a candidate biological marker for positive
symptoms.
Palomino et al. (2006) was one of the ﬁrst authors to study
prospectively the evolution of BDNF plasma levels of patients
with a ﬁnal diagnosis of schizophrenia was measured at base-
line at the start of their ﬁrst psychotic episode (4.19 ± 2.26 ng/ml)
and the following months after starting treatment (often with
atypical antipsychotics), with a higher level at 6 months duration
(6.53 ± 2.48 ng/ml), approaching the level of the control subjects
(7.55 ± 4.31 ng/ml).
Many authors have also evaluated the effects of both pharma-
cological and non-pharmacological treatments for SCZ in BDNF,
and despite some controversial results, it seems that both med-
icated and non-medicated patients present with lower levels of
BDNF when compared to controls. Further data suggests that typ-
ical antipsychotics may decrease BDNF expression whereas mixed
results have been obtained with atypical antipsychotics (Favalli
et al., 2012).
In a recent review, Martinotti et al. (2012) suggested that most
data points to decreased plasma and serum BDNF concentrations
in both drug-naive and medicated schizophrenic patients com-
pared to healthy controls. They also mentioned that there are
contrasting results on a possible correlation between increase in
BDNF concentrations and treatment with antipsychotics.
In a meta-analysis, Green et al. (2011) concluded that blood
levels of BDNF are reduced in medicated and drug-naive patients
with schizophrenia. This evidence is of moderate quality, that is,
precise but with considerable, unexplained heterogeneity across
study results.
The relationship between BDNF plasma levels and treatment
response to antipsychotic treatment with risperidone has been
studied by Lee and Kim (2009). They found that baseline BDNF
levels were signiﬁcantly lower in non-response patients than oth-
ers,suggesting that higher plasma BDNF levels might be associated
with better response to antipsychotic treatment.
BDNF LEVELS AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION
Considering that hippocampal volume shrinks in late adulthood,
and that circulating levels of BDNF decline with advancing age,
Erickson et al. (2010) tested whether age-related reductions in
serum levels of BDNF would be related to shrinkage of the hip-
pocampus and memory deﬁcits in older adults. Hippocampal
volume was acquired by automated segmentation of magnetic res-
onance images in 142 older adults without dementia. The caudate
nucleus was also segmented and examined in relation to levels
of serum BDNF. Spatial memory was tested using a paradigm
in which memory load was parametrically increased. The results
showed that increasing age was associated with smaller hippocam-
pal volumes, reduced levels of serum BDNF, and poorer memory
performance.
Interestingly,lower levels of BDNF were associated with smaller
hippocampi and poorer memory, even when controlling for the
variation related to age. In an exploratory mediation analysis,
hippocampal volume mediated the age-related decline in spatial
memory and BDNF mediated the age-related decline in hip-
pocampal volume. Caudate nucleus volume was unrelated to
BDNF levels or spatial memory performance. These results iden-
tify serum BDNF as a signiﬁcant factor related to hippocampal
shrinkage and memory decline in late adulthood (Erickson et al.,
2010).
However, Niitsu et al. (2011) reported that serum BDNF lev-
els of normal controls showed negative correlations with verbal
working memory.
BDNF LEVELS AND COGNITIVE DEFICITS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA
Rizos et al. (2011) investigated the correlation between serum
BDNFlevelsandhippocampalvolumesinasampleof ﬁrst-episode
drug-naïve patients with schizophrenia and healthy control sub-
jects and found that both hippocampal volume and serum BDNF
levels were decreased in these patients. A signiﬁcant positive asso-
ciation was found between serum BDNF and the corrected right
hippocampalvolume in the groupof patients,such that the smaller
the hippocampal volume, the more reduced the serum BDNF
levels.
These ﬁndings indicate that low serum BDNF levels are associ-
ated with reduction in hippocampal volume at the onset of schizo-
phrenia and may further support the theory of a neuroprogressive-
neurotoxic reaction associated with the onset of psychosis (Rizos
et al., 2011).
Recently, Zhang et al. (2012a) evaluated a group of schizo-
phrenic inpatients with the repeatable battery for the assessment
of neuropsychological status (RBANS), and assessed the presence
of the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism and serum BDNF lev-
els. They found an association between the BDNF Met variant
and poor visuospatial/constructional performance and attentional
decrements in schizophrenic patients. They also found that the
association between decreased BDNF serum levels and cognitive
impairment in schizophrenia is dependent on the BDNFVal66Met
polymorphism.
In a different publication, Zhang et al. (2012b) also reported
that BDNF serum levels are positively associated speciﬁcally with
immediate memory in schizophrenia.
Niitsu et al. (2011) reported that serum BDNF levels of schiz-
ophrenic patients showed positive correlations with the scores of
the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and
the Information subtest scores of Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale
Revised (WAIS-R).

Nieto et al.
BDNF and schizophrenia: neurodevelopment, neurocognition
In a study by de Azua et al. (2013) in ﬁrst-episode psy-
chosis patients, there was a positive association between plasma
BDNF and ﬁve cognitive domains (learning ability,immediate and
delayed memory, abstract thinking and processing speed) after a
6 month follow-up. The association persisted after controlling for
medications prescribed, drug use, intelligence quotient (IQ), and
negative symptoms. In the healthy control group, BDNF levels
were not associated with cognitive test scores.
Carlino et al. (2011) hypothesized that controversial data about
serum BDNF in relation to cognition in schizophrenia and control
subjects might be due to the differential regulation of BDNF pre-
cursor pro-BDNF and proteolytic products mature and truncated-
BDNF. Their results suggest that deﬁciency in pro-BDNF pro-
cessing might be a possible biological mechanism underlying
schizophrenia with cognitive impairment.
According to Pedrini et al. (2011), serum BDNF levels concen-
tration in schizophrenia merits further investigations with regard
to the role of neurotrophins in the cognitive response to treatment
with atypical antipsychotics.
Intensive cognitive training can improve cognitive processes
relevant to psychosocial functioning in schizophrenia. One exam-
ple of this is the neuroplasticity-based auditory training used to
improve verbal memory (Fisher et al., 2009). In patients with
schizophrenia receiving neurocognitive training,Vinogradov et al.
(2009) found a signiﬁcant increase in plasma levels of BDNF
during the period of cognitive remediation therapy. In this con-
text, BDNF has also been proposed as a biomarker of cognitive
enhancement.
CONCLUSION
Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophin
that has been related not only to neurodevelopment and neuro-
protection, but also to synapse regulation, learning, and memory.
In relation to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, particu-
larly neurodevelopmental and neurotoxicity-related elements,
neurotrophins such as BDNF can provide an explanatory frame-
work supported by evidence at molecular, cellular, animal,
and human subjects levels. In addition, the synaptic alter-
ations due to problems in BDNF expression may alter neu-
rotransmitter pathways classically involved in schizophrenia
pathophysiology, such as the dopaminergic and GABA sys-
tems.
The cognitive deﬁcits of this illness, considered a core manifes-
tation and an important predictor for functional outcome, can be
understood in the context of the molecular and cellular mecha-
nisms of learning and memory, in which BDNF plays a key role
through regulation of synaptic plasticity. This is related to the
ﬁndings of behavioral studies in animal models and the results of
studies of cognition in human subjects.
Since BDNF is widely distributed in the central nervous sys-
tem and has been implicated in several psychiatric illnesses, the
dysregulation of BDNF signaling is not speciﬁc to schizophrenia.
However, considering its relation to key core mechanisms in the
etiology and pathophysiology of schizophrenia, it can potentially
become an important biomarker of the clinical status and/or the
prognosis of patients with this disease.
A better knowledge of BDNF signaling in schizophrenic
patients and controls may have important implications for the
treatment of schizophrenia, considering current trends toward
individualized medicine based in molecular biomarkers at gene
and protein levels.
In conclusion, evidence support the notion that variations in
neurotrophins such as BDNF may have a role in the molecu-
lar mechanisms underlying this disease, from the neurodevel-
opmental alterations to the molecular mechanisms of cognitive
dysfunction in patients with schizophrenia.
