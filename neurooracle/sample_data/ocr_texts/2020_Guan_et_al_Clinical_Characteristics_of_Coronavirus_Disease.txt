BACKGROUND
Since December 2019, when coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) emerged in Wuhan 
city and rapidly spread throughout China, data have been needed on the clinical 
characteristics of the affected patients.
METHODS
We extracted data regarding 1099 patients with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 from 
552 hospitals in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in mainland 
China through January 29, 2020. The primary composite end point was admission 
to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of mechanical ventilation, or death.
RESULTS
The median age of the patients was 47 years; 41.9% of the patients were female. 
The primary composite end point occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 5.0% 
who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who underwent invasive mechanical ventila-
tion, and 1.4% who died. Only 1.9% of the patients had a history of direct contact 
with wildlife. Among nonresidents of Wuhan, 72.3% had contact with residents of 
Wuhan, including 31.3% who had visited the city. The most common symptoms 
were fever (43.8% on admission and 88.7% during hospitalization) and cough 
(67.8%). Diarrhea was uncommon (3.8%). The median incubation period was 4 days 
(interquartile range, 2 to 7). On admission, ground-glass opacity was the most 
common radiologic finding on chest computed tomography (CT) (56.4%). No radio-
graphic or CT abnormality was found in 157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere 
disease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe disease. Lymphocytopenia was 
present in 83.2% of the patients on admission.
CONCLUSIONS
During the first 2 months of the current outbreak, Covid-19 spread rapidly 
throughout China and caused varying degrees of illness. Patients often presented 
without fever, and many did not have abnormal radiologic findings. (Funded by 
the National Health Commission of China and others.)

I
n early December 2019, the first pneu-
monia cases of unknown origin were identi-
fied in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei 
province.1 The pathogen has been identified as a 
novel enveloped RNA betacoronavirus2 that has 
currently been named severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which 
has a phylogenetic similarity to SARS-CoV.3 Pa-
tients with the infection have been documented 
both in hospitals and in family settings.4-8
The World Health Organization (WHO) has re-
cently declared coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) 
a public health emergency of international con-
cern.9 As of February 25, 2020, a total of 81,109 
laboratory-confirmed cases had been document-
ed globally.5,6,9-11 In recent studies, the severity of 
some cases of Covid-19 mimicked that of SARS-
CoV.1,12,13 Given the rapid spread of Covid-19, we 
determined that an updated analysis of cases 
throughout mainland China might help identify 
the defining clinical characteristics and severity of 
the disease. Here, we describe the results of our 
analysis of the clinical characteristics of Covid-19 
in a selected cohort of patients throughout China.
Methods
Study Oversight
The study was supported by National Health 
Commission of China and designed by the in-
vestigators. The study was approved by the insti-
tutional review board of the National Health 
Commission. Written informed consent was 
waived in light of the urgent need to collect 
data. Data were analyzed and interpreted by the 
authors. All the authors reviewed the manuscript 
and vouch for the accuracy and completeness of 
the data and for the adherence of the study to 
the protocol, available with the full text of this 
article at NEJM.org.
Data Sources
We obtained the medical records and compiled 
data for hospitalized patients and outpatients 
with laboratory-confirmed Covid-19, as reported 
to the National Health Commission between 
December 11, 2019, and January 29, 2020; the 
data cutoff for the study was January 31, 2020. 
Covid-19 was diagnosed on the basis of the 
WHO interim guidance.14 A confirmed case of 
Covid-19 was defined as a positive result on high-
throughput sequencing or real-time reverse-tran-
scriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) 
assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens.1 
Only laboratory-confirmed cases were included 
in the analysis.
We obtained data regarding cases outside 
Hubei province from the National Health Com-
mission. Because of the high workload of clini-
cians, three outside experts from Guangzhou 
performed raw data extraction at Wuhan Jinyin-
tan Hospital, where many of the patients with 
Covid-19 in Wuhan were being treated.
We extracted the recent exposure history, 
clinical symptoms or signs, and laboratory find-
ings on admission from electronic medical rec­
ords. Radiologic assessments included chest radi-
ography or computed tomography (CT), and all 
laboratory testing was performed according to 
the clinical care needs of the patient. We deter-
mined the presence of a radiologic abnormality 
on the basis of the documentation or description 
in medical charts; if imaging scans were avail-
able, they were reviewed by attending physicians 
in respiratory medicine who extracted the data. 
Major disagreement between two reviewers was 
resolved by consultation with a third reviewer. 
Laboratory assessments consisted of a complete 
blood count, blood chemical analysis, coagula-
tion testing, assessment of liver and renal func-
tion, and measures of electrolytes, C-reactive 
protein, procalcitonin, lactate dehydrogenase, 
and creatine kinase. We defined the degree of 
severity of Covid-19 (severe vs. nonsevere) at the 
time of admission using the American Thoracic 
Society guidelines for community-acquired pneu-
monia.15
All medical records were copied and sent to 
the data-processing center in Guangzhou, under 
the coordination of the National Health Com-
mission. A team of experienced respiratory clini-
cians reviewed and abstracted the data. Data 
were entered into a computerized database and 
cross-checked. If the core data were missing, 
requests for clarification were sent to the coor-
dinators, who subsequently contacted the attend-
ing clinicians.
Study Outcomes
The primary composite end point was admission 
to an intensive care unit (ICU), the use of me-
chanical ventilation, or death. These outcomes

n engl j med﻿  nejm.org﻿

Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China
were used in a previous study to assess the se-
verity of other serious infectious diseases, such 
as H7N9 infection.16 Secondary end points were 
the rate of death and the time from symptom 
onset until the composite end point and until 
each component of the composite end point.
Study Definitions
The incubation period was defined as the inter-
val between the potential earliest date of contact 
of the transmission source (wildlife or person 
with suspected or confirmed case) and the poten-
tial earliest date of symptom onset (i.e., cough, 
fever, fatigue, or myalgia). We excluded incuba-
tion periods of less than 1 day because some 
patients had continuous exposure to contamina-
tion sources; in these cases, the latest date of 
exposure was recorded. The summary statistics 
of incubation periods were calculated on the 
basis of 291 patients who had clear information 
regarding the specific date of exposure.
Fever was defined as an axillary temperature 
of 37.5°C or higher. Lymphocytopenia was de-
fined as a lymphocyte count of less than 1500 
cells per cubic millimeter. Thrombocytopenia was 
defined as a platelet count of less than 150,000 
per cubic millimeter. Additional definitions — 
including exposure to wildlife, acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, acute 
kidney failure, acute heart failure, and rhabdo-
myolysis — are provided in the Supplementary 
Appendix, available at NEJM.org.
Laboratory Confirmation
Laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 was per-
formed at the Chinese Center for Disease Preven-
tion and Control before January 23, 2020, and 
subsequently in certified tertiary care hospitals. 
RT-PCR assays were performed in accordance 
with the protocol established by the WHO.17 De-
tails regarding laboratory confirmation processes 
are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.
Statistical Analysis
Continuous variables were expressed as medians 
and interquartile ranges or simple ranges, as ap-
propriate. Categorical variables were summarized 
as counts and percentages. No imputation was 
made for missing data. Because the cohort of 
patients in our study was not derived from ran-
dom selection, all statistics are deemed to be 
descriptive only. We used ArcGIS, version 10.2.2, 
to plot the numbers of patients with reportedly 
confirmed cases on a map. All the analyses were 
performed with the use of R software, version 
3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).
Results
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics
Of the 7736 patients with Covid-19 who had been 
hospitalized at 552 sites as of January 29, 2020, 
we obtained data regarding clinical symptoms 
and outcomes for 1099 patients (14.2%). The 
largest number of patients (132) had been ad-
mitted to Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital. The hospi-
tals that were included in this study accounted 
for 29.7% of the 1856 designated hospitals 
where patients with Covid-19 could be admitted 
in 30 provinces, autonomous regions, or munici-
palities across China (Fig. 1).
The demographic and clinical characteristics 
of the patients are shown in Table 1. A total of 
3.5% were health care workers, and a history of 
contact with wildlife was documented in 1.9%; 
483 patients (43.9%) were residents of Wuhan. 
Among the patients who lived outside Wuhan, 
72.3% had contact with residents of Wuhan, in-
cluding 31.3% who had visited the city; 25.9% of 
nonresidents had neither visited the city nor had 
contact with Wuhan residents.
The median incubation period was 4 days 
(interquartile range, 2 to 7). The median age of 
the patients was 47 years (interquartile range, 35 
to 58); 0.9% of the patients were younger than 
15 years of age. A total of 41.9% were female. 
Fever was present in 43.8% of the patients on 
admission but developed in 88.7% during hospi-
talization. The second most common symptom 
was cough (67.8%); nausea or vomiting (5.0%) 
and diarrhea (3.8%) were uncommon. Among 
the overall population, 23.7% had at least one 
coexisting illness (e.g., hypertension and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease).
On admission, the degree of severity of 
­Covid-19 was categorized as nonsevere in 926 
patients and severe in 173 patients. Patients with 
severe disease were older than those with non-
severe disease by a median of 7 years. Moreover, 
the presence of any coexisting illness was more 
common among patients with severe disease than 
among those with nonsevere disease (38.7% vs.

21.0%). However, the exposure history between 
the two groups of disease severity was similar.
 Radiologic and Laboratory Findings
Table 2 shows the radiologic and laboratory 
findings on admission. Of 975 CT scans that 
were performed at the time of admission, 86.2% 
revealed abnormal results. The most common 
patterns on chest CT were ground-glass opacity 
(56.4%) and bilateral patchy shadowing (51.8%). 
Representative radiologic findings in two pa-
tients with nonsevere Covid-19 and in another 
two patients with severe Covid-19 are provided 
in Figure S1 in the Supplementary Appendix. No 
radiographic or CT abnormality was found in 
157 of 877 patients (17.9%) with nonsevere dis-
ease and in 5 of 173 patients (2.9%) with severe 
disease.
On admission, lymphocytopenia was present 
in 83.2% of the patients, thrombocytopenia in 
36.2%, and leukopenia in 33.7%. Most of the 
patients had elevated levels of C-reactive protein; 
less common were elevated levels of alanine 
aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase,

Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China
creatine kinase, and d-dimer. Patients with severe 
disease had more prominent laboratory abnor-
malities (including lymphocytopenia and leuko-
penia) than those with nonsevere disease.
Clinical Outcomes
None of the 1099 patients were lost to follow-up 
during the study. A primary composite end-point 
event occurred in 67 patients (6.1%), including 
5.0% who were admitted to the ICU, 2.3% who 
underwent invasive mechanical ventilation, and 
1.4% who died (Table 3). Among the 173 patients 
with severe disease, a primary composite end-point 
event occurred in 43 patients (24.9%). Among all 
the patients, the cumulative risk of the compos-
ite end point was 3.6%; among those with severe 
disease, the cumulative risk was 20.6%.
Treatment and Complications
A majority of the patients (58.0%) received intra-
venous antibiotic therapy, and 35.8% received 
oseltamivir therapy; oxygen therapy was admin-
istered in 41.3% and mechanical ventilation in 
6.1%; higher percentages of patients with severe 
disease received these therapies (Table  3). Me-
chanical ventilation was initiated in more pa-
tients with severe disease than in those with 
nonsevere disease (noninvasive ventilation, 32.4% 
vs. 0%; invasive ventilation, 14.5% vs. 0%). Sys-
temic glucocorticoids were given to 204 patients 
(18.6%), with a higher percentage among those 
with severe disease than nonsevere disease (44.5% 
vs. 13.7%). Of these 204 patients, 33 (16.2%) 
were admitted to the ICU, 17 (8.3%) underwent 
invasive ventilation, and 5 (2.5%) died. Extracor-
poreal membrane oxygenation was performed in 
5 patients (0.5%) with severe disease.
The median duration of hospitalization was 
12.0 days (mean, 12.8). During hospital admis-
sion, most of the patients received a diagnosis of 
pneumonia from a physician (91.1%), followed 
by ARDS (3.4%) and shock (1.1%). Patients with 
severe disease had a higher incidence of physi-
cian-diagnosed pneumonia than those with non-
severe disease (99.4% vs. 89.5%).
Discussion
During the initial phase of the Covid-19 out-
break, the diagnosis of the disease was compli-
cated by the diversity in symptoms and imaging 
findings and in the severity of disease at the 
time of presentation. Fever was identified in 
43.8% of the patients on presentation but devel-
oped in 88.7% after hospitalization. Severe ill-
ness occurred in 15.7% of the patients after ad-
mission to a hospital. No radiologic abnormalities 
were noted on initial presentation in 2.9% of the 
patients with severe disease and in 17.9% of those 
with nonsevere disease. Despite the number of 
deaths associated with Covid-19, SARS-CoV-2 
appears to have a lower case fatality rate than 
either SARS-CoV or Middle East respiratory syn-
drome–related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Com-
promised respiratory status on admission (the 
primary driver of disease severity) was associat-
ed with worse outcomes.
Approximately 2% of the patients had a history 
of direct contact with wildlife, whereas more than 
three quarters were either residents of Wuhan, 
had visited the city, or had contact with city 
residents. These findings echo the latest reports, 
including the outbreak of a family cluster,4 
transmission from an asymptomatic patient,6 
and the three-phase outbreak patterns.8 Our 
study cannot preclude the presence of patients 
who have been termed “super-spreaders.”
Conventional routes of transmission of SARS-
CoV, MERS-CoV, and highly pathogenic influenza 
consist of respiratory droplets and direct con-
tact,18-20 mechanisms that probably occur with 
SARS-CoV-2 as well. Because SARS-CoV-2 can be 
detected in the gastrointestinal tract, saliva, and 
urine, these routes of potential transmission 
need to be investigated21 (Tables S1 and S2).
The term Covid-19 has been applied to pa-
tients who have laboratory-confirmed symptom-
atic cases without apparent radiologic manifes-
tations. A better understanding of the spectrum 
of the disease is needed, since in 8.9% of the 
patients, SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected be-
fore the development of viral pneumonia or viral 
pneumonia did not develop.
In concert with recent studies,1,8,12 we found 
that the clinical characteristics of Covid-19 mimic 
those of SARS-CoV. Fever and cough were the 
dominant symptoms and gastrointestinal symp-
toms were uncommon, which suggests a differ-
ence in viral tropism as compared with SARS-CoV, 
MERS-CoV, and seasonal influenza.22,23 The ab-
sence of fever in Covid-19 is more frequent than 
in SARS-CoV (1%) and MERS-CoV infection

Characteristics of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in China
(2%),20 so afebrile patients may be missed if the 
surveillance case definition focuses on fever 
detection.14 Lymphocytopenia was common and, 
in some cases, severe, a finding that was consis-
tent with the results of two recent reports.1,12 We 
found a lower case fatality rate (1.4%) than the 
rate that was recently reportedly,1,12 probably 
because of the difference in sample sizes and 
case inclusion criteria. Our findings were more 
similar to the national official statistics, which 
showed a rate of death of 3.2% among 51,857 
cases of Covid-19 as of February 16, 2020.11,24 
Since patients who were mildly ill and who did 
not seek medical attention were not included in 
our study, the case fatality rate in a real-world 
scenario might be even lower. Early isolation, 
early diagnosis, and early management might 
have collectively contributed to the reduction in 
mortality in Guangdong.
Despite the phylogenetic homogeneity between 
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, there are some clini-
cal characteristics that differentiate Covid-19 from 
SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and seasonal influenza 
infections. (For example, seasonal influenza has 
been more common in respiratory outpatient 
clinics and wards.) Some additional characteris-
tics that are unique to Covid-19 are detailed in 
Table S3.
Our study has some notable limitations. First, 
some cases had incomplete documentation of 
the exposure history and laboratory testing, 
given the variation in the structure of electronic 
databases among different participating sites 
and the urgent timeline for data extraction. 
Some cases were diagnosed in outpatient set-
tings where medical information was briefly 
documented and incomplete laboratory testing 
was performed, along with a shortage of infra-
structure and training of medical staff in non-
specialty hospitals. Second, we could estimate 
the incubation period in only 291 of the study 
patients who had documented information. The 
uncertainty of the exact dates (recall bias) might 
have inevitably affected our assessment. Third, 
because many patients remained in the hospital 
and the outcomes were unknown at the time of 
data cutoff, we censored the data regarding their 
clinical outcomes as of the time of our analysis. 
Fourth, we no doubt missed patients who were 
asymptomatic or had mild cases and who were 
treated at home, so our study cohort may repre-
sent the more severe end of Covid-19. Fifth,

many patients did not undergo sputum bacterio-
logic or fungal assessment on admission because, 
in some hospitals, medical resources were over-
whelmed. Sixth, data generation was clinically 
driven and not systematic.
Covid-19 has spread rapidly since it was first 
identified in Wuhan and has been shown to have 
a wide spectrum of severity. Some patients with 
Covid-19 do not have fever or radiologic abnor-
malities on initial presentation, which has com-
plicated the diagnosis.
