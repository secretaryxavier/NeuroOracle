Abstract: Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disease characterized by dyskinetic cilia.
Respiratory symptoms usually start at birth. The lack of diagnostic gold standard tests is challenging,
as PCD diagnostics requires different methods with high expertise. We founded PCD-UNIBE as the
ﬁrst comprehensive PCD diagnostic center in Switzerland. Our diagnostic approach includes nasal
brushing and cell culture with analysis of ciliary motility via high-speed-videomicroscopy (HSVM)
and immunoﬂuorescence labeling (IF) of structural proteins. Selected patients undergo electron
microscopy (TEM) of ciliary ultrastructure and genetics. We report here on the ﬁrst 100 patients
assessed by PCD-UNIBE. All patients received HSVM fresh, IF, and cell culture (success rate of
90%). We repeated the HSVM with cell cultures and conducted TEM in 30 patients and genetics in
31 patients. Results from cell cultures were much clearer compared to fresh samples. For 80 patients,
we found no evidence of PCD, 17 were diagnosed with PCD, two remained inconclusive, and one
case is ongoing. HSVM was diagnostic in 12, IF in 14, TEM in ﬁve and genetics in 11 cases. None of
the methods was able to diagnose all 17 PCD cases, highlighting that a comprehensive approach is
essential for an accurate diagnosis of PCD.

1. Introduction
Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a rare genetic disorder (prevalence between
1:10,000 and 1:20,000 [1–3]) that manifests with chronic respiratory symptoms caused

by impaired mucociliary clearance [4–6]. Symptoms include chronic wet cough, chronic
rhinitis, recurrent otitis media, and subsequent hearing impairment, recurrent respiratory
infections, and may start early in life with neonatal respiratory distress [6–10]. Pulmonary
long-term morbidity includes function impairment and structural changes (e.g., lung
atelectasis, bronchiectasis) [8,11–13]. The impaired ciliary function with inefﬁcient or
absent beating is based on defects in a large number of genes. Those genes primarily
involve the ciliary motor protein family, the dyneins, but also other components of the
ciliary structure [9,14]. Despite recent diagnostic guidelines of the European Respiratory
Society (ERS) [15] and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) [16], the diagnosis of PCD
remains challenging. Difﬁculties are related to several issues: (i) clinical presentation shows
a wide phenotypical spectrum and is not speciﬁc for PCD; (ii) there is no single test that is
diagnostic for PCD as a stand-alone test; current diagnostic guidelines therefore include a
combination of different functional, structural and molecular methods; (iii) all diagnostic
methods require a high level of expertise; (iv) over 1
4 of the genetic defects causing PCD
are unknown [17]; (v) analytical methods have not been standardized sufﬁciently [18] and
have unsatisfactory sensitivity and/or speciﬁcity if considered individually; and (vi) PCD
is a rare disease and satisfactory diagnostic experience is available in only a few specialized
centers. Hence, PCD is often diagnosed late in life or not at all, resulting in an overall
underdiagnosis and undertreatment [1,2]. Even if causal therapy is not yet available, early
diagnosis and interdisciplinary management increases quality of life and prognosis of
affected patients [19,20].
The current diagnostic guidelines include a combination of different functional, struc-
tural, and molecular methods. All require a high level of expertise. Currently, the following
methods are used routinely for the diagnosis of PCD: (i) measurement of nasal nitric oxide
(nNO); (ii) high-speed-videomicroscopy (HSVM) to assess ciliary motility of viable cells
(fresh samples or air-liquid interface (ALI) cell cultures); (iii) immunoﬂuorescence stain-
ing (IF) of different structural proteins; (iv) assessment of the axonemal ultrastructure by
transmission electron microscopy (TEM); and (v) genetic testing for the identiﬁcation of
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in PCD-associated genes.
Based on 30 years of experience in structural PCD diagnosis, we founded the inter-
disciplinary center for comprehensive PCD diagnostics (PCD-UNIBE) at the University
Children’s Hospital, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital and the Institute of Anatomy,
University of Bern, in January 2018. This is the ﬁrst comprehensive PCD diagnostic center
in Switzerland and is led by an experienced team of clinicians and biomedical researchers.
The aim of this study is to summarize the experiences of the ﬁrst 100 patients assessed
by PCD-UNIBE and to report on the workﬂow, beneﬁts, and challenges of our center and
the diagnostic algorithm used by us.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Study Population
This observational study includes the ﬁrst 100 patients referred to our PCD-UNIBE
diagnostic center. The study was approved by the ethics committees of the University
Children’s Hospital Bern (Ethikkommission der Kinderkliniken) and of the Canton Bern
(Kantonale Ethikkomission Bern), Switzerland (project identiﬁcation code 2018-02155,
01/2019). We obtained written informed consents from all participants or their legal
guardians.
2.2. Diagnostic Workﬂow
The diagnostic workflow used at PCD-UNIBE implements the ERS guidelines [15], but
adds (for all patients) ALI cell culture of brushed cells and IF of structural proteins of the
ciliary axoneme. In brief, we perform HSVM and IF for all patients, but execute TEM and
genetics analysis only for selected patients. Our diagnostic workflow is shown in Figure 1
and our detailed diagnostic algorithm has been recently published [21]. An important
part of PCD-UNIBE are interdisciplinary meetings with clinicians (pneumologists) and

Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1540

diagnostic research specialists to discuss cases, decide on further investigations and conﬁrm
diagnosis. nNO measurements are not performed by PCD-UNIBE, but by the referring
centers themselves (since some patients are not physically present at PCD-UNIBE, but only
their nasal brushes are sent to us).
 
Figure 1. Diagnostic workﬂow of our comprehensive PCD-UNIBE diagnostic center. “PCD positive” and “high evidence
for PCD” are considered as a diagnosis of PCD. For patients with a high clinical suspicion, we usually perform all available
methods. 1 As a clinical screening, the PICADAR-Score [22] may be useful. 2 Further investigations (HSVM, IF, and TEM)
are preferably conducted by analyzing the material of the ALI cell cultures. A re-brushing is considered if cell culture
was not successful. When re-brushing was not possible, fresh material was used. 3 We recommend further investigations
(e.g., RNA-analysis or array-CGH) if other results suggest PCD. Abbreviations: ALI: air-liquid interface, HSVM: high-

2.3. Nasal Brushing and Further Processing
Nasal epithelial cells (NECs) are obtained by brushings with adapted interdental
brushes from both nostrils. The cells are then removed from the brushes and used for dif-
ferent investigations: (i) HSVM of the fresh sample; (ii) preparation of slides for IF staining;
(iii) cultivation of cells; and (iv) ﬁxation for TEM (if the sample contains sufﬁciently large
groups of ciliated cells). Detailed descriptions of the nasal brushing itself, its processing
and the further procedures are provided in the Appendix A—Supplementary Methods’
Description.
2.4. Cell Culture
Primary NECs are cultured using the PneumaCult Media Kits (Stemcell Technologies),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol with minor changes. A detailed description of
our protocol is available in Appendix A.
2.5. High-Speed Videomicroscopy (HSVM)
Ciliary motility of fresh or ALI cells is analyzed via HSVM. To summarize, we use a
silicon spacer to build an imaging chamber and record videos on an inverted bright ﬁeld
microscope. These videos are then analyzed using our own analysis software (termed
“Cilialyzer” [23]) by assessing the ciliary beating pattern (CBP), beating frequency (CBF),
coordination of cilia movement, and particle transport. A detailed description of the
methods is provided in Appendix A. The Excel analysis template is available online under
the Supplementary Material.
2.6. Immunoﬂuorescence Staining (IF)
Different structural proteins of the ciliary axoneme are labeled using standard proto-
cols for IF. Our standard panel includes dynein axonemal heavy chain 5 (DNAH5), growth
arrest speciﬁc 8 (GAS8), and radial-spoke-head 9 (RSPH9) (and dynein axonemal light
intermediate chain 1 (DNALI1) for earlier samples). Based on ﬁndings from the IF and the
HSVM, further proteins are stained. A detailed description of the methods and a list of
available proteins are provided in Appendix A.
2.7. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
We perform an ultrastructural analysis of cilia via TEM for patients with high clinical
suspicion and/or suspicious results from the standard tests (HSVM and IF). In short, cells
(fresh or from ALI cultures) are ﬁxed and processed, and 100–200 well assessable cilia cross
sections imaged. The axonemal structures are systematically evaluated and scored accord-
ing to the international consensus guidelines on TEM in PCD diagnosis [24]. Additionally,
we discriminate between proximal and distal localization. A detailed method’s description
is provided in Appendix A and the Excel analysis template is available online under the
Supplementary Material.
2.8. Genetical Analysis
Analysis of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in all currently known PCD-
associated genes is performed via next-generation sequencing of the whole exome by
specialized centers; for more details see Appendix A.

of all cases. 2 Children = age younger than 18 years. 3 Hospitals with only one case, e.g., University Children’s Hospital Basel, University
Hospital Basel (Clinic for Ear–Nose–Throat). 4 e.g., cardiological problems, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, growth impairment, hearing
problems, colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, family history of PCD. 5 For some patients we do not have this information either
because the referring center had no possibility to measure nNO levels or because the patient was too young to perform a nNO measurement.
3.2. Overview of the Tests: HSVM, IF, TEM, Genetics
The diagnostic outcome was usually the result of several tests; see Figure 2 for an
overview over all patients (A) and PCD cases (B). For all patients, we performed HSVM
of the fresh samples and tried to obtain re-differentiated ALI cell cultures. HSVM ALI
was performed whenever we succeeded in growing and re-differentiating cells (see below
for details on cell culture success rate). For the vast majority of cases, we performed IF,
preferable from ALI cell cultures (n = 82, n = 49 additional from fresh samples). For one
case, we omitted IF since the clinical suspicion was moderate, HSVM showed normal CBP
and CBF, and PCD was no longer the most probable diagnosis pursued. In 30 cases with
highly suspicious CBP in HSVM and/or high clinical suspicion, we performed TEM. We
carried out TEM analysis from seven fresh samples and from 26 ALI samples (for three
patients we performed both). Genetics was done in 31 cases with high clinical suspicion
and/or suggestive results of previous tests.

center and of PCD cases only (B). Numbers in the bars indicate number of cases.
3.3. Air-Liquid Interface (ALI) Cell Culture
We aimed to cultivate cells from all patients. The cell culture grew and re-differentiated
successfully for 90% from the ﬁrst brushings. Reasons for failure of cell cultivation were
bacterial contamination (n = 1), fungal contamination (n = 2), bad primary material (n = 7,
e.g., not sufﬁcient viable cells, no attachment or growing of the cells). In 10 cases, the
cell cultivation was not successful at all; additionally, in one case, the quality of the cell
culture was insufﬁcient. For four patients, we omitted a re-brushing: one case could be
diagnosed with PCD based on a TEM hallmark defect in the fresh sample; one patient had
a pathologic mutation in a known PCD-associated gene; two patients refused a re-brushing.
For the other seven cases with failure of cell cultivation, we performed a re-brushing and
cultured cells again (success rate of 86%; six re-differentiated successfully, one failure due
to fungal contamination).
3.4. Results of the Performed Tests: HSVM, IF, TEM, Genetics
From the 107 fresh HSVM analyses, 29 cases (27%) showed no evidence for PCD (CBP
score > 3), 54 cases (50%) were inconclusive, and 24 cases (22%) showed a high evidence
for PCD (Figure 3). Results of HSVM done on cell cultures were much clearer: 78 cases

Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1540
7 of 21
(83%) showed no evidence for PCD, four cases (4%) were inconclusive, and 12 cases (13%)
showed high evidence for PCD. Interestingly, not all cases were assessed identically from
fresh and ALI samples. For 42 cases, the conclusion was similar in both samples: 28 cases
were assessed as “no evidence for PCD”, four cases as “inconclusive”, and 10 cases as “high
evidence for PCD” based on both, fresh and ALI samples. Forty-one cases were assessed
as “inconclusive” based on fresh samples and as “no evidence for PCD” based on the ALI
sample. Moreover, importantly, one case was assessed as “no evidence for PCD” based on
fresh and as “high evidence for PCD” based on ALI sample. For one case, the fresh sample
was “inconclusive”, but the ALI sample showed a “high evidence for PCD”. In addition,
nine cases showed “high evidence for PCD” in fresh and “no evidence for PCD” in the ALI
samples. The samples of which the cell culture did not successfully re-differentiate were
assessed as follows: 1× “no evidence for PCD”, 7× “inconclusive”, 5× “high evidence for
PCD”. Figure 4A,B show the typical difference in sample quality for the assessment of the
ciliary motility via HSVM.
Figure 3. Differences in the assessments of ciliary motility via HSVM and presence of structural
ciliary proteins via IF stainings in fresh and ALI samples. For HSVM fresh, we analyzed 107 samples
in total, as re-brushings were performed for seven patients. Two of the samples could not be analyzed
at all since no viable cells were found. We had a usable cell culture for 94 patients. For ﬁve patients
we had no ALI and for one patient, the cell culture was not stable and lost all cilia before reaching
maturity (at 28 days), and could not be analyzed. * Statistically signiﬁcant difference between HSVM
fresh versus ALI for “no evidence for PCD” (p < 0.0001), “inconclusive” (p < 0.0001) and “high
evidence for PCD” (p = 0.04) and IF fresh versus ALI for “inconclusive” (p = 0.03). Differences
between IF fresh versus ALI were not signiﬁcant for “no evidence for PCD” (p = 0.18) and “high
evidence for PCD” (p = 0.38). Data were compared using the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank
test (GraphPad Prism Version 9.0.2).
The assessments of IF show similar characteristics, when comparing fresh vs. ALI,
as the ones of HSVM (Figure 3): based on fresh samples statistically signiﬁcant more
inconclusive results (29 cases (55%) versus 19 cases (23%), p = 0.03) and fewer results
suggesting “no evidence for PCD” (23 cases (43%) versus 53 cases (64%), p = 0.18) compared
to the ALI samples. Furthermore, IF of the ALI samples enabled us more often to obtain a
“high evidence for PCD” (one case (2%) versus 11 cases (13%), p = 0.38). Figure 4C–F give
two examples of possible differences in the quality of fresh and ALI samples.

We performed TEM analysis for 30 cases (n = 4 only fresh, n = 3 fresh and ALI, n = 23
only ALI). There was “no evidence for PCD” in 22 cases (72%). Six cases were positive
for PCD: four cases (14%) showed a class 1 ODA and IDA defect, one (3%) a class 1
microtubular disorganization and IDAs defect, and one (3%) a class 2 ODA defect. Two

Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1540
9 of 21
cases (7%) remained inconclusive due to bad quality of cell cultures. The production of
TEM sections and images from ALI cell cultures was far more efﬁcient than from freshly
brushed samples. Abundant ciliated cells from large epithelial stripes and the possibility
of aligning the cell culture prior to sectioning provided many more axonemal views, which
are additionally optimally transected (see also Figure 4G,H). Furthermore, the effort needed
for the TEM assessment of cell cultures was roughly one third of the one needed for the
sparse, randomly oriented fresh brushing material.
Genetic analysis was carried out in 31 cases, with one analysis still ongoing. In 17 cases
(55%), no abnormal variants were found. In nine cases (29%), two pathologic or likely
pathologic variants in the same gene were found (7× DNAH11, 1× DNAH5, 1× HYDIN),
ﬁnally leading to the diagnosis of PCD. Five cases (16%) showed genetic abnormalities,
but did not lead to a (direct) PCD diagnosis: (1) in one case, a homozygous mutation of
unknown signiﬁcance in the DNAH11 gene was found (PCD was conﬁrmed due to missing
DNAH11 in IF and pathologic HSVM). (2) In another case, only a single likely pathogenic
variant in the DNAH11 was found (PCD was conﬁrmed due to missing DNAH11 in IF
and pathologic HSVM). (3) In one case three variants of unknown signiﬁcance in the
DNAH5 gene were found (PCD was not conﬁrmed in this case, since HSVM and TEM
were normal and DNAH5 was present in IF). (4) In another case, we found two DNAH9
variants of unknown signiﬁcance in-cis (the missing of DNAH9 in IF and a TEM class 2
ODA & IDA defect diagnosed PCD). (5) The last of the unclear cases showed only one
pathogenic variant in the HYDIN gene (PCD was not diagnosed due to HSVM being better
than expected for HYDIN mutations and normal nNO levels).
3.5. Overall Diagnostics Outcome
There was no evidence for PCD in 80 cases (Table 2). Seventeen patients were diag-
nosed with PCD (5× “high evidence for PCD”, 12× “PCD positive”). Three cases remained
inconclusive: Two patients refused further investigations, and in one case, the diagnostics
is still ongoing (The fresh sample and the cell culture showed only a few cilia. The genetic
analysis showed no pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 43 genes (including MCI-
DAS, CCNO, FOXJ1). Thus, we performed a re-brushing of which the results were still
pending). Among the 17 patients with diagnosed PCD, there are three cases with ongoing
analysis: In one case, PCD was diagnosed based on fresh HSVM and TEM, but the genetic
analysis is not yet complete. In two cases, PCD was diagnosed (1x based on HSVM and
TEM, 1x based on IF), but the underlying genetic mutation could not be identiﬁed yet.
Two of the cases with “no evidence for PCD” were clinically highly suspicious (one with
repeatedly reduced nNO), but none of the tests (TEM, HSVM, IF, genetics) showed any
evidence of PCD. Further investigations are planned for these patients.

3.6. Relevance of the Different Methods for the Diagnosis of PCD
The result of the HSVM conﬁrmed the diagnosis of PCD in 13 cases (13% of all
100 cases investigated with this method). For IF, this was the case in 14 cases (14% of the 99
IF investigated cases), for TEM in ﬁve (17% of the 30 TEM investigated cases) and genetics
in 10 cases (33% of the 30 genetically investigated cases) (Table 3). This shows that none of
the methods used was able to diagnose all 17 PCD cases. Thus, a comprehensive approach
is essential for an accurate diagnosis of PCD.

3.7. Costs
The costs for the different investigations vary a lot (Table 4) and are highly speciﬁc for
different countries and healthcare systems. Our standard diagnostics including brushing,
cell culture, HSVM fresh, and ALI and IF ALI costs EUR 1229. This is slightly more
compared to the costs of a set without cell culture including three brushings, three HSVM
fresh, and IF fresh, which adds up to EUR 1165. However, as soon as TEM needs to be
performed, the costs for the cell culture are overcompensated: A full set with only fresh
material (3× brushings, 3× HSVM fresh, IF fresh, TEM fresh) would cost EUR 3165, while a
full set including cell culture (1x brushing, HSVM fresh and ALI, IF ALI, TEM ALI) would
be EUR 2025. These reduced costs are in addition to the advantages of higher quality of
the results (for details see above), less clinical visits and less burden for the patients due
to fewer brushings. Our costs are higher compared to the numbers published earlier by
Shoemark et al.: USD 187 (EUR 159 (exchange rate of EUR 0.85 per one dollar was used)
and USD 1452 (EUR 1231). The higher costs in our setting are mostly related to higher
salaries and higher prices for consumables in Switzerland.
Table 4. Overview of the costs for the different methods. These costs only include running costs,
such as consumables, fee for using microscopes and working hours, but no initial set up costs (e.g.,
purchase of equipment) and neither costs on the side from clinics or patients for the visits (of which
more are needed if only fresh material is used).

Remark about costs: PCD-UNIBE is based in Switzerland where salaries and prices for consumables are usually
higher than in other European countries. Original costs were calculated in Swiss francs. For the conversion to
Euros, an exchange rate of 1.1 CHF per one EUR was used. 1 These costs apply for the standard panel including
DNAH5, GAS8, and RSPH9. Costs are higher if additional proteins are stained. 2 Average costs, costs vary
depending on affected gene. 3 Standard methods include nasal brushing, cell culture, HSVM fresh, HSVM ALI,
and IF ALI. 4 All methods include nasal brushing, cell culture, HSVM fresh and ALI, IF ALI, TEM ALI, and
genetics.

4. Discussion
4.1. Summary
Among the ﬁrst 100 patients referred to our newly founded PCD-UNIBE diagnostic
center, we diagnosed PCD in 17 cases and found no evidence for PCD in 80 patients. Three
cases remain inconclusive due to patients’ refusal for further investigations (n = 2) or
ongoing diagnostics (n = 1). We performed HSVM of the fresh samples for all patients and
IF for 99% of the patients. HSVM was repeated for all patients with a successful ALI cell
culture (90% after the initial brushing, 5% after a re-brushing). TEM was performed for 30
and genetics for 31 patients. The use of the cell culture avoided a re-brushing in 90% of the
cases and was crucial for most of the cases as it reduced the ratio of inconclusive ﬁndings
for HSVM and IF signiﬁcantly. HSVM conﬁrmed diagnosis of PCD in 13, IF in 14, TEM in
ﬁve, and genetics in 10 cases, respectively. None of the methods used was able to diagnose
all 17 PCD cases.
4.2. Diagnostic Impact of Methods/Procedures in Our Setting
By setting up our new comprehensive PCD diagnostic center in 2018, we decided
to include ALI cell culture as standard procedure for all patients. Herein, we report on
the importance of this as well as of the other included methods. Every single method
included in our algorithm was essential for certain cases to diagnose PCD. IF and genetics
were the sole diagnostic method in one case each (in the case of genetics, the cell culture
did not grow successfully, HSVM and IF of the fresh sample were inconclusive and we
omitted a re-brushing since the genetic testing conﬁrmed PCD). For all other cases, at least
a combination of two of the four methods were needed to conﬁrm the diagnosis of PCD.
Nevertheless, since none of the methods was able to diagnose all cases, we can neither
omit one of them nor choose a single method to be the best. Furthermore, we would like
to emphasize the importance of ALI cell cultures for our diagnostic procedure. Its value
has been described before [25–28], but we would like to add important aspects. The use
of cell culture avoided a re-brushing in 90% of all cases. This is of particular importance
for pediatric patients, in whom additional uncomfortable examinations should be avoided.
Further results from HSVM, IF, and TEM using cell cultures are much more precise: The
ratio of inconclusive assessments was signiﬁcantly lower for HSVM and IF after cell culture
compared to fresh samples. HSVM of cell cultures has already been shown to robustly
represent original characteristics while eliminating secondary effects and overcoming low
cell yields of the fresh samples [15,26,28,29]. Secondary or artifactual dyskinesia often seen
in fresh samples is one of the main critical points raised when HSVM is used as a diagnostic
method [17]. Even highly standardized and gentle brushings mostly provide merely tiny
cell conglomerates or single cells that are ripped out of their natural environment. This may
lead to additional analysis artefacts. Therefore, we principally avoid HSVM conclusions
from single cells (as also recognized by international HSVM specialists). We also found
a clear improvement of the sampling quality for IF and TEM as the amount of available
cell material inﬂuences the validity of the diagnosis. While TEM from fresh material
often requires time-consuming search of sparsely scattered cells in numerous resin blocks,
ALI-derived epithelial stripes provide large lawns of trimmed cilia. This increases the
chance of getting optimally oriented orthogonal transects in one or two sections from only
two blocks. TEM assessment can thus usually be based on several hundreds of cilia cross
sections obtained at half of the effort and costs needed for fresh samples. The same was
true for IF: slides from cell culture contain more nicely stained epithelial cells reducing
considerably the time needed to perform a valid analysis. An additional advantage of
routinely performed cell cultivation is that leftover cells not used for diagnostics in the
ﬁrst round can be cryostored and used as backup cells (if the primary cell culture should
not re-differentiate successfully or if further tests are needed (e.g., RNA sequencing from
differentiated cells because of unclear genetics results)) and/or for research purposes (if
patients consent), as recognized earlier [26].

4.3. Limitations and Strengths
Our study presents a realistic scenario using real world patients’ data. We principally
highlight the practical aspects of our workﬂow, as such descriptions are often lacking in
other studies. These could be particularly helpful for diagnostic centers. Our diagnostic
algorithm includes an integral set of several methods including cell culture as preparatory
step. Thus, we can evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the different morpho-
functional approaches HSVM, IF, TEM, and the potential improvement by the use of cell
cultures. By our intention to present a real live report, patient data was exclusively obtained
during our routine diagnostic workﬂow. A limitation of the study is that, according to
our diagnostic workﬂow, TEM and genetics are not performed if previous results clearly
showed no evidence for PCD and the clinical suspicion is low. In order to comply with
state regulations to reduce healthcare costs, the expensive TEM analytics and genetic panel
diagnostics were only performed upon high suspicion based on clinics and other test
results. Additionally, genetics need a special approval by the health insurance. Therefore,
we did not have results of all methods for all patients. Three cases remained inconclusive
due to missing analytic data (2× refusal of further investigation, 1x ongoing analysis), but
are consciously part of the ﬁrst 100 patients referred to PCD-UNIBE. Such situations are an
authentic part of the daily work in our PCD diagnostic center.
4.4. Comparison with the Literature
In our study population, prevalence of PCD diagnosis (17%) was rather high com-
pared to a previous study with a prevalence of approximately 10% [22]. There are two
reasons for this high diagnostic yield: (i) when we started the comprehensive approach for
PCD diagnostic in 2018, we worked up several previously unclear, but clinically highly
suspicious cases. The proportion of patients diagnosed with PCD among them was higher
than among the routinely referred ones. This may falsely indicate that our comprehensive
workﬂow enables a superior detection rate. (ii) Among the ﬁrst 100 patients were two
families with four and three members, respectively, also contributing to the high preva-
lence. The family with four members was affected by mutations in the DNAH11 gene.
Interestingly, we found many DNAH11 cases (8 out of 10 genetically solved cases), also
among the cases we work-up again. Additionally, one of the diagnosed, but genetically
unsolved cases have one pathologic variant in the DNAH11 gene (but so far, no second
one). The high proportion of DNAH11 mutations, especially in worked up cases, probably
reﬂects the former diagnostic approach with focus on TEM (TEM hallmark defect is still
ofﬁcially needed to reclaim support from the Swiss disability insurance) and HSVM of
fresh samples. The fact that cilia of patients with DNAH11 mutations show a normal TEM
ultrastructure explains that these cases had not been diagnosed previously. This highlights
again that a comprehensive approach based on different methods is essential.
4.5. Clinical and Practical Relevance
Patients with suspicion of PCD have the right to know whether they suffer from
PCD or not. Since every method on its own misses a considerable part of PCD cases
(e.g., approximately 30% for TEM and genetics if tested individually [17]), all currently
available methods are needed. In our study, every method missed at least four PCD cases
(24% of all 17 PCD cases). Even though current therapy is similar for patients with a
clinically high suspicion of PCD and those with conﬁrmed PCD, it is still important to
precisely know the underlying causes of clinical symptoms [30]. A clear diagnosis may
be of importance for parents who are considering having more children. In addition,
since some PCD mutations are associated with infertility, a clear diagnosis with known
underlying genetic defect is important for the future family planning. Last, having a clear
diagnosis of PCD and its speciﬁc genetic mutation is important with regard to therapeutic
regimens. Recently, ﬁrst evidence-based data for therapies, speciﬁcally for PCD (e.g., with
macrolide antibiotics [31]), became available, and initiatives for molecular treatments or

Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1540

gene therapies for PCD are ongoing (e.g., CLEAN-PCD study, ClinicalTrials.gov Identiﬁer:
NCT02871778).
5. Conclusions
Diagnosis of PCD is challenging and every method included in our diagnostic al-
gorithm contributed to ﬁnal diagnoses. In our approach, the use of ALI cell cultures for
HSVM, IF, and TEM was particularly crucial. However, none of the methods was able to
diagnose all 17 PCD cases singlehandedly, highlighting that a comprehensive approach is
essential for an accurate PCD diagnostics.

Appendix A. Supplementary Methods’ Description
Appendix A.1. Nasal Brushing: Procedure and Processing
After the patients clean their nose, nasal epithelial cells (NECs) are obtained by nasal
brushings using one pre-wetted (cold 0.9% NaCl in a 15 mL tube) interdental brush (IDB-
G50 3 mm, Top Caredent, Zurich, Switzerland; elongated by attaching a 200 µL pipette
tip with paraﬁlm; Figure A1) for each nostril, as previously described [32]. Brieﬂy, the
brush is inserted into and removed out of the inferior turbinate of the nasal cavity a
couple of times, while rotating and slightly pressing against the lateral edges of the nasal
cavity. Brushes with obtained cells are immediately stored in a 15 mL tube with RPMI-
1640 media with HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany, cat#R7388) (using
PneumaCult Expansion Plus (PC-Ex-Pl) media (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver,
Canada, cat#05040) with additional 20 mM HEPES Buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#H0887) for
brushes shipped from other hospitals (storage up to 4–5 h)).
Under a biosafety cabinet, the elongated brushes are washed with the medium in
the tube by pipetting the medium slowly over the brush (using 1 mL of media). After
this, all cells are remove by gently pushing and pulling the brush through an adapted
200 µL tip (cut of approximately 5 mm of the tip to have a larger hole), while keeping
the tip submerged in the medium. This procedure is repeated with all brushes. After
centrifugation (room temperature (RT), 5 min, 300 rcf; this setting is used throughout
this protocol, unless stated otherwise), the cell pellet is resuspended in 1.6 mL PC-Ex-
Pl medium. This 1.6 mL is then used for various diagnostic tests: (i) 60 µL for HSVM;
(ii) 400 µL is used for the preparation of eight IF slides (50 µL/slide; Cellspin Cytoslides
uncoated, one circle, Tharmac, Wiesbaden, Germany, 310-100, VWR 720-1808, air dried
and stored at −20 ◦C); (iii) 100 µL is ﬁxed for TEM if HSVM shows large conglomerates of
epithelial cells with cilia; and (iv) 1 mL (or more, just the remaining) is used for cell culture.

Appendix A.2. Cell Culture
Appendix A.2.1. Preparation of Media
For the culturing of the primary NECs, we use the Stemcell PneumaCult media.
Additionally, for the preparation of the ready-to-use media, 50 µL and 200 µL aliquots of
Hydrocortisone (Stemcell #07926, stored at −20 ◦C), 1 mL and 100 µL aliquots of Primocin
(InvivoGen, Toulouse, France, cat. ant-pm-2, stored at −20 ◦C) as well as Heparin (Stemcell
#07980, stored at 2–8 ◦C) were needed.
The PC-Ex-Pl medium is used for the submerged periods (passage 0 and passage 1 in
plates or ﬂasks, and p2 on the inserts until conﬂuent). This medium kit (Stemcell, #05040)
comes with a “Basal Medium” (#05041, 2–8 ◦C) and a “Supplement” (#05042, −20 ◦C).
Upon receiving a new kit, the basal medium is aliquoted into 10 × 49 mL portions (in

Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1540
15 of 21
50 mL conical tubes (Greiner, Monroe, NC, USA, cat.no. 277261) and stored at 4 ◦C. The
supplement is thawed and then gently, but very well mixed, aliquoted into 10 × 1000 µL
portions and frozen at −20 ◦C. As needed, the complete medium is prepared: 1 mL of the
PC-Ex-Pl supplement is added to the previously prepared 49 mL PC-Ex-Pl basal medium,
along with 50 µL of hydrocortisone and 100 µL of primocin. This complete PC-Ex-Pl
medium can be stored at 4 ◦C for up to 4 weeks.
Later, when the cells are conﬂuent and exposed to the air-liquid interface (ALI), the
cell culture is nourished through the PneumaCult ALI Maintenance (PC-ALI) medium.
The PC-ALI medium kit (Stemcell, #05001) contains a basal medium (Stemcell, #05002), a
supplement (Stemcell #05003) and a maintenance supplement (Stemcell, #05006). For the
preparation of the complete PC-ALI base medium, ﬁrst the PC-ALI Supplement needs to
be thawed, in either cold water or overnight at 4 ◦C. When thawed, it can be mixed gently
through inversion of the vial. Then, the whole 50 mL of the supplement is added to the
450 mL of basal medium, along with 1 mL of Primocin. Then, this complete base medium
is aliquoted to 40 mL in 50 mL Greiner tubes and frozen at −20 ◦C. Then, when needed,
the complete, ready-to-use PC-ALI medium can be prepared. After the 40 mL complete
basal medium thaws, 400 µL of PC-ALI maintenance supplement (comes in 1 mL vials; we
usually remove the 400 µL we need for the preparation of the complete PC-ALI medium,
transfer 400 µL to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube and freeze this, and the original tube with
the remaining 200 µL again at −20 ◦C for later use) along with 200 µL of hydrocortisone
and 80 µL of heparin are mixed. To avoid the risk of fungal contaminations, 400 µL of
amphotericin (Sigma-Aldrich, #A2942) can be added. This complete PC-ALI medium can
be used immediately or stored at 4 ◦C for up to 2 weeks.
Appendix A.2.2. Preparation of Well Plates
Before the brushing arrives at the lab, the 12-well plates should be coated. The two
central wells (b2, b3 of a Falcon 12-well plate, REF353043) are coated with 500 µL diluted
PureCol (PureCol Collagen, cat.no. 5005B, Advanced Biomatrix, Carlsbad, CA, USA;
diluted 1:10 with sterile water) and incubated for at least 30 min at 37 ◦C (or overnight at
RT). After this, the excess PureCol is removed and the wells are washed with 500 µL PBS
(without Ca2+ and Mg2+) (Sigma-Aldrich, #D8537). The PBS from one well is aspirated (to
add the cells suspension); the PBS of the second well is left in (until the next day, when
the supernatant from the ﬁrst well will be transferred to the second well after the Accutase
treatment).
Appendix A.2.3. Procedure of Cell Cultivation
The cells, after being removed from the brushes, are resuspended in 1.6 mL PC-
Ex-Pl medium (as described above), and 1 mL is then used to be seeded in one coated
well of a 12-well plate (called passage 0). The day after the brushing, medium from the
previously seeded well is transferred to a 15 mL tube, centrifuged (300 rcf, 5 min, RT; all
subsequent centrifugation steps are performed with the same settings unless otherwise
stated), resuspended in 1 mL Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich, #A6964-100 mL), and kept for
30 min at 37 ◦C. Subsequently, the cell suspension is centrifuged and again resuspended in
1 mL PC-Ex-Pl and added to a second coated and rinsed well in the same 12-well plate; One
mL of fresh PC-Ex-Pl is added to this ﬁrst well with the already adhered cells. We usually
change media on Monday mornings, and Wednesday and Friday afternoons. Ideally, the
media of passage 0 cells is changed every day or at least every second day. However,
we do not change media over the weekends. The cells are cultured until a maximum
of 60–80% conﬂuence is reached (usually after 3–4 days). If cells do not reach 60–80%
conﬂuence after one week, depending on the growth process, they are still passaged, in
the hope that the provision of a new stimulus might improve growth. Cells are lifted
using Accutase (8–10 min at 37 ◦C, 1 mL for a well of a 12-well plate, ﬂushed off with
the Accutase at least 5 times). The cells in the Accutase are transferred to a 15 mL tube,
containing 10 mL RPMI, and centrifuged. After aspiration of the supernatant, the cell

Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1540
16 of 21
pellet is resuspended in 1 mL PC-Ex-Pl medium and seeded in a pre-coated (incubation
with 2 mL diluted PureCol for 30 min at 37 ◦C, see preparation of well plates) T25 tissue
culture ﬂask (blue vented cap, Falcon, Corning, NY, USA; #353108) (with 5 mL of media in
total) until again conﬂuence of a maximum of 60–80% is reached (usually after 5–7 days;
rather use of the cells at 50% conﬂuence than risking reaching >80%, especially over
the weekend). Then, the cells are lifted and collected again with Accutase (see above)
and seeded in uncoated tissue culture transwell (Corning Transwell polyester membrane
inserts, pore size 0.4 µm, diameter 12 mm, CLS3460-48EA, Sigma-Aldrich) at a density of
100,000 cells/transwell and supplemented with 1 mL in the lower, basolateral chamber,
where no cells are, and 0.5 mL PC-Ex-Pl in the upper, apical chamber, where the cells were
seeded into. We usually seed out into three inserts. The leftover cells are frozen in vials
with roughly one million cells (using 1 mL of CyroStor freezing media, Sigma-Aldrich,
#C2874) as backup if the cell culture would not successfully differentiate. Medium is again
changed three times/week (see above). One day after the cells reach complete conﬂuence
(usually 2–5 days after seeding), they are exposed to the air-liquid interface (ALI) and fed
with 700 µL/well PC-ALI (Stemcell, cat#05001, preparations see above) media from the
basolateral chamber only.
After seven or more days at ALI, cultures undergo a weekly PBS wash (Dulbecco’s
Phosphate Buffered Saline with MgCl2 and CaCl2 (PBS++), Sigma D8537-500 mL) to remove
excess mucus. Before the medium is changed, 500 µL of PBS++ is added to the apical
chamber of the insert. The plates are then left at RT for 15 min. After this, the apical PBS
and the basal medium is removed and 700 µL of fresh PC-ALI medium is added. Normally
after about 7–10 days at the ALI, the cell cultures start to produce mucus, and after about
14–21 days, the ﬁrst moving cilia were seen. Cell cultures used for the experiments are
exposed for ≥28 days at the ALI. Cultures that are at ALI for over 4 weeks are transferred
to maintenance and the medium is only changed once per week, along with a PBS wash
(see above).
Appendix A.2.4. Processing of Mature ALI Cultures
When the culture is allowed to mature at the ALI for 28 days, it is used for different
diagnostic tests. We use one insert for the HSVM ALI and the IF slides (half for each
method), and one-half insert for the TEM.
For the HSVM and IF analysis, all medium from the basolateral chamber is transferred
to the apical one and the cells are scratched off from the whole membrane of this insert
using a 1000 µL ﬁlter tip. Then, the media with the cell pieces is added to a 15 mL Greiner
tube; 60 µL media with small pieces for the HSVM is then transferred to our self-assembled
imaging chamber (see under HSVM). The tube with the remaining media is centrifuged.
After aspiration of the supernatant, the cell pellet is resuspended in 1 mL Accutase. The
tube is placed in the incubator for 30 min. After the incubation, the cells are resuspended
thoroughly, but gently, and centrifuged. After aspiration of the supernatant, the cell pellet
is resuspended in, usually, 400-µL RPMI medium (RPMI-1640 Medium, with L-glutamine
and sodium bicarbonate, Sigma-Aldrich, #R8758) (50 µL per slide, thus 400 µL for 8 slides);
50 µL is then added to each slide (for details, see above under processing of brushing).
For TEM, the cells are ﬁxed in glutaraldehyde (GA, for details of concentrations, see
below); 1 mL of GA is added to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube. Taking another insert of the
mature culture and using a scalpel, one half of the membrane is cut out of the insert holder
and placed in the GA tube, which is stored at 4 ◦C until further processed (the other
half is usually ﬁxed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for potential 3D immunoﬂuorescence
stainings).
Appendix A.3. High-Speed Videomicroscopy (HSVM)
Every patient sample is principally assessed twice by HSVM: the freshly brushed
material and scratched material from the ALI cell culture. The ﬁrst analysis is conducted
immediately after the cells arrive in the lab (called “HSVM fresh”). The second analysis is

Diagnostics 2021, 11, 1540

performed when the cell culture is successfully re-differentiated after four weeks at the ALI,
approximately six weeks after the brushing (called “HSVM ALI”). A 60 µL drop of cell
suspension is brought within a round 200 µm thick rubber spacer (CoverWell silicone ring
(Grace Bio-Labs, Bend, OR, USA, Ref 645401) on a standard glass slide (microscopy slide
(VWR, Dietikon, Switzerland, 631-1553) (Figure A2) and covered tightly with a standard
cover slip (22 × 22 mm, DURAN GROUP, Wertheim, Germany, cat.no. 23550327).
Intact three-dimensional cell stripes are obtained by gently scratching off the epithelial
tissue from the inserts of the ALI cell cultures (for more details see below). A minimum of
10 videos with side views and usually two top views of the cell groups are recorded at RT
(23–25 ◦C). Each video is entirely processed within our own software (“Cilialyzer”) and
assessed by a scoring system developed by S. Tschanz, considering recent publications [18].
The evaluation criteria are (1) ciliary beating pattern (CBP) with a score from 0 to 4, with
”4” indicating a physiological, complete pattern with power and recovery stroke showing
appropriate bending for each phase and “0” indicating no pattern at all. (2) Ciliary beating
amplitude with a score from 0 to 4, with “4” being a full amplitude, and “0” having
no amplitude at all. (3) Intracellular coordination of ciliary beating with a score from
0 to 2, with “2” showing a well-coordinated ciliary motion within a single cell and “0”
showing no coordination at all. (4) Intercellular coordination of ciliary beating with a
score from 0 to 2, with “2” showing well-coordinated, propagating ciliary motion of cilia
over several cells with physiological temporal displacement and cooperation (metachronal
wave) and “0” showing no coordination between cells at all. (5) Cilia-associated transport
of available particles (cell fragments, erythrocytes etc.) is analyzed with a score of either
“1” (transport observed) or “0” (no transport present). (6) Ciliary beat frequency (CBF)
is estimated within several regions of interest (ROI): After selecting a ROI, CBF and its
standard deviation are computed within the “Cilialyzer” software based on the generation
of the grey level Fourier power spectrum. CBF is laboratory and technique-dependent;
therefore, it is recommended to establish a standard CBF with healthy control cells. These
scores are ﬁlled in an Excel template (see Supplementary Material) and the average of each
of the six parameters is calculated to obtain a ﬁnal score. A score >3 for CBP and amplitude
and >1.5 for both coordination types and CBF between 7 and 12 Hz are considered as “no
evidence for PCD”, while a score <2 for CBP and amplitude and <1 for the two coordination
types and a CBF <7 or >12 Hz reﬂects “high evidence for PCD”. The scores between the
just indicated ranges is considered “inconclusive”. Furthermore, prevalent high frequent
(>15 Hz) ﬂickering of cilia with low amplitude and absent bending, as well as rotational
movements in top-views are considered as “high evidence for PCD”. At PCD-UNIBE, two
diagnostic research specialists always assess all of the recordings. Additionally, to each
recording speciﬁc observations, such as rotation, impaired partial bending, obstructing
cell debris or mucus, or cilia length, are noted. These comments are checked for repeat
pathologies (e.g., reduced distal bending) throughout the different videos and a sample
quality is assessed (e.g., groups of cells, vitality, ciliation, mucus, etc.). The ﬁnal HSVM
verdict is a combination of the scores and the observation aspects in all available samples
(usually fresh and ALI cells culture).
Remark about heterogeneity: in regard to the fresh HSVM, we recommend selecting gen-
erally vital looking cells with active ciliary movement—considering that frequent artifacts,
due to the brushing, can result in secondary dyskinesia, giving the beneﬁt of the doubt that
the more active beating represents the more physiological conditions. Conversely, concern-
ing ALI HSVM, secondary dyskinesia effects should have been considerably mitigated: the
intact epithelial stripes from the ALI insert should closer represent physiological conditions
and any dyskinetic movements should be regarded as a possible pathology.

Appendix A.4. Immunoﬂuorescence (IF)
We prefer to perform immunoﬂuorescence staining with slides derived from the ALI
cell cultures, as the quality and number of nicely ciliated cells are usually higher when
compared to the fresh slides. However, slides from the fresh sample can be used. We
usually ﬁrst stain for the proteins DNAH5, GAS8, and RSHP9 (our standard panel) and,
depending on the ﬁndings of those stainings and the HSVM, we perform other stainings.
We have established protocols for the following proteins (in addition to the standard panel):
DNAH9, DNAH11, DNALI1, dynein axonemal intermediate chain 1 (DNAI1), DNAI1,
coiled-coil domain containing 40 (CCDC40), RSPH1, and RSPH4a (see Table S1 for details
about the antibodies).
The protocol for DNAH5, DNALI1, GAS8, RSPH9, CCDC40, DNAI1, and DNAI2
is as follows: ﬁrst, slides are taken from the −20 ◦C freezer and allowed to defrost at RT.
We use, for each patient, one slide per antibody, and for each staining cycle, we include
one slide of a healthy control per antibody and an additional slide for a secondary only
control for the healthy control and each patient (stained with tubulin and both secondary
antibodies). An additional circle is drawn with the Dako Pen (S2002, Dako, Agilent, Santa
Clara, CA, USA) around the circle already printed on the slide. Cells are ﬁxed using 200 µL
of 4% paraformaldehyde 15 min at RT (ﬁxation buffer: 4% PFA; made with 10 mL 16% PFA
(Lucerna Chem, Lucerne, Switzerland, #15710) and 30 mL phosphate-buffered saline (PBS;
made from PBS tablets (GIBCO, ThermoFischer, Waltham, MA, USA, #18912-014), two
tablets in 1 L Milli-Q water). After one wash with PBS, the cells are permeabilized using
200 µL permeabilization buffer (PBS with 0.2% triton (100 mL PBS, 200 µL Triton-×100
(Sigma Aldrich, #T9284), pipette slowly as it is viscous, allow to fully dissolve) for 10 min
at RT. After washing with PBS again, the slides are blocked with 200 µL blocking buffer
(PBS with 5% milk powder (10 mL PBS, 0.5 g milk powder (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany,
#T145.2)) for 1 h at RT. Meanwhile, the primary antibodies (details see in Table A1) are
prepared in blocking buffer, with the addition of tubulin (details see in Table A1) to each
tube. Blocking buffer is removed and slides are dabbed with a paper towel to remove excess
blocking buffer. Then, cells are incubated overnight at 4 ◦C in a wet and closed chamber
with the primary antibodies (200 µL each, dilutions for all antibodies, except beta-tubulin,
which works with a dilution of 1:1000). The next day, the slides are washed four times
with PBS (1× wash down, 1× 3 min, 2× 10 min). Meanwhile, the secondary antibodies are
prepared in freshly prepared blocking buffer and kept in dim light (goat anti-mouse 488 in
a dilution of 1:2500, goat anti-rabbit 546 in a dilution of 1:1000) and 200 µL is added to the
slides, 1.5 h at RT (protected from light). Afterwards, the antibody solutions are removed
and the slides are again washed four times with PBS (1× wash down, 1× 3 min, and
2× 10 min). Lastly, the slides are mounted with one drop of Antifade Mounting Medium
with DAPI (hardset, ENZO Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA, #ENZ-53003), covered
with a cover glass (Cover glass, 22 × 22 mm, Duran Group, 235503207), and stored at 4 ◦C
protected from light.

For DNAH11 and DNAH9, the staining process differs slightly: Washing steps are
always performed using PBS-Triton. After the permeabilization, the cells are washed with
200 µL PBS-Triton for 3 min and 2× 10 min. The blocking buffer is prepared with PBS-
Triton and the antibodies are diluted in PBS-Triton. Secondary antibodies are incubated for
30 min only and before mounting the cells, there is one additional washing with PBS (not
PBS-Triton). Pictures of at least 10 cells are taken with a Leica DMI4000 B Multipurpose
Fluorescence System using the 63× oil objective. Every channel is imaged separately and
an overlay of all colors is done.
Appendix A.5. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
TEM processing is performed as previously described [21]. Brieﬂy, tissue from nasal
brushings (only if HSVM shows big pieces of cells with cilia) and or cell culture membranes
(see chapter “Processing of mature ALI cultures” for more details) are ﬁxed in 2.5% GA
(350 mOsm, buffered with 0.15 M HEPES at pH7.4) and postﬁxed with 1% OsO4 (EMS,
Hatﬁeld, PA, USA) in 0.1 M Na-cacodylate-buffer (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at 4 ◦C for
1 h. After another washing (0.05 M maleic NaOH-buffer three times for 5 min), the tissue
is dehydrated with 70%, 80%, and 96% ethanol (Alcosuisse, Rüti b. Büren, Switzerland)
for 15 min each at RT. Then, the tissue is immersed in 100% ethanol (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany; three times, 10 min), in acetone (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany; two times, 10 min)
and in acetone-Epon (1:1) overnight at RT. The following day, the tissue is embedded
in Epon (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) and left to harden (60 ◦C, 5 days). The
orientation of tissue from ALI inserts (providing large epithelial stripes) is observable
under a light microscope. A small block of epon containing the tissue is subsequently
sawed out and realigned, allowing for optimal orientation of semi- and ultra-thin sectioning
in order to get numerous orthogonal cilia cross sections.
An ultramicrotome UC6 (Leica Microsystems, Vienna, Austria) is used to produce
semi-thin (1 um, for light microscopy, stained 0.5% toluidine blue O (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) and ultra-thin sections (70–80 nm, for electron microscopy). The ultra-thin
sections are mounted on 200 mesh copper grids and stained with a Leica Ultrostainer (Leica
Microsystems, Vienna, Austria) using UranyLess (EMS, Hatﬁeld, PA, USA) and lead citrate.
Sections are viewed on a transmission electron microscope (Tecnai Spirit, FEI, Brno,
Czech Republic) equipped with a 4 Megapixel digital camera (Veleta, Olympus, Soft Imag-
ing System, Münster, Germany) at 80 kV. Moreover, 30 to 50 images with ﬁnal magniﬁcation
of 60,000× are captured providing at least 100–200 orthogonal ciliary transects. One axis
tilting of the specimen holder in the range of maximally 20◦is sometimes used to increase
the delineation of axonemal structures and dynein arms. The ultrastructural analysis is
mainly based on the detection of the hallmark signs of the axonemal structure and the
dynein motor proteins, according to the international consensus guidelines on TEM in PCD

diagnosis [24]. The result of the visual evaluation is transferred to an Excel form, providing
scores of PCD probability (this Excel form can be found under Supplementary Material).
Appendix A.6. Genetics—Whole Genome Sequencing at HUG
For genetic analysis, patients’ blood samples (collected in EDTA tubes) are sent to
genetic testing centers (Molecular and Genetic Diagnostic Lab, University Hospital Geneva
or Human Genetics, Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Switzerland) to check for genetic
variants in all—by the time point of the analysis—known PCD-associated genes by whole
exome sequencing (next-generation-sequencing).
