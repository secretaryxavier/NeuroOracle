Importation and Human-to-Human Transmission  
of a Novel Coronavirus in Vietnam
To the Editor: The emergence and spread of a 
novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) from Wuhan, 
China, has become a global health concern.1 
Since the detection of the coronavirus in late 
December 2019, several countries have reported 
sporadic imported cases among travelers return-
ing from China.2 We report one family cluster of 
2019-nCoV originating from a Chinese man.
On January 22, 2020, a 65-year-old man with 
a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, coro-
nary heart disease for which a stent had been 
implanted, and lung cancer was admitted to the 
emergency department of Cho Ray Hospital, the 
referral hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, for low-
grade fever and fatigue. He had become ill with 
fever on January 17, a total of 4 days after he and 
his wife had flown to Hanoi from the Wuchang 
district in Wuhan, where outbreaks of 2019-nCoV 
were occurring. He reported that he had not 
been exposed to a “wet market” (a market where 
dead and live animals are sold) in Wuhan.
Throat swabs obtained from the patient test-
ed positive for 2019-nCoV on real-time reverse-
transcription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) 
assays.3 On admission to the hospital, the man 
was isolated and treated empirically with antivi-
ral agents, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and sup-
portive therapies. Chest radiographs obtained on 
admission showed an infiltrate in the upper lobe 
of the left lung (Fig. 1A). On January 25, he 
received supplemental oxygen through a nasal 
cannula at a rate of 5 liters per minute because 
of increasing dyspnea with hypoxemia. The par-
tial pressure of oxygen was 57.2 mm Hg while 
he was breathing ambient air, and a progressive 
infiltrate and consolidation were observed on 
chest radiographs (Fig. 1B through 1D). His fe-
ver disappeared on January 25, and his clinical 
condition has improved since January 26. His 
wife had no symptoms of illness while they were 
traveling. She was healthy as of January 28.
The couple’s healthy 27-year-old son had lived 
in Long An, a province 40 km southwest of Ho 
Chi Minh City, since October 2019. He had not 
traveled to a region where 2019-nCoV was 
spreading, and he had not had any known con-
tact with any person returning from such a re-
gion. On January 17, he met his father in Nha 
Trang in central Vietnam and shared a bedroom 
with his parents for 3 days in a hotel room that 
had an air conditioner. On January 20, a dry 
cough and fever developed in the son. He also 
reported having had vomiting and loose stools 
one time before the admission. This suggests 
that the incubation period for 2019-nCoV may 
have been 3 days or less in this case. When the 
son presented at Cho Ray Hospital with his fa-
ther on January 22, his illness, characterized by 
a fever (39°C), was recognized and he was im-
mediately isolated. Chest radiographs and other

laboratory examinations in this patient showed 
no abnormalities except for an increased level of 
C-reactive protein (13.9 mg per liter). Real-time 
RT-PCR assays for influenza A and B viruses and 
nonstructural protein 1 antigen rapid tests for 
dengue viruses were negative in both the father 
and son. A throat swab in the son was positive 
for 2019-nCoV. His father was thought to be the 
source of infection. However, sequencing of 
strains from the two patients to ascertain the 
transmission of 2019-nCoV from the father to 
son has not been performed. The son’s condition 
was stable after January 23.
This family had traveled to four cities across 
Vietnam using various forms of transportation, 
including planes, trains, and taxis. A total of 28 
close contacts have been identified, and symp-
toms of an upper respiratory infection have not 
developed in any of them. This family cluster of 
2019-nCoV infection that occurred outside China4
arouses concern regarding human-to-human 
transmission.

Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab in Non–Small-Cell Lung Cancer
To the Editor: Although more than 10% of the 
patients in the CheckMate 227 trial conducted by 
Hellmann et al. (Nov. 21 issue)1 had never 
smoked, the effect of smoking status on survival 
was not fully discussed. Striking differences in 
the clinical and molecular characteristics of lung 
cancers between smokers and those who have 
never smoked have been identified, suggesting 
that the cancers are separate entities.2
In one trial,3 patients who had never smoked 
had poorer responses to nivolumab (as com-
pared with docetaxel) than current or former 
smokers (hazard ratio for overall survival, 1.02 vs. 
0.70). In a meta-analysis involving 1981 patients, 
antibodies to programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
were less effective in those who had never 
smoked than in smokers (hazard ratio, 0.8; 95% 
confidence interval, 0.54 to 1.06; P>0.05).4 More-
over, in another meta-analysis of 11 trials, as 
compared with chemotherapy, immune check-
point inhibitor therapy was associated with sig-
nificantly lower overall survival among patients 
who had never smoked than among smokers 
(pooled hazard ratio, 0.91 vs. 0.79; P = 0.04).5
The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
has been correlated with higher neoantigen bur-
dens and more mutations in DNA-repair path-
way genes, a correlation that could have been 
affected by tobacco exposure.6 In this respect, 
concerns have been raised regarding the inclu-
sion of patients who have never smoked in trials 
of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The clinical 
benefits of these agents in patients with lung 
cancer who have never smoked need to be fur-
ther explored.
