Targeting DNA repair and the DNA damage response: Beyond the
standard PI3 kinase-like kinases
Targeting DNA repair pathways and the DNA damage response (DDR) for cancer
therapy has gained increased attention since the advent of PARP inhibitors and the
demonstration of their clinical utility in BRCA-deﬁcient cancers (1). In the subsequent 15
years, a major focus has been on development of kinase inhibitors targeting the PI3
kinase-related kinases (PIKKs) DNA-PK, ATM and ATR, to target genome stability and
DNA replication stress inherent to many cancers, and there are excellent reviews of these
efforts (2). In this collection we move beyond the standard PIKKS and present a series of
primary research articles and focused reviews on non-PIKK targets and pathways within
the DDR and DNA repair space. These represent the future of novel agents and targets
and hold considerable potential to not only delineate mechanisms of basic molecular
processes in DDR and repair but also as potential targets and therapeutics for the
treatment of cancer. Figure 1 highlights the breadth of targets and below we provide a
brief summary of the review articles and primary research papers that make up
this collection.
The review by Kelm et al. notes a variety of reasons for targeting proteins beyond the
PIKKs: (i) their potential involvement in the repair of mitochondrial DNA as well as
nuclear DNA; (ii) their role in protecting telomeres; (iii) the potential to expand the range
of clinically beneﬁcial synthetic lethal relationships; and (iv) the stimulation of the innate
immune response when DNA repair is inhibited. The small molecule inhibitors detailed
within this review target proteins in each of the four double strand break (DSB) repair
pathways including Ku70/80, Artemis, DNA Ligase IV, PNKP, MRN complex, RPA,

RAD51, RAD52, ERCC1-XPF, helicases, and DNA polymerase
q. For most of the compounds described, inhibition is based on
either direct inhibition of enzymatic activity or disruption of
protein-DNA or protein-protein interactions. While most of the
inhibitors have IC50 values in the micromolar range, and
therefore require further development, a few, such as the
arylpyrazolone carboxylic acid-based Ku inhibitors (based on
DNA-PK kinase activity) and the DNA polymerase q inhibitor
ART558, have IC50 values in the low nanomolar range.
ART4215 (an undisclosed) derivative of ART558 is now
undergoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials as a monotherapy or in
combination with the PARP inhibitor talazoparib in patients
with advanced or metastatic solid tumors, exhibiting the high
potential beneﬁt for such agents in a clinical setting.
Targeting DNA binding proteins
Small molecule inhibitors of the RAD51 protein were
initially described over a decade ago (3) and while useful tool
compounds for research in some cases, translation to the clinic
has been limited to compounds that target the Rad51 pathway
through an unknown mechanism. In this collection, Gu et al.
describe a novel class of compounds targeting Rad51 and present
evidence for a direct Rad51 interaction and modulation of the
cellular homologous recombination (HR) pathway. Intriguing
evidence of single agent anticancer activity and in combinations
in cell culture models will ultimately need to be veriﬁed in vivo to
enable translation to the clinic.
Upstream of Rad51 in HR and ATR in the DDR lies
Replication protein A (RPA), a trimeric factor that binds
single-stranded DNA with high afﬁnity, protecting these
regions from nucleolytic degradation during DNA replication,
repair and recombination, but also simultaneously controlling
these processes through speciﬁc interactions with the actors
involved. Interfering with the role of RPA in ssDNA
protection has, therefore, the potential to perturb the DDR
and leave ssDNA vulnerable to lethal degradation; consistently
prior genetic studies imply that RPA ‘exhaustion’ can be lethal in
cancer cells. VanderVere-Carozza et al. have previously
developed a series of molecules that block RPA association
with ssDNA (RPAi). In the current issue, they explore the
selectivity of these compounds, demonstrate cellular toxicity
across a range of cancer cells lines and show that stressed
replication forks undergo degradation in the presence of RPAi.
Moreover, RPAi synergy with therapeutically relevant DNA
damaging agents are reported, as are antitumor effects in
mouse xenograft models.
Metnase, whose name reﬂects a dual role as a
methyltransferase and nuclease, is a factor produced through
gene fusion and only found in primates. As reviewed by
Nickoloff et al. Metnase plays a role in multiple DNA
transactions, including in DSB repair processes, promoting
NHEJ, where both the methyltransferase and nuclease domains
FIGURE 1
Targets in the DNA damage response and DNA repair pathways. The PIKKs, depicted in blue occupy central roles in the DDR. Beyond these
targets, additional kinases are viable and interesting including Wee1, and the checkpoint kinases CHK1 and 2 (depicted in light green). Upstream
of all these events are a series of proteins that often interact with DNA to fulﬁll their roles in the DDR and DNA repair (depicted in dark green).
These include MRN, ERCC1/XPF, RPA and Ku that sense different DNA structures. Other potential targets include those that detect altered
chemistry like APE1, and XPC (depicted in light green). A number of viable targets are involved in speciﬁc DNA metabolic events including
Metnase, pol ƞ, and Rad51.

contribute to its activity. Roles for Metnase in combating tumor
replicative stress and a role mediating resistance to Topoisomerase
II poisons also argue for the development of Metnase inhibitors.
Nickoloff et al. also discuss the potential of EEPD1 structure-
selective endonuclease inhibition in cancer. This factor plays a role
in processing damaged replication forks and in promoting HR,
and a case can be made for EEPD1 inhibition to target tumor
vulnerabilities in the DDR and inherent replication stress, as well
as a strategy for enhancing tumor chemosensitivity.
Targeting kinases outside the PIKK
family
Continuing with the theme of non-PIKK related targets,
Bukhari et al. review the state-of-the-art in Wee1 inhibition.
Wee1 is a tyrosine kinase originally identiﬁed by virtue of its key
role in regulating the timing of S. pombe cell entry into mitosis,
by phosphorylating and restraining the activity of CDK1. The
role of Wee1 extends to the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, and
because many cancer cells harbor defects in the G1 checkpoint
they become highly dependent upon the G2/M checkpoint –
when the G2/M checkpoint is perturbed in such cells they will
often enter a (terminal) mitotic catastrophe. Targeting Wee1 is
also a potentially attractive therapeutic strategy due to emerging
evidence regarding synthetic lethal interactions with DNA
damage response regulators and because of potential synergies
with radio- and chemotherapeutics. Bukhari et al. also describe
the dozens of Wee1 inhibitor clinical trials performed to date,
which suggest some promising results.
The checkpoint kinases have also been the subject of intense
study with a number of inhibitors discovered over the years.
Vaughan et al. in a primary research article identiﬁed the DDR
and speciﬁcally Chk1 and 2 proteins as vulnerabilities in TCS-2
mutant renal cancers. This work highlights the complexity of
pathway crosstalk and utility of chemical biology screening to
elucidate previously unknown interactions. Impressive in vivo
data are presented that demonstrate that abrogation of Chk1/2
activity with the dual AZD inhibitors results in prolonged tumor
stasis and a reduction of cysts common in mTOR-driven disease.
The question of whether speciﬁc Chk1 or Chk2 inhibitors
recapitulate the results with the dual inhibitor remains but
offer intriguing possibilities for these complex diseases.
Polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (PNKP) is another very
interesting kinase target but is responsible for phosphorylating
DNA 5’-termini as opposed to proteins. This kinase activity along
with intrinsic DNA 3’-phosphatase activity of PNKP is critical in
the repair of DNA strand breaks to prepare DNA termini for
ligation. This is especially important in the context of IR- induced
DNA damage, where chemical modiﬁcation of both bases and
sugars often give rise to termini that are unable to be ligated. In
this collection Sadat et al. describe a novel polysubstituted
imidopiperidine PNKP 3’-phosphatase inhibitor encapsulated in
a novel nano-particle formulation. Extensive analyses presented
indicate excellent pharmacokinetics, biodistribution and in vivo
efﬁcacy. The in vivo experiments conducted in a colorectal tumor
xenograft model demonstrate convincing radiosensitization and
effective tumor reduction in the nano-particle formulation
compared to the free-soluble drug, an effect that was
demonstrated to be a function of enhanced bio-distribution and
tumor uptake. Together these data position PNKP as a viable
druggable target that is poised for further translation to clinical
utility in treating cancer.
Novel targets within the NER and
BER pathways
Moving beyond DSB repair and kinases to nucleotide
excision repair (NER) and base excision repair (BER) and
crosslink repair, the manuscript by Weilbeer et al. presents
additional in silico screening of a previously reported ERCC1-
XPF inhibitor that focused on modiﬁcations of a speciﬁc side
chain, resulting in a substantial increase in potency. The
structure selective endonuclease ERCC1-XPF plays a role in
repairing damage induced by crosslinking agents like platinum-
based chemotherapies and ionizing radiation, and inhibition of
its biological activity has the potential to potently sensitize cells
to DNA damaging based therapies. The compounds discovered
disrupt the protein-protein interaction required for
heterodimerization, presenting an innovative mechanism of
action for inhibition of ERCC1-XPF endonuclease activity. A
lead hit was further evaluated and shown to sensitize cells to UV
irradiation, cyclophosphamide crosslinking and ionizing
radiation, further suggesting the potential for therapeutic
applications with this family of novel inhibitors.
Nasrallah et al. examine the role that XPC may play in
hematologic and non-dermatologic solid tumors. They point out
that in addition to its canonical participation in the NER
pathway, data strongly indicate XPC’s involvement in the BER,
double strand break repair and interstrand crosslink repair
pathways, possibly serving as a global DNA damage sensor.
The authors go on to discuss the evidence associating XPC
mutations, single-nucleotide polymorphisms and epigenetic
alterations with elevated risk of malignancies as well as clinical
response to chemotherapy. Based on these observations the
authors recommend further investigation of XPC’s potential as
a prognostic and/or predictive biomarker.
Continuing the BER theme, Mijit et al. investigated the
inﬂuence of RelA (nuclear factor NF-kB p65 subunit) on the
response of Kras-mutated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) cells to inhibitors of the redox function of Ref-1 (also
known as the DNA repair endonuclease, APE1). While the BER
activity of APE1 is targetable, the redox function has been shown
Turchi et al.

to be important for cancer survival. They observed that RelA
deﬁciency rendered the PDAC cells more resistant to the Ref-1
inhibitors. Furthermore, Ref-1 inhibition led to a marked
reduction in IL-8, FOSB, and c-Jun, but this required the
presence of active RelA. Their data indicate a critical role for
RelA in redox homeostasis of Kras-mutated PDAC cells with
implications for therapy targeting PDAC drug resistance.
Targeting DNA damage tolerance
pathways
While repair of DNA damage has garnered considerable
attention, tolerance of damage remains an important component
of how cells respond and cope with genetic abnormalities. Ler and
Carty present a comprehensive review of DNA damage tolerance
and the implication for carcinogenesis and opportunities for
impinging on this pathway to treat cancer. The two main
tolerance pathways discussed include translesion synthesis
catalyzed by the by-pass polymerases and homology directed
tolerance. The discussion of pathway choice offers unique insights
into how cells coordinate the response to damage in relation to
tolerance. Existing small molecule inhibitors of translesion
polymerases are also reviewed and highlight the opportunities to
disrupt this pathway to subvert cancer growth and resistance.
Drug development work targeting DNA repair associated
polymerases is a rapidly growing ﬁeld, and POLH represents a
novel target within this family that has clinical promise due to its
intriguing biological role in translesion synthesis that result in
cellular resistance to damage from agents such as UV light and
cisplatin. The work described by Wilson et al. presents a fragment-
based drug development (FBDD) approach that utilizes a
crystallization screen, resulting in novel x-ray crystal structures
of small drug-like compounds bound to POLH. This emerging
methodology and subsequent structural data have the potential to
drive the rapid discovery and development of novel drug-like
molecules, and may be particularly useful in developing drugs
targeting complex enzymes like those in the polymerase families.
Clearly, the DDR space remains incredibly active in both
discovery, preclinical and clinical development, with over 35
ongoing clinical trials spanning a variety of agents and targets.
Importantly, there is an expanding wealth of knowledge
regarding novel targets, therapeutic combinations and genetic
alterations that are ripe for exploitation to impact the treatment
of cancer with DDR targeted therapies. The long and circuitous
route to clinical success of PARP inhibitors has provided a solid
framework by which to pursue and evaluate the current and
future DDR targeted agents, not least in the appropriate design
of clinical trials. These experiences should remind us to not lose
site of the underlying biology nor be swept up by the latest wave
of success. The clinical reality is that the majority of those
diagnosed with cancer will succumb to the disease. Only by
pursuing the discovery and development of novel therapeutic
strategies and targets can we expand the armamentarium to
better equip our medical oncologist colleagues to impact the lives
of cancer patients.
