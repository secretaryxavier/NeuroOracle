There is a burgeoning need for innovative treatment strategies to improve the cognitive 
deﬁcits in schizophrenia. Cognitive remediation (CR) is effective at the group level, but 
the variability in treatment response is large. Given that CR may depend on intact neu-
roplasticity to produce cognitive gains, it is reasonable to combine it with strategies that 
harness patients’ neuroplastic potential. In this review, we discuss two non-pharmaco-
logical approaches that can enhance neuroplasticity and possibly augment the effects of 
CR in schizophrenia: physical exercise and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). 
Substantial body of evidence supports the beneﬁcial effect of physical exercise on cog-
nition, and a handful of studies in schizophrenia have shown that physical exercise in 
conjunction with CR has a larger impact on cognition than CR alone. Physical exercise is 
thought to stimulate neuroplasticity through the regulation of central growth factors, and 
current evidence points to brain-derived neurotrophic factor as the potential underlying 
mechanism through which physical exercise might enhance the effectiveness of CR. 
tDCS has emerged as a potential tool for cognitive enhancement and seems to affect 
the cellular mechanisms involved in long-term potentiation (LTP). A few reports have 
demonstrated the feasibility of integrating tDCS with CR in schizophrenia, but there are 
insufﬁcient data to determine if this multimodal approach leads to incremental perfor-
mance gain in patients. Larger randomized controlled trials are necessary to understand 
the mechanisms of the combined tDCS–CR intervention. Future research should take 
advantage of new developments in neuroplasticity paradigms to examine the effects of 
these interventions on LTP.

INTRODUCTION
Antipsychotic medications are useful in ameliorating positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but they 
have little eﬀect on cognitive deﬁcits (1, 2). Eﬀorts to improve cognitive deﬁcits in schizophrenia are 
of paramount importance as they are among the strongest predictors of patients’ functional outcome 
(3). Most of the eﬀorts for cognition enhancement have used pharmacological approaches (i.e., drugs 
that enhance learning and memory in animal models) (4). However, the results in larger trials have

been disappointing, and currently, there is no drug approved for 
cognition enhancement in schizophrenia (5). Terefore, treat-
ment studies in this population have started to shif to cognitive 
remediation (CR) strategies. Although CR in schizophrenia is 
eﬀective at the group level (6, 7), there is substantial individual 
variability in treatment response, and many patients exhibit little 
beneﬁt (8). Moreover, the training eﬀects resulting from CR alone 
do not always generalize to improvements in real-life functioning 
(9). Tus, as the best validated treatment for the cognitive dys-
function in schizophrenia, CR only leads to a moderate eﬀect-size 
improvement in cognition (0.45), with an even lower impact on 
daily functioning (0.36) (6, 9). It is, therefore, critical to consider 
ways of enhancing the impact of CR.
Recently, “neuroplasticity-based” interventions have been 
developed to train perceptual processes in schizophrenia, while 
also engaging attentional and working memory operations (10). 
Tese interventions are explicitly designed to drive adaptive 
plastic changes throughout distributed prefrontal–temporo–
parietal systems (11). Many studies in schizophrenia patients 
have demonstrated that this neuroscience-informed approach to 
training generates meaningful restoration of prefrontal functions 
and higher-order cognition (12–14), with associated improve-
ments in community functioning (15). Tus, neuroplasticity may 
be an important mechanism underlying eﬀective intervention 
approaches. However, this CR method requires lengthy hours 
of repetitive, intensive practice to induce signiﬁcant changes. 
Combining CR with strategies that promote neuroplasticity may 
not only lead to larger and longer-lasting improvements, but also 
require shorter training protocols. Although there have been 
eﬀorts to combine CR with cognitive-enhancing medications that 
aﬀect neuroplasticity, such as d-cycloserine (16) and modaﬁnil 
(17), less attention has been devoted to non-pharmacological 
approaches that could potentially augment CR eﬀects and maxi-
mize improvements in functional outcomes. In this brief review, 
we will discuss two recent non-pharmacological approaches that 
are thought to enhance neuroplasticity in schizophrenia: physi-
cal exercise and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). 
It should be noted that there are many other neurostimulation 
techniques that have been discussed in the literature, such as 
transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial electrical 
stimulation (TES), magnetic seizure therapy, vagus nerve stimu-
lation, and deep brain stimulation. However, only tDCS has been 
combined with CR.
REVIEW OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE  
AND tDCS STUDIES
Physical Exercise and Cognition
Te beneﬁcial eﬀects of physical exercise on cognition are well 
documented in healthy individuals, as well as across many medical 
and psychiatric illnesses (18–20). Accumulating evidence suggests 
that exercise reduces pro-inﬂammatory processes and peripheral 
risk factors (i.e., obesity and diabetes) that are associated with 
cognitive decline (21). Furthermore, it stimulates hippocampal 
neuroplasticity and promotes angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and 
synaptogenesis through the regulation of central growth factors 
(22). Te mechanisms of exercise-induced cognitive improve-
ments seem, to a large extent, to be related to an increased produc-
tion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays a 
pivotal role in synaptic plasticity and is particularly important for 
learning and memory (18, 23, 24). Similar to CR (25), exercise 
(26) has been shown to increase peripheral BDNF levels.
As the two approaches could potentially enhance cognition 
through overlapping neurobiological mechanisms, adding 
exercise to a CR program may further harness patients’ neu-
roplastic potential and lead to cognitive gains beyond that 
achieved by CR alone. Te evidence from animal research 
suggests some beneﬁt from combining these approaches. Fabel 
et al. (27), for example, showed that a combination of aerobic 
exercise and cognitive enrichment for rodents had beneﬁcial 
eﬀects on neurogenesis, leading to a 30% greater increase in 
new neurons than either activity alone. Several reports in 
healthy older adults have compared the separate vs. combined 
eﬀects of CR and exercise and shown superior eﬀects of the 
combined intervention on verbal/working memory (28, 29), 
divided attention (30), as well as global cognitive performance 
and everyday functioning (31). Studies in children (32) have 
also shown that training programs that integrate physical exer-
cise with computer-based training games improved learning 
and increased gains on school-administered math and reading 
achievement tests.
Physical Exercise in Schizophrenia
Physical activity has been shown to ameliorate the psychotic 
and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and improve patients’ 
quality of life by reducing health problems ofen associated with 
the illness (33, 34). Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have 
been published recently demonstrating that physical exercise, 
especially aerobic exercise, improves cognitive functioning in 
schizophrenia patients, with corresponding increases in white 
matter integrity and structural connectivity (35), hippocampal 
volume (36), and BDNF signaling (37). A recent meta-analysis 
(38) identiﬁed 10 trials (7 RCTs and 3 non-randomized studies) 
evaluating the cognitive eﬀects of exercise in schizophrenia. 
Pooled eﬀect sizes across all outcomes showed that exercise 
signiﬁcantly improved cognition (particularly attention, working 
memory, and social cognition) more than the control conditions. 
Te treatment eﬀect size of 0.33 (95% CI = 0.13–0.53, p = 0.001) 
across all studies and 0.43 (95% CI = 0.21–0.66, p < 0.001) in 
RCTs suggests that the beneﬁcial eﬀect of exercise on cognition 
in schizophrenia is comparable to that of CR.
Physical Exercise plus CR in 
Schizophrenia
We are aware of three published studies that have combined CR 
and exercise in schizophrenia. In one study (39), 29 patients were 
randomly assigned to either CR and exercise or CR and mental 
relaxation. Te interventions were 4-week long and consisted of 
three weekly sessions (30 min of CR and 45 min of either aerobic 
exercise or relaxation). Both groups showed cognitive gains in 
the domains of processing speed, working memory, and visual 
learning, improvement in subjective well-being, and reduction

in negative symptoms. However, the eﬀects were superior for the 
combined cognitive and physical training group.
In another study (40), 22 patients were enrolled in a 12-week 
endurance-training program augmented with CR and compared 
to a matched control group. Patients in the endurance training 
group exercised on bicycle ergometers, while those in the control 
group played table soccer for 30 min three times a week. Afer 
6 weeks of the intervention period, CR was added in each group, 
for two 30 min-sessions a week. Results showed that, compared 
to the control condition, endurance training and CR signiﬁcantly 
improved short- and long-term verbal memory, cognitive ﬂex-
ibility, global and social functioning, and negative symptoms. 
Unfortunately, the lack of random assignment, baseline diﬀer-
ences between the groups, and the fact that the cognitive and 
clinical improvement in the combined training group was only 
seen afer CR was added to the intervention make the ﬁndings 
diﬃcult to interpret.
Last, a pilot study of recent-onset schizophrenia patients 
randomly assigned participants to 10 weeks of CR and exercise 
(n = 7) or CR alone (n = 9) (41). Te CR intervention consisted 
of 2 h of auditory and social cognitive training twice/week, and 
exercise consisted of 30–45 min of aerobic conditioning 4 days/
week. Results showed that the diﬀerential gains in global cogni-
tion and functional outcome were larger in the combined inter-
vention group relative to the CR group, with Cohen’s f eﬀect sizes 
of 0.48 for the MCCB overall composite and 0.88 for independent 
living skills.
tDCS and Cognition
In recent years, neurostimulation has been developed as a 
non-invasive tool for cognitive enhancement (42, 43), with a 
primary advantage of having fewer side eﬀects than pharmaco-
logical treatment (44). Unlike other brain stimulation techniques  
(e.g., TMS, TES), tDCS uses a weak electrical current (1–2 mA) to 
alter spontaneous neuronal network activity by shifing membrane 
potentials in a hyperpolarizing or depolarizing direction without 
inducing neuronal ﬁring (45–47). tDCS changes the excitability 
of neurons in a polarity-dependent manner (48), such that anodal 
stimulation enhances cortical excitability, whereas cathodal 
stimulation decreases it (49). Various electrode montages can be 
applied to the scalp to modulate diﬀerent areas of activity in the 
brain. Although tDCS has coarse spatial targeting, a few minutes 
of stimulation can lead to changes in cortical excitability lasting 
for over an hour (50).
Te therapeutic eﬀect of tDCS is thought to stem from its 
impact on the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in 
long-term potentiation (LTP) (51, 52), and its afer eﬀects seem 
to be NMDA-receptor dependent (53). Tus, similar to physi-
cal exercise (21) and CR (54), tDCS appears to increase cortical 
plasticity (55) and could have additive or synergistic eﬀects with 
CR, allowing for better cognitive outcomes.
A handful of studies in healthy samples have administered 
tDCS during specialized cognitive training and shown a 
performance-enhancing eﬀect on the trained task (56) and gen-
eralization to untrained tasks (57). For instance, Martin et al. (56) 
demonstrated increased accuracy on a dual-working memory 
task during concurrent active tDCS vs. sham, but the eﬀect was 
only present during the stimulation period and did not result 
in greater subsequent learning. Tis short-lived “online” eﬀect 
has also been observed during combined tDCS and behavioral 
inhibition training (58). Additionally, Andrews et al. (57) found 
that completing an n-back task while receiving tDCS resulted 
in greater improvement in performance on Digit Span Forward 
compared to either tDCS or the cognitive activity alone. Similarly, 
the simultaneous administration of tDCS and computerized CR 
in healthy older adults signiﬁcantly improved working memory 
compared with CR alone (59). Te superiority in performance 
with this integrated approach was also evident in studies combin-
ing multiple repeated tDCS sessions with training on a motor skill 
task (52) and artiﬁcial numerical learning task (60).
tDCS in Schizophrenia
Most studies examining the eﬀects of tDCS in schizophrenia have 
administered the stimulation at rest, while the subject is engaged 
in a passive activity, such as watching a movie, followed by an 
“oﬄine” assessment of interest. In diﬀerent randomized sham-
controlled trials, tDCS was found to enhance working memory 
(61), probabilistic association learning (62), and composite 
scores on measures of cognition (63), when applied to the lef 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. More speciﬁcally, Hoy et al. (61) 
reported signiﬁcantly better performance over time on a work-
ing memory task following a single tDCS session compared to 
sham (p  =  0.027). Although Vercammen et  al. (62) found no 
signiﬁcant eﬀect at the group level, a subgroup of patients with 
adequate learning at baseline improved with active tDCS. In 
Smith et al.’s RCT (63), active compared to sham tDCS subjects 
showed signiﬁcant improvements afer the ﬁfh tDCS session 
in the MCCB overall composite (p  =  0.008) and the working 
memory (p = 0.002) and attention-vigilance (p = 0.027) domain 
scores, with large eﬀect sizes (Cohen’s d values ranged from 0.84 
to 1.25). Tere is also evidence that tDCS can ameliorate auditory 
hallucinations (64, 65) and negative symptoms (66) in patients, 
as well as modulate the amplitude of the mismatch negativity, an 
EEG index of basic auditory processing (67).
tDCS plus CR in Schizophrenia
Schizophrenia researchers have recently begun to investigate 
the feasibility and eﬃcacy of integrating tDCS and CR. Tere 
are currently four published reports in this area, mostly pilot-
ing this procedure in small clinical samples. In one study (68), 
two patients received a neuroplasticity-based CR intervention 
combined with tDCS and showed cognitive improvements that 
were maintained at 1-month follow-up. Te 4-week intervention 
consisted of ﬁve 45-min auditory training sessions a week with 
active tDCS administered concurrently with CR on three sessions 
per week. In another pilot study (69), patients (n = 10) received 
three working memory training sessions a week for 16 weeks, 
with active or sham tDCS applied during two of the CR sessions 
each week starting in week 3. Te authors reported enhanced 
cognitive performance on word and picture N-back tasks and 
MCCB overall composite when CR was paired with tDCS. In 
a negative ﬁndings study (70), 10 patients were randomized to 
either active or sham tDCS (10 consecutive sessions over 5 days), 
with cognitive training (administration of n-back and sequence

learning tasks) randomly applied during one of the tDCS sessions. 
Te combined approach failed to improve clinical symptoms and 
cognitive performance.
In the largest study to date (71), investigators randomly 
assigned 49 patients to CR (training on a working memory and 
implicit learning task) and either active (n = 24) or sham tDCS 
(n = 25). Te intervention was relatively short and consisted of 
four cognitive training days (day 1, day 2, day 14, and day 56), 
with two sessions on each day. tDCS was administered concomi-
tantly with CR during the second session of days 1 and 14. Results 
showed signiﬁcantly better working memory performance in the 
CR and active tDCS group relative to the CR and sham tDCS 
group. Surprisingly, the improved performance was evident on 
days 2 and 56, suggesting that tDCS had no enhancing eﬀects 
during the acute stimulation but rather long-term eﬀects on 
consolidation and learning.
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Based on the aforementioned review, it appears that both physi-
cal exercise and tDCS are intriguing candidates for augmenting 
the therapeutic eﬀects of CR in schizophrenia. Current evidence 
suggests that a multimodal intervention that combines CR with 
physical exercise has a larger impact on cognitive functioning 
than CR alone. Moreover, there is strong evidence implicating 
BDNF as the mechanism underlying the cognitive-physical 
training approach (30, 41). Nonetheless, despite the promise that 
exercise has shown in augmenting CR in schizophrenia, there are 
several methodological issues that remain unresolved. For exam-
ple, the literature is not consistent regarding the type, frequency, 
intensity, and duration of physical training necessary to produce 
the beneﬁcial eﬀects. Aerobic exercise has been the most studied 
and has produced the most consistent eﬀects on cognition. 
However, other types of physical activity, such as yoga (72, 73), 
high-intensity interval training (74), and high-velocity circuit 
resistance training (75) deserve further attention. Furthermore, 
although Firth et al. (38) showed that a greater amount of exercise 
is associated with larger cognitive improvement, Kimhy et al. (76) 
found that it is the ﬁdelity with target training intensity, rather 
than the frequency and duration of exercise, which correlates 
with changes in cognition. Some review studies (23, 72, 77) 
suggest a minimum of three sessions per week (at least 30 min/
session) of moderate-intensity aerobic training for schizophrenia 
patients, administered in a supervised group setting for a mini-
mum of 12 weeks, which is in line with recommendations by the 
American College of Sports Medicine (78).
In addition to reﬁning optimal exercise training parameters, it 
is also essential to consider the timing of exercise with respect to 
CR when combining the two approaches. For instance, it might 
be more beneﬁcial to start a treatment session with aerobic 
exercise followed by CR, as some studies have shown that engag-
ing in physical activity before or while performing a cognitively 
demanding task improves learning or performance on the task 
(40). In a recent review (79), the authors proposed that aerobic 
exercise preceding CR may create a state of neuroplastic readiness 
in the brain through BDNF upregulation, which can potentiate 
the eﬀectiveness of CR.
As far as the concurrent administration of tDCS and CR, emerg-
ing data support the feasibility and tolerability of this approach, but 
additional studies are needed to determine if it leads to performance 
gain in schizophrenia patients. Although the duration of stimulation 
of around 20 min has been consistently employed across studies, the 
therapeutic dose (i.e., number of sessions per day or week) has yet 
to be established. A host of parameters may moderate the eﬀects of 
tDCS on cognitive outcomes, including placement and size of anodal/
cathodal electrodes, unilateral vs. bilateral stimulation, amplitude 
of stimulation, and selection of training tasks during stimulation. 
Although it has been suggested that neuromodulation in combination 
with memory training may enhance the eﬀects of training via LTP 
(80), the underlying mechanisms of tDCS have been mainly explored 
within the motor cortex and not memory-related regions. Terefore, 
beyond methodological research to identify a standard montage and 
the parameters required for therapeutic tDCS administration, larger 
RCTs are necessary to establish eﬃcacy and relevant mechanisms of 
the combined tDCS–CR intervention.
Both approaches seem to have the potential to enhance the 
impact of CR by aﬀecting functions that underlie neuroplasticity 
(55, 81). Fortunately, it is now possible to measure neuroplasticity 
in vivo in humans using neuroimaging techniques (e.g., EEG and 
fMRI). New paradigms have been recently developed to assess 
LTP non-invasively using repetitive sensory stimulation. Similar 
to electrical stimulation in animals (82), repetitive high-frequency 
stimulation (HFS) can induce LTP-like eﬀects in humans (83–87). 
Some studies have measured LTP-like plasticity using a paradigm in 
which visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) to visual stimuli are recorded 
before and afer the same stimulus is presented at a high frequency. 
Enhancement (increase in amplitude) of the VEPs afer HFS is 
thought to reﬂect experience-dependent neuroplasticity of the visual 
cortex (84, 86–88). So far, two studies have been published using this 
EEG paradigm in schizophrenia (88, 89). Future treatment studies 
in schizophrenia should take advantage of these novel, non-invasive 
methods of assessing neuroplasticity to directly test whether physical 
exercise or tDCS aﬀect LTP. For example, we are currently conduct-
ing an RCT in which a visual LTP paradigm is an outcome measure 
to examine changes in neuroplasticity following cognitive training.
In the absence of any robust pharmacological treatments for 
cognitive deﬁcits in schizophrenia, physical exercise and tDCS 
are feasible and intriguing adjunctive treatments to enhance 
neuroplasticity and augment the eﬀects of CR. While showing 
promise, their eﬃcacy still needs to be demonstrated in more 
rigorously controlled studies.
