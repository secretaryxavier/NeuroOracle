Abstract
Objectives: Older adults with chronic schizophrenia are at greater risk for functional disability and poorer health outcomes than
those without serious mental illness. These individuals comprise 1–2% of the elderly population in the United States and are
projected to number approximately 15 million by 2030. The symptoms of schizophrenia can be disabling for individuals,
significantly reducing quality of life. Often, the negative symptoms (NS) are the most resistant to treatment and are
considered a marker of illness severity, though they are challenging to measure objectively. Biomarkers can serve as objective
indicators of health status. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a potential biomarker for schizophrenia and may serve as
an important indicator of illness severity. Methods: A cross-sectional study with 30 older adults with chronic schizophrenia.
Participants were assessed on serum levels of BDNF and psychiatric symptoms (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale). Pearson’s
bivariate correlations (two-tailed) and linear regression models were used. Results: A significant positive association (p < .05)
was found between higher serum levels of BDNF and greater severity for the NS items of passive, apathetic, social withdrawal, and
emotional withdrawal. In multivariate analyses, the association remained significant. Conclusions: Although the association
between BDNF and NS was not in the expected direction, the data corroborate findings from previous work in patients with
schizophrenia. It is possible that higher serum levels of BDNF reflect compensatory neuronal mechanisms resulting from
neurodevelopmental dysfunction.

Schizophrenia is a chronic, lifelong, and debilitating illness that
develops through complex, heterogeneous, and multifactorial
pathways, including genetic, developmental, and environmen-
tal (Millan, Fone, Steckler, & Horan, 2014). The prevalence for
schizophrenia in older adults (55 years and older) is estimated
at 0.6–1.0% (Cohen, Meesters, & Zhao, 2015). These numbers
are increasing with the aging of the population, with projec-
tions that those 55 years and older will represent about one
quarter of all people with schizophrenia by 2025 (Cohen
et al., 2008).
Older adults with schizophrenia experience premature aging
and decreased life expectancy with significantly greater risk for
mortality compared with older adults without schizophrenia.
Folsom et al. (2002) reported the age-adjusted mortality rates
for people with schizophrenia as 2 times that of the general
population, and, according to Parks, Svendsen, Singer, and Foti
(2006), people with schizophrenia live on average 20 fewer
years than those without a severe, persistent mental illness.
Individuals with schizophrenia are also more likely to expe-
rience impaired social functioning compared to same-age peers
(Bartels, Mueser, & Miles, 1997). They have higher levels of
need for assistance with their activities of daily living (Ran
et al., 2004) and report lower levels of satisfaction, contributing
to decreased quality of life. The ideal of successful aging
remains difficult for most patients with schizophrenia to
achieve (Cohen et al., 2015).
The concept of negative symptoms (NS) of schizophrenia
broadly refers to the absence or impairment of normal

functions in the areas of emotion, social interaction, productive
goal-directed behavior, thought processes, and communication
(Kirkpatrick & Galderisi, 2008; Reddy, Horan, & Green,
2016). Unlike with positive symptoms, there are no standard
pharmacological treatments for sufficiently improving NS
(Niitsu et al., 2011). Experiencing predominantly NS has dele-
terious effects on financial status, psychological well-being,
and social competency (Strauss, Sandt, Catalano, & Allen,
2012).
A necessary distinction to make when interpreting assess-
ments of NS for clinical and research purposes is that they are
not a homogenous cluster of symptoms but rather are hetero-
geneous in etiology, expression, and outcomes, with partially
overlapping and interacting pathways (Foussias & Reming-
ton, 2010). A lack of pharmacological treatment options for
NS may in part stem from the absence of any single dysfunc-
tion or lesion in the brain identified as responsible for causing
the symptoms of schizophrenia (Foussias, Siddiqui, Fervaha,
Agid, & Remington, 2015). The hypothesis that schizophrenia
may be a neurodevelopmental disorder is gaining support
(Pearlson, 2011). Identification of markers signaling underly-
ing structural and/or functional deviations within the brain is
an important area of research for helping to manage
schizophrenia.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein in the
neurotrophin family, is involved in cellular proliferation,
migration, and differentiation in the central nervous system
(CNS) during brain development (Numakawa et al., 2010) and
in maintaining neuroplasticity and normal brain functioning
in adult life (Park & Poo, 2013). There is accumulating evi-
dence suggesting that BDNF plays a significant role in the
pathophysiology of psychiatric diseases, including schizo-
phrenia (Lu, Nagappan, Guan, Nathan, & Wren, 2013). It is
the most widely distributed neurotrophin in the CNS, includ-
ing brain regions associated with schizophrenia (Shoval &
Weizman, 2005), and is a prime candidate for involvement
in the transformation of functional (synaptic) changes into
structural changes that result in aberrations (Zagrebelsky &
Korte, 2014).
It is well established that BDNF can freely cross the blood–
brain barrier (BBB), and animal models provide evidence that
the measurement of blood BDNF levels in the peripheral cir-
culation reflects BDNF levels in the CNS (Trajkovska et al.,
2007). While synaptic dysfunction is suggested in the patho-
genesis of schizophrenia, the relationship between BDNF and
schizophrenia is controversial, as there still remains significant
heterogeneity across studies (Adachi, Numakawa, Richards,
Nakajima, & Kunugi, 2014). This heterogeneity may be due
to factors such as stage of illness, sample sizes, and/or the
heterogeneity of the symptomatology itself (Akyo et al.,
2015). Although research regarding an association between
serum BDNF levels and age has been inconclusive, findings
tend to point toward a decline in BDNF levels in older age
(Diniz et al., 2014; Green, Matheson, Shepherd, Weickert, &
Carr, 2011; Nettiksimmons et al., 2014). Data suggest that
serum BDNF levels are lower in older adults with
schizophrenia when compared to healthy older adults (Green
et al., 2011; Valiente-Gomez et al., 2014).
The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to evaluate the
association of BDNF as a biomarker of illness severity with the
domains of positive and NS reported by older adults with
chronic schizophrenia.
Method
Design
We used a cross-sectional study design to evaluate the associ-
ation of BDNF as a biomarker of illness severity with the
individual subscale items of positive and NS reported by older
adults with schizophrenia. The university’s Committee on
Human Research approved the study. We maintained anonym-
ity and confidentiality according to the committee’s guidelines.
Participants and Settings
Participants in this study were a subsample (N ¼ 30) of a larger
parent study (N ¼ 46; Leutwyler, Hubbard, Jeste, Miller, &
Vinogradov, 2014). The 30 participants in the present study
were those who consented to the blood draw in addition to the
procedures in the parent study. Inclusion criteria from the par-
ent study were that participants be English-speaking adults 55
years or older with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV), diagnosis of schizo-
phrenia or schizoaffective disorder (based on the Structured
Clinical Interview for DSM-IV). We conducted a 7-item capac-
ity-to-consent evaluation prior to enrollment to ensure that
participants had sufficient understanding of their involvement
in the study.
We recruited participants in the parent study from three
main sites: a transitional residential and day-treatment center
for older adults with severe mental illness, a locked residential
facility for adults diagnosed with serious mental illness, and an
intensive case management program. Participants received
US$90 for their involvement in the study and a bonus payment
of US$20 if all of the study procedures were completed.
Measures
A trained member of the research staff administered all of the
assessments.
Symptom severity. Psychiatric symptoms were measured with
the extended Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS;
Poole, Tobias, & Vinogradov, 2000). The extended PANSS is a
35-item instrument, with each item consisting of one 7-point
(1–7) rating scale, categorized under six subscales measuring
positive (e.g., delusions), negative (e.g., emotional and social
withdrawal), disorganized (conceptual disorganization),
excited (e.g., poor impulse control), depressed anxious (e.g.,
depression), and other symptoms (e.g., preoccupation and poor
attention). The original PANSS (Kay, Fiszbein, & Opler, 1987)
categorizes the symptoms into only three subscales: Positive,
64

Negative, and General. The aim of our study was to understand
how individual symptom items of schizophrenia are associated
with BDNF levels in the peripheral serum. Therefore, we chose
the extended PANSS because it provides more details about the
variety and severity of symptoms experienced. Lindenmayer,
Harvey, Khan, and Kirkpatrick (2007) described the scale to
have demonstrated good-to-excellent reliability in assessing
symptoms and their change during the course of the treatment
in clinical trials with participants diagnosed with schizophre-
nia. The extended PANSS takes approximately 60 min to
administer. The items are summed to determine the scores on
the six subscales and the total PANSS score (the sum of all six
subscales). Higher scores on the PANSS reflect greater severity
in symptom experience as presented and reported by the indi-
vidual. The PANSS was conducted on either the same day as
the blood draw or within a week of the blood draw.
BDNF. BDNF was measured from 3 ml of blood that we col-
lected in the early afternoon (approximately 1:00 p.m. + 1 hr)
in a single BD Vacutainer1 SSTTM 10-ml transport tube (BD
#367985). We standardized the collection to occur at 1 p.m.
because there is limited information on the diurnal variation of
BDNF (Piccinni et al., 2008). The tube was inverted carefully
5–6 times to mix clot activator and blood before incubation.
Whole blood samples were incubated for at least 60 min at
room temperature to clot. The blood tube was then incubated
for at least 60 min on ice. After incubations, samples were
centrifuged for 10 min at 2,200 rpm (1,000g), 4C. Following
centrifugation, serum was aliquoted into 2-ml screw-cap cryo-
vials. Serum samples were stored in a 80oC freezer.
Lab personnel carried out the measurements of serum
BDNF levels in the Center for Reproductive Sciences at Uni-
versity of California, San Francisco. Serum samples were
diluted with the diluent included in the research and develop-
ment (R&D) Human BDNF Quantikine ELISA kit (Minneapo-
lis, MN) to bring measured levels of BDNF up to the range of
the provided standard. A separate control sample was run on
each plate to ensure minimal interassay variability (8–14%).
Mean serum levels of healthy control subjects using the R&D
systems have been reported at 24.81 ng/ml (SD ¼ 5.87) in a
sample with a mean age of 30.7 + 6.87 years, range 21–40
(Yoshida, Ishikawa, Iyo, & Hashimoto, 2013) and 31.30 ng/ml
(SD ¼ 8.95) in a sample with a mean age of 44.50 years (SD ¼
11.69; Vinogradov et al., 2009). The minimum serum BDNF
level detected with this assay is typically less than .02 ng/ml.
We report results in nanogram per milliliter.
Data Analysis
We performed statistical analyses using SPSS (Version 20).
Pearson’s bivariate correlations (two-sided) were conducted
on the entire sample (N ¼ 30). Variables that were significant
at p < .10 and had a correlation of greater than .30 in bivariate
analysis were included in the simultaneous multiple regression
models. Variables that were highly correlated with one another
(r > .8) were not included in the same model. Two simulta-
neous regression models were used to examine the relationship
between BDNF and NS (assessing Item 7, passive, apathetic,
and social withdrawal [PASW], and Item 6, emotional with-
drawal [EW]). The a was set to p < .05. BDNF level in nano-
gram per milliliter was the dependent variable. The significant
negative schizophrenia symptoms and age from the bivariate
analyses were the independent variables. We estimated that
with a sample size of 30 and at a significance level of .05, the
null hypothesis that the Pearson’s correlation coefficient would
equal zero will have 80% power to detect a population effect
size of .531.
Results
A total of 30 participants were included in the analyses. Table 1
presents the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of
these participants. The majority were male (70%), and their
average age was 59.77 years (range ¼ 55–68). More than half
of the participants were current smokers (17/30). The mean
total PANSS score of 78.87 (SD ¼ 24.82) indicated that the
sample was moderately ill (Leucht et al., 2005). Higher scores
on the PANSS reflect more-severe symptoms. The mean level
of BDNF was 24.36 ng/ml (SD ¼ 6.02).
There were significant bivariate correlations between BDNF
level and age and the NS subscale Items 6 (EW) and 7 (PASW).
Older age (r ¼ .30, p ¼ .06) and higher scores on the NS
subscale Items 6 (r ¼ .37, p ¼ .02) and 7 (r ¼ .45, p ¼ .01)
were associated with higher BDNF levels. We did not find
significant bivariate associations with the positive symptom
subscale total or any of the subscale’s items.
NS subscale Item 6 (EW) was highly correlated with NS
subscale Item 7 (PASW); therefore, we did not include the
symptoms in the same models. Table 2 provides the results
of the first and second simultaneous multiple regressions. We
included Item 6 (EW) of the NS subscale and age as predictors

in the first model and Item 7 (PASW) of the NS subscale and
age as predictors in the second.
With two predictors (age and NS subscale Item 6) in the first
model, we explained 16% of the variation in BDNF level (p ¼
.04). When controlling for age, NS subscale Item 6 made a
significant unique contribution to the model (p ¼ .04). For
every 1-point increase in NS Item 6 score, there is a 1.95 ng/
ml unit increase in BDNF level. With two predictors (age and
NS subscale Item 7) in the second model, we explained 23% of
the variation in BDNF level (p ¼ .01). When controlling for
age, NS subscale Item 7 made a significant unique contribution
to the model (p ¼ .01). For every 1-point increase in NS 7
score, there is a 2.15 ng/ml unit increase in BDNF level. Age
did not make a significant unique contribution to either the first
or second model.
Discussion
The major findings in this cross-sectional study of older adults
with schizophrenia were positive correlations between serum
BDNF levels and the individual PANSS NS subscale Items 6
(EW) and 7 (PASW). Our findings are similar to those of two
other studies (Niitsu et al., 2014; Reis et al., 2008), suggesting
that BDNF measured in the serum may be an objective biomar-
ker of illness severity for specific symptoms in individuals with
schizophrenia. While our results are consistent with these two
studies, other studies report negative correlations between
BDNF levels measured peripherally and the symptomatology
of schizophrenia (Akyo et al., 2015; Fernandes et al., 2015).
This persistent heterogeneity in correlating BDNF as a reliable
objective biomarker with the symptoms of schizophrenia may
represent in part the heterogeneity of the illness itself, but also
differences in study designs and the outcomes measured. Some
of the confounding factors in studies evaluating serum BDNF
levels in patients with schizophrenia could be associated with
smoking history, the stage of illness, the duration of illness,
antipsychotic medication treatments, sample sizes, genetic risk
factors, and not evaluating individual schizophrenia symptoms
in the analyses (Akyo et al., 2015; Fernandes et al., 2015; Niitsu
et al., 2011; Reddy et al., 2016; Shimada et al., 2014). It is also
important to note that not all previous studies evaluated serum
BDNF levels in a sample of older adults with chronic
schizophrenia.
Much of the past research on the NS of schizophrenia has
been criticized for assuming that NS are homogenous in
nature—as if the NS boil down to a single syndrome that could
be treated as a single target (Marder & Kirkpatrick, 2014).
Although evidence is mounting that this approach to NS is not
effective, the arguments about how to differentiate, organize,
define, and even assess NS have continued. A more current
model for conceptualizing NS identifies and divides five core
NS features (avolition/amotivation, anhedonia, asociality, alo-
gia, and blunted affect) into two broader subdomains: (1) an
experiential or internal dimension (amotivation), consisting of
the first three features, and (2) an expressive dimension (dimin-
ished expression), consisting of the latter two features (Fous-
sias et al., 2015; Marder & Kirkpatrick, 2014; Reddy et al.,
2016). The consensus in the literature suggests that NS likely
reflect anomalies of distributed neural networks rather than the
disruption of any discrete brain region (Millan et al., 2014), and
though it is unlikely that a single deficit explains the hetero-
geneity of the subdomains, NS may have some shared neuro-
biological origins (Foussias et al., 2015). The symptoms
described by PANSS NS subscale Items 6 (EW) and 7 (PASW)
are both encompassed within the amotivation subdomain, are
recognized as some of the most frequently experienced NS
among individuals with schizophrenia, and are strongly asso-
ciated with serious impacts on long-term functional outcomes
(Gruber, Santuccione, & Aach, 2014; Millan et al., 2014).
Understanding NS in the context of separate but overlapping
subdomains and analyzing them as such could provide greater
insight into relationships with potential biomarkers and also
provide opportunities for focusing on the individual experi-
ences, guiding more effective treatment choices.
The symptomatology of schizophrenia may manifest from
disturbances in varying levels of systems, from neuroplasticity
and synaptogenesis to altered connectivity of complex neural
networks (Fernandes et al., 2015; Millan et al., 2014), with
dysregulation in multiple neurotransmitter mechanisms impli-
cated as well (Galderisi, Merlotti, & Mucci, 2015; Gruber et al.,

2014). The different subdomains of NS may stem from distinct
as well as partially overlapping perturbations in the neural
circuitry (Millan et al., 2014), especially in those areas of the
brain critical for sensory, cognitive, and emotional processing
(Galderisi et al., 2015). It has been argued that the pathophy-
siological mechanisms incriminated in the genesis of the NS of
schizophrenia are not necessarily the same as those that main-
tain NS once they are established (Millan et al., 2014). Incor-
porating a focus on the underlying pathology of each discrete
symptom facet in schizophrenia and the associated neurocir-
cuitry could better inform illness assessments and treatment
decisions and also what biomarker may be best to consider for
use in these assessments and decisions (Azorin, Belzeaux, &
Adida, 2014).
Researchers have described BDNF as the most widely
expressed neurotrophin in the CNS (Adachi et al., 2014; Reis
et al., 2008), including brain regions purported to be involved
in schizophrenia, such as the hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus
accumbens, and striatum. Impairment in BDNF function has
been implicated in multiple psychiatric and neurodegenerative
diseases (Adachi et al., 2014; Akyo et al., 2015), which has led
to many investigations into BDNF’s potential as a biomarker as
well as a potential treatment target, with a dizzying array of
results (Akyo et al., 2015; Fernandes et al., 2015). One of the
essential roles of BDNF within the nervous system is in synap-
tic plasticity (Akyo et al., 2015). Whether underlying aberra-
tions in BDNF expression, such as with impaired plasticity,
contribute to the development of illnesses such as schizophre-
nia or psychiatric illnesses lead to alterations in BDNF is highly
debated (Akyo et al., 2015; Fernandes et al., 2015; Gruber
et al., 2014; Zagrebelsky & Korte, 2014).
Our results illustrate BDNF’s role as a neuroprotectant, with
BDNF representing a compensatory response to the underlying
neuropathology in the brain regions implicated in EW, passive-
ness, apathy, and/or social withdrawal. Researchers have
reported that the frontotemporal and frontocortico-striatal cir-
cuits are the most strongly and consistently implicated in the
NS of schizophrenia (Gruber et al., 2014; Millan et al., 2014).
The correlation we found between BDNF levels and scores on
the NS subscale Items 6 and 7 in the subjects in our sample may
represent a reaction to aberrations in these brain regions from
damage that occurred in the early years of disease for these
individuals. Reis et al. (2008) reported similar findings of a
positive correlation between BDNF and NS, though they did
not individually analyze the subscales of NS and the study
sample did not comprise all older adults with chronic schizo-
phrenia (mean age ¼ 52.3 years, SD + 9.8). The authors
offered a compensatory explanation, suggesting that the higher
levels of BDNF could indicate a more severe level of neuronal
damage at the onset of disease illness (p. 159). In these cases,
the level of BDNF could be a marker for specific symptom
severity due to the underlying pathology and not suggestive
of primary impairments in the role of BDNF in the disease
progression.
The cellular processes involved in manufacturing and
packaging BDNF can ultimately end down two different and
opposing pathways depending on the stage of cleavage the
BDNF signal peptide remains in—pro-BDNF (the precursor
of mature-BDNF) binds to the p75NTR receptor and leads to
apoptosis; mature-BDNF has a greater affinity toward the TrkB
receptor, leading to cellular maintenance (Adachi et al., 2014;
Niitsu et al., 2014; Zagrebelsky & Korte, 2014). Both proteo-
lytic isoforms cross the BBB and would be included in a total
peripheral BDNF-level analysis if not separated out (Traj-
kovska et al., 2007). A limitation of our study, and of many
preceding it, is in the assay kit used for BDNF, which, until
recently, did not differentiate between these two forms. The
newer, commercially available ELISA assay kits can discrimi-
nate mature-BDNF from the total BDNF in the sample, and it
would be much more informative moving forward to measure
the individual levels of pro-BDNF and mature-BDNF when
investigating the biomarker’s correlation with neurological
conditions (Niitsu et al., 2014).
For individuals with schizophrenia who survive into older
age, higher BDNF levels may represent a “survivor effect,”
suggesting that only those with more protective factors live
to an older age (Rao et al., 2015). Given BDNF’s deep associ-
ation with neuronal connectivity and regulation of synaptic
efficacy throughout the CNS, it may be a factor contributing
to this phenomenon in a compensatory manner (Adachi et al.,
2014).
A limitation of our study was its small sample size, which
limited our analyses and our ability to generalize our results to
the larger population of older adults with chronic schizophre-
nia. We did not include in our analyses participant smoking
history, illness duration, medication use, genetic risk factors, or
cognitive dimensions associated with schizophrenia. Future
work on BDNF and other potential biomarkers in older adults
with schizophrenia should include evaluation of the markers’
utility in objectively measuring the effectiveness of interven-
tions such as social rehabilitation as they relate to the individ-
ual symptoms of schizophrenia.
