Abstract
Over the past decade, the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death (NCCD) has formulated guidelines for the deﬁnition and
interpretation of cell death from morphological, biochemical, and functional perspectives. Since the ﬁeld continues to
expand and novel mechanisms that orchestrate multiple cell death pathways are unveiled, we propose an updated
classiﬁcation of cell death subroutines focusing on mechanistic and essential (as opposed to correlative and dispensable)
aspects of the process. As we provide molecularly oriented deﬁnitions of terms including intrinsic apoptosis, extrinsic
apoptosis, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT)-driven necrosis, necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, parthanatos,
entotic cell death, NETotic cell death, lysosome-dependent cell death, autophagy-dependent cell death, immunogenic cell
death, cellular senescence, and mitotic catastrophe, we discuss the utility of neologisms that refer to highly specialized
instances of these processes. The mission of the NCCD is to provide a widely accepted nomenclature on cell death in support
of the continued development of the ﬁeld.
Introduction
For a long time, cell death has been dismissed by biologists
as an inevitable and, hence, spurious consequence of cel-
lular life. A large body of experimental evidence accumu-
lating over the past decades, however, has unveiled and
characterized in ever greater detail a set of genetically
encoded mechanisms for targeted elimination of super-
ﬂuous, irreversibly damaged, and/or potentially harmful
cells [1–4]. Intriguingly, regulated cell death (RCD) is not
unique to multicellular life forms, a setting in which RCD
has an obvious advantage for organismal homeostasis in
both physiological and pathological settings [5–9], but is
also found (in simpliﬁed variants) among unicellular
eukaryotes living (at least for part of their life cycle) in
colonies (such as several yeast species and Dictyostelium
discoideum) [10–15], and at least in some prokaryotes (e.g.,
Escherichia coli) [16]. In striking contrast with accidental
cell death (ACD)—the instantaneous and catastrophic
demise of cells exposed to severe insults of physical (e.g.,
high pressures, temperatures, or osmotic forces), chemical
(e.g., extreme pH variations), or mechanical (e.g., shear
forces) nature—RCD relies on a dedicated molecular
machinery, implying that it can be modulated (i.e., delayed
or accelerated) by pharmacological or genetic interventions
[5, 17].
Although the underlying molecular mechanisms exhibit
considerable overlap (see below), RCD is involved in two
diametrically opposed scenarios. On the one hand, RCD can
occur in the absence of any exogenous environmental per-
turbation, hence operating as a built-in effector of physio-
logical programs for development or tissue turnover [6, 18].
These completely physiological forms of RCD are generally
referred to as programmed cell death (PCD). On the other
hand, RCD can originate from perturbations of the intra-
cellular or extracellular microenvironment, when such per-
turbations are too intense or prolonged for adaptative
responses to cope with stress and restore cellular home-
ostasis [5]. Importantly, stress-driven RCD also constitutes
a strategy for the preservation of a biological equilibrium,
hence resembling adaptative stress responses. However,
while adaptative stress responses operate at the cellular level
(which—by
extension—promotes
the
maintenance
of
homeostasis at the level of organism or colony), RCD
directly operates at the level of the organism or colony in
spite of cellular homeostasis [5]. Such a homeostatic func-
tion not only reﬂects the elimination of useless or poten-
tially dangerous cells, but also the ability of dying cells to
expose or release molecules that alert the organism or col-
ony about a potential threat. Such danger signals are

commonly referred to as damage-associated molecular
patterns (DAMPs) or alarmins [19–22].
Cell death manifests with macroscopic morphological
alterations. Together with the mechanisms whereby dead
cells and their fragments are disposed of, such morphotypes
have historically been employed to classify cell death into
three different forms: (1) type I cell death or apoptosis,
exhibiting cytoplasmic shrinkage, chromatin condensation
(pyknosis),
nuclear
fragmentation
(karyorrhexis),
and
plasma membrane blebbing, culminating with the formation
of apparently intact small vesicles (commonly known as
apoptotic bodies) that are efﬁciently taken up by neigh-
boring cells with phagocytic activity and degraded within
lysosomes; (2) type II cell death or autophagy, manifesting
with extensive cytoplasmic vacuolization and similarly
culminating with phagocytic uptake and consequent lyso-
somal degradation; and (3) type III cell death or necrosis,
displaying no distinctive features of type I or II cell death
and terminating with the disposal of cell corpses in the
absence of obvious phagocytic and lysosomal involvement
[23, 24]. Of note, this morphological classiﬁcation is still
extensively employed, irrespective of multiple limitations,
and caveats. Starting from 2005, the Nomenclature Com-
mittee on Cell Death (NCDD) gathered on a regular basis
(1) to address the issues related to the use of a nomenclature
of cell death based on morphological grounds; (2) to pre-
cisely deﬁne major cell death modalities on a genetic, bio-
chemical, pharmacological, and functional (rather than
morphological) basis; (3) to distinguish essential (causal)
from accessory (correlative) aspects of the death process;
and (4) to identify consensus criteria for the identiﬁcation of
dead cells with irreversible plasma membrane permeabili-
zation or complete cellular fragmentation [17, 25–28].
As the ﬁeld continues to progress and novel signaling
pathways that orchestrate RCD are still being characterized,
we propose here an updated classiﬁcation of cell death
modalities centered on molecular and essential aspects of
the process (Fig. 1 and Box 1). A major focus will be placed
on the signal transduction modules involved in the initia-
tion, execution, and propagation of cell death, as well as on
the pathophysiological relevance of each of the main types
of RCD.
Intrinsic apoptosis
Intrinsic apoptosis is a form of RCD initiated by a variety of
microenvironmental perturbations including (but not limited
to) growth factor withdrawal, DNA damage, endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS)
overload, replication stress, microtubular alterations or
mitotic defects [29–34]. Apoptotic cells retain plasma
membrane integrity and metabolic activity (to some degree)
as the process proceeds to completion, which—in vivo—
allows for the rapid clearance by macrophages or other cells
with phagocytic activity (a process commonly known as
efferocytosis) [35]. Importantly, intrinsic (and extrinsic, see
below) apoptosis and consequent efferocytosis are not
always immunologically silent, as previously thought (see
below) [36, 37]. In vitro, end-stage apoptosis is generally
followed by complete breakdown of the plasma membrane
and the acquisition of a necrotic morphotype (secondary
necrosis), unless cultured cells display phagocytic activity
[38], a process that has recently been linked to the pore-
forming activity of gasdermin E (GSDME; best known as
DFNA5) [39].
The critical step for intrinsic apoptosis is irreversible and
widespread mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
(MOMP) [40, 41], which is controlled by pro-apoptotic and
anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2, apoptosis regulator
(BCL2) protein family, a group of proteins sharing one to
four BCL2 homology (BH) domains (i.e., BH1, BH2, BH3,
and BH4) [29, 42, 43]. In response to apoptotic stimuli,
MOMP is mediated by BCL2 associated X, apoptosis reg-
ulator (BAX), and/or BCL2 antagonist/killer 1 (BAK1; best
known as BAK), both of which contain four BH domains
and a conserved transmembrane domain [44–46]. Together
with BOK, BCL2 family apoptosis regulator (BOK) [47],
BAX and BAK are the only BCL2 family members char-
acterized so far in mammalian cells for their ability to form
pores across the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and
possibly other intracellular membranes [29, 42, 43]. In
physiological
conditions,
BAX
continuously
cycles
between the OMM and the cytosol, where it exhibits a
quiescent monomeric or inactive dimeric conformation [48–
50]. In contrast, BAK constitutively resides at the OMM,
where it inserts within the lipid bilayer via its hydrophobic
C-terminal
α9
helix
upon
interaction
with
voltage
dependent anion channel 2 (VDAC2) [51–54]. Of note,
some degree of BAK retrotranslocation from the OMM to
the cytosol has been documented [55]. Upon induction of
apoptosis, BAX retrotranslocation ceases as the mitochon-
drial pools of BAX and BAK undergo direct or indirect
activation (see below) by pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins
[48, 56–59].
These pro-apoptotic members of the BCL2 protein
family (which contain a single BH3 domain) are activated
transcriptionally or post-translationally as speciﬁc orga-
nelles or cellular compartments experience perturbations of
homeostasis, de facto operating as cellular transducers of
stress signaling [60–63]. Some BH3-only proteins—such as
BCL2 binding component 3 (BBC3; best known as p53-
upregulated modulator of apoptosis, PUMA), BCL2 like 11
(BCL2L11; best known as BCL2-interacting mediator of
cell death, BIM), and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate-
induced protein 1 (PMAIP1; best known as NOXA)—are

mainly activated by transcriptional upregulation, while
others—such as BH3 interacting domain death agonist
(BID)—mostly undergo post-translational activation [64–
70]. BID, BIM, PUMA, and NOXA share the ability to
physically (but transiently) interact with the mitochondrial
pool of BAX and/or BAK (hence being known as “activa-
tors”) to promote a series of conformational changes [59,
64, 67, 71–74] culminating with the dissociation of the core
and latch domains of BCL2 effectors [75–77]. The current
view is that activated BAX and BAK form homodimers
(also heterodimers in speciﬁc settings), resulting in the
release of BH3-only proteins and further dimer-by-dimer
oligomerization [76–83]. Oligomerization ultimately leads
to the assembly of a toroidal lipidic pore that alters mito-
chondrial permeability and causes profound rearrangements
of the mitochondrial ultrastructure [78, 84–86]. In line with
this model, it has recently been shown that (1) BAX can
form rings or linear/arc-shaped oligomers that perforate the
OMM [84, 85], and (2) MOMP proceeds upon the forma-
tion of pores (impinging on OMM curvature stress), which
can vary in size depending on the number of BAX dimers
recruited [87].
MOMP is antagonized by anti-apoptotic members of the
BCL2 family, including BCL2 itself, BCL2 like 1 (BCL2L1;
best known as BCL-XL), MCL1, BCL2 family apoptosis
regulator (MCL1), BCL2 like 2 (BCL2L2; best known as
BCL-W), and BCL2 related protein A1 (BCL2A1; best
known—in human—as BFL-1) [29, 42, 43]. These pro-
survival proteins contain all four BH domains, are generally
inserted into the OMM or the ER membrane through their α9
helix, and mainly exert anti-apoptotic functions by directly
binding pro-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family, an
activity that generally—but not always—depends on a
hydrophobic binding groove formed by BH1, BH2, and BH3
domains [88–94]. In addition, some anti-apoptotic BCL2
family members have been proposed to promote cellular
survival by: (1) regulating Ca2+ homeostasis at the ER [95–
99]; (2) promoting bioenergetic metabolism upon interaction
with the F1FO ATP synthase [100–104]; and (3) contributing
to the regulation of redox homeostasis [105–109]. However,
the importance of these functions has been challenged by the
generation of cell lines that lack all major anti-apoptotic and
pro-apoptotic BCL2 family members [93]. Thus, most pro-
survival BCL2 family members inhibit BAX and BAK by
preventing their oligomerization and pore-forming activity
either directly, upon physical sequestration at the OMM, or
indirectly, following the sequestration of BH3-only activators
[29, 64, 79, 110]. Of note, in physiological conditions, some

perturbations of the intracellular
or extracellular
microenvironment can activate one of many signal transduction cas-
cades ultimately leading to their demise. Each of such regulated cell
death (RCD) modes is initiated and propagated by molecular
mechanisms that exhibit a considerable degree of interconnectivity.
Moreover, each type of RCD can manifest with an entire spectrum of
morphological features ranging from fully necrotic to fully apoptotic,
and an immunomodulatory proﬁle ranging from anti-inﬂammatory and

to

anti-apoptotic BCL2 proteins, such as BCL-XL, exert a pro-
tective role by promoting the retrotranslocation of BAX and
(to a lesser degree) BAK from the mitochondria to the cyto-
plasm, thus limiting their mitochondrial pool [48, 55, 111].
Evidence from T cells and platelets suggests that such retro-
translocation occurs in vivo, resulting in the physiological
inhibition of BAK by BCL-XL [112]. Importantly, some
BH3-only proteins including BCL2 associated agonist of cell
death (BAD), Bcl2 modifying factor (BMF), or harakiri,
BCL2 interacting protein (HRK) promote MOMP in the
absence of a physical interaction with BAX or BAK. These
BH3-only proteins, which are sometimes referred to as “sen-
sitizers” or “inactivators” bind to anti-apoptotic BCL2 family
members and hence limit their availability to sequester BAX,
BAK, or BH3-only activators [58, 93].
Different BH3-only proteins have been suggested to
preferentially bind speciﬁc anti-apoptotic BCL2 family
members (e.g., BID, BIM, and PUMA potently bind all
anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members; BAD preferentially
interacts with BCL2, BCL-XL, and BCL-W; NOXA pre-
ferentially inhibits MCL1; and HRK preferentially inhibits
BCL-XL) [57, 113, 114]. In vitro results suggest that the
distinction between sensitizers and activators may be much
less rigid than previously thought [79, 114–117]. However,
overexpression of BH3-only sensitizers induces minimal
apoptosis in cells lacking BID, BIM, PUMA, and NOXA
[64], suggesting that BH3-only activators function down-
stream of BH3-only sensitizers. Of note, the interaction
between anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic BCL2 family
members
has
major
therapeutic
implications,
with
BCL2 representing the pharmacological target of the
FDA-approved BH3 mimetic venetoclax (also known
as ABT-199) and other molecules with a similar mechanism
of action that are currently under development (e.g., the
MCL1 inhibitor S63845) [118, 119]. Indeed, venetoclax

has been ascribed to the tight association between BCL-XL
and BH3-only activators at subcellular membranes [121,
122]. The relevance of this mechanism for CLL patients
under
venetoclax
treatment,
however,
remains
to
be
elucidated.
Conﬁrming the essential role of BCL2 family members
for MOMP and the high degree of overlap between the
machineries responsible for stress-driven RCD and PCD,
the co-deletion of Bax and Bak1 not only renders a large
panel of cell types profoundly resistant to diverse lethal
stimuli [74], a phenotype that in some settings can be
exacerbated by the co-deletion of Bok [123], but also causes
perinatal lethality in mice as a consequence of severe
developmental defects [124]. Along similar lines, Bcl2l11
−/−Bmf−/−as well as Bid−/−Bcl2l11−/−Bbc3−/−mice die
prematurely
or
display
severe
developmental
defects,
respectively [68, 125]. However, transformed cells lacking
all major BH3 activators (i.e., BID, BIM, PUMA, and
NOXA) can still undergo apoptosis in response to DNA-
damaging agents or downregulation of BCL2, BCL-XL, and
MCL1 [64]. This observation is in line with the notion that
BAX and BAK can self-activate in the absence of anti-
apoptotic BCL2 family members and pro-apoptotic BH3
proteins (according to a relatively slow kinetics) [64, 93].
Perhaps, BAX and BAK can even be activated indepen-
dently of BH3-only proteins by the concerted action of the
prolyl
isomerase
peptidylprolyl
cis/trans
isomerase,
NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) and either tumor protein p53
(TP53; best known as p53) [126–128] or ATR serine/
threonine kinase (ATR) [129, 130], several proteins con-
taining BH-like motifs [131], as well as by detergents, heat,
pH changes, or speciﬁc monoclonal antibodies [132]. That
said, the actual pathophysiological relevance of non-
canonical BAX and BAK activation remains to be for-
mally established. Both anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic
BCL2 proteins are also subjected to tight transcriptional and
post-translational regulation, involving (but not limited to)
proteasomal degradation, phosphorylation, and subcellular
(re)localization [48, 108, 133–138]. Finally, it is becoming
increasingly evident that mitochondrial size and shape
[139–141] as well as lipid composition [142, 143] can
inﬂuence the likelihood of mitochondria to undergo irre-
versible MOMP. These observations exemplify the number
of factors involved in MOMP at the level of single mito-
chondria. Of note, active BAX and BAK have also been
proposed to (1) permeabilize ER membranes, especially in
response to reticular stress, leading to release of luminal ER
chaperones into the cytosol [30, 144]; and (2) favor the
activation of type 1 inositol trisphosphate receptors at the
ER, resulting in the cytosolic leak of Ca2+ ions and con-
sequent mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake [96, 145]. However, the
actual relevance of ER permeabilization for intrinsic apop-
tosis remains to be elucidated. That said, the contact sites
between mitochondria and the ER (which are commonly
known as mitochondria-associated ER membranes) appear
to regulate a plethora of cellular processes that inﬂuence
RCD or its immunological consequences, including (but not
limited to) ER stress signaling, the transfer of Ca2+ ions
from the ER to mitochondria, and inﬂammatory reactions
[146–148].
As for BOK, it has been proposed that this BCL2 protein
contributes to the regulation of ER homeostasis, as
demonstrated by its prominent localization at the ER
membrane [149] and the defective apoptotic response of
Bok−/−cells to some ER stressors [150]. Moreover, BOK
has recently been shown to induce MOMP in the absence of
BAX and BAK and independently of other BCL2 family
members [47, 151, 152]. In particular, BOK appears to be
constitutively active and to be antagonized by an ER-
associated
degradation
pathway
rather
than
by
anti-
apoptotic BCL2 proteins [47]. BOK is also regulated by a
mechanism involving the binding to inositol 1,4,5-trispho-
sphate (IP3) receptors, which reportedly limits its protea-
somal degradation [153]. Of note, Bok−/−, Bax−/−Bok−/−as
well as Bak1−/−Bok−/−mice display no obvious abnorm-
alities (except for persistence of primordial follicle oocytes
in aged Bax−/−Bok−/−females) [154, 155], implying that
physiological functions of BOK can be compensated for by
BAK and/or BAX.
MOMP directly promotes the cytosolic release of apop-
togenic factors that normally reside in the mitochondrial
intermembrane space [40, 44, 156]. These mitochondrial
proteins include (but are not limited to) cytochrome c,
somatic (CYCS), which usually operates as an electron
shuttle in the mitochondrial respiratory chain [157–160],
and diablo IAP-binding mitochondrial protein (DIABLO;
also known as second mitochondrial activator of caspases,
SMAC) [161–163]. The release of CYCS and SMAC to the
cytosol is favored by mitochondrial cristae remodeling
[164], which relies on the oligomerization and activation of
OPA1, mitochondrial dynamin like GTPase (OPA1) [165],
possibly preceded by the BAX-dependent and BAK-
dependent activation of OMA1 zinc metallopeptidase
(OMA1) [166, 167], and/or dynamin 1 like (DNM1L; best
known as DRP1) [168]. Accordingly, nitric oxide (NO) has
been shown to precipitate the release of apoptogenic factors
from mitochondria upon direct nitrosylation of DRP1 (at
least in some settings) [169–171]. The cytosolic pool of
CYCS binds to apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1
(APAF1) and pro-caspase 9 (CASP9) in a deoxyATP-
dependent manner to form the supramolecular complex
known as apoptosome, which is responsible for CASP9
activation [160]. Recently, the structure of the apoptosome
from multiple organisms including humans has been char-
acterized at atomic resolution [172–174]. These studies
revealed that the autocatalytic maturation of CASP9 within
490
L. Galluzzi et al.

the apoptosome occurs through generation of CASP9
homodimers and CASP9-APAF1 heterodimers/multimers
upon association of their respective caspase recruitment
domains (CARDs) [175–178].
Activated CASP9 can catalyze the proteolytic activation
of CASP3 and CASP7, which are widely perceived as the
enzymes responsible for cell demolition during intrinsic
(and extrinsic, see below) apoptosis in mammalian cells
(and hence are commonly known as executioner caspases)
[179, 180]. Cytosolic SMAC precipitates apoptosis by
associating with members of the inhibitor of apoptosis
(IAP) protein family, including X-linked inhibitor of
apoptosis (XIAP) [162, 163, 181]. To acquire apoptogenic
activity, SMAC must undergo a proteolytic maturation step
that unleashes its latent IAP-binding domain, which is cat-
alyzed by the inner membrane peptidase (IMP) complex
[182] and perhaps by the inner mitochondrial membrane
(IMM)
protease
presenilin
associated
rhomboid
like
(PARL) [183]. XIAP is the only IAP protein family member
that counteracts the apoptotic cascade by stably binding to
and hence physically blocking caspases [184, 185]. Con-
versely, baculoviral IAP repeat containing 2 (BIRC2; best
known as c-IAP1) and BIRC3 (best known as c-IAP2)
mostly do so as they (1) drive the upregulation of potent
anti-apoptotic factors such as CASP8 and FADD like
apoptosis regulator (CFLAR; best known as c-FLIP) [186];
(2) promote caspase inactivation by virtue of their E3 ubi-
quitin ligase activity [187–195]; (3) ubiquitinate receptor
interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (RIPK1) and hence
trigger pro-survival NF-κB signaling [196–198]; and (4)
perhaps
promote
SMAC
degradation at
mitochondria
through a mechanism that depends on BCL2 proteins [199].
Of note, MOMP eventually leads to the dissipation of the
mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm)—mostly as a
consequence of the respiratory impairment imposed by the
loss of CYCS—and hence to the cessation of Δψm-depen-
dent mitochondrial functions (including ATP synthesis and
some forms of protein import) [200–203]. Intriguingly,
BAK and BAX may not always be required for pro-
apoptotic stimuli to promote CYTC release and consequent
caspase activation, even in conditions in which mitochon-
drial permeability transition (MPT; see below) is disabled
[204, 205]. This may suggest the existence of another—
presently unidentiﬁed—mechanism for MOMP, possibly
involving speciﬁc lipids like ceramide [206, 207]. The
actual
pathophysiological
relevance
of
this
potential
mechanism remains obscure.
The catalytic activity of executioner caspases precipitates
cellular demise and is responsible for many of the mor-
phological
and
biochemical
correlates
of
apoptosis,
including DNA fragmentation [208], phosphatidylserine
(PS) exposure [209, 210], and the formation of apoptotic
bodies [211, 212]. CASP3 favors DNA fragmentation by
catalyzing the proteolytic inactivation of DNA fragmenta-
tion factor subunit alpha (DFFA; best known as ICAD),
hence unleashing the catalytic activity of DFFB (best
known as CAD) [213–215]. Recent experimental evidence
demonstrates that CASP3 promotes PS exposure by acti-
vating proteins involved in PS externalization, such as the
phospholipid scramblases [216–218], or inactivating factors
that mediate PS internalization, such as phospholipid ﬂip-
pases [219–221]. Thus, in response to apoptotic stimuli,
active CASP3 reportedly cleaves (1) XK related protein 8
(XKR8), which interacts with basigin (BSG) or neuroplastin
(NPTN)
to
form
a
phospholipid-scrambling
complex
responsible for PS exposure [216, 217], and (2) ATPase
phospholipid transporting 11A (ATP11A) and ATP11C,
resulting
in
inhibition
of
their
ﬂippase
activity
and
PS exposure, as demonstrated by absent or reduced PS
translocation on the cell surface of cells expressing a
non-cleavable ATP11C or developing erythrocytes from
Atp11a−/−mice [219–221]. That said, PS exposure may not
universally accompany intrinsic (and extrinsic) apoptosis
[222–224].
Of note, a large body of evidence suggests that execu-
tioner caspases precipitate intrinsic apoptosis, once a
hitherto

(Q-VD-OPh), generally delays (but does not prevent)
intrinsic apoptosis in vitro and in vivo (at least in the
mammalian system), as it promotes a switch to other types
of RCD [17, 225]. In addition, when MOMP affects a
limited number of mitochondria, the consequent sublethal
activation of caspases does not precipitate RCD but pro-
motes genomic instability [226]. Finally, at least some cells
exposed to transient apoptotic stimuli appear to survive
MOMP affecting a limited number of mitochondria and the
partial activation of executioner caspases by a hitherto
poorly characterized process called anastasis (most likely
constituting a robust adaptative response upstream of the
boundary between cellular life and death) [226–228].
Altogether, these observations suggest that CASP3 and
CASP7 mediate a facilitating, rather than indispensable,
role in RCD (for an extensive discussion on this topic,
please refer to ref [17]). This said, executioner caspases can
positively or negatively regulate the emission of multiple
DAMPs from dying cells, including immunostimulatory
[229] as well as immunosuppressive [230] factors. Thus,
pharmacological agents targeting executioner caspases may
be unable to mediate bona ﬁde cytoprotection, but may

efﬁciently switch RCD modality. Interestingly, although
CASP6 has long been considered as an executioner caspase
based on its homology with CASP3 and CASP7, recent data
on substrate speciﬁcity suggest that CASP6 may actually be
involved in RCD initiation [179, 231, 232]. Additional
investigation is required to elucidate the function of CASP6
in mammalian cells.
A speciﬁc variant of intrinsic apoptosis elicited by the
loss of integrin-dependent attachment to the extracellular
matrix is commonly known as anoikis [233, 234]. As such,
anoikis is demarcated by MOMP and precipitated by the
activation of executioner caspases, notably CASP3 [233].
At least in some settings, detachment from the extracellular
matrix triggers MOMP upon activation of the BH3-only
proteins BIM and BMF [137, 235]. Since anoikis prevents
anchorage-independent proliferation and attachment to an
improper matrix, it is generally considered as an oncosup-
pressive process [234, 236]. Accordingly, cancer cells need
to acquire at least some degree of resistance to anoikis to
initiate and progress though the so-called “metastatic cas-
cade” [237–239]. Neoplastic cells can evade anoikis upon
activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1;
best known as ERK2) caused by cellular aggregation and
consequent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) sta-
bilization mediated by erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2
(ERBB2) [237, 240], or degradation of the negative ERK2
regulator BRCA1-associated protein (BRAP), which is
favored by coiled-coil domain containing 178 (CCDC178)
[241]. Once activated, ERK2 reportedly supports anoikis
resistance by promoting the cytosolic sequestration of BIM
in complex with dynein light chain LC8-type 1 (DYNLL1;
best known as LC8) and beclin 1 (BECN1) [138, 238], or
the transactivation of integrin subunit alpha 6 (ITGA6) via a
mechanism dependent on KRAS [242].
Additional strategies that limit the sensitivity of malig-
nant cells to anoikis encompass (but are not limited to): (1)
activation
of
anti-apoptotic
BCL2
proteins,
including
MCL1 stabilization as induced by ﬁbroblast-derived insulin
like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) [243] and
increase in BCL2 expression levels as imposed by hepatitis
B virus X protein [244]; (2) epigenetic silencing of
adhesion-related genes, such as SHC adaptor protein 1
(SHC1) upon overexpression of the hematopoietic tran-
scription factor IKAROS family zinc ﬁnger 3 (IKZF3; also
known as AIOLOS) [245]; (3) perturbation of ITG-protein
tyrosine kinase 2 (PTK2; best known as FAK) signaling,
which usually suppresses anoikis [246–249]; (4) activation
of
the
so-called
“epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition”
(EMT), which is associated with multiple signal transduc-
tion and metabolic modules for RCD resistance [242, 250,
251]; (5) targeting of Yes associated protein 1 (YAP1) by
miR-200a or via a platelet-dependent mechanism [252,
253]; (6) increased antioxidant responses driven by the
activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-mediated upregu-
lation of heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) [254]; (7) autophagy
activation [254, 255]; (8) upregulation of the molecular
chaperone crystallin alpha B (CRYAB; also known as
HSPB5) [256]; (9) signaling via AMPK and proliferation
and apoptosis adaptor protein 15 (PEA15), which favors
anchorage-independent cell growth [257]; (10) upregulation
of matrix metallopeptidases (MMPs) by a mechanism
involving the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-driven auto-
crine production of angiopoietin like 4 (ANGPTL4) [258];
(11) expression and phosphorylation of signal transducer
and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) [259]; and (12)
rewiring of central carbon metabolism toward NAPDH
synthesis, resulting in improved redox homeostasis [260,
261]. That said, it has become evident that the adaptation of
cancer cells to the loss of attachment involves multiple
processes beyond (but presumably highly interconnected to)
anoikis resistance [234 262–264], suggesting that multiple
barriers need to be overcome for the metastatic cascade to
be initiated.
The NCCD proposes to deﬁne intrinsic apoptosis as a
form of RCD initiated by perturbations of the intracellular
or extracellular microenvironment, demarcated by MOMP
and precipitated by executioner caspases, mainly CASP3
(Box 1).
Extrinsic apoptosis
Extrinsic apoptosis is an RCD modality initiated by per-
turbations of the extracellular microenvironment [265–268].
Extrinsic apoptosis is mostly driven by either of two types
of plasma membrane receptors: (1) death receptors, whose
activation depends on the binding of the cognate ligand(s),
and (2) dependence receptors, whose activation occurs
when the levels of their speciﬁc ligand drop below a speciﬁc
threshold [267 269–271].
Death receptors include (but are not limited to): Fas cell
surface death receptor (FAS; also known as CD95 or APO-
1), and TNF receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A;
best known as TNFR1), 10a (TNFRSF10A; best known as
TRAILR1 or DR4), and 10b (TNFRSF10B; best known as
TRAILR2 or DR5) [269, 270, 272, 273]. As a general rule,
death receptor ligation allows for the assembly of a dynamic
multiprotein complex at the intracellular tail of the receptor,
such
as
so-called
“death-inducing
signaling
complex”
(DISC), “complex I”, and “complex II”, which operate as
molecular platforms to regulate the activation and functions
of CASP8 (or CASP10, in a limited number of settings)
[274–276]. In the case of FAS and TRAILRs, the cognate
ligands—namely, FAS ligand (FASLG; also known as
CD95L or APO-1L) and TNF superfamily member 10
(TNFSF10; best known as TRAIL), respectively—stabilize

preformed receptor homotrimers to induce a conformational
change at their intracellular tails that enables the death
domain (DD)-dependent association of the adapter Fas
associated via death domain (FADD) [277–282]. In turn,
FADD drives DISC assembly by promoting the death
effector domain (DED)-dependent recruitment of CASP8 (or
CASP10) and multiple isoforms of c-FLIP. In contrast,
TNFR1 signaling involves the association of TNFRSF1A
associated via DD (TRADD), which acts as an adaptor for
the assembly of complex I, generally consisting of TNF
receptor associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TRAF5, c-IAP1, c-
IAP2, RIPK1, and the linear ubiquitin chain assembly
complex (LUBAC), a supramolecular entity consisting of
SHANK associated RH domain interactor (SHARPIN),
RANBP2-type, and C3HC4-type zinc ﬁnger containing 1
(RBCK1; best known as HOIL-1), and ring ﬁnger protein 31
(RNF31; best known as HOIP) [283–287]. Of note, the
glycosylation state of some death receptors (e.g., FAS) has
been shown to impact on the sensitivity of T lymphocytes to
extrinsic apoptosis, hence inﬂuencing the termination of
inﬂammatory responses [288–290]. The relevance of death
receptor glycosylation for extrinsic apoptosis in other cell
types has not been investigated in detail.
The molecular mechanisms regulating CASP8 activity
upon death receptor stimulation have been extensively
investigated. In particular, CASP8 maturation involves a
cascade of events initiated by the binding of CASP8 to
FADD at the DISC. This interaction enables the assembly
of a linear ﬁlament of CASP8 molecules (depending on
their DEDs) that facilitates homodimerization and con-
sequent activation by autoproteolytic cleavage [291–295].
A key role in this setting is mediated by c-FLIP, which is a
catalytically inactive close relative of CASP8 [296, 297].
Compelling evidence indicates that the short variant of c-
FLIP (c-FLIPS) and its long counterpart (c-FLIPL) inhibit
and activate CASP8, respectively, by modulating CASP8
oligomerization
[298–301].
Active
CASP8
reportedly
cleaves c-FLIPL [302] and heterodimeric complexes of
CASP8 with c-FLIPL (but not c-FLIPS) are endowed with
limited enzymatic activity that favors CASP8 oligomeriza-
tion and consequent activation [301]. c-FLIP isoforms and
CASP8 seem to be recruited at the DISC to comparable
levels [303], supporting the notion that elevated expression
levels of c-FLIPL inhibit, rather than activate, extrinsic
apoptosis possibly by disrupting CASP8 maturation [301,
304]. Of note, CFLAR (the gene encoding c-FLIP) is under
direct transcriptional control by NF-κB, which largely
contributes to pro-survival TNFR1 signaling in speciﬁc
circumstances (see below) [287, 296, 305]. The enzymatic
activity of CASP8 appears to be controlled by additional
post-translational mechanisms, including (but not limited
to): (1) phosphorylation at Y380, which inhibits the
autoproteolytic activity of CASP8 upon FAS activation
[306], (2) phosphorylation at T273, which is catalyzed by
polo like kinase 3 (PLK3) at the DISC and promotes
CASP8 apoptotic functions [307], and (3) deubiquitination,
which decreases CASP8 activity and interrupts extrinsic
apoptosis [302].
The execution of extrinsic apoptosis driven by death
receptors follows two distinct pathways. In so-called “type I
cells” (e.g., thymocytes and mature lymphocytes) the
CASP8-dependent proteolytic maturation of executioner
CASP3 and CASP7 sufﬁces to drive RCD, which cannot be
inhibited by the transgene-driven overexpression of anti-
apoptotic BCL2 proteins, the co-deletion of Bax and Bak1,
or the loss of BID [308, 309]. Conversely, in “type II cells”
(e.g., hepatocytes, pancreatic β cells, and a majority of
cancer cells), in which CASP3 and CASP7 activation is
restrained by XIAP [310], extrinsic apoptosis requires the
proteolytic cleavage of BID by CASP8 [70, 311, 312]. This
leads to the generation of a truncated form of BID (tBID),
which translocates to the OMM [313, 314] via a mechanism
that, at least upon FAS stimulation, reportedly depends on
the binding of modulator of apoptosis 1 (MOAP1) to the
alleged BID receptor mitochondrial carrier 2 (MTCH2)
[315, 316]. At the OMM, tBID operates as a BH3-only
activator to engage BAX/BAK-dependent MOMP-driven
and consequent CASP9-driven RCD. Although human
CASP10 shares some degree of substrate speciﬁcity with
CASP8 [317] and possibly contributes to extrinsic apoptosis
in primary T cells [318], rodents including mice and rats
lack a functional Casp10 gene, and the precise role of this
caspase in death receptor-driven apoptosis in humans and
other CASP10-proﬁcient species remains a matter of con-
troversy [319–321]. A recent study shows that—following
FAS
activation—CASP10
causes
the
dissociation
of
CASP8 from the DISC, thereby promoting cell survival
[319]. FAT atypical cadherin 1 (FAT1) appears to mediate
similar anti-apoptotic function by limiting the association of
CASP8 with the DISC [322].
A large body of evidence demonstrates that death
receptor ligation does not necessarily culminate in RCD. In
particular, TNFR1 activation can have diverse outcomes
depending
on
multiple
variables,
such
as
the
post-
translational modiﬁcation status of RIPK1, which has a
direct impact on the assembly of pro-survival vs. pro-death
signaling complexes [323–325]. Thus, following tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) stimulation, RIPK1 is recruited at
complex I in a TRADD-independent manner, followed by
RIPK1 polyubiquitination by c-IAP1, c-IAP2, and LUBAC
[196, 324 326–329]. Polyubiquitinated RIPK1 promotes
cell survival and inﬂammation by acting as a scaffold for
the sequential recruitment of TGF-beta activated kinase 1/
MAP3K7-binding protein 2 (TAB2), TAB3, and mitogen-
activated protein kinase kinase kinase 7 (MAP3K7; best
known as TAK1), which can drive mitogen-activated
Signaling modules in the control of cell death

protein kinase (MAPK) signaling or IκB kinase (IKK)-
dependent NF-κB activation [283, 287 330–333]. More-
over, the phosphorylation of RIPK1 by TAK1, the IKK
complex
or
mitogen-activated
protein
kinase-activated
protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2; best known as MK2)
appears to alter its ability to interact with FADD and
CASP8, hence preventing the variants of TNF-induced
RCD that depends on RIPK1 kinase activity and favoring
RIPK1-independent TRADD-, FADD-, and CASP8-driven
apoptosis [285 334–336]. Conversely, in the presence of so-
called “SMAC mimetics” (which de facto operate as IAP
inhibitors) [337], RIPK1 is deubiquitinated by CYLD lysine
63 deubiquitinase (CYLD), favoring its release from com-
plex I and its association with FADD and CASP8 in the
cytosol to form complex II, which drives extrinsic apoptosis
[338]. Complex II formation also requires TRAF2 ubiqui-
tination by HECT domain and ankyrin repeat containing E3
ubiquitin protein ligase 1 (HACE1) [339]. To add a further
layer of complexity, the proteasomal degradation of TRAF2
appears to be prevented (at least in hepatocytes) by RIPK1,
independently of its kinase activity [340, 341]. Of note,
TNFR1 can also activate alternative RCD modalities, such
as necroptosis (see below).
Death receptor signaling can also lead to NF-κB activa-
tion, generally resulting in cell survival associated with a
robust inﬂammatory response [272, 342]. The ability of
some death receptors including TNFR1 to promote NF-κB
activation over CASP8 activation appears to depend on the
degree of receptor oligomerization (i.e., trimerization vs.
higher-order multimerization) [343], the scaffolding (i.e.,
non-enzymatic) functions of CASP8, and the consequent
assembly of TNFR1-like complexes containing RIPK1 and
LUBAC [272, 286, 344]. Upon TRAILR activation,
LUBAC reportedly ubiquitinates both CASP8 and RIPK1
while promoting the recruitment of IKK to complex I [286],
which also explains the requirement of LUBAC for the
inhibition of TNF-induced cell death [345]. In line with this
notion, TNF alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3; best
known as A20) inhibits CASP8 activation downstream of
TRAILRs in glioblastoma cells, owing to its ability to
polyubiquitinate RIPK1 [346, 347]. A recent study suggests
that the ability of TRAILR2 to dispatch pro-survival rather
than pro-apoptotic signals may depend on its preferential
localization outside of lipid rafts [348]. It remains to be
demonstrated whether the same also applies to other death
receptors.
The
family
of
dependence
receptors
consists
of
approximately 20 members, including: (1) the netrin 1
(NTN1) receptors DCC netrin 1 receptor (DCC), unc-5
netrin receptor A (UNC5A), UNC5B, UNC5C, and
UNC5D; (2) the neurotrophin receptor neurotrophic
receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (NTRK3); and (3) the sonic
hedgehog (SHH) receptor patched 1 (PTCH1) [267, 349,
350]. Intriguingly, dependence receptors promote cell
survival, proliferation and differentiation in physiological
conditions (when their cognate ligands are normally
available), but activate distinct (and not completely elu-
cidated) lethal signaling cascades (generally impinging on
caspase activation) once ligand availability falls below a
speciﬁc threshold level [350]. Thus, in the absence of their
respective ligands: (1) DCC is cleaved by CASP3 and this
promotes its association with adaptor protein, phospho-
tyrosine interacting with PH domain and leucine zipper 1
(APPL1) and CASP9, resulting in the activation of the
CASP9-CASP3 cascade [350, 351]; (2) PTCH1 interacts
with the cytosolic adaptor four and a half LIM domains 2
(FHL2; best known as DRAL), hence favoring the
assembly of a CASP9-activating complex consisting of
caspase recruitment domain family member 8 (CARD8;
also known as TUCAN) and neural precursor cell
expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4, E3 ubi-
quitin protein ligase (NEDD4) [352–354]; (3) UNC5B
enables the protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A)-mediated acti-
vating dephosphorylation of death associated protein
kinase 1 (DAPK1), which is known to promote p53-
dependent RCD [355–357]; and (4) UNC5D and NTRK3
are subjected to CASP3 cleavage generating intracellular
fragments that translocate either into the nucleus to trigger
the E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1)-driven expression of
pro-apoptotic genes (as in the case of UNC5D) or at
mitochondria to activate CASP9 upon MOMP (as in the
case of NTRK3) [358, 359].
Dependence receptor-driven RCD has been involved in
multiple pathophysiological settings, and exerts robust
oncosuppressive functions [350]. Accordingly, neoplastic
cells often escape from dependence receptor-mediated RCD
by (1) upregulating the expression of their cognate ligands
such as NTN1 [360–362]; (2) inactivating, downregulating,
or losing gene(s) encoding speciﬁc dependence receptors,
including DCC, UNC5C, and NTRK3 [350 363–369]; or (3)
silencing
signal
transducers
operating
downstream
of
dependence receptors—such as DAPK1—via epigenetic
mechanisms [370]. That said, whether the actual patho-
physiological relevance of dependence receptor signaling
stems from the initiation of extrinsic apoptosis remains to be
formally established. Of note, in speciﬁc cell types, some
members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) protein family
including toll like receptor 3 (TLR3) have also been sug-
gested to trigger RCD by a mechanism that involves toll
like receptor adaptor molecule 1 (TICAM1; best known as
TRIF), and ultimately impinges on CASP8 activation [371,
372]. However, it remains unclear whether TLR3 and other
TLRs actually initiate a private RCD program that directly
engages CASP8, or whether they promote RCD upon the
activation of an NF-κB-dependent autocrine/paracrine sig-
naling pathway involving TNF.

We propose to deﬁne extrinsic apoptosis as a type of
RCD initiated by perturbations of the extracellular micro-
environment that are detected by plasma membrane recep-
tors, propagated by CASP8 (with the optional involvement
of MOMP), and precipitated by executioner caspases,
mainly CASP3 (Box 1).
MPT-driven necrosis
MPT-driven necrosis is a form of RCD initiated by speciﬁc
perturbations of the intracellular microenvironment such as
severe oxidative stress and cytosolic Ca2+ overload, which
generally manifests with a necrotic morphotype [373, 374].
The term MPT refers to an abrupt loss of the impermeability
of the IMM to small solutes, resulting in rapid Δψm dis-
sipation, osmotic breakdown of both mitochondrial mem-
branes, and RCD [373, 374].
At the biochemical level, MPT-driven necrosis has been
proposed to follow the opening of the so-called “permeability
transition pore complex” (PTPC), a supramolecular complex
assembled at the junctions between the IMM and OMM [103,
374]. The composition, regulation, and precise mechanism of
action of the PTPC are still under intense investigation and
matter of a vivid debate [373, 375]. To date, peptidylprolyl
isomerase F (PPIF; best known as cyclophilin D, CYPD) is
the only protein whose in vivo requirement for MPT induc-
tion has been formally validated with robust genetic tools
(although there is consensus around the notion that CYPD
does not constitute the pore-forming unit of the PTPC) [376–
379]. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibitors of CYPD
including cyclosporin A (CsA) [376 379–381], sanglifehrin A
(SfA) [382, 383], and JW47 [384] limit MPT-driven necrosis
and confer protection in multiple rodent models of disease in
which oxidative stress and cytosolic Ca2+ overload constitute
major etiological determinants (e.g., neuronal, cardiac, and
renal ischemia/reperfusion). Along similar lines, CYPD
degradation through a mechanism initiated by the over-
expression of HCLS1 associated protein X-1 (HAX1) abol-
ishes
MPT-driven
necrosis
and
limits
the
demise
of
cardiomyocytes experiencing ischemia/reperfusion in vivo
[385]. Nonetheless, a large randomized clinical study com-
pleted in 2015 (the CIRCUS trial) failed to conﬁrm previous
ﬁndings from 2008 [386] on the cardioprotective effects of
cyclosporine administered before percutaneous coronary
intervention to patients with acute myocardial infarction
[387]. Although multiple caveats linked to the methods
employed to measure infarct size and the use of a speciﬁc
pharmacological CsA formulation can be invoked to explain
the negative results of the CIRCUS trial [388], the elevated
interconnectivity of RCD subroutines (notably, intrinsic
apoptosis and MPT-driven necrosis) may have played a key
role in this setting.
At odds with CYPD, several other proteins that had
previously been hypothesized to mediate a non-redundant
role within the PTPC turned out to be dispensable for MPT
in vivo, based on relatively robust genetic models [373].
Thus, an inducible cardiomyocyte-speciﬁc deletion of
solute carrier family 25 member 3 (Slc25a3, which codes
for the inorganic phosphate carrier) in mice does not affect
the ability of mitochondria to undergo MPT in vitro, as it
establishes partial PTPC desensitization in cellula and
slightly mitigates cardiac injury upon ischemia/reperfusion
in vivo (~10% reduction in ischemic area over area at risk)
[389]. Similar ﬁndings have been obtained for distinct
isoforms of the IMM integral protein adenine nucleotide
translocator (ANT) and the OMM protein VDAC. In par-
ticular, the concurrent knockout or knockdown of Slc25a4
and Slc25a5, which encode ANT1 and ANT2, respectively
[390], or that of Vdac1, Vdac2, and Vdac3 [391, 392] fails
to prevent the induction of MPT by oxidative stress or Ca2+
overload. However, mitochondria isolated from Slc25a4
−/−Slc25a5−/−mouse livers are desensitized to Ca2+-driven
MPT to a similar extent than mitochondria exposed to CsA
[390]. Moreover, Slc25a31 encodes another ANT isoform
(i.e., ANT4), that (at least in some mouse tissues) may
compensate for the absence of ANT1 and ANT2 [393, 394].
These results reﬂect a consistent degree of genetic and
functional redundancy among the components of the
molecular machinery for MPT [373].
Several lines of evidence suggest that the mitochondrial
F1FO ATPase mediates a non-redundant role within the
PTPC. Initially, the c-ring of the F1FO ATPase [395–398] as
well as F1FO ATPase dimers [399] have been proposed to
constitute the long-sought PTPC pore-forming unit. A
speciﬁc interaction between CYPD and the lateral stalk of
the F1FO ATPase, as well as the ability of Ca2+ ions (which
are potent MPT inducers) to bind to ATP synthase, H+
transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, beta polypeptide
(ATP5B) [100], lend further support to this interpretation
[395, 400, 401]. However, very recent ﬁndings seem to
exclude the possibility that the F1FO ATPase constitutes the
pore-forming component of the PTPC [402–405]. First, it
seems unlikely for c-rings (which exist as pores across the
IMM) to lose their lipid plugs in relatively physiological
conditions [402]. Second, mitochondria from human cells
lacking all the genes coding for the c subunit of the F1FO
ATP synthase, i.e., ATP synthase, H+ transporting, mito-
chondrial Fo complex subunit C1 (subunit 9; ATP5G1),
subunit C2 (subunit 9; ATP5G2), and subunit C3 (subunit 9;
ATP5G3), reportedly retain the ability to undergo MPT in
response to Ca2+ overload [403]. Finally, cells lacking ATP
synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F1 complex, O
subunit (ATP5O; best known as OSCP), or the membrane
domain of the b subunit of the F1FO ATP synthase (encoded
by ATP5F1) appear to preserve normal PTPC activity [405].
Signaling modules in the control of cell death
495

That said, the implication of the F1FO ATPase or compo-
nents thereof in MPT-driven necrosis remains a matter of
intensive investigation. An RNA interference (RNAi)-based
screening identiﬁed SPG7, paraplegin matrix AAA pepti-
dase subunit (SPG7) as an essential component of the PTPC
acting as part of VDAC-containing and CYPD-containing
hetero-oligomers [406]. Despite the availability of Spg7−/−
mice, the actual involvement of SPG7 in MPT-derived
necrosis in vivo remains to be validated.
Several physical or functional PTPC interactors have
been shown to regulate MPT-driven necrosis. These
include: (1) pro- and anti-apoptotic BCL2 family members
such as BAX, BAK, and BID [407–410], as well as BCL2
and BCL-XL [411–414]; (2) DRP1, which appears to pro-
mote PTPC opening in response to chronic β adrenergic
receptor stimulation, via a mechanism that relies on DRP1
phosphorylation by calcium/calmodulin dependent protein
kinase II (CAMK2G; best known as CaMKII) [415]; and
(3) p53, which participates in MPT-driven necrosis upon
physical interaction with CYPD [416]. The latter interaction
has been shown to participate in the pathogenesis of
ischemic stroke in mice [416]. Its pathophysiological rele-
vance in humans, however, remains to be elucidated. Recent
ﬁndings lend additional support to the relevance of tight
Ca2+ homeostasis at the mitochondrial level for cellular and
organismal ﬁtness. Thus, perturbing the activity of the IMM
Ca2+ uniporter, consisting of mitochondrial calcium uni-
porter
(MCU),
single-pass
membrane
protein
with
aspartate-rich tail 1 (SMDT1; also known as EMRE),
mitochondrial calcium uptake 1 (MICU1) and MICU2,
reportedly affects mouse survival and liver regeneration
after partial hepatectomy by promoting mitochondrial Ca2+
overload and MPT-driven necrosis [417]. Along similar
lines, the loss of mitochondrial m-AAA proteases of the
IMM, which regulate the assembly of the IMM Ca2+ uni-
porter, induces mitochondrial Ca2+ overload, PTPC open-
ing, and neuronal cell death [418]. Adult mice subjected to
the cardiomyocyte-speciﬁc deletion of Mcu are protected
against cardiac ischemia/reperfusion as a consequence of
MTP
inhibition
[419].
Moreover,
the
inducible
cardiomyocyte-speciﬁc deletion of solute carrier family 8
member B1 (Slc8b1, which encodes a mitochondrial
potassium-dependent sodium/calcium exchanger) in mice
reportedly provokes sudden lethality owing to heart failure
imposed by MTP-regulated necrosis upon mitochondrial
Ca2+ overload [420]. Finally, rap guanine nucleotide
exchange factor 3 (RAPGEF3; best known as EPAC1)
appears to trigger PTPC opening by increasing mitochon-
drial Ca2+ levels through interaction with VDAC1, heat
shock protein family A (Hsp70) member 9 (HSPA9; best
known as GRP75), and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor
type 1 (ITPR1; best known as IP3R1), and the knockout of
Rapgef3
protects
mice
against
myocardial
ischemia/
reperfusion injury [421]. However, EPAC1 activation with
bicarbonate
reportedly
decreases
mitochondrial
Ca2+
uptake, stimulates ATP production, and inhibits multiple
forms of RCD including MPT-driven necrosis in rat cardi-
omyocytes [422]. The precise reasons underlying this
apparent discrepancy remain to be elucidated.
We propose to deﬁne MPT-driven necrosis as a form of
RCD triggered by perturbations of the intracellular micro-
environment and relying on CYPD (Box 1).
Necroptosis
Necroptosis is a form of RCD initiated by perturbations
of the extracellular or intracellular microenvironment
detected by speciﬁc death receptors, including (but not
limited to) FAS and TNFR1 [423–427], or pathogen
recognition receptors (PRRs), including TLR3, TLR4, and
Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1; also known as DAI)
[428–430]. It is now clear that necroptosis (which gen-
erally manifests with a necrotic morphotype) not only
mediates adaptative functions upon failing responses to
stress, but also participates in developmental safeguard
programs (to ensure the elimination of potentially defec-
tive organisms before parturition), as well as in the
maintenance of adult T-cell homeostasis (de facto serving
as a PCD subroutine, at least in speciﬁc settings)
[2 431–433].
At the molecular level, necroptosis critically depends on
the sequential activation of RIPK3 and mixed lineage
kinase domain like pseudokinase (MLKL) [434, 435]. Upon
necroptosis initiation by TNFR1, RIPK3 is activated by
RIPK1 (provided that CASP8 is inactive, see below)
through a mechanism involving the physical interaction
between their respective RIP homotypic interaction motif
(RHIM) domains and RIPK1 catalytic activity [436–438].
Accordingly, chemical inhibitors of RIPK1 including
necrostatin-1 (Nec-1) and derivatives (e.g., Nec-1s) robustly
inhibit TNFR1-driven necroptosis, in vitro and in vivo [425,
427]. Alternatively, RIPK3 can be activated following the
RHIM-dependent interaction with (1) TRIF upon either
TLR3 activation by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) within
endosomes, or TLR4 activation by lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) or various DAMPs at the plasma membrane [428]; or
(2) ZBP1, which operates as a sensor for cytosolic DNA-
promoting type I interferon (IFN) synthesis and NF-κB
activation [439–441]. Active RIPK3 catalyzes the phos-
phorylation of MLKL, resulting in the formation of MLKL
oligomers (most likely trimers or tetramers) that translocate
to the plasma membrane, where they bind speciﬁc phos-
phatidylinositol phosphate species by a roll-over mechan-
ism and hence trigger plasma membrane permeabilization
[435 442–453].

Although
the
essential
contribution
of
MLKL
to
necroptosis has been conﬁrmed by genetic studies [435] as
well as by pharmacological (i.e., inhibition of MLKL with
necrosulfonamide, NSA) interventions [442], the precise
mechanism through which MLKL executes necroptosis is
not completely understood. Recent studies ascribe to the
heat shock protein 90 kDa alpha family class A member 1
(HSP90AA1; best known as HSP90) a speciﬁc and non-
redundant role in MLKL oligomerization and translocation
[454, 455]. Moreover, it has also been reported that MLKL
oligomerization promotes a cascade of intracellular events
involving (1) Ca2+ inﬂux, which is presumably mediated by
the MLKL target transient receptor potential cation channel
subfamily M member 7 (TRPM7) [449]; and (2) PS expo-
sure, which seems to be directly operated by MLKL [456].
This is followed by the formation of PS-exposing plasma
membrane bubbles whose breakdown and release is nega-
tively regulated—in conditions of limited MLKL activation
—by the antagonistic activity of the endosomal sorting
complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III machinery
[456, 457]. Once localized at the plasma membrane, MLKL
reportedly activates cell-surface proteases of the ADAM
family, which can promote the shedding of plasma
membrane-associated proteins [458], or form Mg2+ per-
meant channels [459]. Of note, active MLKL also appears
to translocate to the nucleus, but the relevance of this
phenomenon for necroptosis remains to be investigated
[460].
Previous
data
supporting
the
involvement
of
PGAM family member 5, serine/threonine protein phos-
phatase, mitochondrial (PGAM5)- and DRP1-driven mito-
chondrial fragmentation in necroptosis [461] have been
conclusively invalidated [435, 446 462–466], conﬁrming
that necroptotic signaling can proceed normally indepen-
dent of mitochondria. Of note, the core components of
necroptosis are poorly conserved across the animal king-
dom, as some species lack RIPK3 and/or MLKL [467].
Moreover, a few non-canonical instances of pseudone-
croptotic RCD involving MLKL (but not RIPK3) [468] or
RIPK3 (but not MLKL) [469] have been described. These
observations reinforce the notion that the signaling path-
ways leading to RCD display a hitherto incompletely
understood degree of interconnectivity.
Death receptor (in particular TNFR1) engagement is the
trigger for RIPK3 activation best characterized so far. As
mentioned
above,
the
biological
outcome
of
TNFR1 signaling spans from cell survival and activation
(i.e., cytokine secretion) to multiple subroutines of RCD,
depending on a variety of cell-intrinsic (e.g., expression
levels of the proteins involved in the process) and cell-
extrinsic (e.g., intensity and duration of TNF stimulation)
factors [283]. In particular, the activation of RIPK3 down-
stream of TNFR1 ligation relies on the formation of a
RIPK1-containing
and
RIPK3-containing
amyloid-like
signaling complex commonly known as necrosome [436,
470], wherein ﬁrst RIPK1 and then RIPK3 undergo a series
of trans-phosphorylation or auto-phosphorylation events
that are required for MLKL recruitment and necroptosis
activation [437, 438, 442, 471]. Major negative regulators
of the necrosome include: (1) STIP1 homology and U-box
containing protein 1 (STUB1; also known as CHIP), which
promotes RIPK1 and RIPK3 ubiquitination followed by
lysosomal degradation [472, 473]; (2) A20, which inhibits
necrosome assembly by deubiquitinating RIPK3 [473, 474];
(3)
protein
phosphatase, Mg2+/Mn2+
dependent 1B
(PPM1B), which prevents MLKL recruitment to the
necrosome by dephosphorylating RIPK3 [475]; and (4)
aurora kinase A (AURKA), which mediates inhibitory
function upon physical interaction with RIPK1 and RIPK3
[476]. RIPK3 activation also depends on its physical asso-
ciation with a HSP90-containing and cell division cycle 37
(CDC37)-containing
co-chaperone
complex
[477].
In
addition,
the
assembly
of
the
necrosome
upon
TNFR1 stimulation impinges on two conditions: (1) phar-
macological or genetic CASP8 inactivation [478, 479], and
(2) RIPK1 deubiquitination-dependent phosphorylation (at
least in some settings), which can be favored by exogen-
ously provided SMAC mimetics, ensuring the release of
RIPK1 from complex I (see above) [334, 335, 480, 481].
As for the ﬁrst condition, compelling experimental
ﬁndings demonstrate that the concerted activity of CASP8,
FADD, and c-FLIPL tonically inhibits necroptosis [432,
466, 478, 479 482–484]. Thus, the embryonic lethality
imposed on mice by the loss of Casp8 or Fadd can be
rescued by concurrent ablation of Ripk3 or Mlkl, even
though these double knockout animals generally display
lymphoproliferative and/or systemic autoimmune disorders
as adults [432, 466, 484, 485]. Of note, Cﬂar−/−mice
require the concomitant knockout of Ripk3 and Fadd to
develop into adulthood, which underscores the inhibitory
role of c-FLIP in both necroptosis and extrinsic apoptosis
reported above [483, 486]. Along similar lines, the con-
current deletion of Ripk3 averts perturbations of cutaneous
and intestinal homeostasis imposed by the tissue-speciﬁc
ablation of Fadd or Casp8 [483, 487, 488]. Moreover, the
proliferative defects of Casp8−/−or Fadd−/−T cells can be
rescued by the administration of the RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1
or the concomitant ablation of Ripk3 [489]. Necroptosis is
also tonically inhibited by c-IAPs, owing to their ability to
ubiquitinate RIPK1 [490–493]. Accordingly, necroptosis
relies on the deubiquitinating activity of CYLD [338],
which is also a proteolytic target of CASP8 [494–496].
Finally, some components of the TNFR1 signaling cascade
reportedly regulate necroptosis either in a negative manner,
by catalyzing the inhibitory phosphorylation of RIPK1
(e.g., the IKK complex and MK2) [335, 336] and con-
stitutively
interacting
with
(and
thus
preventing
the
Signaling modules in the control of cell death
497

activation of) MLKL (e.g., TRAF2) [497], or in a positive
manner, by favoring the activating phosphorylation of
RIPK1 or RIPK3 upon prolonged activation (e.g., TAK1)
[334, 498]. In this context, CYLD also contributes to
necroptosis by deubiquitinating—and hence suppressing the
anti-necroptotic activity of—TRAF2 [497].
That said, mounting evidence indicates that necroptosis
driven by several stimuli—in some circumstances even
TNFR1 activation—does not necessarily rely on RIPK1.
Thus, in contrast to Ripk3−/−mice that are viable and fertile,
the Ripk1−/−genotype causes perinatal lethality [482],
which cannot be prevented by the ablation of Ripk3, Casp8,
or Fadd alone, but can be rescued by the co-deletion of
Ripk3 and Casp8, Fadd or Tnfrsf1a [482 499–501].
Moreover, Ripk1−/−cells display increased sensitivity to
necroptosis and/or extrinsic apoptosis induced by a set of
innate immune stimuli [499]. Conditional knockout mouse
models demonstrate the key role of RIPK1 for the pre-
servation of intestinal and cutaneous homeostasis and sur-
vival [502, 503]. In particular, mice lacking Ripk1 in
intestinal epithelial cells display increased rates of sponta-
neous
CASP8-driven
apoptosis
and
develop
severe
inﬂammatory lesions leading to premature death, a detri-
mental phenotype that can be prevented by co-deleting
Fadd or (to a lesser degree) Tnfrsf1a [502]. Likewise, the
absence of Ripk1 from keratinocytes promotes spontaneous
necroptosis and consequent cutaneous inﬂammation, which
can be prevented by the co-deletion of Ripk3, Mlkl, or Zbp1
but not Fadd [440, 502]. Collectively, these results suggest
that (at least in some settings) RIPK1 can inhibit (rather
than activate) RIPK3-dependent necroptosis and/or CASP8-
dependent extrinsic apoptosis [504]. At least in some set-
tings, this reﬂects the major role of RIPK1 in NF-κB acti-
vation [505–507].
Intriguingly, the pro-survival role of RIPK1 in develop-
ment seems to be independent of both its kinase activity and
RIPK3 binding, as demonstrated by the fact that mice
genetically engineered to express a kinase-dead variant of
RIPK1 (e.g., RIPK1K45A) are viable and fertile [447, 499,
508]. Moreover, it has recently been reported that the
autophagic receptor optineurin (OPTN) [509] actively reg-
ulates the proteasomal turnover of RIPK1, as the loss of
OPTN induces axonal degeneration via RIPK1-dependent
necroptosis [510]. Inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa B kinase
subunit gamma (IKBKG; best known as NEMO) also pre-
vents RIPK1-driven intestinal inﬂammation and epithelial cell
death, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain
poorly understood [511] Finally, when catalytically inactive
or inhibited by speciﬁc pharmacological agents such as Nec-
1, RIPK1 (and, at least under certain circumstances, RIPK3)
reportedly contributes to speciﬁc forms of CASP8-dependent
apoptosis (see above) [335, 336, 446, 447, 481 512–516]. The
current view ascribes the opposing roles of RIPK1 (and—at
least in part—RIPK3) in promoting or inhibiting RCD to its
kinase-dependent vs. kinase-independent (i.e., scaffolding)
functions, respectively [4, 517].
As mentioned above, RIPK3 can be activated by proteins
involved
in
innate
immunity
to
invading
pathogens
including TRIF and ZBP1 [428, 439]. Thus, in the absence
of CASP8 activity, stimulation of TLR3 or TLR4 by their
respective ligands promotes necroptosis upon the interac-
tion between TRIF and RIPK3 and the consequent activa-
tion of MLKL [428]. Accordingly, the synthetic TLR3
ligand polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) or the co-
administration of low-dose LPS and the caspase inhibitor Z-
VAD-fmk trigger necroptosis in dendritic cells (DCs) [518]
or microglial cells [519], respectively. In this context, IFN
alpha and beta receptor subunit 1 (IFNAR1) and IFN
gamma receptor 1 (IFNGR1) also appear to have pro-
necroptotic functions [520–523]. Thus, Ifnar1−/−macro-
phages are resistant to RCD induced by LPS or polyI:C in
the context of caspase inhibition, which would otherwise
trigger a necroptotic process relying on TRIF and tonic
IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) signaling [523].
Genetic studies demonstrate that the lethality imposed to
mice by the Ripk1−/−Tnfrsf1a−/−genotype is delayed (but
not prevented) by the co-deletion of Ticam1 or Ifnar1 [482].
Moreover, Ripk1−/−cells are more sensitive to necroptosis
induced by polyI:C or type I IFN [482]. However, Tnfrsf1a
−/−Ripk1−/−Ripk3−/−mice develop into adulthood, sug-
gesting the existence of additional RIPK3 activators [482].
Recently, the mechanism underlying ZBP1-mediated
necroptosis and its regulation by RIPK1 has been elucidated
[440, 441]. ZBP1 acts at the initial steps of necroptosis by
mediating the sequential activation of RIPK3 and MLKL.
Moreover, mice expressing a variant of RIPK1 mutated in
the RHIM domain die perinatally, a phenotype that can be
rescued by concurrent Ripk3, Mlkl, or Zbp1 (but not
Ticam1) deletion, as well as by the knock-in of catalytically
inactive RIPK3 or RIPK3 mutated in the RHIM domain
[440, 441]. This suggests that the RHIM of RIPK1 acts as
an inhibitor of ZBP1-driven necroptosis, most likely
because it prevents the interaction between ZBP1 and
RIPK3. Further investigation is required to clarify the
mechanisms of ZBP1 activation in this context and its
relevance for development and homeostatic tissue regula-
tion. Importantly, multiple components of the molecular
machinery
for
necroptosis—including
ZBP1,
RIPK3,
MLKL, and TNFR1 (mainly via NF-κB)—impinge on the
control of the so-called “inﬂammasome”, a supramolecular
platform for the activation of CASP1 and consequent
secretion of mature interleukin 1 beta (IL1B; best known as
IL-1β) and IL18 [524–529]. Discussing in detail these links
—which exemplify the complex interconnection between
RCD signaling and inﬂammatory responses—goes beyond
the scope of this review [4, 8 530–532].

In summary, we propose to deﬁne necroptosis as a type
of RCD triggered by perturbations of extracellular or
intracellular homeostasis that critically depends on MLKL,
RIPK3, and (at least in some settings) on the kinase activity
of RIPK1 (Box 1).
Ferroptosis
Ferroptosis is a form of RCD initiated by speciﬁc pertur-
bations of the intracellular microenvironment, notably
severe lipid peroxidation, which relies on ROS generation
and iron availability [533–536]. The molecular mechanisms
precipitating ferroptosis have begun to emerge [534], and
(so far) ferroptotic RCD has been linked to toxic lipid
peroxide accrual [537, 538]. Ferroptosis occurs indepen-
dently of caspases, necrosome components and CYPD, and
the molecular machinery for autophagy [539], manifests
with a necrotic morphotype (with a predominance of
mitochondrial
alterations
encompassing
shrinkage,
an
electron-dense ultrastructure, reduced/disappeared cristae,
and ruptured OMM) [374], and is potentially associated
with a consistent release of immunostimulatory DAMPs
[540, 541]. Interestingly, BCL2 has been suggested to limit
the physiological demise of neuron progenitors failing to
differentiate via a mechanism that (1) does not depend on
BAX and caspases, and (2) can be suppressed by ferroptosis
inhibitors [542]. The actual implication of BCL2 in the
regulation of ferroptosis, however, remains to be ﬁrmly
established.
Some of the molecular circuitries regulating the initial
steps of ferroptosis have been recently unveiled by
employing (1) speciﬁc ferroptosis-inducing agents, includ-
ing erastin [543, 544], RSL3 [543, 544], and FIN56 [545];
and (2) speciﬁc ferroptosis-inhibiting agents, including
ferrostatins [539, 546] and liproxstatins [547]. In particular,
the reduced glutathione (GSH)-dependent enzyme glu-
tathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)—which is directly targeted
by RSL3—has emerged as the main endogenous inhibitor
of ferroptosis by virtue of its ability to limit lipid perox-
idation by catalyzing the GSH-dependent reduction of lipid
hydroperoxides to lipid alcohols [547–550]. In line with this
notion, erastin triggers ferroptosis by (indirectly) affecting
the catalytic cycle of GPX4 via a mechanism that involves
the inhibition of the cystine/glutamate antiporter system xc
−
and consequent decrease in intracellular cysteine (which
derives from cystine reduction in the cytoplasm) and GSH
(which is synthesized from cysteine) [539, 548, 549, 551].
Accordingly, depleting GSH with L-buthionine sulfoximine
(BSO)—an inhibitor of the glutamate–cysteine ligase
complex—can induce ferroptotic RCD (at least in some
cases) [547]. Moreover, the toxicity of high extracellular
glutamate may depend (at least in part) on the activation of
ferroptosis through cysteine imbalance [534, 538, 552]. Of
relevance for cancer therapy, the pronounced addiction of
triple-negative breast carcinoma to glutamine relates (at
least in part) to its ability to drive cystine uptake via xc
−,
implying that xc
−may constitute a therapeutic target in this
setting [553, 554]. Moreover, the FDA-approved tyrosine
kinase inhibitor sorafenib can trigger ferroptosis in distinct
cellular models by depleting GSH upon system xc
−inhi-
bition [551 555–557], while altretamine (an FDA-approved
alkylating agent) has been recently identiﬁed as a potential
inhibitor of GPX4 by a regulatory network genome-wide
system strategy [558]. Thus, the antineoplastic effects of
sorafenib and altretamine may partially stem from the
activation of ferroptosis. Notably, the demise of neurons
caused by inhibition of xc
−was initially referred to as
oxytosis, oxidative glutamate toxicity, or excitotoxicity, and
was linked to alterations in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis
[559–561]. It remains unclear to which extent oxytosis can
be mechanistically discriminated from ferroptosis and MPT-
driven necrosis in diverse cellular contexts.
Recent evidence indicates that ferroptosis involves the
preferential oxidation of speciﬁc phosphatidylethanolamine-
containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) such as
arachidonic and adrenic acid [562]. In line with a critical
requirement for oxidizable PUFAs, genetic and/or phar-
macological inhibition of acyl-CoA synthetase long chain
family member 4 (ACSL4) and lysophosphatidylcholine
acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3), both of which are involved in
the incorporation of long PUFAs into cellular membranes,
protects cells against ferroptosis (at least in some settings)
[562–565]. Lipid hydroperoxides can be formed by auto-
xidation or via enzymatic reactions catalyzed by lipox-
ygenases (LOXs) or cyclooxygenases (COXs). In the
context of ferroptosis, PUFA peroxidation seems to be
mainly regulated by the mutually antagonistic activity of
LOXs (which directly catalyze lipid peroxidation) and
GPX4 (which indirectly inhibits it) [550, 566]. Although
arachidonate
15-lipoxygenase
(ALOX15)
was
initially
thought to play a major role in this setting, the deletion of
Alox15 fails to rescue the renal phenotype imposed by the
Gpx4−/−genotype (see below) [547], suggesting that mul-
tiple LOXs are involved in PUFA peroxidation and con-
sequent ferroptosis in some mouse tissues. Accordingly,
oxidized PUFAs accumulate upon GPX4 inactivation and
this can result in PUFA fragmentation and ferroptosis [539,
547]. This lethal cascade can be prevented by antioxidant
agents such as ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), liproxstatin-1 (Lip-1) as
well as by vitamin E, coenzyme Q10 and their analogs, all of
which efﬁciently limit lipid peroxidation by operating as
ROS scavengers [539, 547, 550, 562 567–569]. Of note, the
catalytic sites of LOXs contain di-iron centers [570]. This
may explain: (1) the ferroptosis-inhibiting effect of iron
depletion
by
either
chelators
[539,
543,
548]
or
Signaling modules in the control of cell death
499

phosphorylase kinase catalytic subunit gamma 2 (PHKG2)
knockdown [566], and (2) the ferroptosis-promoting effect
of increased intracellular iron availability consequent to
import by the circulating iron carrier transferrin (TF) [571,
572], degradation of ferritin (a cellular iron storage com-
plex) by a speciﬁc autophagic mechanism known as ferri-
tinophagy [573, 574], disruption of iron homeostasis
induced by nanoparticles [541], or administration of a
bioavailable iron form [575]. Alternatively, the critical
dependency of ferroptosis on iron can also be ascribed to
the ability of this heavy metal to promote non-enzymatic
lipid oxidation via lysosomal Fenton reactions [538, 572,
576, 577].
Additional
ferroptosis
regulators
described
so
far
include: (1) the mevalonate pathway component farnesyl-
diphosphate farnesyltransferase 1 (FDFT1; best known as
SQS) [545]; (2) the transsulfuration pathway enzyme
cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase (CARS) [578]; (3) heat shock
protein family B (small) member 1 (HSPB1; best known as
HSP27) [579] and heat shock protein family A (Hsp70)
member 5 (HSPA5) [580]; (4) glutaminolysis [571]; (5)
components of the MAPK signaling pathway [539, 581];
(6) the nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2 (NFE2L2; best
known NRF2) signaling pathway [582]; (7) metallothionein
1G (MT1G) [583]; (8) dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) [584];
(9) Fanconi anemia complementation group D2 (FANCD2)
[585]; and (10) CDGSH iron sulfur domain 1 (CISD1; also
known as mitoNEET) [586]. Elucidating the precise role of
these proteins or signaling pathways in ferroptosis requires
further investigation.
Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the pro-survival
functions of GPX4 contribute to development and homeo-
static tissue maintenance. Gpx4−/−mice display embryonic
lethality with complete penetrance [547, 550, 587, 588].
Moreover, the inducible or tissue-speciﬁc ablation of Gpx4 in
mice provokes a variety of pathological conditions, including
acute renal or hepatic injury [547, 563, 589], neurodegen-
eration [550, 590, 591], and defective immunity to infection
[567], all of which can be prevented or mitigated by
ferroptosis-inhibiting strategies. A similar protective effect is
observed in GPX4-independent models of renal ischemic or
toxic injury [540, 592], Parkinson disease [593], and other
human pathologies [594]. Moreover, ferroptosis appears to
operate as a bona ﬁde oncosuppressive mechanism [548
595–598]. It has been proposed—but remains to be formally
established—that part of the multipronged oncosuppressor
functions of p53 may derive from the transcriptional down-
regulation of components of system xc
−, which would
impinge on speciﬁc post-translational modiﬁcations of p53
[596, 598]. Accordingly, the ability of ATF4 to upregulate
system xc
−and stabilize GPX4 (upon HSPA5 transactivation)
is causally involved in some models of oncogenesis and
chemoresistance to ferroptosis induction [580, 599]. Along
similar lines, parts of the oncogenic effects of NRF2 acti-
vation driven by cancer-associated mutations in kelch like
ECH associated protein 1 (KEAP1) may derive from the
upregulation of system xc
−[582]. Conversely, p53 appears to
inhibit ferroptosis in colorectal cancer cells, at least in part by
inhibiting DPP4 activity in a transcription-independent
manner [584]. Of note, malignant cells with a mesenchy-
mal phenotype (which are generally more resistant to treat-
ment) reportedly acquire an accrued dependency on GPX4
activity, which can be exploited therapeutically [600].
Recently, a ferroptosis-like RCD subroutine has been
described in plants responding to moderate heat stress, sup-
porting some degree of evolutionary conservation and the
relevance of ferroptosis for organismal homeostasis [601]. In
this context, it is worth noting that the pharmacological
inhibition of ferroptosis, but not necroptosis or apoptosis,
protects tissues such as renal tubules from ischemia/reper-
fusion injury [540]. The precise role of ferroptosis in devel-
opment and tissue homeostasis, however, remains to be fully
elucidated.
We propose to deﬁne ferroptosis as a form of RCD
initiated by oxidative perturbations of the intracellular
microenvironment that is under constitutive control by
GPX4 and can be inhibited by iron chelators and lipophilic
antioxidants (Box 1).
Pyroptosis
Pyroptosis is a form of RCD triggered by perturbations of
extracellular or intracellular homeostasis related to innate
immunity (e.g., pathogen invasion) manifesting with speciﬁc
morphological feature [602]. These include a peculiar form of
chromatin condensation that differs from its apoptotic coun-
terpart, as well as cellular swelling culminating with plasma
membrane permeabilization [602]. The term pyroptosis was
originally coined by Cookson and Brennan to deﬁne a par-
ticular type of RCD partially resembling apoptosis but
dependent on inﬂammatory CASP1 (and hence linked to
pyrexia) [603], and several names including pyronecrosis
have been introduced since to deﬁne partially related pro-
cesses [604, 605]. Initially, pyroptosis was thought to be
relevant only for the demise of monocytes or macrophages
undergoing canonical CASP1 activation [606, 607]. How-
ever, recent ﬁndings indicate that pyroptosis (1) can be also
driven by several other caspases including CASP3 [608], (2)
can also occur in cell types other than cells from the mono-
cytic lineage [609], (3) has a major role in innate immunity
against intracellular pathogens [602], and (4) is etiologically
involved in pathological conditions such as lethal septic shock
(at least as induced by LPS) [610, 611].
At a molecular level, pyroptosis generally relies on the
activation of one or more caspases, including CASP1,
500
L. Galluzzi et al.

CASP3, murine CASP11, and its human homologs CASP4
and CASP5, depending on the initiating stimulus [612,
613]. Thus, pyroptosis is often (if not always) associated
with IL-1β and IL18 secretion, and hence mediates robust
pro-inﬂammatory effects [614, 615]. A large body of evi-
dence indicates that cytosolic LPS from invading Gram-
negative bacteria is a major trigger of pyroptosis. In parti-
cular, it has been shown that CASP11 is responsible for the
CASP1-independent death of macrophages responding to
Gram-negative bacterial infection [616–619]. Moreover,
Casp11 deletion protects mice against a challenge with
cytosol-invasive bacteria [612, 620], as well as against
systemic LPS administration and consequent pyroptosis-
dependent endotoxic shock [616, 621]. Further experi-
mental observations conﬁrmed that CASP11, CASP4, and
CASP5 trigger pyroptosis upon sensing cytosolic LPS [609
622–624], in monocytes as well as in other cell types [609,
625]. In particular, LPS-induced pyroptosis involves the
physical interaction of LPS (or its lipid moiety) with the
CARD domain of CASP11, CASP4, or CASP5, a highly
speciﬁc binding resulting in caspase oligomerization and
consequent activation [609]. Thus, CASP11, CASP4, and
CASP5 act as bona ﬁde PRRs for cytosolic LPS. Once
activated beyond a speciﬁc threshold, inﬂammatory cas-
pases precipitate pyroptosis by catalyzing the proteolytic
cleavage of GSDMD [621, 626, 627]. However, at least in
some cell types including DCs, CASP11 activation can
drive IL-1β secretion in the absence of cell death [628].
In line with a critical role of GSDMD, Gsdmd−/−mac-
rophages are resistant to LPS-induced and Gram-negative
bacteria-induced pyroptosis, and Gsdmd−/−mice survive
doses of LPS that induce lethal endotoxic shock in their
wild-type counterparts [621, 626]. Recent ﬁndings demon-
strate that GSDMD is constitutionally auto-inhibited by the
binding of its C-terminal repressor domain (GSDMD-C, or
RD) to its N-terminal pore-forming domain (GSDMD-N, or
PFD). On pyroptosis induction, inﬂammatory caspases
relieve this inhibition by catalyzing the proteolytic cleavage
of the interdomain loop, which promotes the release of the
pyroptotic
inducer
GSDMD-N
[621,
629].
Cleaved
GSDMD-N acquires the ability to translocate to the inner
leaﬂet of the plasma membrane (or the bacterial plasma
membrane), where it binds with high speciﬁcity to selected
phosphoinositides (or cardiolipin) [629, 630]. Membrane
targeting enables GSDMD-N oligomerization, generating a
pore that is responsible for rapid plasma membrane per-
meabilization [629–633]. Of note, the GSDMD pore has
recently been characterized at the ultrastructural level,
consisting of 16 symmetric protomers with an inner dia-
meter of ~10–14 nm [629].
Active CASP1 can also cleave GSDMD, suggesting that
microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) other than
cytosolic LPS as well as DAMPs usually stimulating
canonical inﬂammasome signaling can initiate pyroptosis
[626
634–636].
CASP1-driven
pyroptosis
limits
the
spreading of intracellular bacteria by (1) killing the host cell
[637], and (2) generating so-called “pore-induced intracel-
lular traps (PITs)”, which essentially are dead macrophages
that can be efﬁciently disposed of (together with the living
bacteria they trap) by efferocytosis [638]. Supporting the
critical role of CASP1-driven pyroptosis for innate immune
responses against invading bacteria, Nlrc4−/−mice (which
are unable to normally activate CASP1) succumb to low
amounts of otherwise innocuous environmental opportu-
nists (e.g., Chromobacterium violaceum) [639]. Instances of
CASP1-dependent but GSDMD-independent RCD have
also been reported, including the demise of macrophages
experiencing prolonged canonical inﬂammasome activation
[621, 636]. Of note, additional substrates of inﬂammatory
caspases have been hypothesized to participate in pyr-
optosis. Experiments with knockout mice suggest that the
endotoxic shock caused by systemic LPS administration
involves the CASP11-dependent cleavage not only of
GSDMD, but also of pannexin 1 (PANX1) channels,
leading to ATP release in the extracellular space and con-
sequent activation of purinergic receptor P2X 7 (P2RX7),
which further impinges on the collapse of ionic gradients
and inﬂammasome signaling [640]. Most likely, however,
these ﬁndings reﬂect the presence of an inactivating pas-
senger mutation in Casp11 speciﬁcally affecting transgenic
mice generated from 129/Sv-derived embryonic stem cells
[641]. Moreover, CASP1 has been proposed to drive pyr-
optosis by causing mitochondrial damage upon cleavage of
parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase (PRKN; best known
as PARKIN) [642]. However, contrasting observations have
been reported [528], and the actual pathophysiological
relevance of the latter mechanism remains to be established.
Accumulating evidence indicates that the (shared) N-
terminal domains of other members of the gasdermin
family, including GSDMA, GSDMB, GSDMC, GSDME/
DFNA5, and GSDMA3 (which is encoded by the mouse—
but not the human—genome), resemble those of GSDMD
as they display pore-forming and pyroptotic activity [39,
613, 626, 629]. Although the mechanisms underlying the
activation of GSDMA remain unknown, two recent studies
demonstrate the existence of an instance of pyroptotic RCD
dependent on GSDME-N/DFNA5-N that can be elicited by
multiple
challenges,
including
TNF,
various
DNA-
damaging chemotherapeutic agents, and/or infection with
the vesicular stomatitis virus [39, 613]. In this setting,
CASP3 is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of
GSDME/DFNA5, which precipitates in pyroptosis rather
than apoptosis [39, 613]. As GSDME/DFNA5 is often
silenced in malignant cells but expressed by their normal
counterparts, the activation of GSDME/DFNA5 by CASP3
contributes to the side effects of multiple chemotherapeutic
Signaling modules in the control of cell death
501

agents, at least in mice [613]. Interestingly, GSDME/
DFNA5 has also been involved in the acquisition of a
necrotic phenotype by cells undergoing CASP3-driven
apoptosis in vitro (in the absence of proﬁcient phagocy-
tosis) [39], further demonstrating the elevated degree of
interconnectivity that exists between distinct types of RCD.
The identiﬁcation of multiple gasdermin family members as
key factors in the late steps of pyroptosis, as well as the
characterization of CASP3 as an activator of GSDME/
DFNA5, expanded the relevance of this RCD form (and its
deﬁnition, see below) well beyond inﬂammatory settings
[613, 626, 629]. Of note, type I IFN and IFN gamma
(IFNG) also contribute to pyroptosis by promoting: (1) the
transactivation of CASP11, through an IFNAR1-dependent
or IFNGR1-dependent mechanism initiated by TLR4 or
IL18 signaling [620, 643, 644]; (2) TLR7, cyclic GMP-
AMP
synthase
(CGAS),
transmembrane
protein
173
(TMEM173; best known as STING), DExD/H-box helicase
58 (DDX58; best known as RIG-I), or mitochondrial anti-
viral signaling protein (MAVS) signaling upon bacterial or
viral infection [525, 645]; or (3) the expression of
guanylate-binding proteins and an IFN-inducible GTPase
commonly known as IRGB10 (ofﬁcial name Gm12250),
which increase cytosolic LPS levels by mediating the lysis
of vacuoles containing Gram-negative bacteria [646–648].
Further underscoring the complexity of the interaction
between inﬂammation and pyroptosis [649], CASP11 can
also be upregulated by a complement cascade dependent on
carboxypeptidase B1 (CPB1) acting downstream of TLR4
and IFNAR1 activation [650]. Moreover, cytosolic LPS
promotes the secretion of inﬂammatory cytokines by a
mechanism involving CASP11 activation, followed by
GSDMD cleavage, loss of K+ ions, and consequent acti-
vation of CASP1 by the NLR family pyrin domain con-
taining 3 (NLRP3) inﬂammasome, in vitro (but perhaps not
in vivo) [616, 620, 621, 626 651–655].
We propose to deﬁne pyroptosis as a form of RCD that
critically depends on the formation of plasma membrane
pores by members of the gasdermin protein family, often
(but not always) as a consequence of inﬂammatory caspase
activation. The NCCD discourages the use of alternative
terms including pyronecrosis (Box 1).
Parthanatos
Parthanatos is a form of RCD driven by the hyperactivation
of a speciﬁc component of the DNA damage response
(DDR) machinery, namely, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1
(PARP1). Notably, parthanatos appears to occur not only as
a
consequence
of
severe/prolonged
alkylating
DNA
damage, but also in response to oxidative stress, hypoxia,
hypoglycemia, or inﬂammatory cues [656–658]. In this
context, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) including NO
stand out as major triggers for PARP1 hyperactivation,
especially in neurons [659–661]. PARP1 hyperactivation
mediates cytotoxic effects as it causes (1) NAD+ and ATP
depletion, which ultimately results in a bioenergetic and
redox collapse, and (2) the accumulation of poly(ADP-
ribose) polymers and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins at
mitochondria, ultimately causing Δψm dissipation and
MOMP [656, 657 662–665].
One of the key processes of parthanatos is the binding of
poly(ADP-ribose) polymers to apoptosis inducing factor
mitochondria associated 1 (AIFM1; best known as AIF).
This promotes the release of AIF into the cytosol and its
translocation into the nucleus, where it mediates large-scale
DNA fragmentation and chromatin condensation [656, 658
664–667]. Further corroborating a key role for poly(ADP-
ribosyl)ation in parthanatos, the poly(ADP-ribose)-degrad-
ing protein ADP-ribosylhydrolase like 2 (ADPRHL2; also
known as ARH3) and the poly(ADP-ribose)-binding protein
ring ﬁnger protein 146 (RNF146; best known as IDUNA)
prevent AIF release and consequent RCD as they decrease
poly(ADP-ribose) levels and availability, respectively [662,
668]. Moreover, speciﬁc pharmacological inhibitors of
PARP1 efﬁciently delay parthanatos in multiple cell types,
in vitro and in vivo [1, 669]. Parthanatotic DNA fragmen-
tation occurs independently of apoptotic caspases and
endonuclease G (ENDOG) [670], a mitochondrial nuclease
that precipitates RCD by a mechanism involving its release
followed by translocation to the nucleus (at least in Sac-
charomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Dro-
sophila
melanogaster)
[671–674].
Indeed,
the
actual
contribution of ENDOG to RCD in mammals [675] has
been questioned by the generation of Endog−/−mice, whose
cells display normal sensitivity to multiple lethal triggers
[676, 677]. That said, it seems that the catalytic activity of
CPS-6 (the homolog of ENDOG in C. elegans) is boosted
upon interaction with WAH-1 (the worm homolog of AIF)
[678].
Macrophage
migration
inhibitory
factor (MIF)
has
emerged as the main nuclease precipitating parthanatos
in a recent screening for AIF-binding proteins [679].
Thus, cytosolic AIF reportedly promotes the translocation
of MIF into the nucleus, where MIF precipitates parthanatos
by catalyzing DNA cleavage. Accordingly, MIF depletion
or speciﬁc mutations in its nuclease domain confer protec-
tion against parthanatos in vitro and in vivo (in an
experimental model of focal cerebral ischemia) [679].
Another protein involved in parthanatos is hexokinase 1
(HK1), whose binding to poly(ADP-ribose) polymers
inhibits glycolysis to cause a bioenergetic collapse that
precipitates RCD [680, 681]. Recently, a non-canonical,
AIF-independent instance of parthanatos, presumably cen-
tered on the impairment of energetic metabolism, has been
502
L. Galluzzi et al.

proposed to contribute to the demise of retinal epithelial
cells and consequent retinal degeneration [682]. Interest-
ingly, some authors suggest a certain degree of inter-
connectivity between the parthanatotic and the necroptotic
machineries. Thus, upon induction of necroptosis by
TRAIL or β lapachone (an ortho naphthoquinone with
antineoplastic activity) [683], activated RIPK1 and RIPK3
appear to stimulate the enzymatic activity of PARP1 and
hence promote ATP depletion and/or AIF release [684,
685]. This interpretation may not hold true in all experi-
mental settings [686].
Parthanatos reportedly contributes to various pathologi-
cal conditions, including some cardiovascular and renal
disorders, diabetes, cerebral ischemia, and neurodegenera-
tion [534, 656 687–690]. Accordingly, PARP1 inhibition
by pharmacological or genetic interventions mediates robust
cytoprotective effects in multiple animal models of disease
[1, 669]. However, further experiments are required to
clarify the actual role of parthanatos in the etiology of these
(and possible other) pathologies and the true therapeutic
beneﬁts of parthanatos-inhibiting agents.
The NCCD proposes to deﬁne parthanatos as a form of
RCD initiated by PARP1 hyperactivation and precipitated
by the consequent bioenergetic catastrophe coupled to AIF-
dependent and MIF-dependent DNA degradation (Box 1).
Entotic cell death
Entosis is a form of cell cannibalism that occurs in healthy
and malignant mammalian tissues, involving the engulf-
ment of viable cells by non-phagocytic cells of the same
(homotypic) or a different (heterotypic) type [691, 692].
Often (but not always), internalization is followed by the
demise of internalized cells (which are commonly referred
to as “entotic cells”) [691–693].
Entosis is mainly triggered by the detachment of epi-
thelial cells from the extracellular matrix and consequent
loss of integrin signaling [263, 694], although alternative
mechanisms have been reported. These include: (1) the
deregulated expression of myosins during the formation of
cell-to-cell contacts [695]; and (2) differences in the
mechanical properties [696] or responses to metabolic stress
[697] of cancer cells competing for proliferation. Moreover,
a recent study suggests the existence of a speciﬁc form of
entosis occurring in cancer cells during mitosis (entotic
mitosis), which is driven by aberrant mitotic rounding (and
thus reduced adhesion) in conditions of cell division cycle
42 (CDC42) depletion or upon exposure to antimitotic
agents [698].
The current model proposes that the internalization of
entotic cells occurs through cell invasion rather than by
phagocytosis [691]. Accordingly, the uptake of entotic cells
is an integrin-independent process promoted by the forma-
tion of junctions between engulﬁng and entotic cells that
involve the adhesion proteins cadherin 1 (CDH1; also
known as E-cadherin) and catenin alpha 1 (CTNNA1) [694,
699]. Actomyosin chains accumulate at the cortex of
internalizing cells (at the pole opposite to the cell-to-cell
contact site), via a mechanism that depends on the localized
activity of ras homolog family member A (RHOA), Rho
associated
coiled-coil
containing
protein
kinase
1
(ROCK1), ROCK2, and diaphanous related formin 1
(DIAPH1), and results in a contraction that promotes
engulfment [695 699–701]. Actin drives entosis by pro-
moting pro-invasive (non-apoptotic) cortical plasma mem-
brane blebbing upon activation of a signaling pathway that
involves myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF) and
serum response factor (SRF) culminating with ezrin (EZR)
upregulation [702]. The regulation of microtubule dynamics
by AURKA has also been attributed a role in cell invasion
[703], but the relevance of AURKA signaling for entosis
awaits
experimental
conﬁrmation.
In
line
with
the
actomyosin-dependent
cell-in-cell
invasion
model,
the
administration
of
exogenous
CDH1
promotes
entosis
among CDH1-deﬁcient breast cancer cells, whereas forced
overexpression of RHOA or ROCK1 plus ROCK2 enables
the internalization of entotic cells by epithelial CDH1-
expressing cells [701]. In addition, hyperactivation of con-
tractile myosin induces entotic cell-in-cell invasion via a
mechanism involving the activation of RHOA, ROCK1,
and ROCK2 [695]. Intriguingly, competition in the tumor
system can occur via an entotic process whose outcome is
dictated by the activation of KRAS proto-oncogene,
GTPase (KRAS), and Rac family small GTPase 1 (RAC1)
signaling, which confers an advantage to engulﬁng cells by
favoring myosin downregulation [696]. In this context, it
has recently been demonstrated that, in conditions of glu-
cose withdrawal, cells displaying high 5′ AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) activity succumb to entosis,
underscoring a possible function of this process for nutrient
recovery by cells with comparatively lower AMPK activity
(which a priori are metabolically ﬁtter) [697].
Once engulfed, entotic cells are often eliminated by a
RCD subroutine that occurs independently of BCL2 pro-
teins and caspases [694, 704], but relies (at least in part) on
a speciﬁc autophagy-related process commonly known as
LC3-associated phagocytosis (LAP) [509, 705, 706]. In this
context, some (but not all) components of the macro-
autophagy apparatus, including microtubule associated
protein 1 light chain 3 beta (MAP1LC3B; best known as
LC3), autophagy related 5 (ATG5), ATG7, and phosphati-
dylinositol 3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 (PIK3C3; best
known as VPS34) are recruited to the cytosolic side of
entotic cell-containing vesicles and promote their fusion
with lysosomes (in the absence of bona ﬁde autophagosome
Signaling modules in the control of cell death
503

formation) [704]. Eventually, the lysosomal degradation of
internalized
entotic
cells
generates
nutrients
that
are
recovered by engulﬁng cells, via a mechanism that report-
edly involves phosphoinositide kinase, FYVE-type zinc
ﬁnger containing (PIKFYVE) [704, 707, 708].
Entotic cell death has been documented in several human
neoplasms, presumably operating as an oncosuppressor
mechanism [694, 695, 701, 709, 710]. Thus, abrogation of
entosis by a chemical ROCK inhibitor reportedly favors the
anchorage-independent growth of malignant cells [694].
However, entotic invasion has also been suggested to favor
aneuploidization
and
polyploidization
(which
promote
tumor
progression)
[711–713]
through
a
mechanism
involving cytokinesis failure of engulﬁng cells [714, 715].
A potential role for entosis in development and tissue
homeostasis has recently been proposed. Thus, in the course
of mammalian embryo implantation, trophoblast cells
reportedly eliminate uterine luminal epithelial cells upon
entosis [716]. Moreover, the spermatozoa of hibernating
Chinese soft-shelled turtle appear to be degraded within
Sertoli cell by entotic cell death [717]. Further experiments
are required to elucidate the actual role of entosis in the
pathophysiology of mammalian organisms. Importantly,
entosis does not always lead to the death of invading cells
within the lysosome. Thus, at least in some circumstances,
entotic cells remain viable and even proliferate inside host
cells or upon escape [716].
On the basis of this consideration, we propose to deﬁne
entotic cell death as a form of RCD that originates from
actomyosin-dependent cell-in-cell internalization and is
executed by lysosomes (Box 1). In the absence of precise
experimental
determination
of
terminal
cell
fate,
we
recommend to use the term entosis to refer to the inter-
nalization process only.
NETotic cell death
The term “NETotic cell death” refers to a rather con-
troversial type of RCD initially characterized in neutrophils
for being associated with the extrusion of a meshwork of
chromatin-containing and histone-containing ﬁbers bound
to granular and cytoplasmic proteins known as neutrophil
extracellular traps (NETs), a process commonly referred to
as NETosis [718, 719]. NETs, which are produced in
response to various microbial and sterile activators or upon
stimulation of speciﬁc receptors including (but not limited
to) TLRs, de facto constitute a stable extracellular platform
for trapping and degrading microbes [718 720–723]. Sev-
eral reports demonstrate that a considerable fraction of the
nucleic acids contained in NETs is of mitochondrial, rather
than nuclear, origin [724–728]. Besides having anti-
microbial
effects,
NETs
reportedly
contribute
to
the
etiology of some human pathologies, including diabetes and
cancer [729–731]. Of note, NET-like structures can be
released by cells other than neutrophils, including mast cells
[732], eosinophils [733], and basophils [734]. Importantly,
NET extrusion per se does not necessarily result in cellular
lysis [722, 724, 735].
Although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying
NET generation are not fully elucidated, both NETotic cell
death and NET extrusion in the absence of RCD appears to
rely on the activity of NADPH oxidases [724, 736, 737].
NETotic cell death has been suggested to result from a
signaling pathway that involves Raf-1 proto-oncogene,
serine/threonine kinase (RAF1), mitogen-activated protein
kinase kinases (MAP2Ks), and ERK2, culminating with
NADPH oxidase activation and consequent ROS generation
[736, 738, 739]. According to this model, intracellular ROS
would drive NETotic cell death (1) by triggering the release
of elastase, neutrophil expressed (ELANE), and myeloper-
oxidase (MPO) from neutrophil granules to the cytosol,
followed by their translocation to the nucleus, and (2) by
promoting the MPO-dependent proteolytic activity of
ELANE [740]. Once activated, the cytosolic pool of
ELANE would catalyze the proteolysis of F-actin, followed
by an impairment of cytoskeleton dynamics [741]. Along-
side, the nuclear pool of ELANE would promote the
degradation of histones (and possibly of the nuclear
envelope) and, in conjunction with MPO, chromatin
decondensation [737 740–742]. This would culminate with
the extrusion of chromatin ﬁbers intermixed with cyto-
plasmic and nuclear components, ultimately leading to
plasma membrane rupture and RCD [736]. That said, recent
ﬁndings indicate that ROS drive NET extrusion by a
mechanism that requires an intact cytoskeleton [743].
Moreover, ELANE is dispensable for NET formation in the
course of deep vein thrombosis (in mice) [744]. Peptidyl
arginine deiminase 4 (PADI4; also known as PAD4) has
also been proposed to participate in chromatin dispersion
[745], but its actual involvement remains a matter of debate
and appears to depend on the initiating stimulus [746, 747].
Finally, NETotic cell death has been proposed to depend (at
least in part) on components of the necroptotic apparatus,
based on the fact that the administration of chemical RIPK1
or MLKL inhibitors (i.e., Nec-1 or NSA, respectively) as
well as the Ripk3−/−genotype appeared to inhibit NET
extrusion and neutrophil lysis [748]. However, Ripk3−/−
neutrophils as well as neutrophils exposed to NSA were
fully proﬁcient in NET formation in another study [749].
These apparently contradicting ﬁndings call for additional
studies to address the precise contribution of necroptosis to
NET extrusion and NETotic cell death.
We propose to deﬁne NETotic cell death as a ROS-
dependent modality of RCD restricted to cells of hemato-
poietic derivation and associated with NET extrusion
504
L. Galluzzi et al.

(Box 1). That said, it is clear that NET can be formed and
extruded by fully viable neutrophils, eosinophils, and
basophils. Thus, the NCCD recommends to avoid the use of
the term NETosis when no experimental evidence in sup-
port of cell death (vs, NET extrusion only) is available.
Moreover, we discourage the use of alternative terms pro-
posed to describe this process, including ETosis.
Lysosome-dependent cell death
Lysosome-dependent cell death is a subroutine of RCD
initiated by perturbations of intracellular homeostasis and
demarcated by the permeabilization of lysosomal mem-
branes. Lysosome-dependent cell death is relevant for sev-
eral pathophysiological conditions, including inﬂammation,
tissue remodeling (e.g., mammary gland involution after
lactation), aging, neurodegeneration, cardiovascular dis-
orders, and intracellular pathogen response [750–752].
Moreover, a type of RCD that is highly reminiscent of
lysosome-dependent cell death, which has been dubbed
“germ cell death”, appears to play a critical role in the
physiological elimination of a fraction of emerging male
germ cells (at least in D. melanogaster) [753–756].
At a biochemical level, lysosome-dependent cell death
proceeds
upon
lysosomal
membrane
permeabilization
(LMP), resulting in the release of lysosomal contents,
including proteolytic enzymes of the cathepsin family, to
the cytoplasm [750]. The molecular mechanisms operating
upstream of LMP are not fully elucidated. In some cir-
cumstances, LMP appears to occur downstream of MOMP
as a result of apoptotic signaling, de facto constituting an
epiphenomenon of intrinsic apoptosis [757–759]. In other
experimental settings, however, lysosomes are permeabi-
lized before mitochondria [752, 760, 761], via a mechanism
that optionally involves BAX recruitment to the lysosomal
membrane followed by the activation of its pore-forming
activity [762–765]. More commonly, ROS play a prominent
causal role in LMP, not only as the H2O2-driven luminal
production of hydroxyl radicals by Fenton reactions desta-
bilizes the lysosomal membrane upon lipid peroxidation
[766, 767], but also as ROS reportedly favor the activation
of lysosomal Ca2+ channels [768]. Primary LMP has been
documented in vitro in cells responding to speciﬁc pro-
apoptotic stimuli, including the administration of lysoso-
motropic agents such as L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester,
ciproﬂoxacin, and hydroxychloroquine, TRAIL signaling,
and viral infection [760, 761, 765 769–772], as well in an
animal model of Parkinson's disease [764]. The p53 effector
DNA damage regulated autophagy modulator 1 (DRAM1)
[773] provides a major contribution to lysosome-dependent
cell death in HIV1-infected T cells by linking LMP to
MOMP
[770].
Additional
LMP
triggers
include
lysosomotropic agents (e.g., sphingosine), calpains, and
ROS
[751].
Moreover,
STAT3
reportedly
promotes
lysosome-dependent cell death during the involution of
mammary
gland
post-lactation
as
it
upregulates
the
expression of cathepsin B (CTSB) and CTSL, while
downregulating
their
endogenous
inhibitor
serine
(or
cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 3G (SER-
PINA3G; best known as SPI2A) [774, 775].
Cytosolic cathepsins usually precipitate RCD by cata-
lyzing the proteolytic activation or inactivation of several
substrates, including BID, BAX, anti-apoptotic BCL2
family members, and XIAP [776–778], hence engaging a
feed-forward ampliﬁcation circuitry of the lethal cascade
involving MOMP and caspases. Moreover, primary lyso-
somal dysfunction may negatively affect the mitochondrial
network as a consequence of impaired mitophagic respon-
ses (which normally target damaged or dysfunctional
mitochondria to lysosomes for degradation) [779, 780]. In
aged neutrophils, LMP also allows for the release of pro-
teinase 3 (PRTN3) from cytotoxic granules, where it pro-
motes RCD by catalyzing the proteolytic activation of
CASP3 [781]. Of note, lysosome-dependent cell death does
not necessarily involve MOMP and caspases, and does not
necessarily manifest with an apoptotic morphotype [782].
Moreover, CTSL appears to play a key role in the regulation
of autophagic adaptation vs. RCD in cells responding to the
LMP inducer resveratrol [783, 784]. These observations
suggest that LMP and lysosome-dependent cell death are
intimately interconnected with adaptative responses to
stress and other RCD subroutines.
Lysosome-dependent cell death can be retarded in vitro
and in vivo by inhibiting LMP or blocking cathepsin
activity via pharmacological or genetic means [750, 752].
Commonly employed cathepsin-targeting molecules include
endogenous protease inhibitors (cystatins and serpins), as
well as various pharmacological agents speciﬁc for cysteine
cathepsins (e.g., E64D and Ca-074-Me) or aspartyl cathe-
psins (e.g., pepstatin A) [785–787]. Moreover, under phy-
siological
conditions,
lysosomal
membranes
can
be
stabilized by altering lysosomal cholesterol content [788] or
by boosting endogenous activity of heat shock protein
family A (Hsp70) member 1A (HSPA1A; best known as
HSP70) [789, 790]. In line with this notion, the adminis-
tration of recombinant HSP70 or the HSP70-inducing agent
arimiclomol reverts lysosomal abnormalities in cellula as
well as in murine models of various lysosomal storage
disorders [789, 791]. Of relevance for cancer therapy,
cancer cells may present an increased sensitivity to lyso-
somotropic agents and are generally vulnerable to LMP,
which supports the clinical development of LCD-inducing
agents [752 792–795].
We propose to deﬁne lysosome-dependent cell death as a
form of RCD demarcated by primary LMP and precipitated
Signaling modules in the control of cell death
505

by cathepsins, with optional involvement of MOMP and
executioner caspases (Box 1).
Autophagy-dependent cell death
Autophagy-dependent cell death is a type of RCD that relies
on the autophagic machinery or components thereof [509
796–798]. Proﬁcient autophagic responses (which are under
tight transcriptional and post-translational regulation) [509
799–805] most often operate at the hub of adaptation to
stress, hence mediating cytoprotective (rather than cyto-
toxic) effects [806–811]. Thus, blocking autophagy with
pharmacological or genetic interventions generally accel-
erates (rather than delays) the demise of cells responding to
stress, and permanent or transient endogenous defects in
autophagy have been associated with embryonic lethality,
developmental defects, and multiple pathological disorders,
including (but not limited to) neurodegeneration, cancer,
and cardiovascular disorders [812–817]. However, in a
number of developmental and pathophysiological settings,
the molecular machinery for autophagy etiologically con-
tributes to cellular demise [796, 798 818–820]. Thus, the
term autophagy-dependent cell death does not refer to set-
tings in which the autophagic apparatus (or components
thereof) is activated alongside (rather than precipitates)
RCD [821] or it favors the engagement of other RCD
modalities, such as (1) ferroptosis, which is promoted by the
autophagic degradation of ferritin (ferritinophagy) [573,
574]; (2) FAS-driven extrinsic apoptosis, which is enhanced
by the autophagic degradation of protein tyrosine phos-
phatase, non-receptor type 13 (PTPN13; best known as
FAP1) [822], and (3) necroptosis, which is favored by a
necrosome-scaffolding function of the autophagy apparatus
[823–825], as well as by the autophagic degradation of c-
IAP1 and c-IAP2 [826].
The genetics and pathophysiological signiﬁcance of
autophagy-dependent cell death is now well established
[818–820]. Thus, whereas the genetic inactivation of cas-
pases in the midgut of developing D. melanogaster has no
consequences,
mutations
or
deletions
in
essential
autophagy-related (Atg) genes suppress midgut tissue
degradation [827–829]. Along similar lines, the complete
removal of larval salivary glands from D. melanogaster
larvae undergoing metamorphosis requires the apoptotic as
well as the autophagic machinery [830–832]. In both these
developmental scenarios, autophagy-dependent cell death is
preceded by growth arrest and is controlled by ecdysone, a
steroid hormone that is critically required in Drosophila to
undergo the larva-to-pupa transition and subsequent meta-
morphosis into an adult ﬂy [830, 833]. The autophagic
machinery also precipitates germ cell and ventral cord
neuron RCD during C. elegans development [834], and
perhaps contributes to embryonic development in mam-
mals, as suggested by the fact that Atg5 ablation in
apoptosis-deﬁcient (i.e., Bax−/−Bak−/−) mice further delays
interdigital web clearance, aggravates cerebral abnormal-
ities (at least in the C57BL/6 background), impairs negative
selection of autoreactive thymocytes, and increases the
resistance of some cell types to multiple stressors [835,
836].
Of
note,
the
molecular
machinery
of
autophagy-
dependent cell death and adaptative autophagy exhibit
some differences (at least in D. melanogaster) [837, 838].
For example, the autophagy-dependent degradation of the
midgut tissue proceeds independently of Atg7, Atg3, and
several other Atg genes that are required for starvation-
induced autophagy in the fat body, but relies on ubiquitin
activating enzyme 1 (Uba1) [837, 838]. Moreover, the
developmental degradation of Drosophila salivary glands
by autophagy requires the activity of: (1) Utx histone
demethylase (Utx), which contributes to the transcriptional
regulation of apoptosis and autophagy genes [839]; (2) miR-
14, which speciﬁcally activates autophagy-dependent cell
death by modulating multiple IP3-driven signaling pathways
upon targeting inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate kinase (IP3K2)
[840];
(3)
Ras-like
protein
A
(Rala),
which
ignites
autophagy-dependent cell death upon Notch activation
[841]; (4) Draper (Drpr), which is thought to promote the
engulfment of dying salivary gland cells [842]; and (5)
macroglobulin complement-related (Mcr), which promotes
autophagy-dependent cell death at least in part by triggering
Drpr signaling [843]. Of note, the apoptotic and autophagic
machineries are highly interconnected during develop-
mental cell death [796]. Thus, during Drosophila oogenesis
apoptotic proteins, including effector caspases, regulate
autophagy-dependent cell death [844], while the autophagic
apparatus acts upstream of DNA fragmentation by pro-
moting IAP degradation and caspase activation [845, 846].
In this context, the autophagic apparatus also drives the
developmental clearance of apoptotic cells [796].
Autophagy-dependent cell death also appears to con-
tribute to the pathogenesis of some human disorders. The
neuron-speciﬁc deletion of Atg7 confers robust neuropro-
tection in a mouse model of severe neonatal hypoxia-
ischemia by preventing neuronal RCD [847]. Along similar
lines, abolishing autophagy by pharmacological means or
by genetically depleting ATG5 or BECN1, prevents the
neurotoxicity
of
cocaine
in
cultured
neurons
[848].
Recently, a signalome-wide RNAi-based screen identiﬁed
glucosylceramidase beta (GBA) as a positive regulator of
autophagy-dependent cell death in human cells, presumably
linked to the ability of GBA to convert glucosylceramide to
ceramide (and glucose) [849]. However, additional inves-
tigation is required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms
whereby GBA drives autophagy-dependent cell death.

Finally, the long non-coding RNA autophagy-promoting
factor (APF) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of
myocardial infarction owing to its ability to indirectly pro-
mote the expression of ATG7 [850]. Autosis is a speciﬁc
variant of autophagy-dependent cell death that relies on the
plasma membrane Na+/K+-ATPase [851]. Corroborating
the physiological relevance of this process, the administra-
tion of Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitors such as cardiac glyco-
sides, confers neuroprotection in a rat model of neonatal
hypoxia-ischemia [851].
In summary, autophagy-dependent cell death can be
deﬁned as a form of RCD that depends on the autophagic
machinery (or components thereof) (Box 1). To avoid
confusion, this term should be consistently avoided (1) in
the absence of robust experimental evidence mechan-
istically linking RCD to (ideally more than one) compo-
nents of the autophagy apparatus, as well as (2) when
pharmacological or genetic manipulations of the molecular
machinery for autophagy impact on other RCD subroutines.
Immunogenic cell death
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a functionally peculiar
form of RCD that is sufﬁcient to activate an adaptive
immune response speciﬁc for endogenous (cellular) or
exogenous (viral) antigens expressed by dying cells [852,
853]. ICD can be initiated by a relatively restricted set of
stimuli, including viral infection, some FDA-approved
chemotherapeutics (e.g., anthracyclines, bortezomib), spe-
ciﬁc forms of radiation therapy, and hypericin-based pho-
todynamic therapy [854–861]. These agents are able to
stimulate the timely release of a series of DAMPs, whose
recognition by PRRs expressed by innate and adaptive
components of the immune system warns the organism of a
situation of danger, resulting in the elicitation of an immune
response generally associated with the establishment of
immunological memory [853 862–864]. So far, six DAMPs
have been mechanistically linked to the perception of RCD
as immunogenic: (1) calreticulin (CALR) [865, 866], (2)
ATP [867–869], (3) high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)
[870–872], (4) type I IFN [854, 873, 874], (5) cancer cell-
derived nucleic acids [864, 875], and (6) annexin A1
(ANXA1) [876].
In the course of ICD, CALR translocates from the ER,
where it is involved in the maintenance of Ca2+ homeostasis
[877], to the outer leaﬂet of the plasma membrane [865,
866].
CALR
translocation
occurs
as
an
early
ICD-
associated event, i.e., it occurs before PS exposure [878],
and is mediated (at least in the case of chemotherapy-driven
ICD) by three sequential signal transduction modules: (1) an
ER stress module, which involves the phosphorylation of
eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 subunit alpha
(EIF2S1; best known as eIF2α) by eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 3 (EIF2AK3; best known as
PERK) coupled to a block in protein synthesis; (2) an
apoptotic module, which involves the CASP8-dependent
cleavage
of
B-cell
receptor-associated
protein
31
(BCAP31), BAX, and BAK; and (3) an exocytosis module,
which involves the anterograde transport of CALR from the
ER to the plasma membrane via the Golgi apparatus
depending
on
vesicle-associated
membrane
protein
1
(VAMP1)
and
synaptosomal-associated
protein
25
(SNAP25) [878–880]. Defects at any level of this cascade
compromise the immunogenicity of RCD in vivo [878]. In
most instances of ICD, CALR translocates to the cell sur-
face together with protein disulﬁde isomerase family A
member 3 (PDIA3; best known as known as ERp57) [881].
Cell surface-exposed CALR functions (1) as an “eat me”
signal for phagocytosis by macrophages, neutrophils, and
DCs, which is required for subsequent antigen cross-
presentation to cytotoxic T cells; and (2) as a trigger for
TH17 cell priming [882]. In line with a key role of CALR in
the immunogenicity of RCD, the RNAi-mediated knock-
down of CALR as well as natural defects in the CALR
exposure pathway reportedly abolish the ability of dying
cancer cells succumbing to anthracyclines to establish
protective immunity in mice, whereas the exogenous pro-
vision of recombinant CALR confers immunogenic prop-
erties to otherwise non-immunogenic variants of RCD [865,
878, 881, 883, 884]. Of note, in some preclinical and
clinical instances, the activity of surface-exposed CALR is
antagonized by CD47, which operates as a “don’t eat me”
signal as it inhibits phagocytosis by DCs and macrophages
upon interaction with signal regulatory protein alpha
(SIRPA) [885, 886]. Accordingly, while CALR exposure
has positive prognostic value in patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML) [887], increased CD47 levels on the sur-
face of malignant cells correlate with dismal prognosis in
subjects with AML, esophageal carcinoma, and ovarian
cancer [888–891]. That said, CD47 appears to be required
for the efﬁcient phagocytic uptake of some murine cell lines
undergoing RCD [892, 893]. The reasons underlying this
apparent discrepancy remain to be elucidated.
Extracellular ATP not only operates as a “ﬁnd-me” signal
for macrophages and DC precursors upon binding to pur-
inergic receptor P2Y G-protein coupled (P2RY2), but also
mediates immunostimulatory effects by
activating
the
canonical inﬂammasome upon binding to P2RX7 [867, 868
894–897]. In the context of ICD, ATP is released through a
cascade of events occurring downstream of caspase activa-
tion and involving: (1) the autophagy-dependent accumula-
tion of ATP within autolysosomes (the organelles forming
by the fusion of autophagosomes or amphisomes with
lysosomes), (2) the relocalization of lysosomal-associated
membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) to the plasma membrane, (3)
Signaling modules in the control of cell death
507

ROCK1-dependent cellular blebbing, and (4) the opening of
PANX1 channels [229, 898, 899]. Accordingly, pre-mortem
autophagy is required for optimal ATP release in the course
of ICD, and hence for cell death induced by several (but not
all) ICD inducers to be perceived as immunogenic [867,
900, 901]. Moreover, overexpression of the ATP-degrading
ectoenzymes
ectonucleoside
triphosphate
dipho-
sphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD1; best known as CD39) and 5′
nucleotidase, ecto (NT5E; best known as CD73) efﬁciently
lowers extracellular ATP levels in favor of adenosine
accumulation, hence abolishing the immunogenicity of cell
death [902]. CD39 is expressed at high levels on the surface
of immune cells endowed with immunosuppressive proper-
ties, including CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ regulatory T (TREG)
cells, and this promotes tumor progression and spreading
[903, 904].
Type I IFN is produced by cancer cells succumbing to
ICD by a mechanism involving the detection of endogenous
dsRNA by TLR3 [873], or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
by cGAS [854, 905, 906]. Besides mediating broad
immunostimulatory effects on immune cells expressing
IFNAR1 [520, 907], type I IFN reportedly activates an
autocrine/paracrine signaling pathway in malignant cells,
culminating with the expression of a spectrum of IFN-sti-
mulated genes (ISGs) that includes the chemoattractant for
T cells C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) [873].
Accordingly, defects in dsRNA or dsDNA detection
imposed by genetic interventions, including the Tlr3−/−
genotype and the transgene-driven overexpression of the
three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1), as well as the
deletion of Ifnar1 from cancer or host cells, abolish the
immunogenicity of cell death triggered by various ICD
inducers [854, 873]. Of note, cancer cell-derived nucleic
acids do not mediate immunostimulatory functions only by
autocrine/paracrine circuitries [908]. Rather, cancer cells
succumbing to ICD release dsDNA and RNA molecules
that can be efﬁciently taken up by DCs, neutrophils, and
macrophages, resulting in the activation of a potent type I
IFN response driven by multiple TLRs and the cGAS-
STING pathway [864 909–911]. In line with this notion, the
enzymatic degradation of extracellular nucleic acids con-
siderably limits the immunogenicity of RCD [864, 875].
The
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
the
ICD-
associated release of HMGB1 and ANXA1 remain to be
fully elucidated. Once secreted, the non-histone chromatin-
binding protein HMGB1 mediates potent pro-inﬂammatory
effects by binding to TLR2, TLR4, and advanced glyco-
sylation end product-speciﬁc receptor (AGER; best known
as RAGE) [912], although TLR4 seems to be the sole
HMGB1 receptor relevant to perceive cell death as immu-
nogenic [870 913–915]. In particular, the ligation of
HGMB1 to TLR4 on DCs promotes antigen processing and
cross-presentation, yet does not induce DC maturation,
which is mainly stimulated by RAGE [870, 916]. That said,
it should be noted that biological activities of HMGB1 may
ﬂip from pro-inﬂammatory to anti-inﬂammatory depending
on multiple variables including its oxidation state [917–
923]. Extracellular ANXA1 reportedly acts as a DAMP and
supports the activation of adaptive immune responses by
engaging formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) on DCs [876].
In line with these observations, RCD is not perceived as
immunogenic when cancer cells are depleted of HMGB1 or
ANXA1, as well as when the host lacks TLR4 or FPR1
[870, 876].
Of note, the immunogenicity of RCD is robustly sup-
pressed by some caspases, notably CASP8 and CASP3, by
a variety of mechanisms [7, 924]. These include: (1) the
prominent ability of CASP8 to inhibit necroptosis (see
above), which is generally associated with the establishment
of robust inﬂammatory responses linked to NF-κB activa-
tion [496 925–928]; (2) the capacity of CASP3 to drive PS
exposure (see above), which generally supports the pha-
gocytic removal of dying and dead cells while delivering
anti-inﬂammatory signals to macrophages and DCs [218,
219]; (3) the ability of CASP3 to boost the secretion of
prostaglandin E2 from dying cells, which has robust
immunosuppressive effects [230, 929, 930]; and (4) the
CASP3-dependent inhibition of type I IFN signaling eli-
cited by mitochondrial DNA release upon MOMP [931,
932]. These observations suggest that speciﬁc caspase
inhibitors may be harnessed to potently boost the immu-
nogenicity of RCD.
The NCCD proposes to deﬁne ICD as a type of RCD that
is sufﬁcient to activate an adaptive immune response in
immunocompetent hosts (Box 1).
Non-lethal processes
The molecular machinery for RCD is involved in several
processes that have been mistakenly considered as bona ﬁde
instances of cell death over the past decades, including
cellular senescence, mitotic catastrophe, and multiple cases
of terminal differentiation.
Cellular senescence
The term “cellular senescence” refers to a pathophysiologi-
cal process by which the cells permanently lose their pro-
liferative capacity while remaining viable and metabolically
active [933–935]. Senescent cells exhibit speciﬁc morpho-
logical traits including ﬂattening, intracellular vacuoliza-
tion, cellular/nuclear enlargement, and altered chromatin
structure. At the biochemical level, cellular senescence is
often characterized by: (1) increased lysosomal galactosi-
dase beta 1 (GLB1) activity; (2) inhibition of multiple
508
L. Galluzzi et al.

cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and consequent depho-
sphorylation of various members of the retinoblastoma (RB)
protein family—including RB transcriptional corepressor 1
(RB1), RB transcriptional corepressor like 1 (RB1L; best
known as p107) and RB2L (best known as p130)—upon
upregulation of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A
(CDKN1A; best known as p21) [936] and/or the CDKN2A
products p16 (a powerful inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6)
[937, 938] and ARF (an activator of p53) [939, 940]; (3)
absence of proliferation markers, such as marker of pro-
liferation Ki-67 (MKI67); (4) activation of the DDR
machinery, generally as a consequence of telomere erosion;
and (5) presence of so-called “senescence-associated het-
erochromatic foci” (SAHF) [934, 941]. Senescent cells
secrete a variety of immunomodulatory and mitogenic
cytokines, chemokines, growth, and MMPs [941–943].
Although such a senescence-associated secretory phenotype
(SASP) appears to be involved in the immunological
clearance of senescent cells, it also affects the biology of
neighboring cells with an intact proliferative potential (and
this has major implications for senescence-inducing antic-
ancer agents) [941–945].
Waves of cellular senescence (followed by RCD) appear
to contribute to developmental embryogenesis (although in
a dispensable manner) [6, 946, 947] as well as to multiple
pathophysiological processes in the adult, including tissue
repair and regeneration, immunity, preservation of the stem
cell compartment, and oncosuppression [948–957]. In par-
ticular, this failsafe cellular senescence reportedly occurs in
response to (1) potentially carcinogenic events including
oncogene activation or oncosuppressor gene inactivation;
and (2) several sublethal cellular insults, including telomere
shortening,
DNA
damage,
mitochondrial
dysfunction,
defective/stalled DNA replication and epigenetic, lysoso-
mal, mechanical, metabolic, mitotic, oxidative, or proteo-
toxic challenges [933, 958, 959]. Mounting evidence,
however, indicates that senescent cells accumulate during
organismal aging due to their increased generation coupled
to inefﬁcient clearance [935, 941, 960, 961]. Accordingly,
chronic cellular senescence has been involved in natural
aging, lifespan shortening, tissue deterioration, and the
etiology of multiple age-related diseases, including athero-
sclerosis and osteoarthritis [935, 945, 948 962–969].
Moreover, senescent cells have been implicated in the
adverse effects of some chemotherapeutic regimens as well
as in the recurrence of speciﬁc neoplasms, at least in mice
[969]. Thus, senescence stands out as an attractive ther-
apeutic target for extending healthy lifespan [941, 970]. In
this context, one promising senolytic regimen relies on the
elevated vulnerability of senescent cells to inhibitors of pro-
survival BCL2 family members (in particular BCL-XL),
reﬂecting the elevated dependence of senescent cells on
these proteins for survival [971–973]. The role of acute
cellular senescence in multiple physiological processes,
however, casts doubts on the actual feasibility of this
approach [958, 968].
For these reasons, cellular senescence cannot be con-
sidered as a form of RCD (Box 1).
Mitotic catastrophe
Mitotic
catastrophe
is
a
regulated
oncosuppressive
mechanism that impedes the proliferation and/or survival of
cells that are unable to complete mitosis owing to extensive
DNA damage, problems with the mitotic machinery, and/or
failure of mitotic checkpoints [974, 975]. Mitotic cata-
strophe is morphologically deﬁned by unique nuclear
changes, including multinucleation and macronucleation
(two potential consequences of chromosomal missegrega-
tion) as well as micronucleation (perhaps resulting from the
persistence of lagging or acentric chromosomes) [974, 975].
Mitotic defects can derive from: (1) exogenous sources,
including a large panel of xenobiotics that alter DNA
replication, cell cycle checkpoints, chromosome segrega-
tion, and/or microtubular dynamics [976]; or (2) endogen-
ous sources, such as high levels of DNA replication stress
or mitotic stress caused by an aberrant ploidy or by
deregulated expression/activity of factors involved in DNA
replication or chromosome segregation [977, 978]. Of note,
the primary alterations that drive catastrophic mitoses can
originate in other phases of the cell cycles, including the S
phase (e.g., a premature entry in mitosis caused by failure of
the intra-S-phase checkpoint) [979, 980]. The precise
molecular mechanisms through which mitotic alterations
are sensed and trigger mitotic catastrophe cascade are
unclear, but presumably involve p53 (at least in many cell
types) [975]. A large body of experimental evidence sug-
gests that—at least in speciﬁc experimental settings—
mitotic catastrophe is precipitated by a signal transduction
cascade that relies on CASP2 activation, often (but not
always) triggering a variant of intrinsic apoptosis regulated
by the BCL2 protein family and demarcated by MOMP
[974 981–984]. In line with a key role for CASP2 in the
control of mitotic proﬁciency, the bone marrow of Casp2−/−
mice accumulates aneuploid cells with aging [985], and
Casp2−/−malignant cells exhibit increased levels of aneu-
ploidy as compared to their wild-type counterparts [982,
986, 987]. Moreover, Casp2−/−mice are more susceptible
than their wild-type littermates to oncogenesis in a multi-
tude of experimental settings [982 985–989]. In the absence
of p53, however, mitotic defects appear to drive a necrotic
variant of RCD independent of CASP2 signaling (at least in
some settings) [990–992].
Of note, the ultimate fate of cells undergoing mitotic
catastrophe seems to be dictated (at least in part) by the time
spent under mitotic arrest and their capability to slip out of
Signaling modules in the control of cell death
509

aberrant mitoses [993]. Thus, while cells arrested in aber-
rant mitosis for prolonged periods often undergo intrinsic
apoptosis, cells escaping the mitotic block and reaching
interphase can undergo a similar fate, enter cellular senes-
cence on activating speciﬁc cell cycle checkpoints mediated
by p53, and/or Hippo signaling, or simply be outcompeted
by their proliferating counterparts [978 994–1002]. Impor-
tantly, the abrogation of mitotic catastrophe is a key event
during neoplastic transformation and progression, mainly as
it allows for the generation and/or survival of polyploid and
aneuploid cells [975], whereas cancer (stem) cells report-
edly display increased sensitivity to mitotic defects [1003].
However, mitotic catastrophe appears to constitute a major
mechanism of action of anticancer chemotherapeutics,
mostly reﬂecting the increased resistance of neoplastic cells
to the induction of intrinsic apoptosis [1004–1009]. More-
over, recent data indicate that cancer cells escaping mitotic
catastrophe efﬁciently promote the secretion of type I IFN
following the detection of cytosolic dsDNA by cGAS,
potentially resulting in their elimination by immunological
mechanisms [905, 906]. The latter observation lends further
support to the notion that extracellular homeostasis in
mammalian organisms is preserved by a plethora of
mechanisms that are initiated at the cell-intrinsic level but
only operate once cellular homeostasis is compromised.
Since mitotic catastrophe does not always result in RCD
(but can also drive cellular senescence), it cannot be con-
sidered as a form of RCD per se. We propose the use of the
term mitotic death to indicate the speciﬁc variant of RCD
(most often intrinsic apoptosis) driven by mitotic cata-
strophe (Box 1).
Terminal differentiation and others
Multiple components of the signal transduction cascades
that regulate or precipitate RCD are involved in the terminal
differentiation of a variety of cell types [157, 180 1010–
1013], including (but presumably not limited to) neurons
[1014–1017], granulocytes [1018], megakaryocytes [1019],
erythroblasts [1020], osteoclasts [1021], sperm cells [1022],
skeletal myocytes [1023], lens cells [1024], and the kera-
tinized epithelium [1025]. The latter process, which is
commonly known as corniﬁcation (or keratinization) and
critically relies on CASP14 [1026, 1027] and multiple
isoforms of transglutaminase [1025, 1028, 1029], has long
been considered as a form of PCD [1025, 1030]. However,
the NCCD suggests to keep PCD and terminal differentia-
tion conceptually well discriminated from each other.
Indeed, dead cells are disposed of (and hence cease to have
a function) in the course of PCD. Conversely, when term-
inal differentiation involves cellular demise, as in the case
of corniﬁcation, dead cells become integral part of a tissue
(and hence mediate a speciﬁc physiological function).
Along similar lines, the NCCD discourages the use of the
term eryptosis, which has been coined to indicate the
demise of erythrocytes exposed to stress [1031]. Irrespec-
tively of the unquestionable relevance of this process for
human pathophysiology [1032–1034], it is indeed extre-
mely complex from a conceptual standpoint to deﬁne the
death of entities that—in physiological conditions—exist in
a debatable state between life and death (such as ery-
throcytes and viruses).
Concluding remarks
As amply discussed above, RCD plays a major role
in
development,
tissue
homeostasis,
inﬂammation,
immunity, and multiple pathophysiological conditions. On
the one hand, RCD constitutes a primary etiological
determinant in diseases associated with the irreversible loss
of post-mitotic tissues (e.g., myocardial infarction, neuro-
degeneration) [687, 752, 851, 869, 1035, 1036]. On the
other hand, defects in the signaling cascades that precipitate
RCD are associated with pathologies characterized by
uncontrolled cell expansion or accumulation (e.g., some
autoimmune disorders, cancer) [44, 263, 267, 537 1037–
1042]. Thus, RCD stands out as a major therapeutic target
for the management of multiple human disorders [1, 2, 649,
1043].
Over the past two decades tremendous efforts have been
dedicated to the development of cytoprotective strategies
aimed at interrupting RCD signaling after the initiation of
the process (a clinically relevant scenario for most ischemic
disorders) [1044, 1045], with relatively deceiving results
(despite multiple clinical trials, no drug based on this con-
cept has ever been approved for use in humans by reg-
ulatory agencies) [387]. Conversely, the BCL2 inhibitor
venetoclax is currently available for the treatment of CLL
patients who fail to obtain clinical beneﬁt from conventional
therapies [1046], and several other molecules with a similar
mechanism of action are currently in clinical development
[118] (source https://clinicaltrials.gov/). Why does the spe-
ciﬁc activation of RCD (that should not be confounded with
the alteration of normal cellular functions, although this also
can lead to RCD) appear as a much simpler clinical
objective than its inhibition?
Besides potential issues linked to the pharmacokinetics
and pharmacodynamics of the compounds tested so far, this
discrepancy likely reﬂects the high interconnectivity of the
signaling modules involved in RCD control in mammalian
organisms (which has begun to emerge only recently) [374
1047–1049]. Thus, while tilting the balance toward RCD
appears as a relatively easy task, blocking it—once a
hitherto poorly deﬁned point-of-no-return has been tres-
passed—may require the simultaneous inhibition of several
510

signal transduction modules, and hence may be hardly
achievable (Fig. 2). Moreover, the community has focused
for a long time on speciﬁc enzymes that were thought to
have a key causal role in RCD execution, but in a majority
of scenarios only appear to accelerate (rather than causally
determine) cellular demise (e.g., caspases) [17, 374].
Indeed, cell death in all its forms (including ACD) is ulti-
mately associated with a bioenergetic and redox crisis that
may constitute its actual cause [17, 374]. In this scenario,
true cytoprotection may be achieved only by interventions
that counteract such crisis or the causes (rather than the
epiphenomena) thereof. Interestingly, one of the most rapid
consequences
of
potentially
lethal
ATP
depletion
in
D. discoideum is an abrupt nucleolar disorganization
coupled to an irreversible block in ribosomal RNA and
DNA synthesis [1050]. A similar process has also been
observed in mammalian and plant cells succumbing to
multiple forms of RCD, perhaps suggesting that nucleolar
stress plays a key role in RCD execution across different
species [1051]. This possibility, however, remains to be
formally addressed.
Only recently, it has become clear that the modality
through which an individual cell succumbs to stress may
have a major impact on how RCD affects the local and
systemic microenvironment [36, 852, 1052]. This opened
an entirely new therapeutic perspective for the ﬁeld,
involving two major approaches: (1) the development of
approaches aimed at switching RCD modality, rather than
increasing or limiting the incidence of RCD (which may be
problematic in both directions) [856 1053–1056]; and (2)
the development of agents that intercept DAMPs or regulate
DAMP-dependent signaling pathways [20 1057–1059]. In
this context, ACD may also constitute a therapeutic target.
Indeed, although ACD occurs in a limited number of human
Fig. 2 Interconnectivity of cell death from a therapeutic perspective.
On the basis of the assumption that each regulated cell death (RCD)
subroutine would operate in a virtually isolated manner (a), con-
siderable efforts have been dedicated to the development of pharma-
cological agents that would interrupt RCD by operating on a single
signal transduction module (b). It is now clear that the molecular
mechanisms underlying distinct RCD modalities exhibit a considerable
degree of interconnectivity (c). This implies that robust cytoprotection
may not be achieved by targeting a single RCD subroutine, but only
upon the simultaneous inhibition of multiple signal transduction
modules (assuming that these modules are the actual cause of cell
death, and not simple epiphenomena of RCD signaling (d).

disorders (e.g., trauma, severe burns) and it cannot be
pharmacologically inhibited (by deﬁnition), the molecules
released by cells undergoing ACD may be blocked (at least
theoretically) with speciﬁc interventions, and this may have
a positive impact on long-term disease outcome [21 1060–
1062]. These observations exemplify the complexity of
targeting primary RCD or ACD (the death of cells suc-
cumbing to primary environmental perturbations), second-

Fig. 3 Causal vs. accessory aspects of cell death from a therapeutic
perspective. Cells exposed to very harsh environmental conditions
disassemble in a virtually instantaneous and uncontrollable manner, a
process that is referred to as accidental cell death (ACD). Conversely,
relatively mild perturbations of exogenous or endogenous origin pro-
mote adaptative stress responses aimed at the restoration of cellular
homeostasis. If such responses fail, cells generally activate one or
more of multiple, highly interconnected signal transduction modules
that precipitate regulated cell death (RCD). ACD cannot be retarded by
pharmacological or genetic interventions, and most (if not all) strate-
gies conceived so far to block RCD in mammalian organisms fail to
efﬁciently do so, at least in part owing to the elevated interconnectivity
of the process. Conversely, some agents that de facto promote RCD by
primarily targeting the underlying molecular machinery (rather than by
targeting normal cellular functions) are already available for use in the
clinic. The events that follow primary cell death—including a sec-
ondary wave of RCD in neighboring cells established (directly or
indirectly) by molecules released from the cells succumbing to the
primary insult, as well as danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP)
signaling—may also be targets for pharmacological interventions.
Finally, although altering quantitatively the percentage of cells suc-
cumbing to primary RCD remains challenging (especially when a
hitherto poorly deﬁned point-of-no-return of the process has been
trespassed), favoring the use of speciﬁc signaling modules over others
may have prominent effects on long-term disease outcome.

indirectly, by neighboring cells undergoing primary RCD or
ACD), and RCD-driven or ACD-driven DAMP signaling
for therapeutic purposes [1063] (Fig. 3).
In conclusion, targeting RCD holds great promise for
the treatment of several human disorders and considerable
efforts are being made to generate RCD modulators for
clinical use, but additional studies are required to devise
the most efﬁcient strategies in that sense. We are conﬁdent
that a correct, but ﬂexible, use of the RCD-related terms
deﬁned herein will strongly support the progress of the
ﬁeld toward such an ambitious goal. To avoid confusion,
it will be important to incorporate neologisms into the
scientiﬁc literature only for novel RCD subroutines
clearly relying on signal transduction modules and
effector mechanisms that show little or no overlap with
known types of RCD. Along these lines, we believe that
terms mostly referring to morphological features of cel-
lular demise and/or indicating considerable mechanistic
overlap with well-established RCD forms, such as auto-
schizis [1064, 1065], should be dismissed. The NCCD
surmises that this is the only way for new cell death-
related terms to acquire genuine utility and be broadly
adopted by the scientiﬁc community.
