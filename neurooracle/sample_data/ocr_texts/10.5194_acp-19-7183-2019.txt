Abstract. Satellite-derived aerosol products provide long-
term and large-scale observations for analysing aerosol dis-
tributions and variations, climate-scale aerosol simulations,
and aerosol–climate interactions. Therefore, a better under-
standing of the consistencies and differences among multiple
aerosol products is important. The objective of this study is
to compare 11 global monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD)
products, which are the European Space Agency Climate
Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) Advanced Along-Track Scan-
ning Radiometer (AATSR), Advanced Very High Resolu-
tion Radiometer (AVHRR), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRa-
diometer (MISR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrora-
diometer (MODIS), Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sen-
sor (SeaWiFS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VI-
IRS), and POLarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Re-
ﬂectance (POLDER) products. AErosol RObotic NEtwork
(AERONET) Version 3 Level 2.0 monthly measurements
at 308 sites around the world are selected for comparison.
Our results illustrate that the spatial distributions and tempo-
ral variations of most aerosol products are highly consistent
globally but exhibit certain differences on regional and site
scales. In general, the AATSR Dual View (ADV) and SeaW-
iFS products show the lowest spatial coverage with numerous
missing values, while the MODIS products can cover most
areas (average of 87 %) of the world. The best performance
is observed in September–October–November (SON) and the
worst is in June–July–August (JJA). All the products per-
form unsatisfactorily over northern Africa and Middle East,
southern and eastern Asia, and their coastal areas due to the
inﬂuence from surface brightness and human activities. In
general, the MODIS products show the best agreement with
the AERONET-based AOD values on different spatial scales
among all the products. Furthermore, all aerosol products can
capture the correct aerosol trends at most cases, especially in
areas where aerosols change signiﬁcantly. The MODIS prod-
ucts perform best in capturing the global temporal variations
in aerosols. These results provide a reference for users to se-
lect appropriate aerosol products for their particular studies.

Introduction
Atmospheric aerosols originating from both natural and an-
thropogenic sources have noticeable effects on the ecolog-
ical environment, climate change, urban air quality, and hu-
man health; these issues also attract increasing attention from
national governments and scientists (Cao et al., 2012; Guo
et al., 2016, 2017; Li et al., 2011, 2017; Pöschl, 2005). On
the one hand, the increase in anthropogenic aerosols over
the past century has signiﬁcantly affected the radiation bud-
get balance by scattering or absorbing solar radiation and
by changing cloud microphysical properties (Ramanathan et
al., 2001; Rosenfeld et al., 2008). On the other hand, ﬁne-
particulate matter greatly endangers human health by caus-
ing various respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Brauer
et al., 2012; Bartell et al., 2013; Crouse et al., 2012). How-

ever, due to the complex sources, compositions, and short
lifetimes of atmospheric aerosol particles, large uncertainties
exist in the estimation of aerosol–climate forcing and health
effects. To better understand the spatial and temporal vari-
ability of aerosol distributions from regional to global scales,
long-term data records with reasonable accuracy are needed
as benchmarks to evaluate aerosol effects based on climate
model simulations.
Since the 20th century, several aerosol ground-based ob-
servation networks, such as the worldwide AErosol RObotic
NEtwork (AERONET), Interagency Monitoring of Pro-
tected Visual Environments (IMPROVE), European Moni-
toring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), and Chinese Sun
Hazemeter Network (CSHNET), have been established. The
monitoring stations are sparsely distributed, and the observa-
tion periods at different sites vary across a large range due
to instrumental or weather conditions. Therefore, ground-
based observational data are limited to representing aerosol
characteristics in long-term and large-scale studies. For the
last few decades, satellite instruments have been launched
with increasing capability for remote sensing of aerosol
measurements, which have provided long-term data records
with wide spatial coverage. Meanwhile, an abundance of
mature aerosol retrieval algorithms has been developed ac-
cording to the characteristics of different satellite sensors
and atmospheric radiative transfer models, and these algo-
rithms have been successfully applied to generate global-
coverage aerosol products for over 10 years. These satel-
lite instruments include the Advanced Very High Resolu-
tion Radiometer (AVHRR), Total Ozone Mapping Spectrom-
eter (TOMS), Advanced Along-Track Scanning Radiometer
(AATSR), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR),
Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS),
Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), Visible
Infrared Imaging Radiometer (VIIRS), Polarization and Di-
rectionality of Earth’s Reﬂectance (POLDER), and Cloud-
Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIPSO).
Based on these long-term space-borne aerosol products,
numerous researchers have begun to explore the spatial and
temporal variations in aerosols on regional and global scales
as well as the potential climate effects of aerosols. For ex-
ample, Guo et al. (2011) analysed the temporal and spatial
distributions and trends in aerosol optical depth (AOD) over
eight typical regions in China by combining TOMS (1980–
2001) and Terra MODIS (2000–2008, Collection 5.1, C5.1)
aerosol products. Hsu et al. (2012) explored the global and
regional AOD trends over land and the oceans from 1997 to
2010 based on the SeaWiFS monthly aerosol products. Nabat
et al. (2013) used different satellite-derived monthly AOD
products (e.g. MODIS, MISR, and SeaWiFS) and model
datasets to create a 4-D climatology of the monthly tropo-
spheric AOD distribution and analyse the variations from
1979 to 2009 over Europe, the Mediterranean Sea, and north-
ern Africa. Zhao et al. (2013) analysed the AVHRR AOD
datasets over the global oceans and explored the effects of
subpixel cloud contamination on aerosol retrievals from 1981
to 2009. Floutsi et al. (2016) examined the spatio-temporal
variations in the AOD, ﬁne-particle fraction and Ångström
exponent over the Mediterranean basin from 2002 to 2014
with the Aqua MODIS C6 aerosol products. Klingmüller et
al. (2016) studied the aerosol trends over the Middle East
and explored the effects of rainfall, soil moisture, and surface
winds on aerosols with Terra MODIS C6 aerosol products
from 2000 to 2015. Mehta et al. (2016) presented the spatio-
temporal AOD variations and their spatial correlations glob-
ally and over six subregions using the Terra MODIS (C5.1)
and MISR monthly products from 2001 to 2014. Sayer et
al. (2018a) extracted and compared the AOD distributions
and variations using multi-satellite monthly aerosol products
(e.g. VIIRS, Aqua MODIS, and MISR) over the main oceans
(e.g. Tropical Paciﬁc and North and South Atlantic oceans).
Sogacheva et al. (2018) discussed the spatial and seasonal
variations in aerosols over China based on 2 decades of
multi-satellite observations using AATSR (1995–2012) and
Terra MODIS (2000–2017, C6.1) aerosol products.
In most of the above studies, satellite-derived aerosol
products are arbitrarily selected for research applications by
simply following the usage in previous studies or are based
on data availability. However, noticeable inconsistencies ex-
ist among the aerosol datasets generated from different satel-
lite sensors and aerosol retrieval algorithms. Few studies
have focused on exploring the similarities and differences
among aerosol datasets (Holzer-Popp et al., 2013; Nabat et
al., 2013; De Leeuw et al., 2015; Sayer et al., 2018a). The
selection of an accurate and appropriate aerosol product that
represents the long-term aerosol variations and trends for
their respective studies is of great importance for users, es-
pecially interdisciplinary scholars. Otherwise, problematic
aerosol characteristics will inevitably lead to questionable
conclusions.
The objective of this study is to comprehensively inves-
tigate the consistencies and differences in aerosol charac-
teristics among multiple global aerosol products from satel-
lites. For this purpose, a total of 11 of the most up-to-
date global aerosol products are selected in this paper, in-
cluding the European Space Agency’s Climate Change Ini-
tiative (ESA-CCI) products: AATSR Dual View (AATSR-
ADV), AATSR Swansea University (AATSR-SU), AATSR-
Oxford-RAL Retrieval of Aerosol and Cloud (AATSR-
ORAC) and AATSR-ENSEMBLE (AATSR-EN), which
cover the period from 2002 to 2012, AVHRR (2006–
2011), MISR (2000–2017), Terra MODIS (2000–2017),
Aqua MODIS (2002–2017), POLDER (2005–2013), Sea-
WiFS (1997–2010), and VIIRS (2012–2017) products. It
should be noted that, while these data up to 2017 are used
in the current study, many of them (i.e. MISR, MODIS, and
VIIRS) are ongoing as the instruments are still returning
data. The newest AERONET Version 3 monthly AOD mea-
surements at 308 globally distributed sites over land and the
oceans are collected for comparison.

Data description
2.1
Satellite-derived aerosol products
2.1.1
ESA-CCI aerosol products
Four typical ESA-CCI global-coverage aerosol products are
selected, including the AATSR-ADV, AATSR-SU, AATSR-
ORAC, and AATSR-EN. The AATSR-ADV product is gen-
erated using the dual-view (ADV, Veefkind et al., 1998a) al-
gorithm over land and the single-view (ASV, Veefkind and
de Leeuw, 1998b) algorithm over the ocean. The ADV al-
gorithm uses the dual-view feature and K-ratio approach to
eliminate the contribution from the surface to the apparent
reﬂectance. However, this approximation is not reliable over
bright surfaces or in the presence of coarse-mode aerosols.
The ASV algorithm assumes the water is a dark surface at
the near-infrared channel, and an ocean reﬂectance model is
applied to correct for the effects of chlorophyll and white-
caps (Kolmonen et al., 2013). The SU algorithm employs a
parameterized model of the surface angular anisotropy and
estimates the surface spectral reﬂectance using the dual-view
feature over land. Over the ocean, the SU algorithm esti-
mates the water-leaving radiance from the ocean at the red
and infrared channels at both nadir and along-track view an-
gles with a simple model (North et al., 1999; North, 2002;
Bevan et al., 2012). The ORAC algorithm is an optimal es-
timation retrieval scheme for multispectral images (Thomas
et al., 2009; Sayer et al., 2010), which uses a forward model
to ﬁt all the shortwave forward and nadir radiances through
the DIScrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (DISORT) model.
Meanwhile, the retrieved errors for aerosol parameters are es-
timated by propagating the measurement and forward model
uncertainties into the state space. The AATSR-EN product
is integrated based on different ESA-AATSR aerosol prod-
ucts using likelihood estimate approaches (Holzer-Popp et
al., 2013). In this study, the latest versions of the above four
ESA-CCI products (Table 1) are collected.
2.1.2
MISR aerosol product
The MISR aerosol product provides aerosol distributions
over both land and oceans. Over land, MISR is initially based
on the dense dark vegetation (DDV) algorithm (King et al.,

J. Wei et al.: Comparison of multiple satellite aerosol products
1992) and uses spatial contrasts to explore an empirical or-
thogonal function of the angular variations in apparent re-
ﬂectance. Then, the MISR product is used to estimate the
scene path radiance and determine the best-ﬁtting aerosol
models. Additionally, the spectral and angular shapes of the
reﬂectance function are assumed to be constant. The algo-
rithm is continuously revised and developed to generate the
AOD product with high spatial resolution (4.4 km) based
on the primary underlying physical assumptions. Over the
ocean, water bodies are essentially assumed to be black at
the visible and near-infrared wavelengths, and with an ad-
ditional assumption of an ocean aerosol model, the aerosol
retrieval is realized using the radiative transfer theory. MISR
multi-angle radiances are used to improve the deﬁnition of
aerosol models for aerosol retrieval. Recently, a new method
was introduced to improve dark-water aerosol retrievals by
considering the entire range of cost functions associated with
each aerosol mixture, and a new aerosol retrieval conﬁdence
index was established to screen high-AOD retrieval blunders
caused by cloud contamination or other factors (Witek et al.,
2018). In this study, the latest MISR Version 23 monthly
aerosol product was selected (Table 1).
2.1.3
MODIS aerosol products
The MODIS aerosol products are generated from three well-
known algorithms, including the dark-target (DT) algorithms
over both the oceans and dark land and the deep-blue (DB)
algorithm over bright and dark land. Over the oceans, the
DT algorithm considers the water to be a dark surface from
visible to longer wavelengths and neglects the water sur-
face reﬂectance. Over land, the DT algorithm assumes that
the surface reﬂectances in the visible channels exhibit sta-
ble statistical empirical relationships with the 2.1 µm appar-
ent reﬂectance over the dark-target surfaces (Kaufman et al.,
1997; Levy et al., 2007). The aerosol retrieval can be real-
ized based on the atmospheric radiative transfer model using
the look-up table (LUT) approach. In contrast, the DB algo-
rithm is designed to overcome the ﬂaw in the DT algorithms
and realizes aerosol retrieval over bright surfaces, where
the surface reﬂectance in the visible channels is estimated
based on the pre-calculated surface reﬂectance database us-
ing atmospherically corrected data from the long time se-
ries of measurements. Both algorithms have been continu-
ously improved with reﬁnements and improvements made
to the above aerosol retrieval algorithms, and the second-
generation operational DT (Levy et al., 2013) and the en-
hanced DB algorithms (Hsu et al., 2019) were used to gener-
ate the latest Collection C6.1 (C6.1) aerosol products (Sayer
et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019a, b). The C6.1 DT land al-
gorithm has an update to reduce biases in urban areas by
using a different surface reﬂectance model (Gupta et al.,
2016). The C6.1 DB land algorithm has some updates in sur-
face reﬂectance estimation using three different approaches
depending on land cover type and performing aerosol re-
trievals based on pre-calculated LUTs for a range of solar
and satellite-viewing geometry, aerosol and surface condi-
tions (Hsu et al., 2019). To increase the data coverage, a new
combined DT and DB (DTB) dataset was recently gener-
ated according to the independently derived MODIS monthly
normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products that
leverage the strengths of the DT and DB algorithms (Sayer et
al., 2014). In this study, the newly released Terra (MOD08)
and Aqua (MYD08) C6.1 DTB monthly aerosol products
(Sayer et al., 2019; Wei et al., 2019c) are selected (Table 1).
2.1.4
SeaWiFS, AVHRR, and VIIRS aerosol products
The SeaWiFS, AVHRR, and VIIRS aerosol products over
land are generated from the same DB algorithm as MODIS
but with some extensions and reﬁnements (Hsu et al., 2017,
2019). Over the ocean, these products are based on the Satel-
lite Ocean Aerosol Retrieval (SOAR) algorithm (Sayer et al.,
2012, 2017, 2018b) and include three phases: the selection
of suitable pixels to exclude the sun glint, clouds, or suspect
of excessively turbid water; pixel-level retrieval; and a post-
processing stage (data downscaling and quality assurance).
In the SOAR algorithm, the aerosol retrieval simultaneously
retrieved the AOD at 550 nm, ﬁne-mode fraction (FMF) and
the best ﬁt aerosol optical model based on the linear interpo-
lation of pre-calculated LUTs through the Vector LInearized
Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (VLIDORT) model. In
this study, the newly released SeaWiFS Version 4, AVHRR
Version 1, and VIIRS Version 1 monthly aerosol products are
selected (Table 1).
2.1.5
POLDER aerosol product
The POLDER/PARASOL aerosol product is generated us-
ing the Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Prop-
erties (GRASP) algorithm over land and ocean (Dubovik
et al., 2011, 2014). The GRASP algorithm is based on
the AERONET inversion algorithm and was developed
for enhanced characterization of aerosol properties from
spectral, multi-angular polarimetric remote-sensing obser-
vations. POLDER is of great interest as it builds on the
design of the forthcoming multi-viewing, multi-channel,
multi-polarization (3 MI) instrument (Marbach et al., 2015).
POLDER has provided a variety of aerosol characteristics,
including spectral AOD, single-scattering albedo (SSA), and
Ångström exponent; however, the data are only available
at latitudes equatorward of 60◦. It should be noted that
POLDER AOD is deﬁned at 565 nm. The effect of this re-
striction on the global analysis is expected to be small be-
cause high latitudes are frequently unavailable due to clouds,
snow, polar night, and continental land masses (Sayer et
al., 2018a). In this study, the latest POLDER Version 1.1
monthly aerosol products are selected (Table 1).

AERONET ground measurements
AERONET is a widely used ground-based observation net-
work with long-term data records at numerous monitoring
sites around the world. The AOD observations are available
over a wide spectral range from visible to near-infrared chan-
nels (0.34–1.02 µm), and they are measured with a high tem-
poral resolution of 15 min and a low bias of 0.01–0.02. The
data quality has been divided into three levels (L): L1.0 (un-
screened), L1.5 (cloud screened), and L2.0 (cloud screened
and quality assured) (Holben et al., 1998; Smirnov et al.,
2000, 2009). Meanwhile, the instantaneous AOD observa-
tions are further processed and released at daily and monthly
levels. In the current study, the newly released AERONET
Version 3 L2.0 monthly AOD observations (Giles et al.,
2019) are collected and compared with the multi-source
satellite-derived monthly aerosol products over land and
ocean. The globe is divided into 10 custom regions of land,
four coastal areas, and four open-ocean areas, as illustrated
in Fig. 1. Table 1 summarizes all the data sources used in this
study.

Methodology
3.1
Spatial comparison
For multi-satellite aerosol products, the monthly retrievals at
550 nm are collected from the listed scientiﬁc dataset (SDS,
Table 1) and used for the current analysis in this study. Due
to different spatial resolutions, all datasets are uniformly in-
tegrated into 1◦× 1◦grid cells using the bidirectional lin-
ear interpolation method. For comparison, monthly retrievals
for diverse aerosol products are deﬁned by the pixel cen-
tred on the AERONET site, and the corresponding monthly
AERONET AOD is regarded as the true value. Notably, the
AERONET sites do not provide the AOD observations at
550 nm; thus, the AOD values at 550 nm are interpolated us-
ing the Ångström exponent (e) algorithm from 440–675 nm
using the AERONET AOD measured at those wavelengths
(Eq. 1). Moreover, the spatial coverage for satellite-derived
aerosol products is calculated through the area-weighting ap-
proach where each grid cell is weighted by cosine of central
latitude. The annual mean AOD value is averaged from at
least eight available monthly values over 1 year.
AOD550 = AODλ(550/λ)−e
(1)
3.2
Temporal trend
The satellite-derived and AERONET-measured monthly
mean AOD values are selected for temporal variation and
trend analysis; however, to remove the noticeable inﬂuence
of the annual cycle, the data are ﬁrst deseasonalized by cal-
culating the time series of the AOD anomalies. An anomaly
is deﬁned as the difference between the monthly mean AOD
in 1 year and the monthly AOD average over all years. Then,
the ordinary least squares ﬁtting method (Lai and Wei, 1978;
Zdaniuk, 2014) is selected to minimize the sum of residual
squares of all observed values and obtain the coefﬁcient of
the linear regression slope that represents the temporal trend
(AOD yr−1, Eq. 2).
Yt = aXt + b + Nt,t = 1,...,T,
(2)
where Yt is the AOD time series anomaly, a is the trend
(AOD yr−1), b is the offset term, and Xt is the annual time se-
ries (Xt = t/12, where t is the individual months in the time
series). The term Nt represents the residuals in the time se-
ries. However, large-scale systems and seasonal patterns can
persist for weeks to months and affect the temporal aerosol
trend, and the 1-month lag autocorrelation in the time series
is considered in the AOD trend analyses. The uncertainty (σ,
represents 1 standard deviation) in the estimated trend is ap-
proximated by the following approach (Weatherhead et al.,
1998):
σ ≈σN
N3/2
s
R′
1 −R′ ,
(3)
where σN is the standard deviation of the residuals Nt on
the ﬁt and R′ is the autocorrelation coefﬁcient. The math-
ematical value and uncertainty range of the AOD trend are
represented by a ±σ. The statistical signiﬁcance of the trend
is assessed using the two-side test approach, where p values
less than 0.05 represent trends that are signiﬁcant at the 95 %
conﬁdence levels. The p value represents the probability of
obtaining results at least as extreme as those found, under the
null hypothesis of there being no relation between AOD and
time.
Moreover, the false-discovery rate (FDR) is also consid-
ered to decrease the fraction of false positives for multiple-
hypothesis testing (Wilks, 2006). The discovery refers to the
rejection of a hypothesis, and a false discovery is an incor-
rect rejection of a hypothesis, and the FDR is the likelihood
that such a rejection occurs. The well-known Benjamini–
Hochberg procedure is selected to calculate the FDR in this
paper (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). This procedure be-
gins by ordering the m hypothesis by ascending p values,
where Pi is the p value at the ith position with the associated
hypothesis Hi. Let k be the largest i for which
Pi ≤i
mα.
(4)
Reject hypotheses i = 1,2,3... k. In this study, the FDR is
controlled for all tests at the expected level (α = 0.05), where
no more than 5 % of the signiﬁcant results are in fact false
positives.
3.3
Statistical metrics
To quantitatively evaluate the quality and uncertainty of
the retrievals, four main metrics are calculated between the

satellite-derived AOD (AODS) and AERONET-based AOD
(AODA). The Pearson product-moment correlation coefﬁ-
cient (R) is selected to measure the linear correlation be-
tween the above two variables. The mean absolute error
(MAE, Eq. 5) represents the overall estimation accuracy. The
root mean square error (RMSE, Eq. 6) and relative mean
bias (RMB, Eq. 7) represent the overall estimation uncer-
tainty, where RMB > 1.0 or RMB < 1.0 indicate the over- or
underestimation uncertainty. Although several satellite prod-
ucts have provided an expected level of uncertainty on AOD,
this refers to level 2 products and is not applicable to the
level 3 products in studies like this one. Level 3 uncertainty
estimates have not yet been developed for these AOD prod-
ucts. Moreover, to quantify the performance of each satel-
lite aerosol product in capturing aerosol trends, an additional
correct-trend percentage (CTP) is deﬁned as the percent-
age of sites where the satellite-derived and AERONET-based
trends are consistent within each uncertainty (1 standard de-
viation) or not, and they are compared by combining trend
uncertainties in quadrature by assuming that the uncertainty
estimates from different data sets are independent.

Performance of monthly aerosol products
4.1
Global-scale comparison
Figure 2 compares the monthly AODS values derived from
10 satellite aerosol products and AODA values at a total
of 268 available AERONET sites for the common period
2006–2010 throughout the world (VIIRS data are not dis-
cussed in Sect. 4 because they start in 2012). Table S1 in
the Supplement also summarizes the comparison of AODS
and AODA values from the 10 products over land and ocean
for the common period 2006–2010. Due to the differences in
aerosol retrieval algorithms and satellite observation condi-
tions, the spatial coverage is not uniform among these prod-
ucts, which results in noticeable differences in the num-
ber of data collections (sample size, N). The four ESA-
CCI monthly aerosol products show similar overall perfor-
mance with comparable evaluation metrics. The AOD re-
trievals (N = 7938–9467) agree well with AODA (R = 0.7–
0.8), with MAE values ranging from 0.07 to 0.09 and RMSE
values ranging from 0.13 to 0.15. Among them, the AATSR-
SU (AATSR-ADV) product shows the best (worst) perfor-
mance with the smallest (largest) differences on the global
scale. These results are consistent with those reported by a
previous study (de Leeuw et al., 2015). The AVHRR AODS
values (N = 8382) are well correlated with the AERONET
AODA values with MAE and RMSE of 0.077 and 0.145, re-
spectively. The Terra MISR product provides a sample size
of 8418, which is smaller than the Terra MODIS sample size
(N = 9196) and is possibly due to the narrower swath width.
MISR AODS values are highly correlated with the ground-

measured AODA values (R = 0.781), with a MAE of 0.074
and RMSE of 0.127. The Terra MODIS product is generally
better than the MISR product with a high correlation and low
RMSE. Due to the afternoon imaging time, the Aqua MODIS
product provides approximately 2 % fewer data collections
than Terra MODIS, but it exhibits superior performance in
terms of most of the evaluation metrics (i.e. R = 0.868, MAE
= 0.067, and RMSE = 0.107) among all 10 products. In con-
trast, the POLDER product exhibits an inferior performance,
with the largest MAE and RMSE errors among all the prod-
ucts, signiﬁcantly overestimating the monthly aerosol loads
(RMB = 1.287). This result could be partially attributed to
the relatively low accuracy of cloud detection results in the
current POLDER product, and an upcoming version of the
POLDER product with an advanced algorithm will improve
the AOD retrievals. The SeaWiFS product has the smallest
sample size, which provides 33 %–44 % fewer data collec-
tions than other products but exhibits overall good perfor-
mance. The reason is partly the temporary failures during the
studied time period that cause missing monthly data. In gen-
eral, both MODIS and POLDER products overestimate the
monthly average aerosol loads and other products underesti-
mate them, especially the MISR and AATSR-ADV products.
4.2
Continent-scale comparison
Aerosol characteristics over land are more diverse than those
over the ocean due to complex surface structures, vary-
ing aerosol compositions, and inﬂuences of natural and hu-
man factors. Therefore, this section focuses on the compar-
ison between monthly AODS and AODA on the continental
scale over land. For this purpose, 10 main customized conti-
nents (Fig. 1) are considered, including eastern North Amer-
ica (ENA), western North America (WNA), South America
(SAM), Europe (EUR), Africa (AFR), the Middle East (ME),
southern Asia (SAA), eastern Asia (EAA), southeastern Asia
(SEA), and Oceania (OCE). Figure 3 shows the continent-
scale performance for 10 AODS products for the common
period 2006–2010 over land, and the statistical results are
given in Table S2.
The results show some common features of the 10 AODS
products. In general, a large number of data samples are
collected over Europe and North America due to intensive
ground-based observation sites. In contrast, the sample sizes
are small over the Middle East, eastern Asia, southeastern
Asia, and Oceania due to the sparse observation sites and al-
gorithm limitations over the high-brightness underlying sur-
faces. Most aerosol products exhibit good performances with
low MAE and RMSE values less than 0.06 and 0.08 over Eu-
rope, North America, and Oceania. The main reason for this
result is that the relatively high vegetation coverage and dark
underlying surface allow for more accurate aerosol retrievals
by different aerosol algorithms (Wei et al., 2018a, b). How-
ever, poor performances with large MAE and RMSE values
occur over southern Asia, eastern Asia, Africa, and the Mid-
dle East. This result is mainly due to the complex and bright
underlying surfaces (e.g. desert, bare land, and urban areas),
as well as intense human activities, which increase the difﬁ-
culty of aerosol estimation (Wei and Sun, 2017; Wei et al.,
2017, 2018a, b, 2019d). Overall, most aerosol products over-
estimate the monthly AOD over North America and Oceania,
while general underestimations occur over South America,
Africa, and eastern Asia.

2010 in terms of (a) sample size (N), (b) MAE, (c) RMSE, and (d) RMB.
The performance of each AODS product is also dis-
tinct in each speciﬁc region. In general, the AATSR-ORAC,
POLDER, and MODIS products provide a larger number
of data samples than the other products. In particular, the
AATSR-ADV product provides fewer data samples over the
Middle East than over the other regions because the ADV al-
gorithm cannot be applied in bright desert areas. In terms
of the retrieved AODs, all the products perform almost
equally with similar evaluation metrics (e.g. MAE, RMSE)
over North America, Europe, and Oceania, except for the
POLDER product. In the other regions, large differences are
found among the 10 AODS products. In general, the MODIS
and MISR products exhibit better performances (with low
MAE and RMSE values) than the other products over South
America, Africa, the Middle East, eastern Asia, and south-
eastern Asia. The POLDER and MODIS products overesti-
mate the monthly aerosol loads over most continents, espe-
cially America and Europe. In contrast, the AATSR-ORAC,
AATSR-ADV, and MISR products usually underestimate the
monthly aerosol loads except for a few speciﬁc regions (i.e.
western North America and Oceania).
4.3
Site-scale comparison
The global- and continent-scale comparisons show the over-
all performance of ten satellite aerosol products. However,
the selected AERONET sites are unevenly distributed around
the world, with most sites concentrated in densely populated
land regions. Therefore, the site-scale comparison at a total
of 308 available sites is performed in this section. For this
purpose, four main evaluation metrics are calculated, includ-
ing the sample size (N), MAE, RMSE, and RMB. For statis-
tical signiﬁcance, only those sites with at least half a year
of observations (six matchups) are used for analysis. Fig-
ures 4–6 shows the site-scale performance map for AODS
against AODA, and Table 2 summarizes the percentages of
the sites within a certain range of evaluation metrics for all
AODS products in the common period 2006–2010.
Figure 4 illustrates the number of data collections for the
different AODS products at each site over both land and
ocean, where the black dots represent an insufﬁcient number
of matchups. Most products can provide enough data sam-
ples at more than 95 % of the sites around the world, espe-
cially the AATSR and MODIS products. However, the Sea-
WiFS product has approximately 21 % of the sites with no
or few matchup samples, which are mainly distributed over
North America, Europe, Asia, and southeastern Asia. The
AATSR-ADV product has approximately 8 % of the sites
lacking matched samples, which are spread over northern
Africa, southern Europe, the Middle East, and central Asia.
The main reason for this result is that the ADV algorithm
cannot be adequately applied over bright surfaces. Moreover,
the sites with no matched data samples from the POLDER
product are concentrated in high-latitude areas because the

POLDER algorithm is designed for aerosol retrieval between
60◦latitude.
Figures 5 and 6 plot the MAE and RMSE errors between
AODS and AODA at each site across the world. The MAE
and RMSE maps have very similar spatial patterns for each
aerosol product. Good performances are exhibited at most
North American and European sites with low MAE and
RMSE values less than 0.04 and 0.06. The sites with poor
performances are mainly aggregated in northern Africa, east-
ern Asia, and southern Asia, where the MAE and RMSE
values are generally greater than 0.16 and 0.20. This result
indicates that the overall performance of the aerosol prod-
ucts on the site scale is spatially heterogeneous and highly
dependent on the type of underlying surfaces and the im-
pact of human activities. Among the 10 aerosol products, the
Aqua MODIS product shows the best performance, having
a large percentage of sites (71 % and 60 %) with MAE and
RMSE values less than 0.08 throughout the world. By con-
trast, the POLDER product performs the worst, having more
than 31 % and 47 % of the sites with MAE and RMSE values
greater than 0.12.
Figure 7 shows the spatial distribution of the site-scale
AODS bias. For the 10 products, only 14 %–32 % of the
sites show good estimations, with RMB values ranging from
0.9 to 1.1. The POLDER and MOD08 products overestimate
at most sites, especially in North America and Europe, and
more than 54 % and 61 % of the sites show signiﬁcant overes-
timations (RMB > 1.2) according to the statistics in Table 2.
The other products mostly underestimate at sites over Eu-
rope, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia and overestimate at
sites over South America and Australia.

AOD spatial coverage and distribution
5.1
Global and regional distribution
In this section, we compare the AOD distribution among the
11 aerosol products (VIIRS data are included). Figure 8 illus-
trates the global spatial coverage and mean value of all AODS
products for their respective available periods from 1997 to
2017. There are several missing monthly data records for the
AATSR-ADV, AATSR-ORAC, AVHRR, and SeaWiFS prod-
ucts, which are given in Table S3.
All the aerosol products present a similar and obvious an-
nual cycle, with high spatial coverage in August and Septem-
ber and low coverage in December and January (Fig. 8a). In
general, the MODIS and VIIRS products provide the largest
spatial coverage, covering more than 86 % of the area of
the world. In contrast, the AATSR-ADV and SeaWiFS prod-
ucts have the lowest spatial coverage, with global averages
of 68 % and 69 %. The AATSR-EN, AATSR-SU, AVHRR,
and POLDER products have similar spatial coverages, with
an average of 72 %–76 %. The spatial coverage decreased
signiﬁcantly as the SeaWiFS and POLDER satellite services
approached their end stages. Figure 8b shows similar annual
variations among the 11 AODS products, with the peak from
July to September and the trough from November to Jan-
uary. The POLDER product exhibits the highest AOD values
among all products, while the SeaWiFS and MISR products
show the lowest values. The other products have relatively
similar AODS values, ranging from 0.13 to 0.18. Finally, we
found that the VIIRS product is almost identical to the Aqua
MODIS AODS, as shown in Fig. 8, due to the similar satellite
parameters and algorithms. Considering the relatively short
data records of VIIRS, we will not include these data in the
subsequent comparison and analysis.
Considering the remarkable seasonal variations, we plot
the seasonal spatial distributions of the 10 aerosol prod-
ucts for their common period 2006–2010 in Fig. 9. Mean-
while, we also reproduce the satellite-derived global AODS

for most aerosol products, especially for AATSR-ADV prod-
uct (∼73 %). The missing data are mainly for the Northern
Hemisphere in winter and in high-latitude areas with bright
surfaces covered by snow and ice, where most of the retrieval
algorithms cannot be implemented. By contrast, the spatial

coverage is increased in the other seasons and the highest
values are always observed in SON for most aerosol prod-
ucts. Among these 10 products, two MODIS aerosol products
can provide almost the largest spatial coverage with average
cover rates of 88 %, 94 %, 93 %, and 95 % for DJF, MAM,
JJA, and SON. By contrast, AATSR-ADV and POLDER
products are generally narrower than other products in spatial
coverage for each season.
For the spatial distribution of AODS, noticeable spatial
heterogeneity occurs over land with low values in North
America, Europe, and Australia and high values in north-
ern Africa, the Middle East, southern Asia, and eastern Asia.

peaks in spring (eastern Asia) or summer (northern Africa
and the Middle East) in accordance with the prevailing time
of dust. Anthropogenic polluted regions exhibit peaks in
high-emission seasons, such as dry seasons in the savanna
and Amazon due to biomass burning, summer in eastern Asia
due to the formation of large numbers of ﬁne particles and
water uptake by hygroscopic particles. There is also strong
diversity in the seasonal or annual mean AODS over north-
ern Africa and eastern Asia among most datasets (Fig. S1 in
the Supplement). This diversity is mainly due to the different
aerosol algorithms applied over bright surfaces (i.e. desert
and urban areas). Both high surface reﬂectance and complex
underlying surfaces increase the difﬁculty of aerosol retrieval
(Wei and Sun, 2017; Wei et al., 2017, 2018a, b, 2019d). For

the spatial distributions over the ocean, the seasonal and an-
nual mean AODS values are generally lower than 0.1 in most
areas, especially open seas (Fig. S2). In coastal areas near
central and northern Africa, southern Middle East, southern
India, and eastern China, the AODS values are strongly in-
ﬂuenced by the source regions. The seasonal mean AODS
values are generally greater than 0.4, and the seasonal vari-
ation in AODS in the downstream plume areas is consistent
with that in the upstream land area.
Figures 10 and 11 plot the seasonal spatial coverage and
mean AODS values over 10 land and 8 oceanic customized
regions (see Fig. 1) for each product during the common pe-
riod 2006–2010. The results illustrate that the SeaWiFS and

other products over most land regions, especially for South
America, southern Asia, and southeastern Asia. The AATSR-
ADV product has the lowest spatial coverage in Africa and
the Middle East due to the limitations of aerosol retrieval al-
gorithms. Meanwhile, the POLDER product yields the min-
imum spatial coverage in the high latitudes due to the lack
of retrievals above 60◦(i.e. eastern and western North Amer-
ica, and Europe). In general, the range in spatial coverage
of all AODS products is greater in all seasons (especially in
DJF) over North America, Europe, and the European coast.
By contrast, most aerosol products are more consistent and
have higher spatial coverage in the remaining areas, espe-
cially for open seas, where the average spatial coverage can
even reach up to 100 %.
For the seasonal mean AODS, the POLDER product has
the highest values, and the SeaWiFS product has the low-
est values over most customized regions. The AATSR-ADV
product exhibits the lowest seasonal AOD values in the Mid-

remaining aerosol products, the range of the seasonal mean
AODS is greater than 0.2 over Africa, southern Asia, east-
ern Asia, southeastern Asia, and the coastal areas of southern
Asia, and eastern Asia. The main reason for this wide range
could be the complex aerosol types from multiple sources
(e.g. natural dust mixed with anthropogenic ﬁne particles)
that cannot be resolved by current aerosol retrieval algo-
rithms. For the remaining land and ocean regions, the range
in seasonal AOD values is generally within 0.1 among these
aerosol products. The main reason for this result may be the
differences in satellite scanning widths and pixel selection
during the reprocessing of the monthly aerosol products.
5.2
Comparison between seasonal and annual AODS
and AODA
Figure 12 compares the satellite-derived seasonal mean
AODS value for each satellite over AERONET sites with the
ground-based AODA values over land and ocean, and the sta-
tistical results are given in Table S4. The best performance
with the smallest MAE (Fig. 12b) and RMSE (Fig. 12c) val-
ues are always found in SON. In contrast, the worst perfor-
mances with the largest estimation uncertainties (i.e. MAE
and RMSE) among the 10 aerosol products are found in JJA.
In general, the MODIS and POLDER products overestimate
the aerosol loads in the four seasons, and the remaining seven
aerosol products underestimate them (Fig. 12d). The perfor-
mance of the AATSR-ORAC and AVHRR products is poor
with large estimation uncertainties in JJA but much improved
in the other three seasons. The AATSR-SU product shows the
smallest estimation bias (RMB = 0.95–1.05) in all four sea-
sons among all products. In general, the Aqua MODIS prod-
uct performs best with almost all the best evaluation metrics
(e.g. N, MAE, and RMSE) compared to the other products
on the seasonal level.
In Fig. 13 we also compare the annual mean AODS val-
ues from each satellite product with the AERONET AODA
values at available sites from 2006 to 2010. The results in-
dicate that similar conclusions can be drawn for both sea-
sonal and annual scales. The AATSR-SU product performs
superior among the four ESA-CCI AATSR products. The
AVHRR and MISR products show similar performances with
close MAE (0.049 and 0.050) and RMSE (0.082 and 0.083)
values but underestimate the annual mean AOD (RMB =
0.972 and 0.881). However, these products are better over-
all than the ESA-CCI AATSR products. The POLDER and
SeaWiFS products exhibit poor performance due to the no-
table overestimation (RMB = 1.307) and the smallest num-
ber of matchup samples, respectively. The MODIS products
have noticeably high correlations with ground measurements

AOD temporal variation and trend
6.1
Global and regional AOD trend
In this section, we focus on the comparison of the tempo-
ral trends of global and regional AOD products. Because the
AVHRR and POLDER products provide less than 10 years of
aerosol observations in this study, only the remaining eight
long-term aerosol products are compared for a common ob-
servation period. To ensure that the long-term trend is not
impacted by the trends of the aerosol products themselves,
we calculated the autocorrelation coefﬁcient of each product
with a 1-month lag (Fig. S3).
The linear trends are derived from the de-seasonalized
monthly anomaly of each AODS, and a two-sided test is con-
ducted to present the statistical signiﬁcance of the temporal
trends, where the trends that are signiﬁcant at the 95 % conﬁ-
dence level (p < 0.05) are marked with black dots in Fig. 14.
Considering the multiple-hypothesis testing (many data sets
and locations are being tested for trends), there could be a
signiﬁcant fraction of false positives. Therefore, the FDR test
at the 95 % signiﬁcance level (α = 0.05) is performed to ad-
dress this issue. We see that the false-positive points can be
adequately eliminated after the FDR adjustment and that the
statistically signiﬁcant areas are more or less reduced (com-
paring Fig. 14 with Fig. S4). After these processes, the trends
are able to represent the time evolution of aerosols realisti-
cally.
The global AOD trend distribution shows similar overall
spatial patterns among all aerosol products. Over land, sig-
niﬁcantly positive trends (a > 0.01, p < 0.05, where a and
p are deﬁned in Sect. 3.2) are mainly found in the Middle
East and southern Asia, indicating increasing air pollution.
In contrast, signiﬁcantly negative aerosol trends (a < −0.01,
p < 0.05) are mainly observed in eastern North America,
Europe, and central Africa, indicating improved air qual-
ity. Trends greater than 0.01 yr−1 but not statistically signif-
icant are found in a few areas of northern Africa and eastern
Asia. Strong negative but statistically nonsigniﬁcant trends
are found in central South America and parts of southeast-
ern Asia. The large trends indicate the importance of aerosol
evolution, and the lack of signiﬁcance may be attributed to
the complex aerosol sources; thus, more attention should be
placed on these areas to better understand the temporal vari-
ations in aerosols. The magnitude of the aerosol trend is gen-
erally small (|a| < 0.005) over the ocean. However, signiﬁ-
cantly decreasing aerosol trends (a < −0.01, p < 0.05) are
observed along the west coast of South America, the east
coast of North America and the east coast of Asia. A sig-
niﬁcant increase in aerosol trends (a > 0.01, p < 0.05) was
observed along the Indian coast. On the other hand, the four
ESA-CCI and MISR aerosol products are not signiﬁcant in

most ocean areas, even for the open seas. MODIS and Sea-
WiFS products have similar spatial patterns in most ocean ar-
eas, such as the signiﬁcantly increasing trends observed over
the Paciﬁc and Indian oceans.
Figure 15 compares the regional aerosol trends among
the eight satellite AODS values, and Tables 4–5 show the
statistics of the regional AODS trends and uncertainties over
land and ocean. Over land, most small trends are not sta-
tistically signiﬁcant, indicating unconﬁrmed temporal trends
over most land regions (Fig. 15a, Table 4). However, most
products show signiﬁcantly increasing trends over the Mid-
dle East (a = 0.0048–0.0111 yr−1, p < 0.05) and southern
Asia (a = 0.0034–0.0047 yr−1, p < 0.05), conﬁrming the
robust enhancement of aerosols in these two regions. Some
products also exhibit obvious decreasing aerosol trends over
eastern North America, western North America, Europe, and
southeastern Asia. The robustness of the decreasing trends
is credible in eastern North America and Europe but un-
sure in western North America. Over the ocean, the aerosol
trends are generally small (Fig. 15b, Table 5), especially for
the three open-ocean areas (i.e. Paciﬁc, Indian, and Atlantic
oceans). However, the aerosol changes in the four coastal
areas exceed 0.002 yr−1. The downward trends on the east-
ern North American coast and European coast and the rising

Comparison between AODS and AODA trends
In this section, the satellite-derived AODS trends are com-
pared against the AERONET AODA trends from ground
measurements. To ensure the statistical signiﬁcance of the
trend calculations, only the AERONET sites with at least
5 years (120 months) of effective observations are selected.
Figure 16 plots the AODS and AODA trends at all available
sites for the eight satellite products from 2003 to 2010 over
the world. The results show that most products can capture
the correct AOD trends at 40 % to 45 % of the available sites
over land and ocean. For four ESA-CCI aerosol products, the
satellite-derived AOD trends are consistent with AERONET-
based trends with average MAEs ranging from 0.45 to 0.49
and RMSEs ranging from 0.65 to 0.78. The MISR product
shows an overall better performance with a lower MAE of
0.418 and RMSE of 0.589 than the ESA-CCI products. How-
ever, the SeaWiFS product has valid comparisons at only 59
sites due to the lower spatial coverage over land, and the
AODS trend exhibits the worst performance with the largest
MAE and RMSE values among all the aerosol products. By
contrast, Terra and Aqua show similar performances with al-
most equal CTPs of 42 %, and the MODIS products capture
the temporal AODS trend most accurately with the lowest
MAE and RMSE errors.

Summary and conclusion
This study focuses on the similarities and differences in the
spatial variations and temporal trends of the current satellite-
derived AOD products. For this purpose, 11 global monthly
aerosol products at coarse spatial resolutions are collected
and compared against the ground measurements from 308
AERONET sites throughout the world, including four prod-
ucts from the European Space Agency’s Climate Change
Initiative (AATSR-ADV, AATSR-EN, AATSR-ORAC, and
AATSR-SU) and AVHRR, MISR, Terra and Aqua MODIS,
POLDER, SeaWiFS, and VIIRS products. These data are
evaluated in three ways: (1) direct comparison of monthly re-
trievals against the AERONET observations on global, con-
tinent, and site scales; (2) comparison of the global and re-
gional AOD spatial coverage and distribution; and (3) com-
parison of the global and regional AOD temporal variations
and trends. Our results may help readers to better understand
the features of different satellite aerosol products and select
a suitable aerosol dataset for their studies.
In terms of the performance of multiple products on dif-
ferent spatial scales, we show that the four ESA-CCI aerosol
products show similar performance and are generally worse
than the AVHRR and MISR products. The SeaWiFS prod-
uct provides the smallest sample size despite an overall good
performance. The seven abovementioned products underes-
timate the aerosol loads, especially the MISR and AATSR-
ADV products. The POLDER product performs worst with
the largest estimation uncertainties and signiﬁcantly overes-
timates the aerosol loads. The MODIS products (especially
Aqua MODIS) show superior performance among all prod-
ucts with small estimation uncertainties in most regions and
sites but overestimate AOD overall. In general, most products
exhibit consistently good performance over dark surfaces in
Europe and North America but perform worse over bright
and complex surfaces in southern Asia, eastern Asia, Africa,
and the Middle East.
In terms of the aerosol spatial distribution, the AATSR-
ADV and SeaWiFS products have lower spatial coverage
(∼68 % and 69 %) with numerous missing values, while
the MODIS products can provide the highest spatial cover-
age (∼87 %) throughout the world. Most products show the
highest spatial coverage in SON but the lowest aerosol con-
centrations in DJF. In general, the seasonal aerosol spatial
distributions over the ocean are more consistent among the
different aerosol products. However, noticeable spatial het-
erogeneity and numerical differences are observed over land,
especially over Africa, Asia, and some coastal areas, which
are possibly due to the complex aerosol sources and the lim-
itations of the different aerosol retrieval algorithms. In gen-

eral, the best performance for describing the seasonal aerosol
distributions is always observed in SON, but the worst is ob-
served in JJA. The Aqua MODIS product performs best with
almost all the best evaluation metrics (e.g. MAE and RMSE)
among all the products at the seasonal and annual levels.
In terms of the temporal aerosol trends, most products ex-
hibit similar spatial patterns throughout the world, where sig-
niﬁcantly positive trends are found over the Middle East,
southern Asia, and southern Asian coasts. In contrast, sig-
niﬁcantly decreasing trends are observed over eastern North
America, Europe, and their coastal areas. In general, most
products can capture the correct AOD trends at more than
approximately 40 % of the AERONET sites. In general, the
MODIS products show the best performance with the best
evaluation metrics in describing the temporal aerosol varia-
tions.
This study has comprehensively evaluated the perfor-
mance of the atmosphere level 3 aerosol products derived
from multi-source satellite sensors in describing temporal
and spatial aerosol variations and provided users with pre-
liminary data selection and suggestions for their particularly
special studies. Due to large differences in the performance
(especially for local regions) and operation time for different
aerosol products, a better selection of more accurate aerosol
products may lead to more reliable research conclusions.
Meanwhile, by making full use of multi-source aerosol prod-
ucts, newly combined or merged approaches can be further
explored to reduce the estimate bias for reproducing more
accurate global aerosol products. This might be speciﬁcally
critical for validating the aerosol simulation and prediction
using global climate models. Furthermore, aerosol retrieval
over highly bright (e.g. desert, bare land) and heterogeneous
(e.g. urban) areas over land still have large estimation un-
certainties, which brings great challenges due to high sur-
face brightness and intense human activities. Therefore, the
aerosol algorithm teams may need put more effort into opti-
mizing the estimation in surface reﬂectance and the assump-
tion of aerosol types over these areas to improve the data
quality of aerosol retrievals and thus increase the spatial cov-
erage and decrease the diversity among different data sets.
These could be the major points of aerosol research in the
future.
