Objective: The recent outbreak of Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is reminiscent
of the SARS outbreak in 2003. We aim to compare the severity and mortality between
male and female patients with COVID-19 or SARS.
Study Design and Setting:
We extracted the data from: (1) a case series of 43
hospitalized patients we treated, (2) a public data set of the ﬁrst 37 cases of patients
who died of COVID-19 and 1,019 patients who survived in China, and (3) data of 524
patients with SARS, including 139 deaths, from Beijing in early 2003.
Results: Older age and a high number of comorbidities were associated with higher
severity and mortality in patients with both COVID-19 and SARS. Age was comparable
between men and women in all data sets. In the case series, however, men’s cases
tended to be more serious than women’s (P = 0.035). In the public data set, the number
of men who died from COVID-19 is 2.4 times that of women (70.3 vs. 29.7%, P = 0.016).
In SARS patients, the gender role in mortality was also observed. The percentage of
males were higher in the deceased group than in the survived group (P = 0.015).
Conclusion: While men and women have the same prevalence, men with COVID-19
are more at risk for worse outcomes and death, independent of age.
Keywords: SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, SARS, morbidity, mortality, gender, male, female

Gender Differences in COVID-19
INTRODUCTION
In early December 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus
disease (COVID-19) occurred in Wuhan city and then rapidly
spread throughout China, putting the world on alert. High-
throughput sequencing has revealed a novel β-coronavirus that is
currently named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus
2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1), which resembles severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (2). Most patients with
COVID-19 were Mild/Moderate patients who often experienced
dyspnea after 1 week. Severe patients progressed rapidly to
Critical conditions, which included symptoms such as acute
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure,
coagulopathy, septic shock, and metabolic acidosis.
Early identiﬁcation of risk factors for Critical conditions is
urgently needed, not only to identify the deﬁning clinical and
epidemiological characteristics with greater precision, but also to
facilitate the appropriate supportive care and prompt access to
the intensive care unit (ICU) if necessary.
The Chinese health authority has announced that the total
number of conﬁrmed cases on the Chinese mainland has reached
76,936, and 2,442 people have died of the disease as of Feb 23.
Among the 2,442 deceased patients, most were old and two-
thirds were males, though the detailed data has not been reported
(3). This raises a question: Are men more susceptible to getting
and dying from COVID-19?
Here, we report the clinical characteristics of a recent case
series of 43 patients we treated and a public data set of the ﬁrst 37
cases of those who died from COVID-19 and the 1,019 patients
who survived COVID-19. We aimed to compare the severity
and mortality in male and female patients with COVID-19 and
to explore the most useful prognostic factor for individualized
assessment. SARS-CoV-2 infection is reminiscent of the SARS-
CoV outbreak in early 2003, because both viruses attack cells via
the same ACE2 receptor (3). In this study, we also analyzed the
data of 524 SARS patients, including 139 deaths, from Beijing in
early 2003.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Data Sources
Cases Series of COVID-19
The case series analysis covers 43 patients with COVID-19
who were treated at Wuhan Union Hospital by the medical
team of Beijing Tongren Hospital from January 29, 2020 to
February 15, 2020.
Public Data Set of COVID-19
The public data set covers the ﬁrst 37 cases of patients who
died from COVID-19 and 1,019-cases of COVID-19 survivors
from the public data set from the Chinese Public Health Science
Data Center.
Cases Series of SARS
This study also included data of 524 SARS patients, including
139 deaths from 29 hospitals in early 2003. These patients were
hospitalized in Beijing between 25 March and 22 May 2003.
Diagnosis and clinical classiﬁcation criteria and treatment
plan (trial version 5) of COVID-19 was launched by the National
Health Committee of the People’s Republic of China (http://www.
nhc.gov.cn/). The clinical classiﬁcation of severity is as follows:
(1) Mild, only mild symptoms, imaging shows no pneumonia; (2)
Moderate, with fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and imaging
shows pneumonia; (3) Severe, meet any of the following signs:
(a) respiratory distress, respiratory rate ≥30 beats / min; (b) in
the resting state, ﬁnger oxygen saturation ≤93%) arterial blood
oxygen partial pressure (PaO2/oxygen concentration (FiO2) ≤
300 mmHg (1 mmHg = 0.133 kPa); (4) Critical, one of the
following conditions: (a) respiratory failure occurs and requires
mechanical ventilation, (b) Shock occurs, (c) ICU admission is
required for combined organ failure.
The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Beijing Tongren Hospital, Capital Medical University.
Statistical Analysis
Data were expressed as mean ± SD, median [interquartile
range (IQR)], or percentages, as appropriate. To compare the
diﬀerences between the two groups, mean values and percentages
were used between the two groups by the Student t-test, Mann-
Whitney U-test, or chi-square (χ2) test. Kaplan–Meier survival
curves and the log-rank test was used for testing the survival rates
between males and females. Statistical analyses were performed
using the SAS software (version 9.4). P < 0.05 (two-tailed) was
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.
RESULTS
Case Series of Covid-19
The demographic and clinical characteristics are shown in
Table 1. The median age was 62 years (IQR, 51 to 70). Fever
(95.3%) and cough (65.1%) were the most common symptoms,
while diarrhea (16.3) was not common. 37.2% of patients had
at least one underlying disorder (i.e., hypertension, diabetes,
cardiovascular diseases, and chronic lung diseases). There is no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence in median age between male and female
groups, but the maximum of the range of IQR is lower in
male (66 years in men vs. 73 years in women). Symptoms
and comorbidities were comparable between men and women.
As expected, men had a higher level of hemoglobin. However,
male patients also had elevated serum creatinine, white blood
cells, and neutrophils. Among the 43-case series, 13 (30.2%)
were diagnosed with Mild or Moderate pneumonia, while 14
(32.6%) and 16 (37.2%) were diagnosed with Severe and Critical
pneumonia, respectively. Chi-square (χ2) test for trend indicated
that men’s cases of COVID-19 tended to be more serious than
women’s (P = 0.035), according to the clinical classiﬁcation of
severity (Figure 1).
Public Data Set of COVID-19
In the deceased patients, fever (86.5%) and cough (67.6%) were
common, while diarrhea was uncommon (18.9%).The median
period from symptom onset to death was 13 days (ranging of IQR
11 to 18 days). Of these deceased patients, 64.9% had at least one

comparable between men and women in both patients who
deceased and survived (Figure 2B). Of the 37 deceased patients,
70.3% were men and 29.7% were woman. The number of men
was 2.4 times that of women in the deceased patients. While men
and women had the same susceptibility, men were more prone to
dying (χ2 test, P = 0.016) (Figure 2C).
Cases Series of SARS, in 2003
Between March 25 and May 22, 2003, a total of 524 SARS
patients, including 139 deaths, in the Beijing area were reported
from 29 hospitals enrolled in our analysis. Fever (98.4%) and
cough (76.9%) were the most common symptoms, while diarrhea
(6.7%) was not common. 57.0% of the patients had at least one
of the concomitant diseases including hypertension, diabetes,
cardiovascular diseases, and chronic lung diseases. The mean
duration from self-reported symptoms to death was 15 (IQR:
10–19) days. Table 2 summarizes the clinical and biochemical
characteristics of all SARS patients. The median age of the
deceased patients was much higher than that of the patients who
survived (57 vs. 32, P < 0.001). The rate of the concomitant
diseases in the deceased patients was also higher than that of
the patients who survived (57.0% vs. 17.9%, P < 0.001). While
the deceased patients were signiﬁcantly older than the patients
who survived (Figure 3A), ages were comparable between men
and women in both patients who deceased and survived with
SARS (Figure 3B). The proportion of men was higher in the
deceased group (53.2%) than in the group who survived (42.3%)
(χ2 test, P = 0.027) (Figure 3C). Survival analysis showed that
men had a signiﬁcantly higher mortality rate than women (31.2
vs. 22.6%) in this hospital-based cohort (hazard ratio [95% CI]
1.47 [1.05–2.06], P = 0.026) (Figure 3D).
DISCUSSION
Coronavirus is a large family of viruses that cause illnesses
ranging from the common cold to severe pneumonia, such
as SARS (2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
(4). SARS-CoV-2 was ﬁrst identiﬁed in Wuhan, China, by the
Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (1).
Both epidemiological (5, 6) and clinical (7, 8) features of patients
with COVID-19 have recently been reported. However, little data
on the prognostic factors of COVID-19 have been reported.
In the Case series of COVID-19, consistent with previous
reports (8–10), older patients (≥65 years old), were more likely
to have a Severe type of COVID-19. Men tended to develop more
serious cases than women, according to the clinical classiﬁcation
of severity. In the Public data set of COVID-19, we also found that
the percentage of older age (≥65 years) was much higher in the
deceased patients than in the patients who survived (83.8% in 37
deceased patients vs. 13.2% in 1,019 patients who survived).
The number of men is 2.4 times that of women in the deceased
patients. While men and women had the same susceptibility, men
were more prone to dying.
This is the ﬁrst preliminary study investigating the role of
gender in morbidity and mortality of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
One study of 425 patients with COVID-19 indicated that 56%

were males (5). Another study of 140 patients found that 50.7%
were males (9). In the present study, similar susceptibility
to SARS-CoV-2 between males and females was observed in
1,019 patients who survived the disease (50.0% males), collected
from a public data set and in a case series of 43 hospitalized
patients (51.2% males). Although the deceased patients were
signiﬁcantly older than the patients who survived COVID-19,
ages were comparable between males and females in both the
deceased and the patients who survived. Therefore, gender is
a risk factor for higher severity and mortality in patients with
COVID-19, independent of age and susceptibility. This gender
factor, as well as higher incidences in men for most of the
diseases, could correlate with a general demographic fact of a
shorter life expectancy in men compared to women in China
and in the world in general. Although there is no signiﬁcant
diﬀerence in median age between male and female groups,
the maximum of the range of IQR is lower in males in the
case series.
In early 2003, we participated in the Beijing Municipal
Medical Taskforce of SARS (11). Here, we re-analyzed the data
of a large population of 520 SARS patients, including 135
deaths in Beijing, and summarized the experience and lessons
for present use, because SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV attack
cells via the same receptor, ACE2 (3). We have previously
reported that high protein expression of ACE2 receptor in
speciﬁc organs correlated with speciﬁc organ failures, indicated
by corresponding clinical parameters in SARS patients (11, 12).
It has been shown that circulating ACE2 levels are higher in men
than in women and in patients with diabetes or cardiovascular
diseases (13).
This study has some limitations. First, for severity analysis,
only a case series of 43 patients with SARS-CoV-2 was
included, because detailed patient information, particularly
regarding clinical outcomes, was unavailable in the public data
set. Second, for mortality analysis only the ﬁrst 37 cases of
patients who died of SARS-CoV-2 were included. Due to the
urgent circumstances we are living in, there was no access
to unique, homogeneous data for COVID. It could aﬀect the
analysis and any possible biased results. However, this is the
ﬁrst preliminary analysis investigating the role of gender in
morbidity and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2. More
clinical and basic research regarding gender and other prognostic
factors for individualized assessment and treatment is needed
in the future.
