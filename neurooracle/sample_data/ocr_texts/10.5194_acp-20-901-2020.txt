Abstract. The aerosol liquid water (ALW) content (ALWC),
an important component of atmospheric particles, has a sig-
niﬁcant effect on atmospheric optical properties, visibility
and multiphase chemical reactions. In this study, ALWC is
determined from aerosol hygroscopic growth factor (GF) and
particle number size distribution (PNSD) measurements and
is also simulated by ISORROPIA II, a thermodynamic equi-
librium model, with measured aerosol chemical composition
data taken at an urban site in Beijing from 8 November to
15 December 2017. Rich measurements made during the ex-
periment concerning virtually all aerosol properties allow us
not only to derive the ALWC but also to study the contri-
butions by various species for which little has been done in
this region. The simulated ALWC including the contribution
of organics and the calculated ALWC are highly correlated
(coefﬁcient of determination R2 = 0.92). The ALWC con-
tributed by organics (ALWCOrg) accounts for 30% ± 22%
of the total ALWC during the sampling period. These re-
sults suggest a signiﬁcant contribution of organics to ALWC,
which is rather different from previous studies that showed
negligible contributions by organics. Our results also show
that ALWC correlates well with the mass concentrations
of sulfate, nitrate, and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs)
(R2 = 0.66, 0.56 and 0.60, respectively). We further noted
that accumulation mode particles play a key role in deter-
mining ALWC, dominating among all the aerosol modes.
ALWC is an exponential function of ambient relative humid-
ity (RH), whose strong diurnal variation inﬂuence the diurnal
variation of ALWC. However, there is a 3 h lag between the
extremes of ALWC and RH values, due to the diurnal vari-
ations in PNSD and aerosol chemical composition. Finally,
a case study reveals that ALWCOrg plays an important role
in the formation of secondary aerosols through multiphase
reactions at the initial stage of a heavy-haze episode.

Introduction
China has experienced rapid economic developments during
the past few decades, resulting in frequent heavy-haze events.
Severe air pollution may harm human health and affect the
regional climate through aerosol direct and indirect radiation
effects (Li et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Wei et al., 2019a,
b). However, air pollution formation mechanisms and aerosol
climate effects remain highly uncertain due to the complex

physical and chemical processes involved (Tao et al., 2012;
Wang et al., 2014).
Aerosol liquid water (ALW), a component of atmospheric
particles in the atmosphere, exists universally and plays an
important role in many atmospheric physical and chemical
processes (Nguyen et al., 2016). For example, ALW can
inﬂuence aerosol optical properties, resulting in increased
extinction coefﬁcients, lowered atmospheric visibilities, en-
hanced aerosol optical depths (AODs) and changes in the di-
rect climatic effect of aerosols (Dougle et al., 1996; Adams
and Seinfeld, 2001; Liao et al., 2005; Seinfeld and Pan-
dis, 2006). Secondary aerosols (SAs) are considered to be
the main source of particulate pollution during heavy-haze
events in China (Huang et al., 2014). Many studies now high-
light the signiﬁcance of aerosol liquid water content (ALWC)
in the formation of SA through chemical reactions (e.g.,
Arellanes et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2016).
This is because ALW can dilute the absolute concentration
of solutes, adjust aerosol acidity and serve as a reactant, re-
sulting in increases in trace gas (e.g., N2O5 and HO2) up-
take coefﬁcients (Wahner et al., 1998; Bertram et al., 2009;
Abbatt et al., 2012). H. Wang et al. (2017) found that the
uptake coefﬁcient of N2O5 can be high, which is related to
high ALWC in Beijing, thereby increasing the formation of
nitrates. ALW can also speed up the aqueous phase chemical
reaction by serving as a reactor for the transformation of SO2
to sulfate (Zheng et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2016; Cheng et al.,
2016). Some studies have found that ALWC can facilitate
the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) through
aqueous-phase chemistry and photochemistry (Blando and
Turpin, 2001; Surratt et al., 2007; Hennigan et al., 2008;
Song et al., 2019). Furthermore, observations in Beijing have
shown that aqueous-phase processes play a dominant role in
the additional formation of oxidized SOAs (Xu et al., 2017).
Overall, investigating the formation of SA and haze in north-
ern China requires an examination of ALWC and its factors
including aerosol particle number size distribution (PNSD),
aerosol chemical composition and ambient related humidity
(RH) in this region.
However, directly measuring real-time ALWC is not feasi-
ble yet because of technical limitations (Kuang et al., 2018).
Four indirect methods have been proposed to calculate real-
time ALWC: (1) the aerosol PNSD under dry conditions and
ambient RH conditions are ﬁrst measured, then ALWC is cal-
culated as the difference between dry and ambient aerosol
volumes (Stanier et al., 2004); (2) the increased aerosol vol-
ume due to water uptake (i.e., ALWC) is calculated accord-
ing to the measured dry PNSD, size-dependent aerosol hy-
groscopicity and ambient RH (Kitamori et al., 2009; Bian et
al., 2014; Tan et al., 2017); (3) the dry and ambient aerosol
volumes are ﬁrst estimated using the measured aerosol op-
tical enhancement and Ångström exponent, then ALWC is
calculated as the difference between dry and ambient aerosol
volumes (Kuang et al., 2018); and (4) ALWC is simulated
using thermal equilibrium models such as the ISORROPIA
thermodynamic model (Nenes et al., 1998), Aerosol Inorgan-
ics Model (Wexler and Clegg, 2002), the Simulating Compo-
sition of Atmospheric Particles in Equilibrium model (Kim
et al., 1993), and the Gibbs Free Energy Minimization model
(Ansari and Pandis, 1999) with aerosol chemical composi-
tion information as an input.
ALWC mostly depends on aerosol PNSD, chemical com-
position and ambient RH. Hodas et al. (2014) reported that
ALWC in the Po Valley in Italy was driven by locally formed
anthropogenic nitrates. The implications for the lifetimes of
water-soluble organic compounds and its potential inﬂuence
on SOA formation were also discussed. Another study also
revealed that ALWC in Beijing was driven by secondary in-
organic aerosols (SIAs; Wu et al., 2018). Most previous stud-
ies have focused on the interaction between inorganic salts
and ALWC, but the impact of organic species on ALWC has
been ignored to our knowledge (Blando et al., 2001; Surratt
et al., 2007; Hennigan et al., 2008; Carlton et al., 2013). A
thorough understanding of the association of ALWC with or-
ganic aerosols in the atmosphere is lacking.
In this study, ALWC is calculated using the indirect
method (2) and simulated using the ISORROPIA II model,
i.e., indirect method (4), discussed previously. The effects of
inorganic aerosols, organic aerosols, PNSD and ambient RH
on ALWC are then investigated separately. We demonstrate
the signiﬁcant contribution of organics to ALWC in Beijing
and provide evidence that the ALW contributed by organics
serves as a reactor for sulfate and SOA formation.

Data and measurements
2.1
Sampling site
The Air Pollution and Human Health (APHH) winter ﬁeld
campaign took place from 8 November to 15 December 2016
at the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Atmo-
spheric Physics Tower Branch in Beijing. Beijing is located
in the northwestern part of the North China Plain, which
has experienced rapid economic developments during the last
few decades. A large amount of gaseous precursors and other
air pollutants are emitted in this region every year, caus-
ing serious air pollution problems. The sampling site is lo-
cated in the northwestern urban area of Beijing (39.97◦N,
116.37◦E), between the northern 3rd and 4th Ring Roads
and surrounded by restaurants. Trafﬁc and cooking emis-
sions are thus the main pollutants at the site. Aerosols at
this site can, therefore, represent anthropogenic aerosols in
highly polluted areas well. Sun et al. (2013) and Y. Wang et
al. (2017) provide more detailed descriptions of the sampling
site.

cluded a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) equipped

with a long differential mobility analyzer (DMA; model
3081A, TSI) and a condensation particle counter (CPC;
model 3772, TSI). A custom-built hygroscopicity tandem
differential mobility analyzer (H-TDMA) was installed in an
air-conditioned mobile container at ground level. The tem-
perature inside the container was maintained at 20–25 ◦C. A
high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-AMS) was
set up in a sampling room located on a two-story roof, about
25 m north from the container. Sampled air went through
a PM2.5 cyclone inlet ﬁxed on the top of the container be-
fore entering the instruments. The RH of the sampled air was
dried to below 20 % by a dryer system consisting of a tube
ﬁlled with silica gel and a Naﬁon dryer (model PD-70T-24ss,
Perma Pure Inc., USA). Various meteorological parameters,
including wind speed (WS), wind direction (WD), tempera-
ture (T ), and RH, were measured from a 325 m meteorologi-
cal tower located ∼20 m west of the container. In this study,
all times are reported in Beijing local time (UTC+8 h).
PNSDs with electrical-mobility diameters ranging from 10
to 600 nm were measured by a scanning mobility particle
sizer (SMPS) at a 5 min time resolution. PNSDs were ex-
tended to diameters ranging from 0.6 to 1 µm by ﬁtting the
measured PNSDs with functions consisting of three-mode
log-normal distributions (Hussein et al., 2005). Thus gener-
ated are PNSDs with a diameter range of 10 nm to 1 µm.
The H-TDMA system developed by the Guangzhou Insti-
tute of Tropical and Marine Meteorology measured the size-
dependent aerosol hygroscopic growth factor (GF). The H-
TDMA system mainly consists of four parts. The ﬁrst part
is a Naﬁon dryer to keep the RH of sampled air below 20 %
and a bipolar neutralizer (soft X-ray, model 3088, TSI Inc.)
to equilibrate the particle charge (Wiedensohler et al., 1988).
Next, the sampled air passes through the ﬁrst differential
mobility analyzer (DMA1; model 3081L, TSI Inc.) to pro-
duce mono-dispersed particles. In this study, the diameters
were set to 40, 80, 110, 150 and 200 nm. The sampled air
then went through a Naﬁon humidiﬁer (model PD-70T-24ss,
Perma Pure Inc., USA) used to humidify the RH of sampled
air to 90 %. The last part of the H-TDMA is the second DMA
(same model as the DMA1) and a water-based condensation
particle counter (model 3787, TSI Inc.) used to measure the
number size distribution of humidiﬁed particles in the ﬁve
selected diameters. Y. Wang et al. (2017) provide a detailed
introduction to the H-TDMA system.

chemical species, including organics (Org), sulfate (SO2−

were measured by the HR-AMS. The sampled air dried by
diffusion silica gel dryers was drawn into the HR-AMS
through a PM2.5 cyclone inlet to remove coarse particles
larger than 2.5 µm. The HR-AMS was calibrated with pure
ammonium nitrate following the procedures detailed in
Jimenez et al. (2003). Sun et al. (2016b) provide operational
details about the HR-AMS.

Method
3.1
ALWC calculations based on H-TDMA
measurements
The ALWC is calculated based on measurements of the
aerosol GF and particle number size distribution. Brieﬂy, H-
TDMA data are ﬁrst used to derive the size-resolved parti-
cle GFs at various RHs. Then ALWC is calculated as the in-
creased aerosol volume due to hygroscopic growth attributed
to water uptake.
Chen et al. (2012) showed how to calculate size-resolved
particle GFs at different RHs. First, a three-mode log-normal
distribution is applied to ﬁt the measured PNSD to produce
ﬁtting parameters for each mode. The hygroscopicity param-
eter (κ) in any mode is assumed to be constant. The H-
TDMA-derived size-dependent κ can then be used to de-
duce the corresponding κ for the nucleation mode, the Aitken
mode and the accumulation mode of PNSDs according to the
following equation:
κ(Dp) =
P3
i=1κi · Ni(Dp)
P3
i=1Ni(Dp)
,
(1)
where κi refers to the κ of the ith mode and Ni(Dp) refers
to the number concentration of particles in the ith mode.
According to the κ-Köhler theory (Petters and Kreidenweis,
2007), κ at a certain diameter (Dd) can be calculated as
κ(Dd) = (GF3 −1) ·

where RH is the control value by the humidiﬁer in the H-
TDMA system, T is the mean room temperature of the con-
tainer set to 293 K, σs/a is the surface tension of the solution–
air interface assumed to be the same as the surface tension
coefﬁcient between water and air (about 0.0728 N m−1 at
293 K), Mw is the molecular weight of water, R is the uni-
versal gas constant, ρw is the density of water, and Dd is the
diameter of the dry particles. The GF at a given RH is deﬁned
as the ratio of the humidiﬁed diameter [Dp (RH)] to Dd as
GF = Dp(RH)/Dd.
(3)
The known κ of each mode derives the size-resolved κ at
90 % RH using Eq. (1). Substituting the size-resolved κ into
Eq. (2) results in size-resolved GFs at various RHs. Finally,
the volume of ALWC at ambient RH is equal to the increased
aerosol volume due to water uptake, i.e., ALWC can be cal-
culated as

3.2
ALWC simulations based on the ISORROPIA II
model
The thermodynamic equilibrium model ISORROPIA II de-
veloped by Fountoukis and Nenes (2007) using aerosol
chemical composition information from the HR-AMS can
simulate ALWC (ALWCISO). The bulk chemical composi-
tion was used in the model. However, the ISORROPIA II
model only considers the contribution of inorganic species
(Ca2+, K+, Mg2+, NH+, Na+, SO2−
4 , NO−
3 , Cl−and H2O)
on ALWC and neglects the contribution of organics. In this
study, the model was set to reverse mode due to the lack of
measurements of gaseous ammonia, and the phase state was
assumed to be stable in the model calculation. As shown in
Fig. S1, the simulated ALWC in stable mode is similar to that
in metastable mode (R2 = 0.99).
According to the model assumptions that the aerosol cur-
vature effect in the κ-Köhler theory is ignored, and the
aerosol water uptake has no effect on ambient vapor pressure,
the water activity (aw) deﬁned as the effective mole fraction
of water is equal to the ambient RH in this model (Seinfeld
and Pandis, 2006).
aw = RH

The ALWC can be calculated using the Zdanovskii–Stokes–
Robinson (ZSR) mixing rule (Stokes and Robinson, 1966),
ALWCISO =

(6)
where Mi is the molar concentration of the ith species
(mol m−3 in air) and m0i(aw) is the corresponding molality
of the binary solution of the ith species under the same aw
with complex solution. Finally, measured ambient RH and T
values as input ALWCISO values under different RH and T
conditions can be derived.
3.3
Inferring the contribution of organics to ALWC
According to the κ-Köhler theory and the ZSR mixing rule,
κ can also be expressed as the sum of the contributions of
each aerosol component.
κ =
X
iεiκi,
(7)
where εi and κi are the volume fraction and hygroscopic-
ity of the ith species, respectively. Submicrometer aerosols
mainly consist of organic and inorganic species (Carbone et
al., 2013; Zieger et al., 2017). As mentioned in Sect. 2.2,
the HR-AMS measures the mass concentrations of organics
and inorganics, including SO2−
4 , NO−
3 , NH+
4 and Cl−. The
volume fraction of inorganic species can be calculated based
on the ion-pairing scheme given by the following equations
(Gysel et al., 2007):
nNH4NO3 = nNO−
3
nNH4HSO4 = min(2nSO2−
4 −nNH+
4 + nNO−

nNH+

n(NH4)2SO4 = max(nNH+

4 ,0)
nH2SO4 = max(0,nSO42−−nNH+
4 + nNO−
3 )
nHNO3 = 0,
(8)
where n represents the molar numbers and “min” and “max”
are minimum and maximum values, respectively. The κ val-
ues of the inorganic species sulfuric acid, ammonium sul-
fate, ammonium hydrogen sulfate and ammonium nitrate are
1.19, 0.48, 0.56 and 0.58, respectively (Topping et al., 2005;
Petters and Kreidenweis, 2007). So the ZSR model can be
used to estimate the contribution of inorganic species to the
κ value. In this paper, the chloride was not taken into account
in ion pairing because its source is hard to determine. This
may result in a minor uncertainty in κ calculation. The hy-
groscopicity parameter of organics (κOrg) can be calculated
using the volume fraction of organics, and the total κ value
can be derived from the H-TDMA, according to Eq. (7). Fi-
nally, ALWC contributed by organic species (ALWCOrg) can
be calculated as (Petters and Kreidenweis, 2007)
ALWCOrg = mOrgρW

where mOrg is the organic mass concentration from the AMS

et al., 2015).

Results and discussion
4.1
Comparison of calculated and simulated ALWC
The trends in ALWC calculated based on the hygroscopic
growth factor and PNSD (ALWCHTDMA) and simulated from
the ISORROPIA II model (ALWCISO) are generally con-
sistent. Figure 1a shows that ALWCHTDMA and ALWCISO
agree well and that their coefﬁcient of determination (R2)
is 0.89. The correlation is especially strong for RH over
90 %. However, for RH below 60 %, ALWCISO is less than
ALWCHTDMA and even close to zero in some cases. Bian
et al. (2014) and Tan et al. (2017) observed a similar phe-
nomenon in northern and southern China. There are three
possible explanations for these results. H-TDMA samples
were humidiﬁed to 90 % RH during the ﬁeld campaign,
thereby leading to the neglect of the deliquescence process
in the ALWCHTDMA calculation. This may lead to an over-
estimation of ALWCHTDMA for RH below the deliquescence

relative humidity (DRH). Second, the assumption of constant
κ in each mode may lead to small uncertainty in size-resolved
GFs at different RHs, resulting in a small deviation in the
ALWC calculation. This may be another reason for the dif-
ference between ALWCHTDMA and ALWCISO. In addition,
the ISORROPIA II model ignores the effect of aerosol shape
and complex organic species on the DRH. Previous studies
have suggested that the particle spherical assumption and
simpliﬁed aerosol chemical species in this model can over-
estimate the DRH (Seinfeld and Pandis, 2006; Sjogren et
al., 2007). So for RH below the simulated DRH (∼60 %),
particles may still be dry in the ISORROPIA II model, but
they may have been hydrated in the real atmosphere. There-
fore, this model underestimates ALWC. The ambient aerosol
deliquescent phenomenon is rare in the North China Plain
(Kuang et al., 2016). In addition, the ISORROPIA II model
cannot simulate water uptake by organics, which can lead
to some bias between simulated and calculated ALWCs. As
described in Sect. 3.3, ALWCOrg can be inferred and used
to discuss differences between ALWCISO and ALWCHTDMA.
Figure 1b shows that adding ALWCOrg to ALWCISO leads to
a stronger correlation with ALWCHTDMA (R2 = 0.92). The
correlation improves signiﬁcantly for RH below 60 %. This
demonstrates that (1) organic species contribute signiﬁcantly
to ALWC and (2) the underestimation of ALWC by the
ISORROPIA II model is also related to the neglect of organic
species in the model.

Impact of different factors on ALWC
4.2.1
Impact of aerosol chemical species on ALWC
Figure 2 shows the characteristics of seven heavy pollution
events selected for examination. Figure 2a and c display the
time series of WS, WD, and ambient RH. The prevailing
wind during the haze episodes was a weak southerly wind
that was favorable for bringing in pollutants from the highly
populated and industrialized neighboring regions to the sam-
pling site. This is beneﬁcial to the formation and accumula-
tion of SA (Wang et al., 2010; Y. Wang et al., 2017). How-
ever, the prevailing winds during the clean events were strong
northerly winds that always carried in a clean air mass, re-
sulting in pollutants being quickly removed (Fig. 2c). Note
that the PM1 mass concentration decreases somewhat in
the evening during haze episodes, following the short-term
change of WD from southerly to northerly. This is related to
mountain valley breezes in Beijing (Wehner et al., 2008; Gao
et al., 2011; Y. Wang et al., 2017). These results demonstrate
that heavy-haze episodes have a strong correlation with local
wind direction in Beijing.
Figure 2a and d show the time series of ambient RH and
mass concentrations of aerosol chemical species in PM1.
These ﬁgures suggest that the increase in inorganic and or-
ganic aerosols is synchronous with the increase in ambient
RH during the heavy pollution periods (P1–P7). This is likely
because of a positive-feedback mechanism driven by Henry’s
law and thermodynamic equilibrium (Wu et al., 2018). Fig-
ure 2b also shows that ALWC continuously increases during
the pollution accumulation period. On average, ALWC in-
creases from 8 to 89 µg m−3 as ambient RH increases from
15 % to 80 %, and the inorganic and organic aerosol mass
concentrations increase from 15 to 120 µg m−3 and from 12
to 78 µg m−3, respectively. These results imply that the in-
crease in ambient RH and aerosol mass concentration are all
important for the increase in ALWC.
Equation (4) also suggests that the absolute value of
ALWC is dependent on the value of ambient RH and aerosol
chemical composition (i.e., the GF value). To further inves-
tigate the impact of chemical composition on ALWC, the
impact of RH on ALWC should be accounted for. Previous
studies suggest that there is an exponential relationship be-
tween ALWC and RH (e.g., Z. Wu et al., 2018). Here, we
deﬁne the relative ALWC as the ratio of ALWCHTDMA and
the function of ambient RH (ebRH). The b is derived accord-
ing to the relationship between ALWCHTDMA and RH that
is ﬁtted by the function y = aebx. Figure 3a shows the rela-
tionship between relative ALWC and primary aerosol (PA)
or SA mass concentrations. PA consists of primary organic
aerosols (POAs) and black carbon (BC), and SA consists
of SOA, sulfate and nitrate. The positive matrix factoriza-
tion (Paatero and Tapper, 1994) was applied on the organic
aerosol (OA) spectral matrices to identify POA and SOA.
The relative ALWC is highly correlated with SA mass con-
centrations (R2 = 0.94) but poorly correlated with PA mass
concentrations (R2 = 0.69). High relative ALWC coincident
with high SA mass concentrations suggest that SA plays a
key role in the increase in ALWC. This is likely because SA
is mainly generated from photochemical reactions in the day-
time or reactions at night, making SA highly aged with a
hygroscopicity stronger than that of PA (Ervens et al., 2011;
Sareen et al., 2017). SA can, therefore, absorb more water va-
por than PA in the atmosphere. The enhanced aerosol liquid
water induced by SA is further favorable for the formation of
SA by speeding up the atmospheric chemical reaction rate
and serving as the medium for gas-particle heterogeneous
reactions (Wang et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2016). This fur-
ther increases the bulk aerosol hygroscopicity. This is also
the reason why the inferred κ value based on the ZSR model
continuously increases during haze episodes (Fig. 2c).
Secondary aerosols are mainly composed of nitrate, sul-
fate, ammonium and SOA. To determine which species is the
driver for ALWC in Beijing, Fig. 3b shows the correlation
analysis between relative ALWC and the mass concentra-
tions of different aerosol chemical species. Relative ALWC
and all SIA agree well (R2 equals 0.66 for sulfate and 0.56
for nitrate). It has been reported that ALWC is driven by in-
organic salts with both nitrate and sulfate playing key roles
in determining ALWC (Wu et al., 2018). ALWC also agrees
well with SOA (R2 = 0.60) in our study. This is unexpected
because the hygroscopicity of SOA is relatively lower than

that of nitrate and sulfate. Some studies have also suggested
that the water uptake of aged organics accounts for only a
few percent of the total aerosol water uptake (e.g., Gysel et
al., 2007; Engelhart et al., 2011). In our study, the contribu-
tion of ALWCOrg to total ALWC is signiﬁcant, accounting
for 30% ± 22 %. As shown in Fig. 4, the contribution of or-
ganics to total ALWC varies strongly. This is likely related
with the variation in the mass fraction and hygroscopicity
parameter of organics (κorg). The mass concentration of inor-

ganics increases more than that of organics as RH increases,
leading to a lower mass fraction of organics in the case of
high ambient RH. Figure 4 also shows that the ALWCOrg
fraction increases signiﬁcantly with the increase of κorg. All
these help explain a large variation in the ALWCOrg contribu-
tion to total ALWC. Considering the distinct ambient RH and
κorg between clean and polluted periods, we calculated the
respective fraction of ALWCOrg during two periods. There is
a higher ALWCOrg fraction (33% ± 23%) during clean pe-
riods than during polluted periods (26% ± 11%). Yet, there
is little variability of the ALWCOrg fraction during polluted
periods. The larger variability in the ALWCOrg fraction dur-

ing clean periods is likely caused by the highly variable κorg
value when the ambient RH is low. In summary, the contribu-
tion of organics in total ALWC varies with the variations of
the mass fraction of organics and κorg, and this contribution
is signiﬁcant during both clean and polluted periods. Studies
of ALWC in Beijing, therefore, cannot neglect ALWCOrg.
This is different from the studies in other regions such as in
the Po Valley in Italy (Hodas et al., 2014) and the eastern US
(Carlton et al., 2013), where the ALWC was found to be only
driven by nitrate and sulfate, respectively.
An interesting phenomenon is frequently observed at the
initial stage of heavy-haze episodes (e.g., P4, P5, P6 and P7).
ALWCISO is almost close to 0, but both ALWCHTDMA and
ALWCOrg are always larger than 0, and the organic aerosol
mass fraction is high at this stage. These observations reveal
that at the initial stage of heavy-haze episodes, the ALWC is
mostly contributed by organic species. Meanwhile, κ is not
very low and increases markedly as the PM1 mass concentra-
tion increases, which is unexpected because of the lower hy-
groscopicity of organic aerosols compared to SIA. Therefore,
some highly hygroscopic substance (i.e., SA) must be gener-
ated through multiphase chemical reaction at this stage. We
propose that the liquid water contributed by organic species
provides a reactor for the transformation of gaseous precur-
sors to SA at the initial stages of heavy-haze episodes, in-
creasing the uptake of more liquid water by more SA and
further accelerating the formation of heavy haze. Section 4.3
provides a case study to demonstrate this.
4.2.2
Impact of PNSD on ALWC
In addition to aerosol chemical composition, ALWC also de-
pends on PNSD (Bian et al., 2014). PNSD does not inﬂu-
ence ALWC directly, but it is an important factor to deter-
mine the mass concentration and the distribution of hygro-
scopic materials. As described in Sect. 3.1, the nucleation
mode (< 30 nm), the Aitken mode (30–110 nm) and the accu-
mulation mode (110 nm to 1 µm) (Whitby, 1978; Birmili et
al., 2001) are considered in this study. Particles with diam-
eters greater than 1 µm are not considered because although
some particles in the coarse mode are water soluble, their
contribution on the ALWC is low (e.g., Hussein et al., 2004;
Liu et al., 2008; Bian et al., 2014; Tan et al., 2017).
The contributions of nucleation mode, Aitken mode, and
accumulation mode particles to ALWCHTDMA are about
1.0 %, 18.0 % and 82.0 %, respectively. Figure 5 shows the
correlations between ALWCHTDMA and the volume concen-
trations of different mode particles and the average contri-
bution of different mode particles to ALWCHTDMA (fALWC)
under ﬁve different RH conditions. The R2 and fALWC of the
nucleation mode particles (left column in Fig. 5) are all less
than 0.1 % and 1 %, respectively, under all RH conditions.
This is likely because the volume concentration of nucle-
ation mode particles is very low, and most of these small par-
ticles are composed of hydrophobic chemical species such
as BC and POA. Similarly, the number concentration of
Aitken mode particles also shows weak correlations with
ALWCHTDMA (R2 <0.2) under RH < 90 % conditions, but
their correlation (R2 = 0.25) is enhanced signiﬁcantly under
RH > 90 % conditions (middle column of Fig. 5). This is be-
cause there are more aged particles in the Aitken mode which
can absorb much more water when the ambient RH is higher
than 90 %. However, the contribution of the Aitken mode to
ALWC ranges from 14 % to 21 % and decreases as RH in-
creases. ALWCHTDMA is strongly correlated to the volume
concentration of accumulation mode particles, with R2 and
fALWC greater than 0.6 % and 75 %, respectively, under all
RH conditions (right column of Fig. 5). Figure 5 also shows
that ALWC increases slightly as the volume concentration
of accumulation mode particles increases under RH < 70 %
conditions (slope < 0.001), but it increases strongly under
higher RH conditions, especially under RH > 90 % condi-
tions (slope = 0.0041). This is likely because there are more
accumulation mode SAs formed due to multiphase chemical
reactions under conditions of high ambient RH. Swietlicki et
al. (1999) have suggested that the contribution of accumula-
tion mode particles to ALWC is largest for all-mode parti-
cles.
In summary, the contribution of nucleation mode particles
to ALWC is very low. The contribution of Aitken mode par-
ticles is much higher than nucleation mode particles and de-
creases with increasing ambient RH. The contribution of ac-
cumulation mode particles to ALWC is largest under all RH

conditions and increases with increasing ambient RH, thus
playing a key role in determining ALWC.
4.2.3
Impact of RH on ALWC
As discussed in Sect. 4.2.1, the absolute value of ALWC has
an exponential relationship with ambient RH. Figure 6 shows
the relationship between ALWC and RH for different PM1
mass concentration ranges. ALWC increases slowly as RH
increases under conditions of lower ambient RH then sharply
increases when RH exceeds a critical RH value. This criti-
cal RH value is different for different PM1 mass concentra-
tions. This is because the low RH conditions cannot provide
enough water for aerosol particles, even though the PNSD is
dominated by accumulation mode particles with higher hy-
groscopicity (Tan et al., 2017). This demonstrates the impor-
tant inﬂuence of RH on ALWC. The lower critical RH value
for higher PM1 mass concentrations (∼80 %) suggests that
ALWC is easily formed under heavily polluted conditions.
This is likely because there are more SA and accumulation
mode particles during pollution periods (Sun et al., 2016a;
Y. Wang et al., 2017).
Figure 7a shows the diurnal variations of ALWCHTDMA
and ambient RH during the sampling period. The extreme
ALWCHTDMA values appear at night and during the day,
respectively, likely related to the diurnal variations of am-
bient RH. The elevated ambient RH at night not only in-

creases ALWC through water uptake of particles directly but
also facilitates the formation of hydrophilic particulate ni-
trate through the speeding up of the uptake coefﬁcient of
N2O5 (Thornton et al., 2003; Bertram et al., 2009). This
can further enhance ALWC. However, although the diurnal
variations of ALWCHTDMA and ambient RH are similar, the
peak and nadir of ALWCHTDMA (03:00 and 11:00 LT, respec-
tively) appear 3 h earlier than the peak and nadir of ambi-
ent RH (06:00 and 14:00 LT, respectively). This time differ-
ence is likely related to changes in PNSD. The diurnal vari-
ation of PNSD (Fig. 7b) shows that the number concentra-
tions of Aitken and accumulation mode particles begin to de-
crease quickly at 03:00 LT. ALWC also begins to decrease
although the ambient RH increases slightly at that time. In
the morning, ALWC decreases sharply following the ambient
RH and PNSD changes due to the lifting planetary bound-
ary layer height. ALWC decreases to its minimum value at
∼11:00 LT then begins to increase quickly. However, ambi-
ent RH still decreases at that time and reaches its minimum
value at ∼14:00 LT. The increase in ALWC is likely associ-
ated with changes in aerosol chemical species and PNSD.
Figure 7b and c show that there are many newly formed
Aitken and accumulation mode particles and that the fraction
of SA increases at noon, likely because of strong photochem-
ical reactions. Y. Wang et al. (2017, 2018) have suggested
that daytime photochemical reactions are efﬁcient enough to
enhance aerosol hygroscopicity and change the aerosol mix-
ing state from external to internal in northern China through
the formation of hydrophilic chemical species. All this sug-
gests that ambient RH is not the only determining factor for
ALWC. PNSD and aerosol chemical composition are also
important for ALWC.

A case study on the impact of ALWCOrg on
SA formation
As discussed in Sect. 4.2.1, a hypothesis is proposed that
ALWCOrg may provide a reactor for the formation of sec-
ondary species. To verify this hypothesis, the P4 case shown
in Fig. 2 is selected to further analyze the inﬂuence of
ALWCOrg on the formation of secondary aerosols (Fig. 8).
Figure 8a shows the time series of ALWCHTDMA, ALWCISO
and ALWCOrg during this case. On 27 November 2017,
ALWCISO was close to zero all day long because of the low
ambient RH, but both ALWCHTDMA and ALWCOrg were al-
ways larger than 0, increasing with the increasing PM1 mass
concentration (Fig. 8a). Figure 8a also shows that the fraction
of ALWCOrg in ALWCHTDMA was high at the initial stage
of this pollution case, but this fraction decreased as haze
increased. This case was further divided into three periods
(Fig. 8b). Organics were the most abundant chemical species
during the ﬁrst period (64 %), which explains the high frac-
tion of ALWCOrg in ALWCHTDMA at the initial stage of this

haze case. The pie charts in Fig. 8b also show that both SOA
and SIA (sulfate, nitrate and ammonium) increase from the
ﬁrst to third periods, but POA decreases, likely related to
multiphase reactions (i.e., aqueous-phase reactions) due to
the enhanced ALWC. Time series of f44 and the fraction of
sulfate in total sulfur (FSO2−
4 ) are also shown to further il-
lustrate the inﬂuence of aqueous-phase reactions on aerosol
chemical species. The mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) 44 signal
intensity f44 (mostly contributed by the CO+
2 ion) measured
by the AMS can be used as an indicator of the oxidation level
in organic species (Mei et al., 2013). The sulfur oxidation ra-
tio FSO2−
4
(Sun et al., 2006) is deﬁned as
FSO2−
4 =
n[SO2−
4 ]
n[SO2−
4 ] + n[SO2]
,
(10)
where n[SO2−
4 ] and n[SO2] refer to the molar concen-
trations of SO2−
4
and SO2, respectively. Figure 8b sug-
gests that f44 and FSO2−
4
both increase gradually with in-
creasing ALWCHTDMA and PM1 mass concentrations from
27 November to 30 November 2017. This is likely because
the increase in ALWC is beneﬁcial to the oxidation of or-
ganics and the transformation of SO2 to SO2−
4 , implying the
importance of aqueous-phase chemical reactions on haze for-
mation in Beijing. The production of secondary organic and
inorganic species can further enhance aerosol hygroscopicity,
increasing ALWC in the atmosphere. This positive feedback
is the reason behind the rapid formation of heavy-haze events
in Beijing (Wang et al., 2016). A rapid increase in f44 and
FSO2−
4 was seen during the ﬁrst period at night on 27 Novem-
ber (shown by green and red arrows in Fig. 8) when organics
contributed the most to ALWC. This suggests that ALWC
contributed by organics may have played an important role
in the formation of secondary species at the initial stage of
the pollution event.

Conclusions
In this study, the aerosol liquid water content was calculated
using the size-resolved aerosol hygroscopic growth factor
and the particle number size distribution measured at a Bei-
jing urban site during the APHH winter campaign (8 Novem-
ber to 15 December 2017). Also done were simulations us-
ing the ISORROPIA II model with measured aerosol chem-
ical composition data as input data. During the sampling pe-
riod, seven heavy-haze episodes were selected to investigate
the inﬂuence of different factors (PNSD, ambient RH and
aerosol chemical composition) on ALWC.
The calculated and simulated ALWC (ALWCHTDMA and
ALWCISO) agree well (correlation of determination R2
equals 0.89). However, ALWCISO is much lower than
ALWCHTDMA for RH below 60 %, even approaching zero
many times. This deviation is in part attributed to the ne-
glect of the contribution of organics to ALWC (ALWCOrg)

in the ISORROPIA II model, contradicting previous studies
which ignored this contribution. The aerosol hygroscopicity
of organics was also derived in this study for use in calcu-
lating ALWCOrg. The sum of ALWCISO and ALWCOrg has
a higher correlation (R2 = 0.92) with the calculated ALWC
(i.e., ALWCHTDMA), especially for RH below 60 %. This im-
plies that organic aerosols are also an important contributor
to ALWC.
PNSD, ambient RH and aerosol chemical composition are
all found to affect ALWC signiﬁcantly. Nucleation mode and
Aitken mode particles have little inﬂuence on ALWC. Ac-
cumulation mode particles play a key role in determining
ALWC and dominate among all aerosol modes. ALWC is
highly related to the relative humidity when RH exceeds a
critical RH value that is different for different PM1 mass con-
centrations. ALWC varies diurnally with its extreme values
appearing at night and during the day, respectively. The diur-
nal variation of ambient RH explains this. However, there is
a 3 h difference between when the extreme ALWC and RH
values occur, caused by the diurnal variations in PNSD and
aerosol chemical composition.
On average, ALWCOrg accounts for ∼30% ± 22% of
the total aerosol liquid water during the sampling period.
This shows the signiﬁcant contribution of organic species to
ALWC. Our results suggest that ALWC is driven not only by
inorganic salts but also by organics in Beijing. This is differ-
ent from the results obtained in the Po Valley in Italy (Hodas
et al., 2014) and the eastern US (Carlton et al., 2013), where
the ALWC is driven by nitrate and sulfate, respectively. Fi-
