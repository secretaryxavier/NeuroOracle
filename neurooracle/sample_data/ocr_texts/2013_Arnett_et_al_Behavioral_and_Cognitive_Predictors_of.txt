Abstract
Research reveals mixed results regarding the utility of standardized cognitive and academic tests
to predict educational outcomes in youth following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Yet, deficits in
everyday school-based outcomes are prevalent after pediatric TBI. The current study used path
modeling to test the hypothesis that parent ratings of adolescents’ daily behaviors associated with
executive functioning (EF) would predict long-term functional educational outcomes following
pediatric TBI, even when injury severity and patient demographics were included in the model.
Furthermore, we contrasted the predictive strength of the EF behavioral ratings with that of a
common measure of verbal memory. A total of 132 adolescents who were hospitalized for
moderate to severe TBI were recruited to participate in a randomized clinical intervention trial. EF
ratings and verbal memory were measured within 6 months of the injury; functional educational
outcomes were measured 12 months later. EF ratings and verbal memory added to injury severity
in predicting educational competence post injury but did not predict post-injury initiation of
special education. The results demonstrated that measurement of EF behaviors is an important
research and clinical tool for prediction of functional outcomes in pediatric TBI.

INTRODUCTION
Moderate to severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in childhood increases risk for a wide
variety of neuropsychological difficulties, which can persist for years post injury (Anderson,
Catroppa, Morse, Haritou, & Rosenfeld, 2000; Babikian & Asarnow, 2009; Horneman &
Emanuelson, 2009; Kinsella et al., 1997; Miller & Donders, 2003). Whether academic
deficits as measured by individual achievement tests are apparent after pediatric TBI is less
clear, as some studies have found persistent difficulties, while others have demonstrated few
or no lasting effects (Ewing-Cobbs, Fletcher, Levin, Iovino, & Miner, 1998; Ewing-Cobbs et
al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2008).
Regardless of performance on standardized academic and neuropsychological tests,
everyday school-based outcomes are generally poor after pediatric TBI. Children with TBI
tend to earn worse grades, show higher rates of grade retention, and receive more special
education services than non-injured peers (Donders, 1994; Ewing-Cobbs et al., 1998;
Kinsella et al., 1997; Perrott, Taylor, & Montes, 1991). Educational outcome is of
significant concern to families and patients with pediatric TBI and is often identified in
clinical settings as a primary contributor to parental stress and family burden (Savage,
DePompei, Tyler, & Lash, 2005). Literature on adult TBI outcomes mirrors these findings
with reduced occupational success following moderate to severe TBI (Muscara, Catroppa, &
Anderson, 2008; Ryu, Cullen, & Bayley, 2010).
Relatively little research has investigated predictors of functional educational outcomes after
pediatric TBI. Persistence of cognitive and academic skills deficits is related to injury
severity as well as to family demographics, age at injury, and the child’s premorbid
developmental and academic levels (Ewing-Cobbs et al., 2004; Taylor et al., 2002).
However, the existing literature is mixed regarding the utility of general cognitive,
neuropsychological, and academic achievement testing to predict classroom outcomes above
and beyond the effect of injury severity (Ewing-Cobbs et al., 2004; Kinsella et al., 1997;
Miller & Donders, 2003; Schwartz et al., 2003). Most consistently, verbal list learning tests
predict variance in educational outcomes beyond that accounted for by injury severity and
cognitive and neuropsychological testing (Kinsella et al., 1997; Miller & Donders, 2003). In
contrast, these studies found that individual neuropsychological constructs, such as
processing speed and IQ, were not predictive of educational outcomes when verbal learning
and injury severity were included in their models.
Behaviors that are frequently classified as executive functions (EF), including attentional
control, inhibition, organization, planning, and self-monitoring, impact functional outcomes
in other pediatric populations, such as children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD) (Biederman et al., 2004). The prevalence of EF deficits following pediatric TBI is
well documented (Dennis, Guger, Roncadin, Barnes, & Schachar, 2001; Levin & Hanten,
Arnett et al.

2005) and suggests that these impairments may be useful predictors of functional
educational outcomes in pediatric TBI. However, we are not aware of studies that have
focused specifically on the utility of EF measures in predicting long-term educational
outcomes in this population.
Observations of problems in EF in daily life have commonly been measured using the
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Functions (BRIEF; Gioia, Isquith, Guy, &
Kenworthy, 2000). Research on parent- and teacher-reports of daily behaviors typically
associated with EF (e.g., organization, attention, emotion-regulation) has revealed only
modest to nonexistent concurrent associations between these behaviorally based measures
and scores on performance-based tests of EF administered in a laboratory setting (Toplak,
West, & Stanovich, 2013). Yet, scores on the BRIEF have been linked to children’s adaptive
functioning, social competency, and social-emotional adjustment after TBI, as well as
family outcomes 5 years post injury, independent of injury severity (Ganesalingam et al.,
2011; Mangeot, Armstrong, Colvin, Yeates, & Taylor, 2002). Reduced integrity of the
uncinate fasciulus, a brain area implicated in emotional and behavioral regulation, has also
been associated with impaired scores on the parent-report BRIEF after pediatric TBI
(Johnson et al., 2011). Furthermore, Rassovsky and colleagues (2006) found that, in adults,
examiner- and self-reports of problems in EF were significant predictors of employability
and functional independence. Less research has been done on the external validity of the
adolescent self-report version of the BRIEF (BRIEF Self-Report) in neuropsychological
populations. However, a study by Mahone, Zabel, Levey, Verda, and Kinsman (2002) found
that adolescents with myelomengingocele and hydrocephalus were more likely to rate
themselves as impaired on the BRIEF Self-Report Behavior Regulation Index than on
another common self-report questionnaire, the Behavior Assessment System for Children
(BASC; Reynolds & Kamphaus, 1998).
Taken together, the extant research suggests that behaviors measured by the BRIEF explain
significant variance in functional outcomes following TBI in adults, and that the BRIEF is
more sensitive to social emotional outcomes than are performance-based tests of EF in the
pediatric TBI population. The current study aims to extend these findings by examining the
BRIEF in relation to educational outcomes following pediatric TBI.
The primary goal of the current study was to determine if parent- and self-ratings of EF on
the BRIEF were related to educational outcomes in adolescents who had sustained a TBI.
We hypothesized that problems in EF as evident on the BRIEF would affect educational
success in the classroom setting 12 months later. We used path modeling to test our
hypothesis that scores on the BRIEF at the initial assessment would contribute unique
predictive variance for educational outcomes 12 months later, even when injury severity,
family demographics, and cognitive functioning were included in the model. Furthermore,
based on previously published small effects of neuropsychological test performance on later
educational outcomes, we predicted that both parent- and self-ratings on the BRIEF would
be more closely related to educational outcomes than would performance on memory
testing. We included socioeconomic status (SES) and treatment variables in our model as
well, to account for the potential effects of family resources and clinical intervention on
outcomes of pediatric TBI.

METHODS
Overview
The current study is part of a larger randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy of two
Internet-based interventions: (1) Counselor Assisted Problem Solving (CAPS), a 6-month,
Web-based, family-centered intervention that focuses on problem solving, communication,
and self-regulation, and (2) an Internet resource comparison (IRC) group. Half of the sample
was randomly assigned to each group. While not the focus of the current study, group
assignment was included in the models to account for the possible influence of intervention
on educational outcomes. The parent study was conducted at five major trauma centers and
included an initial assessment as well as three follow-up assessments within 24 months of
the injury.
Participants
One hundred thirty-two adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old who were hospitalized for a
complicated mild to severe TBI and their families were recruited. Eligible participants
displayed an alteration of neurological functioning as measured by a Glasgow Coma Scale
(GCS) score less than 13 or evidence of neurological insult as seen on computerized
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Exclusion criteria included non-blunt trauma
(e.g., penetrating head injury), primary language other than English, history of intellectual
disability before injury, history of child abuse as documented in the medical record or
reported by parents, insufficient recovery to allow participation in the study, and history of
participant or parental psychiatric hospitalization within 1 year previous to enrollment. A
total of 308 families were initially identified for participation. Of these, 52 were found to be
ineligible, 52 refused participation, 5 could not be contacted, and 67 were unable to be
recruited within 6 months post-injury. Relative to the final group of 132 participants, non-
participants had less severe injuries on average and were more likely to be non-Caucasian;
age at injury did not differ.
The final group of participants included 65% males and 23% non-Caucasians. The mean age
of injury was 14.54 years (SD = 1.74) and mean time since injury at the initial follow-up was
3.56 months (SD = 1.74). GCS scores were recorded in the medical records for 125 of the
132 participating adolescents. Fifty participants had severe TBI (GCS score 3–8), 21 had
moderate TBI (GCS score 9–12), and 54 had complicated mild TBI (GCS score 13–15 with
evidence of neurological abnormality on CT or MRI). Following previous research
(Schwartz et al., 2003; Taylor et al., 2002), we grouped individuals with moderate and
complicated mild injuries together into a single Moderate group. The 7 participants without
a documented GCS score were assigned to the severe TBI group if the medical record
indicated that the child was verbally unresponsive with no spontaneous eye opening or
purposeful movement, and to the moderate TBI group if there was an indication of impaired
consciousness or abnormal imaging findings, but the child did not meet criteria for severe
TBI. Severe and Moderate TBI groups did not differ on age, gender, time since injury, or
proportion non-Caucasian (see Table 1).

SES for the participating adolescents was collected via self-report by the primary caregiver
as well as census tract information, and included level of education of the primary caregiver,
median income and percent poverty level for the family’s residence based on census data,
and the financial stress composite score from the Life Stressors and Social Resources
Inventory – Adult Version (Moos & Moos, 1994). An SES factor score was derived using
maximum likelihood extraction without rotation in Mplus 6.0. The two injury severity
groups did not differ significantly on SES.
Procedure
Participants were recruited following guidelines and procedures approved by the
institutional review boards at participating institutions. Families were approached either in
person at the hospital where the adolescent was being treated, or by phone within 6 months
of the injury, and informed about the study and eligibility requirements. Interested families
were sent additional packets of information by mail and contacted by phone to schedule an
initial assessment. Families were contacted by phone to schedule follow-up assessments
approximately 6, 12, and 18 months after the initial assessment. All assessments took place
in the family’s homes after families gave their informed consent and with adolescent assent.
At the initial assessment, adolescents completed cognitive testing, structured interviews, and
self-report questionnaires. The primary caregiver (and when possible both parents) also
completed child- and self-report questionnaires, as well as structured interviews. Follow-up
assessments included parent- and child-reports of child and family functioning, as well as
parent-interview. The initial assessment took approximately 2.5 hr, and follow-up
assessments took approximately 1.5 hr. Only data from the initial assessment and 6- and 12-
month follow-ups were available for the current study.
Measures
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)—The Parent-Report and
Self-Report versions of the BRIEF (Gioia et al., 2000) were completed at the initial
assessment (i.e., before assignment to treatment groups). The parent report was completed
by the primary caregiver and in some cases, by both parents. When both parents completed
the assessment, the mean of the two scores was used. The BRIEF contains 86 items
comprising eight clinical subscales that contribute to a Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI)
and a Metacognition Index (MI). These two indices combine to form the Global Executive
Composite (GEC) score. All scores were T-scores with mean = 50, standard deviation = 10,
and were multiplied by −1 so that higher scores would reflect better EF. Sixty-seven BRIEF
T-scores were the mean of the T-scores obtained from both parents, 63 were based on
ratings from a single parent (59 mothers and 4 fathers), and two participants were missing
Parent-Report BRIEF data at the initial assessment. A total of 129 Self-Report BRIEF
measures were completed at the initial assessment. Parent- and Self-report GEC scores were
moderately correlated (r = .5). When both of these predictors were included simultaneously
in the model, the predictive power of each was reduced, suggesting enough overlap to
consider them redundant. Furthermore, the overall results did not change. Thus, the models
are presented with these two measures analyzed independently.

Verbal memory—At the initial assessment, verbal learning and memory were assessed
using the age-appropriate version of the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT; Delis,
Kramer, Kaplan, & Ober, 1994, 2000), a verbal list-learning procedure. The T-score total
learning across the five learning trials was used in analyses.
Educational outcomes—Educational outcomes at the 12-month follow-up were assessed
using the School Competency subscale of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL; Achenbach,
2001), a parent-report measure of broad behavioral and social-emotional functioning. The
School Competency scale is a composite measuring attained grades in individual academic
subjects, use of special education, and educational promotion. As an alternative measure of
educational outcomes at the 12-month follow-up, parents reported on whether the adolescent
was receiving any special education services at the 12-month follow-up, and whether formal
special education services had been in place before the injury. Due to the overlap between
this and the CBCL School Competence scale, we chose to analyze these outcomes
separately. Adolescents receiving special education who had not received it before injury
were coded as 1; adolescents not receiving special education at the 12-month follow-up, or
those who were already receiving it before the injury, were coded as 0. Formal special
education services were in place for 21 participants before the injury, and 26 different
adolescents were receiving post-injury initiated services at the 12-month follow-up. Given
the high number of premorbid special education users, the established comorbidity between
pediatric TBI and premorbid attention and learning problems, and the potentially worse
effects TBI could have on children with special needs because of their presumed lower
cognitive and/or brain reserve (Goldstrohm & Arffa, 2005; Yeates et al., 2005), participants
who had formal special education services before the injury were not excluded from the
study.
Analysis
Data cleaning and preliminary analyses were done using SPSS 18.0. Path analyses were
conducted using Mplus 6.0. All models included the GCS score, SES, treatment group
(CAPS vs. IRC), and the CVLT as predictors. Multiple models were examined, with each
combination of BRIEF composite (GEC, MI, BRI) and version (Parent- and Self-Report)
considered individually. Additionally, two independent educational outcomes were tested:
the CBCL School Competency subscale and post-injury initiated use of special education at
the 12-month follow-up (yes/no).
Goodness-of-fit of the path models was assessed using the χ2 exact test; models with non-
significant χ2 values (p > .05) were considered to fit the data well (Barrett, 2007).
Additionally, following previously published research, the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) and
Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) were reported as approximations of
fit. In general, values of CFI > .9, and RMSEA < .05 are considered to approximate an
excellent fit. The χ2 difference testing was used to compare model fits when constraints
were placed on path weights (e.g., constraining a path to equal 0, or constraining two paths
to equal one another). Significantly different χ2 values indicated a worse fit for the
constrained model. In contrast, if the constrained and free models fit the data equally well,
the constrained path coefficients were considered to be comparable (Kline, 2005). As the

special education outcome was a dichotomous variable, these models were calculated in
Mplus 6.0 using logistic regression. Standardized path coefficients predicting this outcome
variable are imprecise and thus cannot be compared to one another directly. Rather,
following guidelines set forth by the authors of Mplus, interpretation of these path
coefficients was limited to their sign and statistical significance (Methuen & Methuen,
1998–2004).
RESULTS
Preliminary Analysis
All data were initially inspected for outliers and normal distributions. Outliers were
Winsorized to three standard deviations from the mean. Final skew and kurtosis values were
within the acceptable range, with absolute values less than 2. Mplus 6.0 uses full
information maximum likelihood (FIML) to account for missing data. At each time point,
the number of participants with any missing data (due to attrition or incomplete collection)
on one or more variables was: Initial assessment = 12; 12-month follow-up = 44. Attrition
accounted for 21 of the missing data points at the 12-month follow-up. Participants with
missing data at any time point were older and had a lower SES, on average, than participants
with complete data. There were no differences in GCS score between participants with any
missing data and those with complete data.
Participants in the Moderate versus Severe groups did not differ on primary caregiver
education, percent poverty level, median income of their zip code, or age at injury.
Preliminary analyses revealed that the Severe TBI group had significantly lower scores on
the CVLT at the initial assessment and higher rates of special education at the 12-month
follow-up than the Moderate TBI group (Table 1).
Path Models
CBCL School Competence outcome—The first model included the BRIEF Parent-
Report GEC from the initial assessment as a predictor, and the CBCL School Competence
scale as the 12-month follow-up outcome. The model had an excellent fit: χ2(2) = 1.086, p
= .581, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.00. CBCL School Competence was predicted by the BRIEF
Parent-Report GEC (B = .31; SE = .08; p < .001) and family SES (B = 2.60; SE = .80; p = .
001), but not by injury severity (B = .05; SE = .18; p = .797), CVLT (B = .11; SE = .07; p = .
111), or study group (B = −2.84; SE = 1.5; p = .066). See Figure 1. The model was re-run
using the BRI and MI composites of the BRIEF Parent-Report, with similar results, so the
GEC was used in subsequent analyses. To test the hypothesis that behavioral assessment of
EF, as measured here by the BRIEF Parent-Report GEC, would be more predictive of CBCL
School Competence than verbal memory, as assessed by the CVLT, we constrained the
standardized coefficients of those two paths to be equal. With the paths constrained, the χ2
was not significantly different (χ2(3) = 3.200; p = .362, CFI = .996; RMSEA = .022; Δχ2(1)
= 2.114; p = .146), indicating that the path coefficients from the BRIEF Parent-Report GEC
and from the CVLT to the CBCL School Competence outcome were not significantly
different, with a shared standardized β = 0.25.

Next, we ran the model using the BRIEF self-report GEC. This model also had an excellent
fit: χ2(2) = 0.747, p = .688, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.00. CBCL School Competence was
significantly predicted by the BRIEF Self-Report GEC (B = .25; SE = .064; p < .001) and
the CVLT (B = .18; SE = .066; p = .006; Figure 2). Again, results were comparable when
the BRIEF Self-Report MI and BRI scales were used in place of the GEC. When
standardized coefficients of the paths from the BRIEF Self-Report GEC and CVLT to the
CBCL School Competence were constrained to be equal, the fit was significantly worse
(χ2(3) = 18.471; p = .001; CFI = .695; RMSEA = .166; Dχ2(1) = 17.724; p < .001),
indicating that the standardized path coefficient from the BRIEF Self-Report GEC to CBCL
School Competence was significantly stronger than that from the CVLT.
Special education outcome—The next model was tested using post-injury initiation of
special education services as the 12-month follow-up educational outcome and the BRIEF
Parent-Report GEC as a predictor. Again, the data fit the model well (χ2(4) = 2.488; p = .
647; CFI = 1.00; RMSEA = 0.00). However, only injury severity was a significant predictor
of special education, with lower GCS score predicting use of special education services at
the 12-month follow-up (B = −.12; SE = .020; p < .001; Figure 3). There was a trend toward
lower CVLT scores predicting use of special education (B = −.019; SE = .01; p = .065).
When the BRIEF BRI and MI composites were modeled separately, results were comparable
and neither score was a significant predictor of special education outcomes.
The special education model was re-run using the BRIEF Self-Report as a predictor. This
model had an excellent fit: χ2(4) = 2.314, p = .678, CFI = 1.00, RMSEA = 0.00. Lower GCS
scores again predicted post-injury initiation of special education at the 12-month follow-up
(B = −.120; SE = .019; p < .001; Figure 4). In this model, the association between lower
CVLT scores and special education reached significance (B = −.021; SE = .01; p = .039).
Similar results were obtained using the BRIEF Self-Report MI and BRI scales.
Path coefficients predicting special education were calculated using logistic regression, due
to the fact that this variable is binomial. Thus, the magnitude of the standardized path
coefficients need to be interpreted with caution (Figures 3 and 4; Methuen & Methuen,
1998–2004) and the standardized paths from the BRIEF and the CVLT to this outcome
could not be compared directly.
DISCUSSION
The goal of the current study was to examine early predictors of functional educational
outcomes in adolescents after TBI. Previous research has highlighted a discrepancy between
children’s performance on laboratory cognitive and academic achievement tests and their
success in the school setting post-TBI. As hypothesized, the BRIEF contributed unique
variance to the prediction of CBCL School Competence outcomes, even with injury
severity, SES, and the CVLT in the model. Contrary to our hypothesis, the BRIEF did not
predict use of special education services when these other constructs were included in the
model.

We also tested the hypothesis that the BRIEF would predict educational outcomes more
strongly than the CVLT. When standardized path coefficients were compared, only the self-
report version of the BRIEF was significantly more predictive of CBCL School Competence
than the CVLT. Furthermore, only the CVLT was a significant predictor of post-injury
initiation of special education. Thus, both the BRIEF and the CVLT remained important
predictors of educational outcomes, even after accounting for injury severity and
demographic variables in the models.
In our sample, the parent and adolescent reports on the BRIEF were moderately correlated (r
= .50), and the models were generally consistent across raters. However, the path coefficient
from the CVLT to educational outcome varied slightly, depending on the BRIEF report that
was used. This appeared to relate to the fact that in these models, the Parent-Report BRIEF
was significantly associated with our objective measure of cognitive functioning, the CVLT,
while the Self-Report BRIEF was not. This suggests that parent reports of the adolescent’s
EF behaviors may be more objective in nature than an adolescent’s self-report. The finding
underscores the importance of a comprehensive, multi-rater, and multi-domain evaluation of
adolescents following TBI.
Injury severity as measured by the GCS score did not predict scores on the BRIEF at the
initial assessment. Because both the moderate and severe TBI groups had worse BRIEF
Parent-Report and Self-Report GEC scores at the initial assessment compared to the
norming population, a stronger association between injury severity and BRIEF scores may
have resulted had we included a non-TBI comparison group. However, the GCS score
predicted both post-injury initiation of special education and performance on the CVLT; and
the CVLT was in turn related to both educational outcomes. This finding suggests that
adolescents with more severe TBI are more likely to be identified for special education
services after injury and that possibly, difficulties with EF in the classroom setting are
interpreted by school personnel as indications of poor self-regulation, rather than of
cognitive issues that might warrant special education services.
Higher SES predicted better CBCL School Competence ratings, but not use of post-injury
initiated special education. The mechanism underlying the association between higher SES
and School Competence is unknown, but may either reflect premorbid factors (such as
parental IQ or school resources) or a greater access by higher SES families to rehabilitation
services. The lack of association between SES and post-injury initiation of special education
indicates that the greater resources potentially available to higher SES families did not entail
more access to school-based special education programs; rather, higher SES families may be
more likely to hire private tutors than to access services through the school.
Although the goals of the parent study were largely geared toward improving social-
emotional functioning in the teens and their families, we included the CAPS intervention in
the model under the expectation that it might be associated with both school achievement
and receipt of special education supports. The results demonstrated that this was not the case
when demographic, cognitive, and EF variables were included in the model. Previous
research suggests that older subjects in this study sample benefited more from the CAPS

intervention than did younger adolescents (Wade et al., 2013). Thus, we might have seen a
significant treatment effect had we split the group into age cohorts.
Limitations of this study include the fact that teacher-ratings on the CBCL School
Competence scale were not collected as part of this study, and would have offered increased
objectivity. Future research would benefit from the use of additional, independent measures
of predictor and outcome variables. Outcomes, for example, might beneficially include more
objective measures of educational performance such as grade point averages, in-class
behaviors, homework completion rates, and teacher ratings of academic success. Measures
of pre-injury cognitive and academic functioning, such as those based on academic
transcripts and teacher interviews, would also allow for a more objective evaluation of
premorbid factors contributing to post-injury academic functioning. Additionally, the current
study would have benefited from a better understanding of the specific special education
services provided to participants, both before and following injury. Finally, despite the large
size, the sample in the current study is relatively homogeneous ethnically and culturally.
Specifically, participants in this study were mostly Caucasian. Future research should aim to
test these models in minority populations to determine whether the findings generalize to
more ethnically diverse samples.
Age and developmental level at the time of injury are known to interact with injury severity
and injury location to produce varying cognitive and educational outcomes (Taylor & Alden,
1997). Additionally, as children get older, the expectations for independent completion of
work increase, placing greater demands on EF processes. Thus, an extension of the current
research would be to test compare these models across younger children versus older
adolescents. The relation of deficits in EF skills to subsequent learning may vary with age
and other cognitive processes (e.g., memory and language), thus these processes may need
to be taken into account as additional predictors of academic outcomes.
The neuroanatomical location of the injury may also be an important predictor of
educational outcomes. For example, as described in the introduction, the uncinate fasciculus
has been found to be sensitive to behaviors measured by the BRIEF. Thus, there is potential
for a predictive effect of injury location as well as injury severity. Taken one step further,
there may be an interaction between the child’s developmental level and injury location that
uniquely predicts behavioral and cognitive outcomes. Research with larger sample sizes is
needed to characterize these more complex associations of age and injury characteristics
with educational outcomes.
The current results support the continued use of both the BRIEF and CVLT as measures of
functioning in pediatric TBI in both research and clinical settings. The association of daily
EF behaviors and verbal memory skills with educational outcomes also suggests a need to
focus on interventions to improve these abilities and to encourage use of compensatory
strategies and accommodations for such deficits. Adolescents who are struggling
academically might benefit, for example, from tutoring and psychotherapy to support
improved memory, organization, planning, and monitoring skills. Adolescents receiving
psychotherapeutic interventions following TBI have shown improvement on BRIEF GEC
scores post-treatment, suggesting that these skills can be improved in this age group (Wade

et al., 2010). Additionally, interventions designed for children with ADHD may be
appropriate, and typically include implementation of recipe-like approaches to tasks;
increased structure and continuity across the home and school environments; and teaching
specific strategies for organization of written composition and mathematical computation.
As described earlier, the BRIEF also captures emotional regulation and self-control. While
the intervention conducted within the parent project for this study was not related to
educational outcomes, our results suggest that improved self-monitoring, emotional control
and other metacognitive skills may support academic performance in the classroom.
CONCLUSIONS
The current study highlights the impact of behavior ratings of impaired EF and verbal
memory deficits on educational outcomes following pediatric TBI. Behavior ratings of EF
appear to be a critical, unique predictor of educational outcomes in adolescents who have
suffered a TBI, and thus warrant a closer look by researchers and rehabilitation clinicians.
