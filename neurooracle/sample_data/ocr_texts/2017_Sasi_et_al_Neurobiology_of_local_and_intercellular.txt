Abstract Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a
member of the neurotrophin family of secreted proteins.
Signaling cascades induced by BDNF and its receptor, the
receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB, link neuronal growth and dif-
ferentiation with synaptic plasticity. For this reason, interfer-
ence with BDNF signaling has emerged as a promising strat-
egy for potential treatments in psychiatric and neurological
disorders. In many brain circuits, synaptically released
BDNF is essential for structural and functional long-term po-
tentiation, two prototypical cellular models of learning and
memory formation. Recent studies have revealed an unexpect-
ed complexity in the synaptic communication of mature
BDNF and its precursor proBDNF, not only between local
pre- and postsynaptic neuronal targets but also with participa-
tion of glial cells. Here, we consider recent findings on local
actions of the BDNF family of ligands at the synapse and
discuss converging lines of evidence which emerge from per
se conflicting results.

Introduction
On a neurobiological level, learning and memory depend on
regulated signaling processes at synapses and involve the pre-
cise synaptic communication between neurons and other cel-
lular partners. The neurotrophin brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF) [15, 151] and its signaling partners [21, 30,
110, 126] have emerged as key regulators of synaptic plastic-
ity, a biological process describing the regulation of synaptic
strength by neuronal activity. Many neuromodulatory factors
affect neuronal plasticity, but in contrast to many other factors
involved in synapse function, BDNF may serve as a real me-
diator rather than simply a modulator of synaptic plasticity
and synaptic communication [126] (Fig. 1a). Furthermore,
BDNF and neurotransmitter signaling cascades can act togeth-
er in a close temporal association to show immediate and
instructive functions on synaptic plasticity (Fig. 1b).
Therefore, much attention has been given to BDNF because
specific interference with BDNF-related signaling is regarded
as a leading strategy to stimulate neuronal and synaptic plas-
ticity for potential protective and functionally restorative treat-
ments for neurological and psychiatric disorders [97, 116,
152]. This review focuses on recent findings on the neurobi-
ology of BDNF and how it acts in synaptic signaling. We
conclude with some brief comments on how fundamental re-
search on BDNF signaling can contribute to a better under-
standing of dysfunctional synaptic plasticity or disadvanta-
geous synaptic learning in neuropsychiatric diseases.
Neurobiology of BDNF
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) belongs to the pro-
tein family of neurotrophins, of which other members are the
homologs nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin 3 (NT-3),

and NT-4 [90, 151]. BDNF is the predominant member of the
neurotrophin family in the adult brain. Initially, BDNF was
purified from pig brain tissue and was found to support sur-
vival and differentiation of sensory neurons [15]. Disruption
of the Bdnf gene in mice causes the loss of certain types of
neurons in the periphery but does not result in dramatic chang-
es in the central nervous system (CNS) [48, 151]. These early
experiments already indicated that the fundamental functions
of BDNF and its receptor TrkB can differ widely between the
peripheral and the central nervous system.
Human, rat, and mouse BDNF are expressed from a single
gene locus, and Bdnf gene transcription is tightly regulated,
cell-type specific, and controlled by neural activity. The struc-
ture of the Bdnf gene is highly conserved throughout mam-
mals, indicating that there is a strong pressure on the conser-
vation of the regulatory non-coding elements. The mouse and
rat Bdnf genes consist of eight 5′-untranslated exons and one
protein coding 3′-exon [3]. In humans, a latest evaluation
found bidirectional transcription of the BDNF gene and total
number of nine BDNF 5′ UTR promoters (termed I–IX.
Please note that the present BDNF promoter nomenclature
was claimed in 2007 [132]). A recently introduced genome
editing approach combines an inactive Cas9 with a methyla-
tion or demethylation activity to specifically alter the methyl-
ation pattern of a gene, thus allowing research on causal rela-
tionships between changes in methylation and gene function
[95]. Notably, targeted demethylation of the Bdnf promoter IV
in post-mitotic neurons was sufficient to activate BDNF ex-
pression. This indicates that active, signaling-driven demeth-
ylation of a specific Bdnf promoter site contributes to activity-
dependent BDNF activation [95]. The complex structure and
regulation of Bdnf gene activity offers a broad susceptibility
for regulated epigenetic control of Bdnf expression [28]. One
can expect that activity-dependent and cell-type specific epi-
genetic regulation of the BDNF gene will become an influen-
tial topic in gene-environment interaction research (G × E) in
humans.
Removal of BDNF from all neurons markedly reduces
BDNF levels in the brain [136]. However, even after global
neuronal deprivation of BDNF, some BDNF is still found in
cortical tissues [136]. In line with this, microglial cells have
been found to be another physiological source of BDNF [128,
154]. Microglial BDNF supports learning-dependent spine
formation in the motor cortex, and BDNF removal from mi-
croglia reduces the performance in some motor learning tasks
and other learning paradigms [128].
Currently, we do not know much about BDNF protein
sources in humans. For instance, human platelets carry high
amounts of BDNF, while mouse platelets lack BDNF. Human
serum also contains a substantial amount of BDNF, while it is
barely detectable (if not absent) in mouse serum. BDNF is
undetectable in mouse megakaryocytes but highly expressed
and stored in human megakaryocytes [29]. This suggests that
alterations of BDNF levels in human serum, as reported in
studies dealing with psychiatric diseases, might reflect chang-
es occurring in megakaryocytes and platelets [29]. These data
remind us that it is important to understand whether and how
BDNF sources from outside the brain contribute to diverse
bodily functions and brain plasticity.
In the peripheral nervous system, BDNF has the ability to
prevent regulated cell death [14, 146]. In the brain, BDNF is
not primarily acting as a survival factor but rather mediates
region-specific effects on synaptic function and neuronal mor-
phology [94, 120, 136]. For instance, loss of striatal BDNF
Fig. 1 Overview of BDNF signaling. A major source of BDNF in the
brain is the excitatory glutamatergic synapse, a principle synapse of
synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. During plasticity-inducing neu-
ronal activity, BDNF and glutamate are released at synapses. a BDNF
secretion occurs at a slower timescale than glutamate release. BDNF
binds to its receptor TrkB to activate modulatory signaling cascades
(see Fig. 3). In presynapses, BDNF-TrkB signaling enhances neurotrans-
mitter release. On postsynaptic sides, BDNF/TrkB signaling increases the
function or open probability of ionotropic glutamate receptors.
Furthermore, it modulates signaling cascades downstream of neuronal
excitation. BDNF as a mediator (according to Park and Poo [126]) can
directly influence late effects in synaptic plasticity, for instance, local
protein synthesis, spine remodeling, or gene transcription. b BDNF as

signaling causes a spinal atrophy caused by defects in the
dendritic complexity of GABAergic striatal medium spiny
neurons [94, 136]. GABAergic striatal neurons do not produce
BDNF but get significant amounts of axonal BDNF from
presynapses of corticostriatal projections [4, 127]. The specif-
ic depletion of BDNF from corresponding axonal projections
abolishes LTP at corticostriatal synapses [127]. In
Huntington’s disease, an autosomal dominant neurodegenera-
tive disorder, disturbed anterograde axonal transport of BDNF
to the striatum causes reduced cortical supply of BDNF which
is thought to be responsible for striatal degeneration [52].
However, in a Huntington’s disease model, defects in
corticostriatal plasticity are caused by reduced engagement
of the postsynaptic BDNF receptor TrkB. This suggests that
defects in synaptic plasticity do not depend on cortical deliv-
ery of BDNF on striatal spiny projection neurons, at least early
in Huntington’s disease [131]. It has recently been shown in
another disease model that reducing mutant Huntingtin levels
is sufficient to improve the supply of cortical BDNF on striatal
neurons and to rescue the trophic defects [173]. These data
might point to a relevant role of TrkB transactivation in striatal
neurons, in which dopamine D1 receptor and BDNF/TrkB
signaling are intertwined to modulate BDNF responsiveness
[67]. This is in accordance with a cell-autonomous role of
TrkB in striatal neurons [94].
High levels of BDNF messenger RNA (mRNA) and pro-
tein are found in the hippocampus [37, 136], a brain region of
importance in contextual and spatial learning and explicit
memory. In the hippocampus, neuronal anatomy of gluta-
matergic neurons shows only minor changes when BDNF is
removed either from all cells [76] or selectively from all neu-
rons [136]. However, this does not exclude the possibility that
less abundant cell types, such as certain types of GABAergic
neurons, are under developmental control of BDNF. In sum-
mary, these data show that axonal BDNF can dramatically
influence the neuronal complexity of some specific types of
neurons, but not all types of neurons.
Family of bioactive BDNF ligands
New data revealed that three functionally different proteins
originate from the Bdnf gene, namely the precursor
proBDNF, mature BDNF, commonly termed as BDNF, and
even the prodomain of BDNF [62]. The neurobiology of all
three BDNF ligands is one of the most fascinating topics in
BDNF research. Now, it is clear that all these BDNF-derived
proteins are bioactive. However, there is an ongoing (and pas-
sionate) debate about the cellular locus where the conversion
of proBDNF to BDNF takes place, which enzymes are re-
sponsible for the cleavage, how efficient this processing is,
and how much and where proBDNF is secreted by neurons
[7, 24, 43, 89, 103, 118, 122, 168].
BDNF carries an ER translocation signal peptide (pre-
proBDNF). The signal peptide is cleaved off during import
into the secretory protein transport pathway. The resulting
proBDNF is further processed, and the propeptide is finally
cleaved off to generate the mature neurotrophin of ~13 kDa.
Mature BDNF forms stable homodimers that are secreted in
both constitutive and regulated pathways. At certain central
synapses or under certain experimental conditions, proBDNF
is also secreted [17, 86, 103, 155, 165, 168]. Following secre-
tion, proBDNF can be cleaved by extracellular proteases,
leading to local formation of mature BDNF to instruct long-
term changes in synaptic plasticity [122]. For a long time, the
fate of the remaining prodomain of BDNF was unknown and
believed to undergo rapid degradation. However, the
prodomain is a detectable protein [7, 43] and undergoes
activity-dependent secretion from hippocampal neurons [7].
There is compelling evidence that proBDNF and BDNF
utilize distinct receptors to mediate opposing neuronal actions
to regulate neuronal excitability, neuronal remodeling, synap-
tic communication, and plasticity in the CNS. While BDNF
has the ability to increase neuronal excitability and synaptic
strength [5, 20, 71, 76, 78, 130, 171], proBDNF can reduce
neuronal excitability, decrease synaptic efficiency, and facili-
tate synaptic depression [53, 98, 126, 162, 165, 167].
The human BDNF variants Val66Met
The prodomain of BDNF is the locus of a functional human
BDNF polymorphism known to affect synaptic plasticity,
learning, and memory processing, as observed with the help
of functional magnetic resonance imaging [47]. This single
nucleotide polymorphism, the so-called Val66Met polymor-
phism, is defined by replacement of valine66 with methionine
(reference SNP rs6265). Memory impairments in Met66 allele
carriers cause a higher susceptibility to neuropsychiatric dis-
orders, perhaps because associative memory processing in the
emotional circuit is also affected. Polymorphism frequencies
vary between ethnicities and range from about 20 to 50%
between populations. The Val66Met polymorphism does not
exist in the mouse or other model organisms, and multiple
studies are aimed at mimicking the function of
BDNFVal66Met with the help of cellular models, genetic tools,
or genetically engineered mouse models [26, 33, 34, 47, 64].
In neurons, proBDNF with Met66 shows abnormal trafficking
and an altered intracellular distribution. Interestingly, when
both BDNF variants were expressed in the same neuronal cell,
70% of the proBDNF heterodimers carried one BDNF (Val)
version and one BDNF (Met) version [34]. These dimers were
found to be inefficiently sorted into secretory granules, which
led to a decreased number of secreted BDNF proteins [34]. It
is thought that perturbations in BDNF trafficking impairs
CNS function and mood regulation because of an inefficient

activity-dependent secretion of BDNF at synapses [33, 147].
However, reduced secretion seems not to be the only mecha-
nism by which Met66 affects BDNF function. Met at position
66 induces massive structural changes in the prodomain and
affects the biological potency of prodomain signaling. Met66,
but not Val66, BDNF prodomain can induce growth cone
retraction in young hippocampal neurons, an effect which
includes signaling through the so-called sortilin-related
VPS10 domain containing receptor 2 (SorCS2) [7, 62]. Not
much is known yet, but the ligand functions of the Met66-
prodomain might be responsible for certain human-specific
features of neural plasticity.
In a large non-clinical sample of older men and women
(41–80 years old), no association between the BDNF
Val66Met polymorphism and changes in the mood status
was found [149]. However, it needs to be noted that BDNF
protein levels can change dramatically during development
[75] and aging [59], which might explain this finding. For
instance, BDNF modulates hippocampal aging [142], but it
is not well known yet how aging interacts with BDNF func-
tion in synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. It will be
necessary to gather more information about the changes in
BDNF levels and localization over the entire live span of
model organisms and humans.
Cellular aspects of BDNF secretion
There is an ongoing debate whether BDNF is primarily acting
from the postsynaptic or presynaptic site (for review [21, 46,
126]). Conceptually, anterograde release refers to data show-
ing that BDNF is synthesized in the somatic cell body area of
the presynaptic cell, is anterogradely transported to synaptic or
extrasynaptic structures, and is stored in dense core vesicles.
In this model, secretion occurs from presynapses and is
activity-dependent and regulated by calcium ions. The con-
cept of postsynaptic secretion includes transport of BDNF
encoding mRNA or BDNF protein to dendritic structures
followed by activity-dependent release by specialized post-
synaptic or endosome-like vesicles. Postsynaptic secretion of
BDNF includes the possibility that BDNF is released from the
presynaptic or postsynaptic cell, taken up by postsynaptic
neuronal structures and is finally re-offered to the synapse
via endocytic pathways. Furthermore, it has been recently
shown that glial cells can recycle BDNF to re-secret it to
neurons. There is experimental proof for all these concepts,
and, as discussed later, there is no universally valid hypothesis
that can explain the diversity of physiological BDNF actions.
Attempts to define the locus of functional BDNF secretion
were complicated by the low amounts of endogenous BDNF
normally found in neurons in vivo [43, 126]. Thus, neuronal
cultures and genetic overexpression of BDNF in slice cultures
became a standard tool to study BDNF synthesis, synaptic
steady-state localization, and synaptic BDNF release mecha-
nisms. In conclusion, these studies show that BDNF is stored
and released from both axonal and dendritic compartments [12,
19, 24, 25, 45, 56, 57, 80, 103, 144, 164, 168]. Furthermore,
BDNF becomes recycled for activity-dependent secretion [144,
164], and the recycled BDNF can then support activity-
dependent changes in synaptic strength [17, 155]. At postsyn-
aptic sites, recycling of exogenous BDNF occurs through
endocytic trafficking pathways and involves the function of
the specific synaptotagmin isoform 6, which is distinct from
those involved in secretion from dense core vesicles [164].
This indicates that synaptotagmin isoforms might serve as useful
markers to follow the fate of stored and released BDNF. Studies
using neuronal cultures in vitro and overexpressed BDNF fused
to the fluorescent proteins support the view that postsynaptic
secretory granules in dendrites and postsynaptic spines are a
preferential site of BDNF secretion [24, 45, 57, 80, 89].
New techniques, mouse models, and rigorously specified
anti-BDNF antibodies offered new insights in the steady-state
localization of endogenous, natural BDNF and proBDNF in
the mouse brain. In the BDNF-rich hippocampal circuit,
BDNF is highly abundant in presynaptic terminals of gluta-
matergic neurons, where it is stored in presynaptic dense core
vesicles. However, it was not found in distal dendrites, thus
suggesting that BDNF exerts its synaptic action primarily in
an anterograde fashion [43]. BDNF is highly abundant in the
mossy fiber terminal, a large bouton synapse formed between
granule neurons and CA3 pyramidal neurons [37, 38, 43, 168]
(Fig. 2). In the same presynaptic structure, anti-prodomain
immunoreactivity is observed [43, 168]. Whether uncleaved
or cleaved forms of BDNF are stored in the mossy fiber ter-
minals seems to be under developmental control. ProBDNF
abundance and secretion might be pronounced during early
and late postnatal development, when axonal extension and
synaptic maturation are prevalent [168]. Indeed, it has been
shown that refinement of functional connectivity in CA3
needs proBDNF/p75NTR signaling [162]. In another large
bouton synapse, the mossy fiber boutons on cerebellar granule
neurons, high amounts of BDNF are stored as well. This ax-
onal BDNF is functionally important, as it regulates the mat-
uration of GABAergic synapses [31].
A preferential presynaptic storage of endogenous BDNF
has also been visualized in long-term cultured hippocampal
neurons, which develop hallmarks of mature synapses, such
as pre- and postsynaptic bar structures (Fig. 2) [8]. Using
direct STORM (dSTORM), a super-resolution fluorescence
imaging approach enabling spatial lateral resolutions of
~20 nm, it has been shown that natural BDNF is located in
granules directly within the fine structure of the glutamatergic
presynapse [8]. A quantitative estimate confirmed that indi-
vidual glutamatergic presynapses carried up to 90% of the
synaptic steady-state BDNF immunoreactivity. A minor frac-
tion of BDNF molecules was localized in small vesicles on
596

postsynaptic bar structures. The BDNF content varied strong-
ly between individual presynaptic varicosities. These data
confirm that neurons are able to enrich and store high amounts
of BDNF in small granules within the mature glutamatergic
presynapse, at a principle site of synaptic communication.
However, the study also showed that BDNF is not located
directly in the active zone (Fig. 2), thus raising the question
whether presynaptic BDNF is released from the active zone or
from lateral parts of the presynapse [8].
BDNF transcripts carry two different 3′-untranslated region
(UTR) isoforms, a long isoform and a short isoform. It has
been described that the short 3′UTR BDNF isoform is a so-
matic isoform, while the long isoform is targeted to dendrites
by dendritic mRNA transport mechanisms to be used for local
protein translation, trafficking, and secretion [6, 36]. Using
various quantitative techniques such as deep RNA sequenc-
ing, high-resolution transcript localization, quantitative PCR
techniques, and 3′-end sequencing, BDNF mRNA was pri-
marily found in the somatic compartment but was barely de-
tected in dendrites. The vast amount of BDNF transcripts
contained the short isoform, thus indicating that BDNF pro-
tein translation preferentially occurs in somatic regions of
neurons [160]. It is not well understood yet how neuronal
BDNF reaches its postsynaptic release structures to mediate
autocrine functions on postsynaptic spines [45, 57, 157].
Neuronal activity and BDNF secretion
In a simplified view, once established, BDNF expression and
regulated secretion are under control of neuronal activity and
depend on an increase in intracellular calcium at the BDNF
release site, e.g., by activity-dependent calcium influx, the
action of cAMP, or by the action of BDNF itself [12, 24, 25,

35, 54, 56, 57, 74, 80, 103, 144, 150, 168, 169]. Multiple
signaling cascades for BDNF or neurotrophin secretion are
experimentally verified and discussed elsewhere [21, 46,
126].
After secretion, BDNF acts as a local factor. Its biochemical
characteristics prevent a broad diffusion within the target region.
BDNF is a sticky protein of about 27 kDa (mature BDNF dimer)
and is positively charged under physiological conditions. The
isoelectric point of BDNF is close to ten [87, 130]. For this
reason, BDNF is only locally acting at synapses [63, 78, 82,
161]. Local release of BDNF affects synaptic plasticity on an
exquisitely local scale in the low micrometer range. For instance,
when dendrites or cell bodies of a donor neuron supplied
overexpressed BDNF to a nearby dendrite of a recipient neuron,
the BDNF source had to be within a distance of 4.5 μm to
induce dendritic growth in the recipient neuron [63]. Structural
plasticity mediated by BDNF can even be restricted to a single
spine [60]. The local action of BDNF in combination with its
activity-dependent secretion opens the possibility that BDNF is
released as a matter of coincidence between presynaptic and
postsynaptic activity, meaning that BDNF release occurs at a
local place, as a response to the synchrony of a local synaptic
input and a postsynaptic spike. Indeed, pairing of repetitive
postsynaptic spikes with local glutamate uncaging, a method
to simulate glutamate release from presynaptic sources, induces
local structural plasticity in postsynaptic spines [150]. This struc-
tural plasticity is represented by an immediate and a gradual
phase of spine enlargement [150]. The gradual slow phase is
dependent on protein synthesis and local BDNF secretion,
which is induced by spike-timing plasticity [150]. In conclusion,
BDNF may act as a synapse-specific, local actor for synaptic
remodeling in associative learning events and is needed for the
consolidation of efficient synaptic communication. Recent data
underlined the impact of postsynaptic BDNF secretion for
spike-timing-dependent plasticity in CA1 [45, 57, 60].
The timescale of secretion of natural BDNF is not well
defined. Modeling BDNF secretion with overexpressed re-
combinant BDNF coupled to the green fluorescent protein
GFP enables the direct visualization of the release of BDNF-
GFP. Initial studies indicated that activity-dependent BDNF
release is quite slow and occurs over seconds to minutes [24,
56, 80]. In contrast, physiological answers of exogenously
applied BDNF may be very fast and can occur in the millisec-
ond to second range [20, 21, 71, 79, 82, 91]. This is no dis-
crepancy because BDNF binds with high affinity to its target
receptor TrkB [138] and even low amounts of secreted BDNF
should be able to exert a prominent action. A glutamatergic
synapse carries multiple BDNF-containing granules distribut-
ed over the complete presynaptic structure [8] (Fig. 2).
Therefore, secretion characteristics of BDNF coupled to a
fluorescent protein observed by time-lapse imaging microsco-
py are likely to reflect the continuous but stepwise secretion of
individual BDNF molecules from individual secretory
structures. Indeed, when postsynaptic BDNF secretion was
investigated with BDNF fused to superecliptic pHluorin, fast
imaging visualized the release of BDNF in the range of milli-
seconds to seconds [57, 60]. Spike-like fluorescence signals
representing BDNF release from postsynaptic sites correlated
with local glutamate uncaging and fast and stepwise BDNF
release depended on activity [57, 60]. Even glial cells, which
take up synaptically released proBDNF from neurons, are able
to rapidly re-release BDNF [17]. In conclusion, data looking
at the speed of BDNF release with fluorescent proteins are in
accordance with fast and slow BDNF effects on neuronal ex-
citation and synaptic plasticity.
The BDNF receptors TrkB and p75NTR: functional
antagonism of neurotrophin signaling
The neurotrophins act by binding to two kinds of plasma
membrane receptors, the tropomyosin (t)-receptor (r)-kinase
(k) Trk [102] and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR)
[41]. BDNF (mature dimeric BDNF) binds with high affinity
(dissociation constant ~10−11 M) to its receptor TrkB [138].
The binding of BDNF to TrkB has proven to be of elementary
importance for the effects of BDNF to promote synaptic effi-
ciency and long-term potentiation [2, 16, 18, 49, 51, 57, 76,
111, 112, 122, 130, 171] (Fig. 4a). Under physiological con-
ditions, the dimeric BDNF can also act through p75NTR, but
with much lower affinity (dissociation constant ~10−9 M). The
preferential receptor for immediate proBDNF effects is
p75NTR [53, 69, 84, 155, 162, 165, 167], and p75NTR and
TrkB are the key players in the concept of functional antago-
nism of the BDNF signaling system [76, 111, 139, 170]
(Fig. 4a). For instance, low-frequency stimulation of neurons
can cause proBDNF release at excitatory synapses, which can
consequently lead to an attenuation in synaptic function (long-
term depression) via p75NTR [118, 122, 167, 168].
A remarkable form of plasticity through proBDNF/p75NTR
was observed in the developing cortex and hippocampus
[162]. Here, spontaneous activity of neighboring synapses
was found to strengthen the synaptic connection. In contrast,
neighboring synapses that were losing synchronicity and were
only rarely co-active became depressed. Notably, when
proBDNF was given to highly synchronized synapses, these
local synapses underwent synaptic depression. This Bout of
sync – lose your link^ plasticity mechanism points to a rele-
vant role of proBDNF/p75NTR signaling in activity-dependent
shaping of synaptic connectivity [162].
TrkB, the concomitant BDNF receptor, is expressed from a
single gene but exists in four versions, the full-length receptor
tyrosine kinase TrkB, and the splice variants, the truncated ver-
sion TrkB-T1 (glycoprotein 95), TrkB-T2 [108], and TrkB-T4
[50]. An isoform designated TrkB-T3 has been found in chick-
en. The precise function of truncated TrkB receptors still
598

remains elusive, and it is not known yet whether the transcripts
encoding for TrkB-T2 and T4 are translated in vivo to form
functional proteins. However, the different TrkB transcripts
are differentially regulated in phases of experience-dependent
plasticity, e.g., in the visual cortex, [22], indicating that they
might be used to interfere with TrkB expression.
BDNF-dependent effects on synaptic plasticity are generally
mediated by the TrkB kinase, while the role of the truncated
TrkB-T1 is not well understood. TrkB-T1 binds to BDNF with
similar affinity as the TrkB kinase and can interfere with
BDNF-TrkB signaling by binding BDNF without activation
of the downstream kinase cascades. Overexpression in neurons
or the knockout of TrkB-T1 from all cells affects the dendritic
complexity of certain types of neurons, for instance, CA1 py-
ramidal neurons, dentate gyrus granule neurons in the hippo-
campus, or neurons in the basolateral amygdala [27, 107].
When overexpressed in neurons, TrkB-T1 affects structural
and functional plasticity [107]. Furthermore, it reduces fast
physiological answers of the TrkB kinase [140] and in vivo
reduction of TrkB signaling by removal of one BDNF allele
can be partially rescued by TrkB.T1 deletion. These studies
indicate that there is a physiological interaction between TrkB
and endogenous TrkB-T1, but neither the underlying signaling
mechanism nor the function are known and it is not solved yet
whether effects of endogenous TrkB-T1 are of neuronal origin.
Fast signaling via the truncated TrkB-T1 has been found in
hippocampal astrocytes in vitro and in brain slice preparations.
Here, TrkB-T1 activation induced ER calcium release and sub-
sequent store-operated calcium entry [21, 140].
BDNF signaling cascades
BDNF/TrkB kinase signaling can be divided in (1) signaling
cascades which occur over minutes to hours and (2) fast
BDNF-induced signaling cascades which excite neurons
(outline and abbreviations are found in Fig. 3). BDNF actions
differ markedly depending on how fast BDNF concentrations
rise when it is delivered to neurons [70, 71, 82].
Upon binding BDNF, TrkB dimerizes, activates an intrinsic
kinase activity, undergoes autophosphorylation, and activates
a complex set of intracellular signaling cascades [30, 65, 110,
123, 126] (Fig. 3a). The Shc adaptor protein links the activated
Trk receptor at Tyr515 to the Pi3K/Akt pathway. Activation of
Shc by Trk increases in the activity of the small GTPase Ras
and the protein kinase ERK (also called MAPK, mitogen-
activated protein kinase). Downstream of ERK and
Pi3K/Akt, MAP kinase-interacting kinases (MNK), and
mTOR-signaling mediates BDNF/TrkB functions for transla-
tional control [123, 124] (Fig. 3a).
Phosphorylation of a tyrosine at the carboxyterminal end of
TrkB (Tyr816) creates the binding site for the PLCγ which sub-
sequently induces the release of calcium ions from the
intracellular calcium store (Fig. 3a). Calcium release from inter-
nal calcium stores links BDNF signaling with many calcium-
dependent signaling steps, e.g., via activation of CaMKII, a
master regulator of synaptic plasticity. Phosphorylation of
Ser478 in the juxtamembrane region of TrkB by CDK5
(cyclin-dependent kinase 5) links TIAM1, a guanine nucleotide
exchange factor, to activate Rac1 (Fig. 3a). Rac1 is a well-
established signaling protein that promotes spine growth and
maturation by regulating actin dynamics [81]. This signaling
cascade is involved in BDNF- and activity-dependent dendritic
spine remodeling.
BDNF-dependent TrkB activation can immediately excite
neurons. BDNF can, for instance, induce a slow and sustained
calcium influx and a long-lasting non-selective cationic current
through canonical transient receptor potential channels such as
TrpC3. This effect is initiated by TrkB-PLCγ activation and is
thought to depend on calcium release from internal calcium
stores [5, 91–93]. Very fast signaling cascades of BDNF are
not well defined [21]. When locally applied, BDNF can also
mediate fast sodium influx which triggers fast calcium ion influx
through voltage-gated calcium channels [20, 71, 79, 82]
(Fig. 3a).
TrkB activation in the absence of neurotrophins
Activation of TrkB in absence of its natural ligand BDNF, the
so-called TrkB transactivation, is another important mecha-
nism how TrkB can exert specific signaling functions [30,
67, 133] (Fig. 3b). Structural models for the activation mech-
anism of TrkB are mainly based on generalized models of
receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation [88]. In general,
growth factor binding activates RTKs by inducing receptor
dimerization and structural data show that dimerization of
the extracellular receptor domain of Trk receptors is mediated
by the ligand dimer [158]. In the absence of a ligand, RTKs are
autoinhibited in cis and autoinhibition is released following
ligand-induced receptor dimerization [88]. However, many
studies showed that TrkB can execute autophosphorylation
activity and downstream signaling without stimulation by
the ligand BDNF [66, 85, 117, 133–135, 159]. Activation of
TrkB receptors in the absence of neurotrophins can be medi-
ated by ligand activation of the G-protein-coupled adenosine
2A receptor (A2A-R) or the dopamine D1 receptor [67, 85,
134, 159] (Fig. 3b). G-protein-coupled receptors can trigger
the transactivation of TrkB in the range of tens of minutes to
hours. This effect is mediated by Src family of protein tyrosine
kinases (SFKs, e.g., Fyn) [67, 85, 134, 135]. TrkB activation
in the absence of neurotrophins can occur at intracellular sites
[67, 133, 135], which includes calcium-dependent steps [67],
and regulates the cell surface abundance of TrkB [67, 133]
(Fig. 3b). During development of the cortex, intracellular
TrkB and TrkC can be activated by an Src kinase-dependent

599

pathway induced by EGF binding to the EGF receptor [133]
(Fig. 3b). This effect regulates the migration of newborn cor-
tical neurons. In contrast to the slow G-protein-mediated TrkB
activation, EGF-mediated transactivation of TrkB occurs in
the range of some minutes and regulates TrkB responsiveness
to BDNF at the cell surface [133]. In hippocampal neurons,
TrkB can be transactivated by zinc ions, which signal through
C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) [61, 66, 121] (Fig. 3b).
Before understanding how other factors transactivate TrkB,
more efforts are needed to better understand the structural
basis of auto-transactivation between TrkB dimers. TrkB auto-
phosphorylation has been proposed to be a sequential cis/
transphosphorylation, with a cis component (a kinases’ own
active site mediates autophosphorylation) as an initial key
step, while the subsequent transphosphorylation step is depen-
dent on the concentration of the intracellular TrkB kinase do-
main [68]. We do not know much yet, but cis components in
Trk kinase activation belong to those observations that support
the provocative idea that active TrkB monomers can be of
functional relevance.
BDNF signaling in synaptic plasticity

by which defined types of synaptic stimulation result in a
long-lasting increase (potentiation) or decrease (depression)
in the strength of synaptic transmission. An increasing number
of studies show that structural spine plasticity and synaptic
processes such as LTP or LTD are causally linked to memory
[58, 115, 166].
Many studies showed that BDNF is secreted during LTP
induction and is functionally essential for acute signaling cas-
cades leading to LTP, albeit BDNF is not required for all forms
of LTP or mechanisms leading to LTP [23, 45, 46, 76, 171].
Blocking TrkB or scavenging BDNF during and after LTP
induction confirmed critical temporal windows required for
early and late phases in BDNF-dependent LTP components
that begin with the induction of LTP and end in the range of 10
to 60 min after LTP initiation [45, 49, 57, 66, 76, 78, 79, 104,
145, 150, 155, 171, 172]. Furthermore, there is compelling
evidence that memory consolidation needs a persistent action
of BDNF over longer time windows of up to 24 h [13, 124].
Some review articles worth reading have been focused on
BDNF action in synaptic plasticity and early and late phases
of BDNF-dependent components of LTP [23, 46, 123].
BDNF in LTP formation is best understood for the hippo-
campus, but the effects of BDNF differ quite widely depend-
ing on the type of synapse. Therefore, it is not well known yet
which BDNF signaling cascades contribute to circuit func-
tions in memory processing (Figs. 3 and 4).
BDNF and LTP formation in the hippocampal CA1 region
A functional role of endogenous BDNF in LTP expression in
CA1 was first described by Korte et al. [76]. In hippocampal
slices of homo- and heterozygous BDNF knockout mice, LTP
expression was reduced after tetanic stimulation [76]. This ex-
periment indicated an immediate effect of BDNF on synaptic
plasticity. In another study, it was shown that application of
exogenous BDNF for 30 min was sufficient to reverse deficits
in LTP and synaptic transmission at the Schaffer collateral–
CA1 synapse of 2- to 3-week old BDNF knockout mice. At
his age, BDNF knockout mice are old enough to develop LTP,
but are still viable [130]. BDNF does not only exert an acute
action on CA1 neurons but also triggers synapse maturation. In
hippocampal slices of the developing hippocampus, at postna-
tal day 12–13, different types of tetanic stimulation caused
short-term potentiation but did not develop LTP [49].
However, when treated with exogenous BDNF for 2.5–4 h,
the same stimulation protocols could induce LTP. Thus, in the
immature hippocampus, when corresponding slice preparations
are not capable of producing LTP, BDNF exerts a modulatory
function to enable an enhanced responsiveness of synapses to
plasticity-inducing stimulation protocols. However, in older
animals, BDNF can exert an instructive effect during synaptic
potentiation. When a function-blocking antibody against
BDNF was acutely available 2 min before and 2 min after
LTP induction, synaptic potentiation was markedly reduced in
hippocampal slices of 4–6-week old mice [78]. One source of
BDNF release that is required for LTP induction at CA3-CA1
excitatory synapses is the presynaptic CA3 neuron via its
Schaffer collateral [171]. Removing BDNF selectively from
CA1 neurons affected neither theta-burst-induced LTP nor
high-frequency-dependent LTP (200 Hz LTP). In these exper-
iments, both forms of LTP depended on BDNF in the presyn-
aptic CA3 neuron. Notably, this presynaptic BDNF was shown
to regulate a presynaptic module of LTP, possibly via autocrine
activation of presynaptic TrkB kinases [171] (Fig. 4b).
Endogenous BDNF can also be triggered by spike-timing
protocols, for instance, by combining local glutamate
uncaging at spines paired with postsynaptic spikes [57, 60,
150] or by repeated sequential action potential firing in pre-
and postsynaptic neurons [45, 46]. BDNF secretion induced
by spike-timing protocols can induce a functional timing-
dependent LTP (t-LTP), as recently shown for CA1 pyramidal
neurons at an age between P15–23 in rats and P25–P35 in
mice [45]. In this experimental paradigm, repeated pairing of
one presynaptic action potential with four postsynaptic spikes
induced a postsynaptic t-LTP. This t-LTP formation was
blocked by an acutely applied BDNF scavenging antibody
and was attributed to postsynaptic secretion of BDNF by the
CA1 neuron itself [45]. This confirms that BDNF is secreted
during a protocol for spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a cel-
lular model thought to represent memory formation at the
single-cell level [55]. Structural and functional plasticity in-
cludes autocrine action of BDNF on TrkB receptors in spines
of CA1 pyramidal neurons [57, 60] (Fig. 4b). When local and
repetitive glutamate uncaging was performed at individual
spines of organotypic slice cultures, calcium influx through
NMDA receptors and subsequent activation of postsynaptic
CaMKII could trigger the release of postsynaptically synthe-
sized BDNF to induce spine enlargement and LTP [57].
Another set of experiments showed that spine enlargement
by autocrine BDNF includes signaling through Rac1 and
Cdc42, two small GTP-binding proteins involved in actin cy-
toskeleton remodeling [60] (outlined in Fig. 4b).
In summary, after developmental maturation of the hippo-
campus, pre- and postsynaptic TrkB and pre- and postsynaptic
BDNF contribute to effects in synaptic plasticity (Fig. 4a, b). It
is possible that this complexity reflects a fine tuning mecha-
nism which allows the synapse to rapidly adapt to a new mem-
ory situation. Spine turnover rates are much higher in CA1 than
in the neocortex, and therefore, it was assumed that the tran-
sience of hippocampal-dependent memory is mirrored in the
high turnover dynamics of hippocampal synapses [10]. It might
well be that BDNF, proBDNF, and the prodomain of BDNF are
master regulators of synapse turnover plasticity (Fig. 4a) and
that some kind of local BDNF cloud, which covers both the
pre- and postsynaptic part of the synapse (Fig. 4b), is needed to
produce more stable synaptic connections.

Mice lacking the TrkB receptor for BDNF and mice with a
targeted mutation in the PLCγ site of TrkB show LTP deficits
as well [110–112]. Notably, concurrent pre- and postsynaptic
interference with TrkB-PLCγ signaling was needed to effi-
ciently reduce LTP [51], which is in accordance with pre-
and postsynaptic effects of BDNF and TrkB in CA1 LTP
(Fig. 4b). TrkB mediates its downstream signaling function
through PLCγ activation [111, 114] (Fig. 3a), and it is be-
lieved that subsequent calcium release from the endoplasmic
reticulum or spine apparatus is important to transduce the
signal. However, not all spines carry ER structures or a spine
apparatus [148]. The cell biology of presynaptic and postsyn-
aptic calcium stores, which are activated by TrkB-PLCγ sig-
naling, is largely unknown (Figs. 3a and 4b).
Fig. 4 Models of synaptic BDNF signaling. a Functional antagonism of
BDNF isoforms. In this model, BDNF potentiates the strength of synaptic
transmission (plus sign) through TrkB receptors, while under different
stimulation conditions, postsynaptic p75NTR receptors are activated by
proBDNF to decrease the strength of synaptic transmission (minus
sign). Mature BDNF is either secreted or formed by extracellular
cleavage from proBDNF, as indicated by the enzymatic scissor. BDNF
may be secreted from pre- and/or postsynaptic sources. b Autocrine and
paracrine BDNF signaling to increase the strength of synaptic transmis-
sion. Presynaptic and postsynaptic TrkB receptors are activated by mature
BDNF. TrkB-PLCγ signaling mediates fast BDNF functions and inter-
acts with other phosphorylation cascades to mediate temporally delayed
effects, such as structural LTP. BDNF derives from presynaptic and post-
synaptic sources and acts autocrine and anterograde. Under certain cir-
cumstances, BDNF might act as a potent retrograde messenger. The mod-
el includes that TrkB signaling cascades activate synaptic ER calcium
stores. The model combines converging lines of evidence at the
Schaffer collateral–CA1 synapse. c BDNF signaling at the mossy fiber
synapse. This model is focused on anterograde BDNF release. High
amounts of BDNF are stored in the presynaptic mossy fiber terminal.
Cleaved and uncleaved BDNF isoforms are found in this synapse.
Autocrine activation of presynaptic TrkB receptors is involved in presyn-
aptic LTP. BDNF can also excite CA3 pyramidal neurons, either through
IP3-mediated ER calcium release and subsequent activation of canonical
transient receptor potential (TrpC) channels or fast depolarization (triple
plus signs in red). Zinc ions (Zn2+) are co-released with glutamate from
mossy fiber synapses, enter CA3 pyramidal neurons through ion chan-
nels, and mediate postsynaptic TrkB transactivation. BDNF signaling
mechanisms at this synapse might change during development. There is
evidence that BDNF plays an important role in feedforward signaling
through local interneurons. The temporal and spatial aspects of the indi-
cated signaling mechanisms are unclear. d BDNF signaling at the tripar-
tite synapse in the perirhinal cortex. Secreted proBDNF is taken up by

ing is not known

BDNF and LTP formation in the dentate gyrus
A different form of BDNF-mediated plasticity was found in
dendrites of dentate granule cells in the hippocampus. Based
on the finding that exogenous BDNF, when locally applied for
some milliseconds, can exert a fast, neurotransmitter-like ac-
tion on multiple types of neurons [20, 71, 140], it was asked
whether this fast excitatory action of BDNF supports LTP
formation. Stimulation of afferents of the medial perforant
path combined with a fast and local pulse application of
BDNF was sufficient to induce LTP [79]. This LTP required
activation of a postsynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels
and NMDA receptors. Rapid calcium signals induced by
BDNF were exclusively observed in dendritic spines, indicat-
ing that postsynaptic spines were the principle site of fast
BDNF actions in this form of synaptic plasticity [79].
In vivo, induction of BDNF-LTP, in contrast to HFS-LTP,
does not require NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation, while
both BDNF-LTP and HFS-LTP are associated with enhanced
granule cell excitability and enhanced synaptic transmission
[106]. Notably, in the dentate gyrus, BDNF does not only act
as an instructive factor in LTP but also mediates the consoli-
dation of LTP [105, 106, 123, 124]. BDNF activation of TrkB
can be very fast, and phosphatases can shut off TrkB function
in the range of minutes. However, here in the dentate gyrus,
LTP consolidation requires a sustained BDNF/TrkB signaling
process. When high frequency stimulation of the medial
perforant path was performed in anesthetized rats to induce
dentate gyrus LTP, BDNF-dependent elements of LTP lasted
for many hours [124]. Notably, rapid, complete, and perma-
nent reversion of LTP could be achieved by local application
of a BDNF scavenger at 10 min and 2 or 4 h after LTP induc-
tion [124]. The BDNF-dependent phase ended at about 10 h
after LTP induction. This persistent BDNF/TrkB signaling
process depends on MAP kinase-interacting kinase signaling
cascades (Fig. 3a) and activates two mechanistically distinct
forms of protein translation. The early phase of BDNF-
dependent protein translation occurs in a time window of
about 100 min after LTP induction, while the second subse-
quent late consolidation phase depends on dendritic protein
synthesis and lasts hours [23, 105, 106, 123, 124].
BDNF and LTP formation in CA3 region
The granule neurons of the dentate gyrus provide a strong
input to the hippocampus. Furthermore, in the subgranular
zone of the dentate gyrus, granule neurons are continuously
generated and are functionally integrated into the hippocam-
pal circuit. This projection is critically involved in the process-
ing of contextual elements of memory, memory precision,
pattern separation, and/or memory resolution [73, 141].
Notably, highest amounts of BDNF in the entire adult brain
are found within the glutamatergic mossy fiber boutons
(MFB) [37, 38, 43] (Fig. 2h–j). MFBs form a strong, soma-
near, dendritic excitatory contact with thorny spines on CA3
pyramidal neurons, and each MFB forms varicosities and
highly dynamic small filopodial extensions to excite
GABAergic interneurons [1] (Fig. 4c). These filopodia show
experience- and learning-dependent structural plasticity and
regulate feedforward inhibition, which is crucial for memory
precision [141]. Within the MFBs, BDNF is not only
contacting CA3 pyramidal neurons but is also found in mossy
fiber terminals contacting inhibitory neurons [38] (Fig. 4c).
Mossy fiber-mediated LTP is unusual because its expression
is independent of postsynaptic NMDA receptors and presyn-
aptic (non-associative) LTP, albeit mossy fiber synapses evoke
NMDA receptor currents [119]. In heterozygous BDNF
knockout mice, MF-LTP is drastically reduced [145]. Acute
blockade of BDNF/TrkB signaling during MF-LTP induction
reduced MF-LTP as well [145]. As BDNF is not found in
dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons of adult mice [43], and
MF-LTP is presynaptic, these experiments indicate that mossy
fiber BDNF might act preferentially in an autocrine way on
presynaptic TrkB receptors to enhance neurotransmitter re-
lease (Fig. 4c). However, CA3 pyramidal neurons express
high numbers of the BDNF receptor TrkB, thus raising the
question whether there is a role of the postsynaptic TrkB in
synaptic plasticity. Surprisingly, epileptogenesis-induced
TrkB activation was found in animals with a conditional lack
of BDNF, so the question was whether a non-BDNF ligand
might be able to activate TrkB. In search of such a ligand,
Huang et al. [66] found that the divalent cation zinc, released
by mossy fiber terminals, can induce an activity-dependent
transactivation of TrkB (Fig. 3b and 4c). This transactivation
process is able to potentiate the mossy fiber-CA3 synapse.
However, genetic elimination of BDNF in zinc transporter 3
knockout mice was needed to reduce in vivo TrkB phosphor-
ylation at the PLCγ interaction site [61]. This suggests that
BDNF but not vesicular zinc activates TrkB in hippocampal
mossy fiber axons, at least under steady-state conditions [61].
The interplay of many mechanisms might be involved in
BDNF-mediated plasticity at the MF synapse (Fig. 4c).
Anyhow, the mossy fiber to CA3 synapse is a promising sys-
tem to find out how local BDNF signaling affects network
maturation, synaptic wiring, and learning-dependent synaptic
plasticity in a microcircuit. Furthermore, it is a good system to
investigate how pre- and postsynaptic calcium stores act
downstream of TrkB.
BDNF and LTP maintenance in perirhinal cortex
Regulation of endogenous BDNF secretion plays a critical
role in perirhinal cortex LTP [2]. Here, critical levels of en-
dogenous BDNF released for 8–12 min after TBS are required
for LTP maintenance [2]. The way in which BDNF
Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2017) 469:593–610
603

availability is orchestrated might thus contribute to this form
of synaptic plasticity. Accordingly, different phases of LTP are
sensitive to BDNF signaling in different brain circuits, and
previous investigations in hippocampus demonstrated that
longer time windows are required for BDNF action on LTP
maintenance. Late TBS-LTP in the CA1 region is prevented
when TrkB phosphorylation was blocked by NMPP1 from 1
to 40 min post-TBS but is not affected thereafter [99].
Moreover, high-frequency stimulation (HFS)-induced LTP in
the CA1 of hippocampal slices can be inhibited by TrkB-Fc in
a time frame of 30 to 60 min, but not from 70 to 100 min, after
LTP induction [72]. Even longer periods of BDNF action
(about 8 h) are necessary in the dentate gyrus [124].
Whether BDNF availability in individual circuits contributes
differently to the duration of BDNF-TrkB signaling and LTP
maintenance is hotly debated [23, 46, 126].
In the perirhinal cortex, long-lasting LTP requires the ac-
tivity of peri-synaptic glia [155]. Here, astrocytes can take up
synaptic proBDNF using the carrier receptor p75NTR and re-
cycle it as the mature neurotrophin, in a process essential for
LTP maintenance and memory retention [155] (Fig. 4d). Glial
BDNF recycling occurs in tight temporal conjunction with the
LTP-inducing electrical stimulation, and specifically, deleting
p75NTR in glial cells from p75-flox mice [174] prevents
BDNF recycling [155]. Notably, when p75NTR is removed
from glial cells, TrkB phosphorylation of nearby neurons de-
creases rapidly following TBS but recovers 10 min later. In
accord with this evidence, we demonstrated that exogenous
BDNF rescues the late-phase LTP deficit in slices from glia-
specific p75 knockout mice only if applied for 10 min from
TBS, and indeed, later administrations of exogenous BDNF
failed to restore LTP maintenance. Thus, a time-sensitive in-
crease in BDNF availability is required for LTP maintenance
[2, 32, 137], and BDNF recycling by glial cells (Fig. 4d) can
compensate this physiological requirement. Additionally,
recycling is required to sustain the size of the activity-
dependent releasable pool of functional BDNF in this cortical
area. This might be particularly important for LTP mainte-
nance, which requires threshold BDNF levels [76, 77, 130].
Thus, BDNF recycled by glia [155] or by neurons themselves
[144, 164] may synergistically regulate synaptic modifications
according to synaptic needs.
Astrocytes are not electrically excitable cells. Receiving
signals from neurons at the synaptic cleft is the most expected
mechanism for these cells to regulate BDNF recycling. This
provides a model by which astrocytes expressing receptors
sensing transmitter release from active synapses transduce in-
ternal signals leading to endocytic BDNF secretion (Fig. 4d).
Astrocytes express receptors for many different transmitters
and modulators and display calcium signaling in response to
their stimulation. This implies that BDNF glial recycling is a
highly regulated process, and it suggests that complex activa-
tion of transmitter receptors on glial cells controls final
neurotrophin availability. Indeed, both glutamate [17] and
the extracellular nucleotide ATP [156] regulate endocytic
BDNF secretion, at least in cultured cortical astrocytes. At
the tripartite synapse, where astrocytes form a third effective
component of the synapse [9, 129], glutamate and ATP sig-
naling between neurons and astrocytes might be needed for
maintaining sufficient levels of BDNF for specific synaptic
requirements. As glial vesicular release of BDNF is regulated
by neurotransmitter release-inducing neuronal activity, astro-
cytes may then couple neuronal network activity to the local
synaptic need of the neurotrophin. Thus, neurons may regulate
BDNF glial recycling via the release of distinct transmitters,
indicating that neuron-astrocyte interaction can play a much
more intricate and functional role in information processing
coupled to cognitive functions than previously assumed.
BDNF signaling and associative learning
in psychiatric diseases
Studies in animal models have revealed the involvement of
BDNF in higher order functions such as learning, memory,
cognition, perception and regulation of emotions.
Furthermore, in humans, BDNF and TrkB signaling has been
associated with a multitude of psychiatric diseases and is
therefore widely studied in the context of schizophrenia, au-
tism, depression, addiction, or anxiety disorders [11]. The
concept of treating psychiatric diseases by interacting with
BDNF signaling has major caveats. Therapeutics mimicking
BDNF or therapies that inhibit or potentiate TrkB signaling
may lead to uncontrolled growth effects (e.g., axon sprouting,
tumor growth, or cancer cell migration), epileptic seizures and
excitotoxicity, or unwished stimulation of long-term changes
in synaptic plasticity, for instance, in circuits underlying ad-
diction, reward behavior, or fear and anxiety control. A com-
mon view on psychiatric diseases is that altered information
processing at synapses in corresponding neural circuits corre-
lates with observed changes in behavior. Therefore, a deep
understanding of local, spatiotemporal, and synapse-specific
BDNF and Trk (B) function is essential before future thera-
peutic procedures can evolve from the more detailed knowl-
edge of the corresponding signaling cascades.
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the role
of BDNF signaling in fear and anxiety regulation because
associative synaptic learning occurring by fear or anxiety con-
ditioning are thought to be a diathesis for the development of
anxiety disorders [109]. Of all psychiatric diseases, anxiety
disorders show the highest lifetime prevalence [163], and the
underlying neural networks are well conserved between mam-
malian model organisms and humans [101, 125, 153].
Furthermore, clinical genetic studies suggest a strong genetic
contribution to the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders [42, 44].
Thus, fear learning and fear extinction paradigms, which
604
Pflugers Arch - Eur J Physiol (2017) 469:593–610

stimulate synaptic plasticity in the underlying neural circuits,
are thought to be a good research model for anxiety disorders.
For instance, cue conditioning characterized by phasic fear
can help to identify neural correlates affected in specific pho-
bias, while context conditioning is assumed to be relevant for
anxiety disorders characterized by sustained anxiety [39, 83,
101]. In anxiety disorders, therapeutic interventions such as
cognitive behavioral or exposure therapy use beneficial strat-
egies of associative synaptic learning, for instance, extinction
learning, to reduce fear memories and anxiety behavior [100].
BDNF is one of the best known synaptic molecules which
efficiently modify synaptic strength during associative learn-
ing, and it can act as a mediator, modulator, or instructor of
synaptic plasticity, over a broad time window. BDNF is one of
the most inspiring molecules to better understand the disad-
vantageous synaptic learning underlying the etiology of anx-
iety disorders and the beneficial synaptic mechanisms under-
lying extinction learning [96, 113, 147].
Concluding remarks
There is compelling experimental evidence that BDNF is an
essential factor and instructive mediator of functional and
structural plasticity in the CNS and is not only offered to
synapses by neurons but also by some types of glial cells.
BDNF can exert fast and slow effects at synapses and changes
its role during microcircuit development and maturation. All
Bdnf gene products, proBDNF, mature BDNF, and even the
isolated proBDNF domain exert functional activity. proBDNF
can not only be regarded as a functional antagonist of mature
BDNF, as it can be processed in microcircuits to be re-
delivered to synapses. One of the most important features of
BDNF is that it acts as a local factor, paracrine and autocrine,
on both presynaptic and postsynaptic target sites.
On a molecular level, more structural data are needed to
explain how TrkB undergoes intermolecular transactivation
and activation in the absence of a ligand. Cell biology in
neurons can answer the question how anterograde and retro-
grade trafficking of BDNF and TrkB is regulated and which
individual trafficking steps depend on intracellular TrkB acti-
vation. There is a broad lack of knowledge on how BDNF and
TrkB are transported and localized within cells. In contrast to
our well-developed understanding of BDNF effects, the
downstream signaling cascades, the balance between fast
and slow signaling, and the corresponding mediators, are not
well defined. BDNF is released at synapses, and many BDNF
effects in synaptic plasticity are thought to be mediated by
calcium release from internal calcium stores. However, not
all synapses carry ER structures, and the cellular compart-
ments for local calcium release are barely defined. New tech-
niques that allow direct ER calcium imaging in the presence of
extracellular calcium [40, 143] might be able to solve how
spatiotemporal BDNF-TrkB signaling activates intracellular
calcium stores and how the ER-derived membrane trafficking
contributes to synaptic plasticity. Monosynaptic tracing tools
in combination with genetic recombination, genome editing,
or optogenetic methodology can help to identify the contribu-
tion of pre-, post-, or recycled BDNF at individual synapses.
New developments in super-resolution microscopy will be
advantageous to resolve the local structural dynamics at syn-
apses which are associated with BDNF signaling to show, for
instance, how BDNF/TrkB cascades interact with actin or mi-
crotubule dynamics, how BDNF is secreted and recycled at
synapses, and how TrkB cycles between the cell surface and
intrasynaptic membranes. It will be exciting and challenging
to look again at the fundamental questions of BDNF neurobi-
ology—where, when, and how. A sound neurobiological
foundation for the understanding of BDNF functions in
synapse-specific signaling is a prerequisite before BDNF-
based therapeutics can become safe and clinically relevant.
