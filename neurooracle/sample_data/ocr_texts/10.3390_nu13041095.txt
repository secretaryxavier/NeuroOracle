Abstract: In the DEPOXIN project, we have found that a high ratio of omega-6/omega-3 fatty
acids (FA) is associated with worsening of depressive symptoms in children and adolescents with
depressive disorder (DD) and that the 12-week omega-3 FA supplementation modulates DD symp-
toms. Here we present our results of the secondary outcomes: the levels of thromboxane (TXB),
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), homocysteine (HCy) and vitamin D. Fifty-eight patients
were randomized into two arms. One group received a ﬁsh oil emulsion enriched with omega-3 FA,
and the other received a sunﬂower oil emulsion containing omega-6 FA, for 12 weeks. Depressive
symptoms were evaluated, using the Child’s Depressive Inventory (CDI). The patients with DD had
elevated TXB levels and decreased vitamin D levels, as compared to healthy controls. Both CDI
and omega-6/omega-3 ratio correlated positively with TXB and negatively with BDNF at baseline.
Compared to the omega-6 FA group, the supplementation with omega-3 FA for 12 weeks signiﬁ-
cantly reduced plasma TXB (p = 0.024) and increased BDNF (p = 0.011) levels. No changes in HCy
and vitamin D were observed. Our results demonstrate the possible role of TXB and BDNF in the
pathophysiology of DD and the beneﬁts of omega-3 FA supplementation. The study was registered
with the ISRCTN registry (ISRCTN81655012).
Keywords: depressive disorder; omega-3 fatty acids; thromboxane; brain-derived neurotrophic

1. Introduction
Depressive disorder (DD) is a serious global issue in children and adolescents, with a
prevalence of about 5.7% among those aged 13–18 years old [1,2].
Core symptoms for childhood depression include persistent sadness, loss of interest
and enjoyment, and increased fatigability [3]. The pathophysiology of DD in children and
adolescents is not fully understood [4,5].
Over the years, the diet ratio of omega-6 fatty acids (FA) to omega-3 FA has changed
from 1:1 to 15–20:1. [6]. These ﬁndings led to the hypothesis that omega-3 FA supplementa-
tion could be a way to treat DD [7–9]. Such an assumption is supported by information on

the omega-3 FA biological effects (formation of anti-inﬂammatory metabolites, their effect
on ﬂuidity of cell membranes modulating membrane functions, and regulation of gene
expression) [10,11]. The relationship between mental health and inﬂammation, as well
as increased levels of markers of inﬂammation, was found not only in adults but also in
children and adolescents with DD [12]. However, information on the relationship between
the depression severity and markers of inﬂammation is insufﬁcient in young individuals,
due to the lack of studies and their heterogeneity [13]. In meta-analyses of 22 studies with
children and adolescents, Colasanto et al. [14] demonstrated that depression positively
correlates with inﬂammation represented by C-reactive protein (CRP) or interleukin IL-6.
Polyunsaturated fatty acids are involved in the regulation of inﬂammation and ﬂuidity
of membranes and may contribute to the pathophysiology of DD. Arachidonic acid (AA,
C20:4, ω = 6), which is formed by elongation/desaturation of linoleic acid (LA, C18:2,
ω = 6), is a substrate for the synthesis of eicosanoids, such as prostacyclins, thromboxanes,
and prostaglandins (e.g., PGF2 and PGE2), stimulating proinﬂammatory cytokine synthe-
sis. The eicosanoids are formed by the catalytic action of cyclooxygenase (COX). On the
other hand, omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C20:5, ω = 3) and
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C22:6, ω = 3), are metabolized by COX and lipoxygenase to
polyhydroxy metabolites, e.g., D-resolvins formed from DHA, or to trihydroxy metabolites,
e.g., E-resolvins formed from EPA, both with anti-inﬂammatory properties. For these rea-
sons, the ratio between omega-6 and omega-3 FA plays an important role in the regulation
of inﬂammatory homeostasis [15]. An increased omega-6/omega-3 FA ratio leads to the
displacement of DHA from its structures in the brain by arachidonic acid, leading to an
increase in the turnover of AA to pro-inﬂammatory eicosanoids [16].
In our recent work [9], we demonstrated that children with depressive disorder have a
higher omega-6/omega-3 ratio compared to healthy controls (24.23/1 vs. 19.3/1, p = 0.017),
and after three months of omega-3 FA supplementation, this ratio dropped to 7.6/1 in
DD patients.
Several studies have examined plasma/urine levels of thromboxane B (TXB), to deter-
mine the pro-inﬂammatory platelet activation as an indirect marker of inﬂammation in the
body [17,18]. It was found that a high omega-6/omega-3 ratio increases platelet aggrega-
tion and TXB2 formation [19]. Some studies have shown the higher TXB levels in depressed
individuals or in adult patients with bipolar disorder [18,20], while others have not con-
ﬁrmed this observation [21]. In children and adolescents, there is a lack of information on
the relationship between the thromboxane level and the severity of depression.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the growth factors, neurotrophins.
Deﬁciency in neurotrophins in adults may contribute to hippocampal pathology during
the development of depression. BDNF regulates a key transcription factor that is involved
in neuroprotection, neuroinﬂammation, and cellular growth [22]. However, there are
controversial reports about the effects of BDNF on depression [23]. Pandey et al. [24] have
found decreased gene and BDNF protein expression in lymphocytes, as well as decreased
BDNF levels in the platelets of adult and pediatric depressed patients. Sen et al. and
Yasui-Furukori et al. [25,26] also reported reduced BDNF levels in the serum of depressed
individuals, compared to healthy controls. However, an elevated level of serum BDNF
levels was found in depressed patients but did not correlate with the severity of depression
or suicidality [27]. Gender differences were found in the production of BDNF in the serum
of depressed adolescents. The lower BDNF levels were observed in females, compared to
adolescent males and healthy controls [28]. The association of omega-3 FA with BDNF level
can be explained by the activation of BDNF transcription by the DHA molecule through the
activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway [29]. However, the decreased serum DHA
concentrations were found in pediatric and adolescent patients with DD, when compared
to controls, whereas the BDNF level was not reduced in DD patients [28].
Evidence suggests that homocysteine (HCy) level is associated with depression, vas-
cular diseases, and disorder of neurotransmission in adults. In adults, an association
between the higher concentration of HCy and increased risk of depression was found.

Nutrients 2021, 13, 1095

It was calculated that the reduction of HCy by 0.19 mg/L could decrease depression by
about 20% [30]. Little information on HCy’s involvement in DD pathology in children
and adolescents is available. The increased HCy levels have been observed in depressed
adolescents, compared to the controls [31]. Chung et al. [32] found higher serum HCy levels
in boys (12–13 years old) with moderate-to-high anxiety levels. However, no association
was observed between serum HCy levels and depression in both boys and girls.
Vitamin D is known to be important for the calcium and phosphorous metabolism
and bone health, but it is also assumed to have an effect on mental health [33]. Vitamin D is
known to transcriptionally activate tryptophan hydroxylase 2, which forms serotonin from
tryptophan [34] and modulates the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, regulating cate-
cholamine production through vitamin D receptors [35]. In addition, EPA is able inﬂuence
the release of serotonin from presynaptic neurons by decreasing prostaglandin PG2 levels,
and DHA can modify serotonin receptors through modulation of membrane ﬂuidity in
neurons [36]. A causal relationship between vitamin D and depressive symptoms in adults
is not expected [37,38]. Following the vitamin D supplementation, an improvement in de-
pressive symptoms assessed by parents was observed in adolescent patients with the mild
depression and low vitamin D levels (<12 ng/mL), but not in self-rated depression [39]. A
negative association between vitamin D levels and severity of depression has been found
in depressed adolescents [31].
In our DEPOXIN project (Molecular basis of depression disorder and inﬂuence of
omega-3 fatty acid on clinical symptoms and biomarkers), we have demonstrated the
effect of ﬁsh oil emulsion rich in omega-3 FA on depressive symptoms in children and
adolescents with DD (the primary outcomes) [9,40]. The aim of our project was to ﬁnd the
relationship of plasma thromboxane B2, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, homocysteine,
and serum vitamin D levels with the depression severity, the omega-6/omega-3 FA ratio,
serum EPA, and DHA concentrations in depressed children and adolescents (the secondary
outcomes), as well as their comparison with healthy controls.
Our results should contribute to the understanding of the interrelationships between
the observed parameters in children and adolescents with depressive disorder.
2. Methods
Subjects, inclusion and exclusion criteria, study design and intervention, random-
ization, patient enrollment, and treatment have been described in detail in our previous
works [9,40].
Brieﬂy, we enrolled thirty-one outpatients with depressive disorder (DD) and twenty-
nine outpatients with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder (MADD) in our study (here-
inafter collectively referred DD + MADD as DD). Data were analyzed from 58 patients
who completed the 12-week intervention (Supplementary Materials Figure S1).
Twenty healthy children and adolescents were enrolled to the healthy control group.
Patients were randomized into two arms (ratio 1:1) and received daily 20 mL of
either ﬁsh oil emulsion rich in omega-3 FA (Om3 group) or a comparator of sunﬂower
oil emulsion rich in omega-6 FA (Om6 group) for 12 weeks, alongside their standard
antidepressant therapy (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; SSRI). The ﬁsh oil emulsion
comprised 2400 mg of total omega-3 FA (1000 mg of EPA and 750 mg of DHA, EPA:DHA
ratio = 1.33:1), and the sunﬂower oil emulsion contained 2467 mg of omega-6 linoleic acid.
Both emulsions were prepared by Cultech Ltd., Port Talbot, UK.
Patients were advised to follow their standard diet and report any changes in their
dietary habits throughout the study. The self-rated scale of Children’s Depression Inventory
(CDI) was used to rate the depression severity [41,42]. More serious depressive state is
represented by a higher CDI score.

2.1. Biochemical Parameters
Patients and healthy controls provided the venous blood samples after a 12 h overnight
fast. The blood samples were centrifuged (1200× g, 10 min) within 1 h of collection, and
the obtained serum and EDTA-plasma were stored at −80 ◦C, until further analysis.
Serum fatty acids were determined as methyl esters and separated by gas chromatog-
raphy. A detailed procedure is described in our most recent previous work [9]. Omega-
6/omega-3 ratio was calculated from (AA + LA)/(EPA + DHA) concentrations in µg/0.1 mL.
Thromboxane B2 in plasma was determined with a Thromboxane B2 EIA kit (Cay-
man Chemicals, No. 501020, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48108, MI, USA), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The concentration of thromboxane is presented in pg/mL.
BDNF was determined in plasma with a Human BDNF ELISA kit (Sigma-Aldrich, No.
RAB0026, St. Louis, MO, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and is expressed
in ng/mL.
Homocysteine was determined in plasma by Advia Centaur XP HCZ kit (Siemens, Ref
09087913, USA) in the Advia Centaur system (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown,
NY, USA). The homocysteine level is expressed in µmol/L.
Serum vitamin D was determined by a 25-OH Vitamin D total Elisa kit (Access 2 Im-
munoassay system, Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA). The vitamin D concentration is
expressed in ng/mL.
2.2. Statistical Analysis
Data are presented as the mean ± standard deviation (SD) for the normally distributed
variables or as a median and interquartile range for data showing departures from nor-
mality. Student’s t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to compare data between
weeks of intervention, depending on the normality of the data. A non-parametric Mann–
Whitney U test was used for the evaluation of difference between patients and healthy
controls. The effect of omega-3 fatty acids on the studied parameters following 12 weeks
of supplementation was evaluated with the two-way ANOVA test. The Spearman rank
correlation coefﬁcient was used for the correlation determination.
A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant. Data analyses were per-
formed, using StatsDirect® 3.3.4 (StatsDirect Ltd., Birkenhead, Merseyside CH42 8NQ,
UK) and IBM SPSS Statistics 25.0.0. The StatsDirect® program was used for graphical
representation of the data.
3. Results
The results of the effect of omega-3 FA on the depressive disorder symptom severity
(the study primary outcome) were published by Trebatická et al. [9]. Brieﬂy, a signiﬁcant
reduction in CDI scores was observed in the Om3 group after six weeks (−6.3 CDI score,
–22%) and 12 weeks (−6.5 CDI score, –24%), compared to the Om6 group. In the Om3
group, the ratio of omega-6/omega-3 was reduced from 24.2/1 to 7.6/1 (–69%) after six
weeks and to 9.93/1 (–60%) after 12 weeks. No changes were found in the Om6 group.
Basal serum levels of EPA (1.08 ± 0.61 µg/0.1 mL) and DHA (2.53 ± 1.02 µg/0.1 mL)
were signiﬁcantly lower (p < 0.001 for both), compared to the healthy controls (1.94 ± 0.8
and 3.74 ± 1.1 µg/0.1 mL, respectively). Following the omega-3 FA supplementation, EPA
and DHA levels increased to 462% and 270% of baseline [9].
At baseline, the levels of EPA and omega-6/omega-3 ratio correlated with symptoms’
severity [9].
3.1. Baseline Data
The baseline characteristics of study participants already published [9,40] are pre-
sented in Table 1.
We analyzed the correlation among depressive symptoms rated as a CDI score (details
are published in Trebatická et al., 2020 [9]) and BMI in all patients at the baseline. There was
no signiﬁcant relationship between CDI and BMI (r = 0.071, p = 0.297) in either depressed

males (r = −0.116, p = 0.36) or depressed females (r = 0.133, p = 0.116). However, a positive
correlation was found between BMI and the serum omega-6/omega-3 FA ratio in depressed
patients (r = 0.244, p = 0.039), but not in the control group (r = −0.240, p = 0.335).

The plasma TXB, BDNF, HCy, and serum vitamin D levels at the baseline are shown
in Table 2. The highly increased levels of TXB and reduced levels of vitamin D were
observed in the patient group, compared to the healthy controls at the baseline (p < 0.001
and p = 0.031, respectively). We evaluated possible differences in basal levels of BDNF,
CDI, omega-6/omega-3, EPA, and DHA between patients already treated and initially
diagnosed, and no signiﬁcant difference was found for any parameter. There was no
signiﬁcant difference in the BDNF and HCy levels between all patients and healthy controls.

However, we found strong gender differences in BDNF and HCy levels at the baseline
(Figure 1). Depressed boys had signiﬁcantly higher BDNF levels (794.55 ± 376 ng/mL)
and HCy levels (21.73 ± 14.1 µmol/L), compared to depressed girls at the baseline (BDNF:
596.41 ± 207 ng/mL, p = 0.027 and HCY: 10.4 ± 2.7 µmol/L, p < 0.0001). The statisti-
cally signiﬁcant gender differences in BDNF and HCy levels were not observed in the
healthy controls.

The levels of TXB were reduced at week six, to 77.3% of baseline (p = 0.194), and
at week 12 of supplementation, to 70.9% of baseline (p = 0.0374). Compared to baseline
(100%), TXB values reached 100.3% and 98.7% (not signiﬁcant, ns), following omega-6 FA
administration after 6 and 12 weeks (Table 3, Figure 2). However, BDNF levels increased
in the Om3 group, in contrast to the Om6 group, after six weeks to 130.9% of baseline
(p = 0.009) and after 12 weeks to 129.9% of baseline (p = 0.04) (Table 3 and Figure 3).
Signiﬁcant differences in TXB (p = 0.024) and BDNF (p = 0.011) levels were observed
between Om3 and Om6 groups after 12 weeks of supplementation (Table 3). No signiﬁcant
changes in HCy and vitamin D levels were observed.
A signiﬁcant treatment effect of omega-3 FA, compared to omega-6 FA, with two-way
ANOVA, in BDNF, was conﬁrmed after 12 weeks of intervention (p = 0.021). The TXB
showed only a borderline signiﬁcant treatment effect (p = 0.091).

We evaluated the correlations of DHA and EPA levels with TXB and BDNF in all
patients (FA levels were published in detail in our prior work [9]) (Figure 5). Surprisingly,
BDNF did not correlate signiﬁcantly with DHA or EPA, in contrast to TXB.

4. Discussion
The primary outcome of the DEPOXIN project was to investigate the effect of omega-3
FA on the severity of depression as determined by the CDI score, compared to the effect of
omega-6 FA. We were the ﬁrst to present a relationship between the omega-6/omega-3 FA
ratio and the depression severity in children and adolescents [9].
We found in DD patients a positive correlation between BMI and omega-6/omega-3
ratio, but not between BMI and CDI. This contradicts the ﬁndings in a Swedish study
where the authors found that obesity is associated with a risk of anxiety and depression
independent of other factors (neuropsychiatric disorders and low socioeconomic status
of the family) [43]. However, it should be noted that, in our group of depressed patients,
74.6% were normal weight, 23.7% were overweight, and only 1.7% were obese.
The secondary outcome of this trial was the comparison of the levels of thromboxane,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor, homocysteine, and vitamin D in the pediatric population
with DD and healthy controls, as well as the investigation of the effect of the omega-3 FA

supplementation alongside the standard antidepressant therapy on depressive symptoms.
A signiﬁcant increase of TXB levels by 299% was observed in the group of depressed
children and adolescents, compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001) independent of gender.
Thromboxane B2 (TXB2) is a marker of platelet activation. It is formed from AA under
catalytic activity of cyclooxygenase (COX) and could be considered as an indirect marker
of activated inﬂammatory pathways [20].
Consistent with the conclusions of Colasanto et al. [14], TXB levels signiﬁcantly corre-
lated with depressive symptoms in our patients, evaluated as the CDI score. Previously,
we have demonstrated a signiﬁcant correlation of the omega-6/omega-3 FA ration with
CDI scores [9]. Similarly, the current results conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant positive correlation
between TXB and omega-6/omega-3 FA ratio (p = 0.03) in the same patient cohort. These
ﬁndings support the conclusions of DiNicolantonio and OKeefe [44], that an inﬂammatory
response of the organism plays an important role in the pathophysiology of DD in children.
Moreover, our previously published results [9,40] suggest that the omega-6/omega-3 FA
ratio plays a role in the pathophysiology of DD in pediatric patients. In our pediatric
patients supplemented with omega-3 FA, the plasma TXB levels were signiﬁcantly reduced
after 12 weeks, as compared to the omega-6 FA group. This could be explained by the fact
that the omega-6/omega-3 FA ratio is reduced by the supplementation, [9] resulting in the
displacement of omega-6 FA (arachidonic acid) from its pro-inﬂammatory effects.
Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein that is implicated in the patho-
physiology of depression. We did not ﬁnd altered plasma BDNF levels in our pediatric
patients, compared to healthy controls, contrary to the results of Pandey et al. [24], who
found a decreased platelet BDNF gene and protein expression in depressed pediatric
patients, compared to controls. The undetected difference in BDNF levels between DD
patients and healthy children in our study at baseline could be explained by the antidepres-
sant treatment of 37% of our patients before inclusion into the study, as antidepressants
have been found to increase BDNF in blood [25]. However, we found the signiﬁcantly
reduced BDNF levels in depressed female patients, as compared to depressed male pa-
tients, to be in line with the results of Tsuchimine et al. [28]. This ﬁnding is consistent
with our previous observation, where females had higher CDI scores (more severe symp-
toms of depression) than males at the baseline [9]. In addition, the role of BDNF in the
pathophysiology of DD is supported by the ﬁnding of a signiﬁcant negative correlation
of BDNF with depression severity (CDI) (p ≤0.001) in our pediatric patients. In contrast
to the ﬁndings of Pallavi et al. [45], who conﬁrmed this correlation in pediatric males but
not females, we have found a signiﬁcant negative correlation of BDNF with CDI in both
males (p = 0.014) and females (p = 0.009). We have also detected a negative correlation of
BDNF with omega-6/omega-3 ratio (p = 0.038) in all patients. We realize that assessing
the situation in the brain through systemic markers may not always be accurate. Similarly,
the pathway of BDNF into the blood cannot be inferred from a human study, unless its
two-way brain–blood transport is taken into account. BDNF synthesis is thought to be
transcriptionally promoted by DHA [29]. However, we did not observe a signiﬁcant corre-
lation between BDNF and DHA or EPA, despite potential bidirectional transport of BDNF
and possible transport of omega-3 FA across the blood–brain barrier (BBB) [46]. On the
other hand, a negative association was observed between the depression severity (CDI)
and EPA, but not DHA [9]. However, after dividing patients by diagnosis (DD subgroup
and MADD), a signiﬁcant correlation was found only between BDNF and EPA in the DD
subgroup, but not with DHA, which similarly conﬁrms the already published results [9].
The supplementation with omega-3 FA for 12 weeks signiﬁcantly increased the plasma
BDNF levels in all patients, compared to omega-6 FA intervention. It can be assumed that
low concentrations of EPA and DHA contribute to the pathophysiology of DD in different
ways. Among other things, the effectiveness of omega-3 FA supplementation depends
on the accuracy of the diagnosis, age, EPA to DHA ratio, and the overall condition of
the patients.

Homocysteine (HCy) is a non-proteinogenic sulfurated amino acid [47]. No differences
in HCy levels in depressed adult patients and healthy individuals [47–50] or an association
between HCy and DD were observed [47]. The increased risk of depression was reported
only in older adults with a high HCy level [30]. Less information is available in depressed
pediatric and adolescent patients. In our population, we did not observe an increased level
of HCy or its correlation with CDI score or with the omega-6/omega3 ratio, contrary to the
results of Esnafoglu and Ozturan [31], who found a signiﬁcantly higher level of HCy and
a positive correlation of HCy with the CDI score in depressed children and adolescents.
Contrary to the observations of Chung et al. [32], who investigated anxiety in healthy
students (boys 12 to 13 years old), we found a higher level of HCy in depressed males,
compared to females (p < 0.001), but not in the healthy controls. Chung et al. [32] explained
their observation in students through biological interactions between sex hormones in
males and homocysteine [51]. However, the question remains why the observed differences
in HCy levels in the males and females of our pediatric patients were not found also in our
cohort of healthy controls. We did not ﬁnd an association between depression and HCy
in female or male patients. When we divided our pediatric patients by diagnosis (depres-
sive disorder subgroup, DD-S), and mixed anxiety and depressive disorder, MADD), no
statistical differences in HCy levels, nor the correlations between HCy and CDI or HCy
and omega-6/omega-3 ratio were observed. The effect of omega-3 FA on HCy levels is
discussed especially in adults, in association with cardiovascular and other diseases [52].
HCy is a metabolite of the C1 cycle and can be converted either to methionine by trans-
methylation in the presence of vitamin B12 and folate or to cysteine by trans-sulfuration
in the presence of vitamin B6. In addition, it binds closely to lipids via betaine, which is
formed from phosphatidylcholine upon release of choline. Betaine is then a cofactor for
HCy methylation. In addition, other enzymes involved in the C1 cycle may be affected by
omega-3 FA. For example, a precursor in HCy synthesis, S-adenosylhomocysteine inhibits
phosphatidylcholine production and negatively correlates with DHA. However, other
mechanisms are also possible [52]. However, the extent to which these relationships apply
to children is not yet known.
The 12-week supplementation with the omega-3 FA or omega-6 FA did not have
an impact on HCy levels. As our results do not lead to a clear conclusion regarding the
association between HCy and the depression severity in children and adolescents, or the
inﬂuence of gender, more studies with a well-deﬁned diagnosis of DD are needed to
conﬁrm the ﬁndings.
Some observational studies highlighted an inverse association between serum vitamin
D levels and depressive symptoms in adults [53]. On the contrary, the Mendelian random-
ization study on depression [37] and similar studies of Milaneschi et al. [38], Michaëlsson
et al. [54] and Manson et al. [55]) indicate no association of vitamin D with depressive
symptoms. However, the meta-analysis by Spedding [35] showed that the size effect of
vitamin D on depression is comparable to the effect of antidepressants. The supplemen-
tation with vitamin D had a beneﬁcial effect on the DD symptoms in 12 studies where
the major depressive disorder diagnosis was established [56]. However, there is a lack of
randomized, controlled trials in children and adolescents. In line with Libuda et al. [39]
ﬁndings, we have observed the serum vitamin D deﬁciency (<20 ng/mL) in our group
of depressed patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.031), but our healthy control
group also had an insufﬁcient level of vitamin D (<30 ng/mL). Libuda et al. [39] did not
conﬁrmed a vitamin D effect on self-rated depression; however, the parents reported less
signiﬁcant depressive symptoms. Similarly, the vitamin D levels in our patients did not
correlate with the severity of depression determined with self-rating CDI score or with
omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Neither omega-3 FA nor omega-6 FA supplementation had any
effect on vitamin D levels during the 12-week intervention. Both substances (omega-3
FA, vitamin D) affect the biosynthesis and serotonin levels and have an anti-inﬂammatory
effect and some other common features [34]. However, their interactions are not fully
known. In hemodialysis patients, Lee et al. [57] found that omega-3 FAs could affect the

Nutrients 2021, 13, 1095

conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. However, our ﬁndings do
not conﬁrm a causal relationship between vitamin D and depressive symptoms in children
and adolescents.
Study Limitations
We did not determine any of the direct markers of inﬂammation (IL-6, IL-1, TNF, or
others) in depressed children and adolescents, for technical reasons. Patients had hsCRP
levels in the physiological range. We used an indirect marker, thromboxane, to indirectly
monitor the inﬂammatory response.
The food diaries were not collected during the study. The patients were advised to
maintain their normal diet and avoid the consumption of any fatty acid supplements or
antioxidants throughout the study.
We are aware of a small number of males [9], as compared to females. Therefore, the
gender assessment should be interpreted with caution.
5. Conclusions
Our ﬁndings suggest the potential involvement of thromboxane and brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the pathophysiology of depressive disorder in children and
adolescents. A signiﬁcant positive correlation was found between the depression severity
or omega-6/omega-3 FA ratio and plasma thromboxane B and a negative correlation
with BDNF. The children and adolescents with depressive disorders had higher levels of
thromboxane B and reduced levels of vitamin D, when compared to healthy controls. The
supplementation with omega-3 FA alongside the standard antidepressant therapy may
have a beneﬁcial effect on thromboxane levels. However, the positive effect of omega-
3 FA supplementation on BDNF levels was seen only in depressed patients diagnosed
with depressive disorder, but not in patients with mixed anxiety and depressive disorder
(evaluated through a correlation between EPA, DHA, and BDNF). These ﬁndings are
encouraging and need to be conﬁrmed in a larger study of the pediatric population.
