A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA ]
Abstract
Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are the most
implemented methodologies to detect alterations of both gray and white matter (WM).
However, the role of WM in mental disorders is still not well defined. We aimed at
clarifying the role of WM disruption in schizophrenia and at identifying the most
frequently involved brain networks. A systematic literature search was conducted to
identify VBM and DTI studies focusing on WM alterations in patients with
schizophrenia compared to control subjects. We selected studies reporting the
coordinates of WM reductions and we performed the anatomical likelihood estimation
(ALE). Moreover, we labelled the WM bundles with an anatomical atlas and
compared VBM and DTI ALE-scores of each significant WM tract. A total of 59
studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. WM alterations were reported in 31 and 34
foci with VBM and DTI methods, respectively. The most occurred WM bundles in
both VBM and DTI studies and largely involved in schizophrenia were long
projection fibers, callosal and commissural fibers, part of motor descending fibers,
and fronto-temporal-limbic pathways. The meta-analysis showed a widespread WM
disruption in schizophrenia involving specific cerebral circuits instead of well-defined
regions.

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 2
1. Introduction
For many years, schizophrenia has been conceptualized as an inter- intra-
hemispheric disconnection syndrome characterized by disconnections in gray matter
(GM) areas (Friston and Frith, 1995; McGuire and Frith, 1996; Friston, 1998). Friston
and Frith (1995) suggested the “disconnection hypothesis” according to which
functional abnormalities involve not only specific GM regions, but also impaired
communications between such regions (i.e., prefrontal-temporal and temporal-limbic
pathways). Subsequently, McGuire and Frith (1996) postulated the existence of a
disrupted fronto-temporal-limbic connection by observing anatomical structural GM
alterations. These studies suggested the presence of a widespread GM disruption
instead of well-defined alterations underlying the involvement of white matter (WM)
connections across different areas. Although GM alterations associated with
schizophrenia were examined thoroughly (Honea, et al., 2005; Glahn et al., 2008;
Olabi et al., 2011), the role of the WM in the illness pathogenesis is still unclear.
Recently, several meta-analytic studies investigated the role of WM
irregularities. A meta-analysis of 15 diffusion tensor imaging (DTT) studies with
patients affected by chronic schizophrenia, observed significant fractional anisotropy
(FA) reductions in left frontal and left temporal WM regions, namely the genu and the
splenium of corpus callosum, the cingulum bundle, the left anterior thalamic
radiation, the left corticobulbar tract, the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus
(IFOF), the fornix, and the left inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) (Ellison-Wright
and Bullmore, 2009). Moreover, Di, Chan, and Gong (2009), by conducting a meta-
analytic procedure implemented on 17 voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies,
described WM alterations of chronic and first-episode schizophrenia (FES) patients
and observed significant WM reductions in frontal regions and in the bilateral internal

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 3
capsule. Finally, a recent meta-analysis, examined WM alterations in patients with
FES, showing significant WM reductions in the corpus callosum, the cingulum
bundle, the left ILF, and the left IFOF (Yao et al., 2013). Taken together, these studies
emphasize that alterations of WM tracts involving frontal, temporal, and limbic
circuits play an important role in schizophrenia, thus reinforcing the disconnection
hypothesis.
Despite the great relevance of these meta-analytic studies, some critical issues
remain to be addressed. First, two studies (Di et al., 2009; Yao et al., 2013) focused
only on patients with FES but they did not evaluate possible effects of illness
progression or age-dependent factors that may have influenced WM anomalies. A
recent review by Chiapponi and colleagues (2013a) highlighted a significant influence
of illness progression in WM anomalies, so that impaired WM regions such as the
corpus callosum, the uncinate fasciculus, and the regions of frontal and temporal WM
continuously worsen over time. Their results indicated a possible association between
illness progression and a faster decline of WM trajectories. In a more recent study
about structural brain changes in schizophrenia over time, Cropley and colleagues
(2017) found that patients with schizophrenia showeda significantly fast rate of WM
deterioration correlated with age, indicating a confounding relationship between WM
reductions and patients’ age. Taken together, these studies support the hypothesis that
WM alterations worsen over time concurrently with aging and progression of illness.
A second critical issue is that the adoption of a single technique (1.e., VBM or DTT)
may not allow to evaluate properly the total amount of WM alterations given that
VBM and DTI methods detect different features of WM alterations (Ashburner and
Friston, 2000; Le Bihan et al., 2001). Third, since 2013 several authors, who were not

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 4
included in previous meta-analytic studies, investigated WM alterations by using both
VBM or DTI methodologies.
Finally, by an in-depth examination of the literature, we observed several
heterogeneous findings in VBM and DTI studies. For example, some VBM studies
agreed in finding WM reductions in frontal and temporal areas regardless of the stage
of illness (e.g., Paillére-Martinot et al., 2001; Spalletta et a., 2003; Price et al., 2006;
Witthaus et al., 2008; Kim and Jeong, 2015; Lyu et al., 2015), but it remains still
unclear which WM tract is damaged in these regions. Indeed, some VBM studies
reported differences between patients and healthy subjects in different regions, such
as the internal capsule (Suzuki et al., 2002; Hulshoff Pol et al., 2004), the superior
longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) (Antonova et al., 2005), the cingulum bundle (Wagner
et al., 2013; Singh et al., 2015), the corpus callosum (Sigmundsson et al., 2001), the
optic radiations (Ananth et al., 2002), and the cerebellum (Singh et al., 2014 and
2015), providing a great heterogeneity in findings of these studies. Moreover, several
DTI studies reported different tracts involved in WM aberration and a clear
convergence of the results of these studies is still missing. Several DTI studies
showed different WM aberrations expressed as FA reductions in patients with
schizophrenia compared to healthy subjects in different bundles, for example in the
internal capsule (Buchsbaum et al., 2006; Kanaan et al., 2009; Nakamura et al., 2012)
and in long projection fibers such as IFOF (Rotarska-Jagiela et al., 2009), inferior and
superior longitudinal fasciculus (Buchsbaum et al., 2006; Seok et al., 2007; Shergill et
al., 2007), and arcuate fasciculus (Hubl et al., 2004). This observed heterogeneity in
published findings prompted us to try to find a clearer convergence between published
studies. In addition, given that important findings have been published during the last

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 5
three years, further and definitive meta-analytic studies may clarify how aberrations
of WM pathways are involved in schizophrenia.
To address the aforementioned issues, we conducted a systematic literature
research to investigate the role of WM reductions in schizophrenia by using the
coordinate-based anatomical likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis of VBM and DTI
studies. ALE is a quantitative voxel-based meta-analysis method that gives anatomical
information by selecting studies comparison (Laird et al., 2005; Eickhoff et al., 2009;
Eickhoff et al., 2012; Eickhoff et al., 2016). In ALE analysis, a pool of coordinates is
extract from a single neuroimaging study. In the neuroimaging studies of cerebral
alterations, a triad of coordinates (x, y, z) given in a standard stereotactic space
usually represent the highest point of alteration (increase or decrease) of a defined
brain area, as the center of a cluster of voxels. This methodology is widely adopted in
neuroimaging meta-analyses, in particular for structural brain data. The ALE output is
an overview of previous selected studies, giving information about results
concordance. The use of ALE analysis on WM studies of schizophrenia could be
helpful to better understand which are the most altered WM tracts in this illness.
Overall, we aimed at summarizing previous studies results on WM reductions
in patients with schizophrenia and clarifying the possible concordance between
findings of different studies. We considered the following schizophrenic categories:
FES, early-onset schizophrenia (EOS), late-onset schizophrenia (LOS), and chronic
schizophrenia, to elucidate the relationship between WM pathways abnormalities and
pathogenesis of schizophrenia spectrum disorders. An in-house developed MATLAB
routine was employed for coordinate data analyzing and, subsequently, defining ALE
maps of altered foci pooled from the selected studies. In addition, a series of meta-
regression were computed to evaluate effects of age-dependent factors or illness

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 6
progression on WM anomalies in patients with schizophrenia. Moreover, we
performed a direct comparison between VBM and DTI data to clarify potential
differences in WM reductions as detected by those two techniques. On this basis, we
may hypothesize the presence of WM tracts commonly detected that could be
represent the most impaired WM bundles in schizophrenia.
2. Methods
2.1. Study selection
We followed PRISMA statement in selecting papers and presenting the results
(Moher et al., 2009). The electronic research literature database included PubMed
from early 2000 to January 2016. Studies selection was supervised and approved by
one neuroimaging expert (FC) and one clinical expert (AZ). Titles, abstracts and
topics were searched using the following combined terms: “schizophrenia” and “white
matter” plus “voxel-based morphometry”; “schizophrenia” and “white matter” plus
“VBM”; “schizophrenia” and “white matter” plus “diffusion tensor imaging”;
“schizophrenia” and “white matter” plus “DTI”. The search terms had to be present in
abstract or title of the selected study. Articles were considered to be eligible according
to the following criteria: 1) studies published as original works: we excluded meta-
analytic results and we considered only original data of WM reductions; 2)
publication of WM reduction peak coordinates in a standard stereotactic space: for
VBM studies, we pooled coordinates of volumetric reductions, while for DTI studies
we selected the coordinates representing foci of decreased FA; 3) comparison between
patients with schizophrenia and healthy subjects; 4) absence of patients affected by
comorbid mental illness in order to avoid a confounding effect of a concomitant
mental illness; 5) data extraction with whole-brain or whole-white matter analyses; 6)
exclusion of studies which implemented Region of Interest (ROT) analysis or an

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 7
equivalent method for data analysis, so that studies that might have neglected
significant data because implemented a well-defined region analysis were excluded;
7) writing in English. Figure 1 shows the detailed flow-diagram of studies selection.

2.2. Anatomical Likelihood Estimation (ALE)
Before performing ALE analysis, we normalized the reported coordinates of
each selected paper in a stereotactic standard space: we transformed the reported
coordinates from MNI space to Talairach space by using the ICBM2Tal transform
(Lancaster et al., 2007; Laird et al., 2010). Subsequently, we performed the ALE
meta-analyses to estimate WM reductions across the selected articles by using the in-
house MATLAB routine (MATLAB 2016a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick,
Massachusetts, United States), which implemented the ALE algorithm proposed by
Laird et al. (2005) and further improved by Eickhoff et al. (2009), Eickhoff et al.
(2012), and Eickhoff et al. (2016).
In the ALE analysis, the anatomical foci (represented by the x, y, z coordinate
system) are treated not as a single point but as spatial probability distributions
centered at the given coordinates (peak). Thus, each reported coordinate is considered
as a central point of a 3D Gaussian probability distribution that models the spatial
uncertainty associated with the foci and defined by a default full-width half maximum
(FWHM). The FWHM is defined by the number of subjects in each experiments as
reported in Eickhoff et al. (2009). The ALE method uses the sample size of each
experiment to weight the size of the distribution around foci, assuming that a larger
sample size should have less associated spatial uncertainty (Eickhoff et al., 2009;
Eickhoff et al., 2012). In other words, larger studies are less sensitive to sampling
errors and, thus, coordinates values should be closer to their true location, leading to a
higher validity of meta-analytic results. For each selected study of structural
neuroimaging, the ALE approach yield to a Modeled Anatomic (MA) map containing
the voxels associated to the probability of observing alterations (in our analysis, we
considered only WM reductions). If any alteration was not observed, the probability

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 10
value associated to the selected voxel is equal to 0 (Eickhoff et al., 2009; Eickhoff et
al., 2012). In these maps, voxels union forms a cluster which size increases when
more studies report foci near to each other. Thus, bigger clusters are more informative
about the probability of observing alterations in the given foci because of the
convergence of studies reporting the same coordinates (Eickhoff et al., 2012). Each
MA map is combined in a single map to provide an estimation of the spatial
convergence across the selected studies. The union of all the MA maps allows to
calculate voxel-wise ALE scores that are tested against an empirical null hypothesis
representing a random spatial association between experiments; this comparison
distinguishes the “true” ALE scores from those obtained by random choice (Eickhoff
et al., 2009; Eickhoff et al., 2012; Eickhoff et al., 2016).
The ALE analysis was performed on two separated groups of data, one for
VBM studies and one for DTI studies, thus obtaining two ALE maps. The ALE maps
were computed at an FDR-corrected threshold of p < 0.05 and a minimum cluster size
of K > 50 mm’.
2.3. WM Labelling
We used the BVQXTools, a MATLAB toolbox (available from
http://support. brainvoyager.com/available-tools/52-matlab-tools-bvxqtools.html), to
transform the ALE maps in a compatible format for the analysis on BrainVoyager QX
software (http://www.brainvoyager.com, version 2.3.5). Subsequently, we uploaded
the transformed maps on Brain Voyager QX to visualize the WM tracts emerged from
our meta-analysis on a standard Talairach template. We built a specific Volume of
Interest (VOI) map, representing a 3D model of a WM mask that contains a list of
coordinates (x, y, z) specifying the voxels belonging to the selected VOI. The WM
mask is based on the WM atlas developed by Catani and Thiebaut de Schotten (2008),

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 11
so each WM tract represented in the VOI map is correctly named following the atlas.
The transformed ALE maps and the 3D model of the WM mask could be both
visualized at the same time, so that it was possible to evaluate where a cluster
emerging from ALE map overlapped the WM mask. This procedure allowed to
evaluate whether a significant cluster belonged to a specific WM tract, thus defining
the name of the involved WM tract. Finally, we calculated the average ALE p-value
expressed by the voxels of an entire WM bundle, so that each WM tract that emerged
from the ALE analysis had an ALE score mediated by the total number of voxels of
the same tract.
2.4. Conjunction analysis
We conducted a conjunction analysis to test the existence of overlapping
clusters between VBM and DTI studies. VBM and DTI are two distinct
methodologies for brain structural investigation and they detect different aspects of
WM alteration. Thus, we hypothesized that VBM and DTI would produce different
results on WM alterations. Indeed, if the conjunction analysis would have not found
any overlapping clusters for the same WM tract, it would be possible that clusters
identified by VBM or DTI were different for the same WM bundle. To test this
hypothesis, the transformed ALE maps were uploaded to BrainVoyager QX to obtain
volume maps from each ALE map. These anatomical-resolution volume maps (AR-
VMP) were stored by Brain Voyager QX as files of volume maps containing statistical
results in 3D format. By using specific functions, Brain Voyager QX produced two
distinct VOI maps for VBM and DTI studies starting from the transformed ALE
maps. A third VOI map representing the logical union of the two maps was created.
This final map contains the overlapped clusters of the two ALE maps and, thus, it

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 12
represents the significant clusters outlined by ALE analysis of both VBM and DTI
studies.
2.5. VBM-DTI comparison
Once obtained the WM labeled tab, we organized the WM bundle in 3 major
cerebral circuits: (a) inter-hemispheric connections, including the anterior
commissure, the corpus callosum and the fornix; (b) fronto-temporal-limbic pathways,
including the arcuate fasciculus and its segmentations, the cingulum bundle, the
uncinate fasciculus, the optic radiations, the internal capsule, and the long projection
fibers as ILF, IFOF, and SLF; (c) cortico-cerebellar tracts, including the internal
capsule, the cortico-spinal tracts, the cortico-ponto-cerebellum tracts, and the
cerebellar penduculi. Subsequently, we reported the average ALE p-values obtained
from ALE analysis of VBM and DTI studies on a double bar chart.
2.6. Meta-Regression
To examine potential effects of age, duration of illness, and gender, we
conducted a series of meta-regressions with the Signed Differential Mapping (SDM)
software (Radua and Mataix-Cols, 2009; Radua and Mataix-Cols, 2012; Radua et al.,
2012), which implemented linear regressions, weighted by the square root of the
sample size and intra-studies and between-studies variance (Radua and Mataix-Cols,
2009). The main output for each selected variable is a map of the regression slope,
representing the amount of volumetric change (in VBM studies comparison) and FA
change (in DTI studies comparison) associated with each variable. For each examined
variable, SDM software returns a map containing significant clusters of WM changes,
with associated peak coordinates, significant p-values, and SDM-Z scores. Positive
SDM-Z scores represent positive correlations, while negative SDM-Z scores represent
negative correlations. The voxel level threshold of regression was automatically given

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 13
at p < 0.005, while the extent threshold for cluster size was minimum 10 voxels. The
variable “gender” was dichotomized to have value 1 (sample entirely composed by
male patients) or value 0 (sample entirely composed by female patients) (Bora et al.,
2011). We conducted separate meta-regressions for VBM and DTI studies. For a
clearer view, we organized the significant clusters emerged from each regression in
different maps using MRIcron (Rorden et al., 2007).
3. Results
3.1. Included studies and sample characteristics
The initial review process yielded 830 studies. Five hundred twenty-four
records remained after duplicates removed, 318 of which were excluded due to not
pertinent abstract or title. Among the remaining 206 studies, 65 studies were rejected
due to the lack of peak coordinates of altered WM tracts voxels, and other 82 studies
did not meet the inclusion criteria. Finally, a total of 59 articles published between
2000 and 2016 were included in our meta-analysis, 25 VBM studies and 34 DTI
studies (Figure 1). Overall, our study included 2,198 patients with schizophrenia and
2,171 comparison subjects, and analyzed 150 foci of WM volume reductions (from
VBM studies) and 237 foci of FA decrease (from DTI studies). Table 1 summarizes
the demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants.

3.3. Conjunction analysis
The conjunction analysis between ALE maps from VBM and DTI studies
found no overlapping clusters on the same WM tract, indicating that DTI and VBM
actually detected different aspects of WM alteration (1.e., volumetric/macrostructural
vs. diffusion/microstructural) and, consequentially, the clusters identified by VBM or
DTI were different for the same WM tract
3.4. VBM-DTI comparison
Figure 4 shows ALE scores for each significant WM bundle emerged from
ALE analysis. On the vertical axis we represented the ALE scores , whereas on the
horizontal axis we listed the WM bundles emerged from our data analysis, according
to Catani’s WM atlas. We found that the left superior cerebellar penduculus, the left
long segment of AF, the right cortico-ponto-cerebellum tract, and the left anterior
segment of AF were activated (occurred) only in DTI studies, whereas the right
anterior segment of AF was activated (occurred) only in VBM studies. The other
tracts that were activated in both type of studies were the bilateral IFOF, the bilateral
ILF, the bilateral posterior segment of AF, the bilateral optic radiation, the bilateral
inferior cerebellar penduculus, the bilateral UF, the bilateral cingulum, the bilateral
SLF1, the bilateral SLF2, the corpus callosum, the bilateral cortico-spinal tract, the
right superior cerebellar penduculus, the internal capsule, the fornix, the left cortico-

3.5. Meta-Regression
Meta-regression analyses of VBM and DTI studies suggested that age,
duration of illness, and gender were associated to WM reductions. Table 3
summarizes the results of meta-regression analysis, while Figure 5 and Figure 6 show
significant clusters (p < 0.005) both positively and negatively associated with each
regressor respectively from analyses of VBM and DTI studies.
As for VBM studies, older patients (higher mean age) showed significant WM
reductions in the left AF and left splenitum of corpus callosum, compared to younger
patients (lower mean age) that showed significant associations with WM reduction in
left ILF and the right genu of corpus callosum. Longer duration of illness was
significantly associated with WM reductions in the internal capsule and the right AF,
whereas shorter duration of illness was associated with WM reductions in the fornix
and the left genu of corpus callosum. Finally, a higher percentage of male patients
showed significantly reduced WM traits in the left UF, the right SLF3, and the left
cingulum, whereas a higher percentage of females showed significantly reduced WM
traits in the right cortico spinal tract and the anterior commissure.
Meta-regressions of DTI studies reported that older patients showed
significantly reduced WM in the right splenium of corpus callosum and the right
cortico spinal tract, whereas younger patients showed significant associations with
WM reductions of left cortico spinal tract, the right cingulum bundle, the WM of right
superior temporal gyrus, and the left SLF3. Association between a longer duration of
illness, and WM reductions in the bilateral UF, the left ILF, the right IFOF and the
right posterior cingulum bundle was found, whereas shorter duration of illness was
associated with significant WM reductions in the right anterior cingulum bundle, the
WM of right median cingulate gyrus, and the left SLF3. Finally, a higher percentage

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 28
of male patients showed significantly reduced WM traits in the right SLF2, the WM
of left inferior temporal gyrus, the bilateral SLF3, the WM of right superior temporal
gyrus, the right posterior segment of AF, and the left body of corpus callosum,
whereas a higher percentage of female patients showed significantly reduced WM
traits in the right genu of corpus callosum, the right IFOF, the right SLF3, the left
superior cerebellar penduculus, the left optic radiation, and the left long segment of
AF.

4. Discussion
The results of this meta-analysis showed a widespread WM disruption in
schizophrenia involving specific cerebral circuits instead of well-defined regions.
Long projection fibers, callosal and commissural fibers, part of motor descending
fibers, and fronto-temporal-limbic pathways were the most frequent WM bundles
detected by both VBM and DTI techniques. We may hypothesize that differences in
results of previous meta-analytic works (Ellison-Wright and Bullmore 2009; Di et al.,
2009; Yao et al.; 2013) compared with those of the current meta-analysis were found
due to the number of eligible articles considered. Indeed, Ellison-wright and Bullmore
(2009) included 15 studies in their meta-analytic work, Di et al. (2009) and Yao et al.
(2013) included respectively only 17 and 8 studies whereas the present work included
59 studies. Given that the ALE algorithm is sensitive to sample size (Eickhoff et al.,
2009; Eickhoff et al., 2012), a larger number of selected studies would produce more
consistent and substantial results compared to the previous meta-analyses.
The current study is the first meta-analysis that investigated WM reductions in
patients with schizophrenia using both VBM and DTI studies of the last 15 years
analyzing and comparing WM reductions associated to each technique. The VBM-
DTI comparison indicated that a group of WM bundles were activated in both VBM
and DTI studies, although the conjunction analysis revealed that both methodologies
outlined WM alterations in different clusters of the same tract. Indeed, the lack of
overlapping clusters highlighted by the conjunction analysis may indicate that VBM
and DTI actually detect different aspects of WM alteration. Although these
differences may depend on data collection or different parameters implemented
during the scan acquisition (Oouchi et al., 2007; Melonakos et al., 2001), another
hypothesis is that the WM tracts might show single or multiple “type” of alteration

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 34
(i.e., volumetric and/or diffusion alterations). Overall, given that different clusters of
WM reduction detected by both VBM and DTI were found on the same tract, our
results may suggest that alterations of these tracts in different clusters are related to a
more severe damage derived from both volumetric and diffusion alterations and may
represent the “core tracts” of schizophrenia.
An aberrant diffusivity could be represented by anomalies in FA, as revealed
by DTI methods (Poretti et al., 2012). FA is sensitive to the disruption of myelin
integrity (Kubicki and Shenton, 2014). Genetic and post-mortem studies had shown
the involvement of both myelin and oligodendrocytes in the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia, suggesting that anomalies in axonal communication observed in
schizophrenia could be partially related to aberrant WM connectivity between
different brain regions (Kubicki and Shenton, 2014). Given that oligodendrocytes
produce myelin and provide facility of communication between brain regions
(Shenton, Whitford and Kubicki, 2010), they may play a central role in the
pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Indeed, a diffusion alteration may reflect
anomalies in the number or in the functions of oligodendrocytes, providing anomalies
in speed conduction among myelinated axons (Whitford, Kubicki and Shenton, 2011).
These anomalies could lead, at least, to confound the origin of neural signals and to a
consequentially confusion between internally and externally generated events (e.g.,
hallucinations) (Whitford, Kubicki and Shenton, 2011).
Given that aberrant communication could represent a general disruption of
functional connectivity in schizophrenia, the functional anomalies could partially arise
from structural deficits (Williams, 2008; Fitzsimmons, Kubicki and Shenton, 2013).
Indeed, structural deficits outlined by VBM methods could highlight synaptic and
cytoarchitectural aberrations, representing a possible loss of organization in the

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 35
affected brain circuits of schizophrenia (Williams, 2008). The aberrant organization
could be due to the consequentially changes in synaptic density during maturation and
development (Andersen, 2003). The presence of significant structural reductions in
schizophrenia could reflect an excessive pruning process involving the WM changes
observed in schizophrenia. The loss of neurons cellular body and their associated
neuropil due to an extensive pruning might indicate that their myelinated axons are
overly eliminated in schizophrenia (Williams, 2008). Normal pruning is triggered by a
reduction of the number of available trophic factors and the overpruning could depend
by an abnormal largely reduction of these trophic factors. Thus, the overpruning
might probably reflect the typical GM and WM reductions of schizophrenia detected
by VBM methods (Williams, 2008).
The WM disruptions showed in our met-analysis, did not involve only single
regions, but a large number of whole-brain connecting areas. Thus, WM abnormalities
in schizophrenia may reflect a disruption of neural circuits and a GM dysfunctional
communication (Friston and Frith, 1995; Friston, 1998), affecting inter-hemispheric
connectivity (Crow, 1998), fronto-temporal-limbic connections, (McGuire and Frith,
1996; Ardekani et al., 2003) and cortical-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit
(Andreasen et al., 1998). The alteration of inter-hemispheric commissural fibers such
as the anterior commissure, corpus callosum, and fornix, is a critical evidence of the
disruption of inter-hemispheric connectivity (Crow, 1998). A damage of these
structures implicates impaired integration of motor, perceptual, and cognitive
information crossing both hemispheres because of specific alterations in the anterior
commissure (Hulshoff Pol et al., 2004; Schlosser et al., 2007), the corpus callosum
(Sigmundsson et al., 2001; Spalletta et al., 2003; Sugranyes et al., 2012; Ellison-

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 36
Wright et al., 2011; Reidet al., 2015), and the fornix (Witthaus et al., 2008; Kanaan et
al., 2009; Guo et al., 2012; ; Sugranyes et al., 2012; Reid et al., 2015).
Different authors (Friston and Frith, 1995; Frith, 1995; McGuire and Frith,
1996; Ardekani et al., 2003) have postulated the existence of a cortical-thalamic
network disruption in patients with schizophrenia involving frontal, temporal, and
limbic regions. Similarly, our analysis showed an involvement of the main WM tracts
that link frontal, temporal, and limbic areas, such as the internal capsule, the cingulum
bundle, the AF, the SLF, the ILF, and the IFOF. These WM tracts may be involved in
cognitive and behavioral outcomes, and in positive and negative symptomatology.
The alteration of the internal capsule is consistent with several VBM (Paillére-
Martinot et al., 2001; Sigmundsson et al., 2001; Suzuki et al., 2002; Hulshoff Pol et
al., 2004; Chua et al., 2007; Yoshihara et al., 2008; Yao et al., 2014; Lyu et al., 2015)
and DTI (Szeszko et al., 2005; Buchsbaum et al., 2006; Cheung et al., 2008; Jeong et
al., 2009; Kanaan et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2012; Knéchel et al., 2012; Nakamura et al.,
2012; Ellison-Wright et al., 2014) findings. The WM loss in the internal capsule may
lead to a functional disconnection between cerebral cortex and other subcortical
structures (Kubicki et al., 2005), reflecting the impairment of executive function,
emotional stability, and motivation (Guo et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2014; Lyu et al.,
2015). Alterations of the internal capsule are also correlated with the severity of both
positive (Sigmundsson et al., 2001) and negative (Paillére-Martinot et al., 2001)
symptoms, and are found also in patients with FES and/or never-medicated patients
(Sigmundsson et al., 2001; Suzuki et al., 2002; Szeszko et al., 2005; Cheung et al.,
2008; Yoshihara et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2012; Yao et al., 2014; Lyu et al., 2015).
Therefore, this type of alteration may not be a secondary effect of medication or

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 37
chronicity, and may represent one of the core features of the pathophysiology of
schizophrenia.
The internal capsule is a central structure in motor pathways: motor
descending fibers as the cortico-spinal tract or the cortico-ponto-cerebellum tract run
through the internal capsule (Catani and Thiebaut de Schotten, 2008; Guo et al., 2012;
Yao et al., 2014) and the abnormalities we found of both the internal capsule and
descending motor pathways may represent the neural basis of motor dysfunctionality
in schizophrenia (Perez-Iglesias et al., 2010; Walther and Strik, 2012). Moreover,
alterations in cerebellar WM (Farrow et al., 2005; Hao et al., 2006; Chua et al., 2007;
Seok et al., 2007; Kyriakopoulos et al., 2008; Yoshihara et al., 2008; Bai et al., 2009;
Kanaan et al., 2009; Kyriakopoulos et al., 2009; Sugranyes et al., 2012; Watson et al.,
2012; Singh et al., 2014; Lyu et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2015; Spalletta et al., 2015)
support the role of motor pathways in schizophrenia. Motor descending fibers, in
addition to internal capsule and cortical-cerebellar tracts, form part of the cortical-
cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit. A disruption of this pathway may be related to
dysfunctionalities of circuits involved in cognitive and motor functions and may
prompt further evidence supporting the concept of “cognitive dysmetria” (Andreasen
et al., 1998). Taken together, the structural alterations of motor pathways, in addition
to the further common GM and motor areas hypofunctionality, may partially explain
one of the essential features of the schizophrenia, 1.e. the presence of behavioral and
motor dysfunctionality (Perez-Iglesias et al., 2010; Walther and Strik, 2012).
We also found WM reductions of bilateral cingulum that may represent one of
the main feature of schizophrenia. Indeed, cingulum alterations occurred in patients
with FES (Hao et al., 2006; Tang et al., 2010), EOS (Kumra et al., 2005), and LOS
(Chen et al., 2013), and also never-medicated patients (Burns et al., 2003).

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 38
Interestingly, Mori et al. (2007) found that FA reductions in the cingulum bundle are
age-related and depend on the progress of the disorder. Given the critical role of the
cingulum in the limbic system (Catani and Thiebaut de Schotten, 2008), one may
speculate that cingulum reductions may implicate the disruption of fronto-cingolo-
thalamic circuits, with consequent emergence of both positive (Seok et al., 2007;
Rotarska-Jagiela, 2009) and negative symptoms such as apathy, lack of drive, and
poor perseveration (Cummings, 1993; Paillére-Martinot et al., 2001; Sigmundsson et
al., 2001).
Our meta-analysis shows a general WM reduction of long projection fibers
such as AF, SLF, ILF, and IFOF in patients with schizophrenia compared to control
subjects. Interestingly, several studies found a relationship between patients who
showed aberrant patterns of these WM tracts and the occurrence of auditory
hallucinations (Hubl et al., 2004; Ashtari et al., 2007; Szeszko et al., 2008; Knochel et
al., 2012). Moreover, a schizophrenic-in-group comparison showed a FA increase of
the auditory and speech production connections, especially AF or SLF, in patients
with auditory hallucinations compared to non-hallucination patients (Hubl et al.,
2004), suggesting an hyperactivation of the auditory and language production areas.
Thus, increasing connectivity may cause a hyperactivation of these regions and may
be responsible for the occurrence of hallucinations (Hubl et al., 2004; Shergill et al.,
2007; Szeszko et al., 2008; Rotarska-Jagiela et al., 2009). The ILF and the IFOF seem
also to be involved in hallucinatory experiences (Ashtari et al., 2007; Szeszko et al.,
2008) and several studies demonstrated the involvement of these tracts in patients
with EOS (Szeszko et al., 2008; Witthaus et al., 2008) and with FES (Cheung et al.,
2008), as well as chronic (Jeong et al., 2009) and never-medicated patients (Cheung et
al., 2008; Liu et al., 2014), and adolescents (Ashtari et al., 2007; Yoshihara et al.,

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 39
2008; Kyriakopoulos et al., 2009). Given the anatomical pathways of these WM tracts
(Catani and Thiebaut de Schotten, 2008), it may be plausible an involvement of ILF
and IFOF in aberrant visual processes such as visual hallucinations. Indeed, Ashtari et
al. (2007) recently found FA reductions in the ILF of their adolescent sample of
patients with visual hallucinations compared to those without hallucinations. These
findings are in contrast with other studies that reported a FA increase in AF or SLF
(Hubl et al., 2004; Seok et al., 2007; Shergill et al., 2007; Rotarska-Jagiela et al.,
2009) and in ILF or IFOF (Szeszko et al., 2008) in patients with hallucination
episodes. The contradictory results between these studies may depend on the age
difference (adult vs. adolescent) (Kyriakopoulos et al., 2009) or the nature of the
auditory and visual experiences (Ashtari et al., 2007).
The meta-regression results suggested a potential effect of age, duration of
illness, and gender in both positive and negative directions, so that the WM tracts that
already showed an alteration worsen in male patients and with progression of age-
dependent factors. Indeed, older patients showed a stronger reduction in the corpus
callosum, the WM of the left AF and the right cortico spinal tract compared to
younger patients that contrarily showed stronger reductions in the left ILF, the right
part of genu of corpus callosum, the left cortico spinal tract, the right cingulum, the
WM of right superior temporal gyrus (near SLF3), and the left SLF3. A longer
duration of illness was associated with stronger WM reductions of the internal
capsule, the right AF, the bilateral UF, the left ILF, the right IFOF and the right
posterior cingulum, whereas a shorter duration of illness was associated with stronger
WM reductions in the fornix, the left part of genu of corpus callosum, the right
anterior cingulum bundle, the WM of right median cingulate gyrus (near SLF1), and

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 40
the left SLF3. Generally, the effect of age may be related with the progression of
illness, because the duration of illness generally increases with aging.
The results outlined by our meta-regression may suggest different WM
trajectories associated to the age and stage of illness. Thus, it might be possible to
compare WM alterations in different stages of schizophrenia, 1.e., comparing FES and
chronic patients. Indeed, a shorter duration of illness may indicate an early stage of
schizophrenia as experienced by FES patients, whereas a longer duration of illness
may be characteristic of chronic patients. Our findings may highlight significant
difference in WM reductions of FES and chronic patients, showing different WM
tracts involved in early or late stage of illness (Bora et al., 2011).
Moreover, these patterns of WM reductions may be due not only to the disease
progression itself but also to the physiological WM reductions observed in healthy
subject because of aging. It has already been demonstrated that WM reductions
trajectories in healthy subject worsen with aging (Bartzokis et al., 2012). The
physiological aging process of WM reductions trajectories may play a crucial role in
WM trajectories observed in patients with schizophrenia. Indeed, the physiological
aging may prompt to disruptions extended to several tracts of the cortical lobes and
the cerebellum that widen with age and progression of illness (Mori et al., 2007;
Kochunov et al., 2014; Cropley et al., 2017).
Finally, a higher percentage of males showed significantly stronger WM
reductions of the left UF, the right SLF2, the bilateral SLF3, the left cingulum, the
bilateral WM of temporal gyrus, the right posterior segment of AF, and the left
portion of the body of corpus callosum, whereas females were characterized by
stronger WM reductions of the right portion of the genu of the corpus callosum, the
right IFOF, the right SLF3, the left superior cerebellar penduculus, the left optic

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 4]
radiation, and the left long segment of AF. These differences may be related to
different WM reductions trajectories in male and female patients (Hawco et al., 2016;
Cropley et al., 2017) that probably even depends on gender differences in normal
brain development trajectories (Giedd et al., 2012).
Some limitations of our study should be noted. The majority of the selected
studies for our analysis included patients under antipsychotic treatment, with the
exception of some studies that did not report this information or others that included
first-episode and/or drug-naive patients. This aspect might partially affect our results
because of the reported association of increase (Ozcelik-Eroglu et al., 2014) and
decrease (Bartzokis et al., 2011) WM changes with antipsychotic treatments.
However, we decided to include every type of patients (1.e., both medicated and non-
medicated patients) in our meta-analysis to have a better understanding of the general
distribution of WM alteration among schizophrenic patients. Moreover, although the
studies reported the diagnosis of schizophrenia based on a psychiatric manual for
diagnostic assessment (1.e., DSM-IV or ICD-10), we were not able to verify the
accuracy of the diagnostic procedure in the selected studies. This might bring us to
consider a sample of patients more heterogeneous than expected.
Furthermore, given that the ALE method requires a dataset of selected
coordinates to compute the analysis and build the MA maps, we did not include in our
analysis studies that did not report the coordinates of alteration foci. A general bias
might be introduced in considering alteration peak values. Indeed, imaging studies
reported only coordinates of alteration peaks, excluding all the significant voxels in
the examined (altered) cluster. This may suggest the researchers to evaluate only
alterations peaks instead of an entire altered cluster. However, reporting and
evaluating peak coordinates instead of an entire cluster is a common procedure in

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 42
imaging studies that implemented ALE methodology (Turkeltaub et al., 2002;
Eickhoff et al., 2009; Radua et al., 2012). This procedure allows the researcher to
make probabilistic observations based on the probability significance of the peak
value that represents the highest point of the coordinates distribution around it (Laird
et al., 2005; Eickhoff et al. 2009; Eickhoff et al., 2012). Thus, evaluating peak
coordinates instead of all coordinates of the investigated cluster reduces the
probability of making errors due to spatial uncertainty, making inferences more
significant.
An additional limitation of our study that might partially influence the results,
was the inclusion of studies using different acquisition field scans (1.5T and 3T).
Some authors outlined a variability of cortical thickness measurements comparing
MRI-field strengths (Han et al., 2006). However, we do not expect a strong bias in our
results because the ALE analysis investigates the concordance degree of the results
across the selected studies (Laird et al., 2005; Eickhoff et al., 2009; Eickhoff et al.,
2012; Eickhoff et al., 2016) regardless of field strength (Duerden et al., 2012). This is
further supported by a recent voxel-based meta-analysis that did not found any
confounding effects of filed strength on anatomical results (Fusar-Poli et al., 2011).
5. Conclusions
Our meta-analytic study found a widespread alteration of WM bundles mostly
included in frontal, temporal, and limbic pathways. Moreover, our results highlighted
the presence of alterations in other circuits, such as callosal and commissural circuits,
and cortical-cerebellar-thalamic-cortical circuit. Similarly, Dong et al. (2017) found a
widespread disruption of several WM bundles forming part of the most relevant
circuits involved in the illness, such as the corpus callosum, the thalamic radiations,
the IFOF, the UF, the cingulum, and the SLF. These WM alterations are generally

A META-ANALYSIS OF WHITE MATTER IN SCHIZOPHRENIA 43
associated with some clinical features of schizophrenia (e.g., see Minichino et al.,
2017), such as positive and negative symptoms, or cognitive and motor
dysfunctionalities. Taken together, these considerations may prompt further evidence
to the “disconnection hypothesis” and underline the conceptualization of the
schizophrenia as a mental illness characterized by a disrupted cerebral network.
Moreover, the present meta-analysis highlighted the existence of a group of WM
tracts that occurred in both VBM and DTI studies. Furthermore, the conjunctions
analysis revealed the presence of different clusters of reduction on the same WM tract
detected by both VBM and DTI. Given that the two techniques individuate different
features of WM alteration, we can consider that both of them are required to detect
efficiently WM reductions widespread over the entire brain. Thus, the group of WM
tracts detected by both methodologies may consequentially show both volumetric and
diffusion alterations. These tracts may be the most commonly involved bundles in
schizophrenia and may represent the “core tracts” of the illness. Overall, our findings
may improve in our understanding of WM alterations in patients with schizophrenia
and may help clinicians to foster advance treatment planning.
