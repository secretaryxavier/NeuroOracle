Comment on ‘Cutaneous
manifestations in COVID-19: a
ﬁrst perspective’ by Recalcati S
Dear Editor,
Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak was
ﬁrst reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan on 31 December
2019, it has stricken more than 1 000 000 persons worldwide, of
whom over 50 000 have died.1 Having been infected by severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2),
patients with COVID-19 mainly present with fever and respira-
tory symptoms.2 Isolated sudden onset anosmia has also fre-
quently been reported.3 Less frequently, rhinorrhea, diarrhoea
and dysgeusia may be associated. While only a few reports have
evoked cutaneous manifestations,4 we read with interest an initial
study on the topic entitled ‘Cutaneous manifestations in COVID-
19: a ﬁrst perspective’ by Recalcati S.5 This Italian study including
88 patients with COVID-19 reported 20.4% of cutaneous mani-
festations such as erythematous rash, widespread urticaria and
chickenpox-like vesicles. In France, while social networking has
facilitated communication and exchanges between French doc-
tors, we have not noticed as many skin manifestations.
We have constructed a prospective study to analyse the inci-
dence and the types of cutaneous manifestations associated with
COVID-19 infections in France. We included patients conﬁrmed
as infected by COVID-19 by nasopharyngeal PCR and recorded
(i) the presence of cutaneous manifestations, whether they
appeared during prodromal, illness or decline periods, (ii) the
type and location of the lesions and (iii) the symptoms associ-
ated with the lesions (itching, burning).
One hundred and three patients were included in the study
between 15 March 2020 and 2 April 2020. There were 71 women and
32 men with a mean age of 47 years (range 20–88). Among them, 76
were treated at home, 23 were admitted in conventional hospitaliza-
tion and four were admitted to intensive care. None of these patients
died. Only 5 (4.9%) presented with cutaneous manifestations. There
were instances of erythematous rash (n = 2) and urticaria (n = 2),
mainly located on the face and the upper body. We also observed an
oral herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) reactivation in an intubated
patient in intensive care. Four of these skin lesions appeared during
the illness and one urticaria during the prodromal phase. All rashes
were associated with itching. These cutaneous manifestations disap-
peared with median time of 48 h (from 24 h to 6 days).
In our country, only patients with respiratory illness or requir-
ing hospitalization are screened. As a result, it is quite difﬁcult to
accurately determine the actual prevalence of COVID-19 infec-
tion and the cutaneous manifestations associated with this viral
disease. These factors could explain the lower prevalence of the
cutaneous manifestations we found compared to Recalcati S.
By social networking, doctors can inform their colleagues
about atypical rash cases they have observed over recent weeks.
Some possible speciﬁc cases should be highlighted. While of
livedoid eruption due to small blood vessel occlusion was pre-
viously reported,6 we teleconsulted three patients (aged from 14
to 22 years) for purplish or red maculopapular +/ vesiculous
lesions of the digits of both feet with pain and burning, includ-
ing chill burns (Fig. 1a,b). They reported no other symptoms
and no exposure to cold temperature. Unfortunately, due to a
limited number of daily test kits we could not screen these
patients. Similar cases have also been reported in social net-
works with proof of COVID-19 infection and skin biopsy

conﬁrming vasculitis. This particular form of the disease seems
to affect mostly young people and is apparently not associated
with respiratory symptoms.
With this study, we have observed that cutaneous manifesta-
tions are not usual and that in cases of COVID-19, they are
mainly aspeciﬁc. However, highlighted clinical features such as
chill burns could be a sign of virus carriers or previous infection.
Further studies are needed to conﬁrm and better characterize
skin reaction in COVID-19.

Acute urticaria with pyrexia as
the ﬁrst manifestations of a
COVID-19 infection
Dear Editor
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) affects principally
the respiratory tract but recent studies described that COVID-19
could present a broader clinical spectrum from the absence of
any symptoms to heart,1 digestive2 or Ear-Nose-Throat (includ-
ing anosmia and ageusia)3 manifestations. Here, we report two
cases of peculiar skin manifestation.
A 71-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for general
weakness, pyrexia and a cutaneous rash, all appearing the day
before with strictly no other complaints. A dermatologist diag-
nosed a very extensive acute urticaria. There was no change in
the patient’s treatment or habits during the previous few weeks.
He was allergic to iodine but no contrast agent had been injected
before the eruption. His comorbidities included obesity (BMI
32), insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia,
obstructive sleep apnoea-hypopnoea syndrome, high blood pres-
sure, stroke 18 months ago without further sequelae and kidney
failure on dialysis three times a week. All his parameters, physi-
cal examination, two pairs of blood cultures, a PCR research of
Inﬂuenza A and B on a nasopharyngeal smear and an electrocar-
diogram were normal. Blood test revealed a mild lymphopenia
(1120/mm3), a slightly elevated CRP (13.2 mg/L> 5 mg/L) and
increased liver enzymes (GOT, GPT, LDH, GGT doubled). Chest
X-ray and abdominal CT-scan also failed to identify any infec-
tious site. A few days after admission, the patient presented clini-
cal
deterioration
with
increased
temperature
and
CRP,
hypoxaemia, unilateral ankle pain, constipation, chest pain,
atrial ﬁbrillation and tachycardia. A nasopharyngeal smear test
revealed a COVID-19 infection. Urticaria improved gradually
with bilastine. Unfortunately, he died 14 days after admission of
end-stage respiratory failure following COVID-19 infection.
Alongside that, some nephrologists, caregivers and dialysis
patients were tested positive. The pandemic hit Belgium in early
February 2020, and the ﬁrst case of COVID-19 was conﬁrmed in
our hospital on 9 March, when the patient’s ﬁrst symptoms
started. Hygienic protective measures were not yet in place.
A 39-year-old nurse, who works in a rest home, went to the
doctor for a generalized, pruritic urticarial rash (Fig. 1a,b) that
had started 2 days ago on her forearms. Concomitantly, pyrexia
(38.3°C) with chills, myalgia and headache had appeared. She
also suffered from rhinorrhea, mild dry cough and dyspnoea but
had no digestive or urinary complaints. There was no change in
her daily habits or drugs. She had been skiing 3 weeks earlier in
Haute-Savoie, close to one of the cores of this pandemic. Bilas-
tine gradually improved her rash. Anosmia and ageusia occurred
5 days after and lasted a week. Her nasopharyngeal smear was
positive for SARS-CoV-2. Thereafter, her 8-year-old son devel-
oped an urticaria and her husband presented a radiologically
conﬁrmed COVID-19 infection.
Very few data are available concerning the association between
urticaria and COVID-19. A medical team of Wuhan4 has studied
140 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, among whom they
noticed two patients with chronic urticaria but did not mention
any acute urticaria. More recently, an Italian report showed that,
among 88 patients with conﬁrmed diagnosis of COVID-19 who
