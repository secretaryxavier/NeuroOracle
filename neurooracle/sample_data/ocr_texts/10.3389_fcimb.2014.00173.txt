Mycobacterial pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiological agent
of tuberculosis (TB), have evolved a remarkable ability to evade the immune system in
order to survive and to colonize the host. Among the most important evasion strategies
is the capacity of these bacilli to parasitize host macrophages, since these are major
effector cells against intracellular pathogens that can be used as long-term cellular
reservoirs. Mycobacterial pathogens employ an array of virulence factors that manipulate
macrophage function to survive and establish infection. Until recently, however, the role
of mycobacterial cell envelope lipids as virulence factors in macrophage subversion has
remained elusive. Here, we will address exclusively the proposed role for phthiocerol
dimycocerosates (DIM) in the modulation of the resident macrophage response and that of
phenolic glycolipids (PGL) in the regulation of the recruitment and phenotype of incoming
macrophage precursors to the site of infection. We will provide a unique perspective of
potential additional functions for these lipids, and highlight obstacles and opportunities to
further understand their role in the pathogenesis of TB and other mycobacterial diseases.

INTRODUCTION
Research progress has identiﬁed key players for mycobacterial
pathogenicity including the major lipid virulence factor, phthio-
cerol dimycocerosates (DIM), and its structurally-related com-
pound, phenolic glycolipids (PGL). In an elegant study, Cambier
et al. proposed an exciting mechanism for their role in immune
evasion strategies evolved by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb),
and its close pathogenic relative M. marinum (Cambier et al.,
2014). The objective of this perspective is to present a brief view
of the literature concerning the immunomodulatory functions of
DIM and PGL at the initial site of infection, and to propose a sce-
nario for their molecular mechanism of action. In particular, we
will address their impact on resident macrophages and recruit-
ment of incoming precursors to the site of infection. Considering
that very little is known about the actual interaction of these lipid
virulence factors with the host immune system, a better under-
standing about their role in immune evasion may contribute to
novel therapeutic strategies for mycobacterial diseases, such as
tuberculosis (TB).
The virulence of mycobacterial pathogens is a multifaceted
process that grants the means to circumvent a dedicated immune
response and to thrive in host cells, including macrophages.
In spite of recent progress demonstrating the contribution of
mycobacterial cell envelope lipids to pathogenicity (for review
see Guenin-Mace et al., 2009; Neyrolles and Guilhot, 2011), rel-
atively little is known about their mechanism of action, and
more speciﬁcally, how these lipids interact with the host at the
molecular level. Most biological effects caused by lipids loosely
associated to mycobacterial envelope derived from speciﬁc inter-
actions with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on innate
immune cells. Among the different PRR families, carbohydrate-
recognition receptors (e.g., calcium-dependent (C)-type lectin
receptors, CLR) have generated great interest because they recog-
nize speciﬁc sugar moieties on glycolipids, referred to as PAMPs
(pathogen associated molecular patterns). This, in turn, can trig-
ger the internalization of mycobacteria and eventually a down-
stream signaling cascade that can generate opposite effects on
host immune responses. For example, the macrophage inducible
CLR Mincle recognizes the mycobacterial trehalose-6,6 dimyco-
cerosate (TDM), likely through its trehalose motif, and triggers
a pro-inﬂammatory cytokine production and Th1 and Th17 cell
responses (Ishikawa et al., 2009; Schoenen et al., 2010). By con-
trast, the mannosylated moieties from the mycobacterial lipogly-
cans, ManLAM, mediate entry of the bacillus into macrophages
through mannose receptor and DC-SIGN, whose signaling cas-
cades engage an anti-inﬂammatory effect that enables Mtb to
evade immune surveillance (for review see Mishra et al., 2011).
Interestingly, the critical motifs of ManLAM for its recogni-
tion by DC-SIGN have been shown to be the mannose caps
as well as the fatty acids (Maeda et al., 2003; Riviere et al.,
2004). Moreover, data indicated that fatty acids are involved in
a supramolecular organization of ManLAM, associated with an

Mycobacterial lipids and immune evasion
increased avidity for their receptors (Riviere et al., 2004).These
ﬁndings strongly suggest that the lipid moiety of glycolipids inter-
feres with their macromolecular organization, which may be
necessary for efﬁcient recognition of the terminal mannosyl epi-
topes. Lipids may also physically interfere with host membranes
and thereby impair immune response-related signaling pathways,
as proposed by Laneelle and Daffe (1991). Indeed, insertion of
TDM in model or natural membranes can affect their biophys-
ical properties (Laneelle and Tocanne, 1980; Sut et al., 1990;
Almog and Mannella, 1996), decreasing notably membrane ﬂuid-
ity by ordering the surrounding phospholipids and cross-linking
the leaﬂets (Laneelle and Tocanne, 1980; Almog and Mannella,
1996). Taken together, these data highlight the importance to con-
sider the speciﬁc structural features of lipids in exploring their
functional role. This is especially true for the highly hydropho-
bic DIM, and even more essential for their glycosylated version,
PGL. DIM and PGL exhibit a common lipid backbone which is
well conserved, with minor structural variations, among the few
mycobacterial species synthesizing these molecules (Figure 1).
In contrast, the saccharide domain of PGL is species-speciﬁc
(Figure 1). Of note, all the major mycobacterial pathogens pro-
duce both substances, but in the particular case of Mtb only a
subset of clinical isolates belonging to Beijing family is capable
to synthesize PGL.

In most cases, the conﬁguration of the asymmetric centers bearing the
methyl branches (asterisks) are of the D series, mycocerosic acids, but in
a limited number of mycobacterial species, they belong to the L series
and are then called phthioceranic acids (see table). Minor structural
variants of the β-diol can contain a keto group in place of the methoxy
group. (B) Structure of the species-speciﬁc sugar moiety of the major

Mycobacterial lipids and immune evasion
NOW YOU SEE ME, NOW YOU DON’T: THE HIDING EFFECT
OF DIM AND MORE
The role of DIM in virulence was ﬁrst suggested by two inde-
pendent studies using signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis
(Camacho et al., 1999; Cox et al., 1999), and thereafter supported
by a large body of evidence (for review, see Neyrolles and Guilhot,
2011). Historically, the only well-established function for DIM
was their structural support to the mycobacterial cell wall as pro-
tective permeability barrier (Camacho et al., 2001). For example,
DIM deﬁcient mutants are sensitive to reactive nitrogen species
(RNS) generated in murine macrophages pretreated with IFN-γ
and TNF-α (Rousseau et al., 2004). However, it is now appar-
ent that other roles exist for DIM beyond the physical protection
against host microbicidal factors, as mutants incapable of trans-
porting DIM or spontaneous DIM deﬁcient variants are more
attenuated in mice lacking inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)
compared to control counterparts (Murry et al., 2009; Kirksey
et al., 2011). Indeed, recent progress indicate that DIM play a
dominant role in the modulation of protective host immune
responses, speciﬁcally during the early steps of infection, when
the bacilli encounter host macrophages (Rousseau et al., 2004;
Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009; Cambier et al., 2014; Passemar
et al., 2014).
Two different but likely complementary mechanisms have
emerged from the latest set of studies addressing this subject. On
the one hand, Cambier et al. postulated that DIM mask physically
mycobacterial PAMPs, and thus prevent their recognition by toll-
like receptors (TLR) and the subsequent recruitment of micro-
bicidal macrophages (Cambier et al., 2014). Using zebraﬁsh to
model in vivo the earliest interactions between bacteria and host
macrophages, these authors reported that a M. marinum mutant
lacking DIM on its surface was unable to prevent the recruitment
of iNOS-expressing macrophages, which were effective in killing
this mutant through RNS production. Further analysis indicated
that DIM act by preventing TLR signaling via the common TLR
adaptor MyD88 (Cambier et al., 2014). Supporting this notion,
Rousseau et al. reported that infection of murine macrophages
with a DIM-deﬁcient Mtb mutant induced a high secretion
of TNF-α and IL-6, two pro-inﬂammatory cytokines produced
downstream of TLR- and MyD88-dependent signaling pathway
(Rousseau et al., 2004). The authors also mentioned that the
greater amount of TNF-α and IL-6 at the site of infection could
overstimulate the recruitment of macrophages. The exact mech-
anism of how DIM are able to mask the mycobacterial PAMPs,
and which TLR-containing immune cell is involved, remain to
be described. On the other hand, our group proposed that DIM
target lipid organization in the membrane of host macrophages,
thereby modifying its biophysical properties and subsequently
the activity of membrane effectors (Astarie-Dequeker et al.,
2009). We observed that DIM-deﬁcient mutants are poorly efﬁ-
cient to infect human macrophages, and accumulate in acidiﬁed
phagosomes at early time post-infection. Importantly, preven-
tion of phagosomal acidiﬁcation by the proton-ATPase inhibitor,
baﬁlomycine, rescued the growth defect of a DIM deﬁcient
mutant (Passemar et al., 2014). This suggests that DIM con-
tribute to the intracellular growth of Mtb by excluding some-
how the proton-ATPase from the phagosomal membrane. At
late post-infection stages, DIM-deﬁciency affects the capacity
of Mtb to induce cell death and to disseminate into bystander
macrophages (Passemar et al., 2014). While these results should
be interpreted with caution, they suggest that DIM participate
in control of the outcome of infected macrophages and cell-to-
cell spread of Mtb. At the root of these observations, we noticed
that Mtb interacts with macrophages in a manner that induces
changes in membrane ﬂuidity along with the requirement of
DIM at the bacterial surface (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009). The
ability of DIM to induce changes in membrane ﬂuidity is consis-
tent with their hydrophobic properties that would facilitate their
insertion into membranes. As non-covalently bound molecules
to the outer cell wall layer of mycobacteria, DIM could thus insert
into membranes of macrophages to induce biophysical changes
that would modulate the activity of membrane-associated effec-
tors. At the level of the plasma membrane, this would increase
macrophage infection by enhancing the activity of phagocytic
receptors (e.g., complement receptor 3, CR3), and subsequent
bacterial replication through inhibition of phagosome acidiﬁ-
cation (Astarie-Dequeker et al., 2009; Passemar et al., 2014).
Moreover, DIM could also collaborate with the secreted Mtb pro-
tein, ESAT-6 by modulating its membrane lytic activity. Indeed,
DIM and ESAT-6 share the capacity to induce cell death and cell-
to-cell spread of Mtb (Aguilo et al., 2013; Passemar et al., 2014),
two events associated to membrane damages.
Collectively, these results clearly established that DIM play an
active role at modulating the recognition of mycobacterial PAMPs
and avoiding the activation of pro-inﬂammatory macrophages,
and at the same time, altering macrophage responses to its favor
possibly by provoking changes in the membrane ﬂuidity that
ultimately affect the microbicidal functions.
SEEKING THE RIGHT PARTNER TO PLAY: THE SIGNIFICANCE
OF PGL STRUCTURAL VARIABILITY
PGL possess a common lipid core closely related to DIM that,
consequently, may share the properties just described for these
molecules. However, PGL also exhibit species-speciﬁc saccharide
domains (Figure 1) and this variation in sugar content may have
a strong impact on the PRRs involved in their recognition, and
therefore, on their biological activities.
Most of Mtb clinical isolates, as well as the reference labora-
tory strains, are unable to produce PGL (Constant et al., 2002).
Yet, some Mtb strains are able to synthesize a speciﬁc form of PGL
named PGL-Tb1. This strongly suggests that PGL are not essential
for TB pathogenesis. However, their presence may have an impact
on the interaction with the host and increases Mtb virulence.
Indeed, Reed et al. established that the production of PGL-Tb1 in
a Beijing clinical isolate is associated with a hypervirulent pheno-
type in animal models (Reed et al., 2004). It was also reported that
treatment of mouse macrophages with puriﬁed PGL-Tb1 inhibits
the production of the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6
and CCL2, and that this effect was dependent on its saccha-
ride domain. The activity of PGL-Tb1 on the modulation of
the immune response was also supported by independent results
showing that the production of this lipid in the laboratory strain
H37Rv, usually unable to synthesize it, modiﬁes cytokine secre-
tion by infected macrophages (Sinsimer et al., 2008). However,

Arbues et al.
Mycobacterial lipids and immune evasion
in that series of experiments, PGL-Tb1-producing H37Rv was
not found to be more virulent than the parental strain in mice.
Pointing to the relevance of this molecule, PGL-deﬁcient Mtb
strains were found to release p-hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives
(p-HBAD), a truncated form of PGL containing just the saccha-
ride domain and the phenol ring, which may also have biological
activities (Constant et al., 2002). Mutants unable to produce PGL-
Tb1 glycosylated-phenol moiety (p-HBAD II) induced increased
secretion of the pro-inﬂammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-6 and
IL-12p40 (Stadthagen et al., 2006).
PGL are also produced by the ﬁsh pathogen M. marinum,
used in several laboratories to model host-pathogen interactions
in the context of human TB. PGL-mar (Figure 1) was found to
be a key factor in the phagosomal maturation arrest induced by
M. marinum (Robinson et al., 2008). In addition, the ability of
puriﬁed PGL-mar to abrogate the secretion of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines TNF-α and IL-12p40 by human macrophages was also
described. Little more was known about the biological activities
of this molecule until recently, when it was demonstrated that
PGL-mar is involved in the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2
(CCR2)-dependent recruitment of macrophages by inducing the
expression of the chemokine CCL2 through a molecular mecha-
nism still unknown (Cambier et al., 2014). Indeed, by selectively
recruiting pathogen-permissive macrophages, Cambier et al.
demonstrated that PGL-mar, in a proposed coordinated manner
with the masking effect of DIM, increases M. marinum ﬁtness in
the host.
Finally, PGL-1 from M. leprae has retained special attention
among the different PGL species since its discovery in the early
1980s, mainly due to the high immunogenicity of its sugar moi-
ety (for a review see Spencer and Brennan, 2011). Like PGL-Tb1,
PGL-1 contains a trisaccharide domain but the structure is dif-
ferent (Figure 1). Mainly due to the inability to grow the leprosy
bacillus in vitro, there is a large body of literature using isolated
PGL-1 to study its role in the modulation of host immune (Mehra
et al., 1984; Schlesinger et al., 1994). Among others, PGL-1
was found to inhibit the pro-inﬂammatory cytokine secretion
by human monocytes (Silva et al., 1993). In addition, M. lep-
rae induces a poor activation and maturation of dendritic cells,
and dampens their ability to induce T-cell responses (Hashimoto
et al., 2002). This inhibition was partially relieved by treatment
of M. leprae-infected cells with anti-PGL-1 antibodies. Together,
those studies suggest that PGL-1, through its terminal trisaccha-
ride motif, is the factor responsible for the immunosuppression
observed in lepromatous leprosy, one of the most characteris-
tic forms of the disease. Using an original genetic engineering
strategy, our team has demonstrated that PGL-1 expression in
M. bovis BCG enables this recombinant strain to exploit CR3
to promote bacterial uptake and to inhibit TNF-α secretion by
human macrophages (Tabouret et al., 2010). In line with this
ﬁnding, a recent study showed that synthetic PGL-1 saccharide
moiety reduces the production of cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β
and CCL2) induced by TLR-2 (Elsaidi et al., 2013).
These results indicate that mycobacteria make use of PGL
to modulate host innate immune response, and that this activ-
ity is primarily mediated by their saccharide domain through
an unknown molecular mechanism. Our data also support the
notion that some PGL forms, such as PGL-1, could enable
mycobacteria to take advantage of CR3 (Tabouret et al., 2010) to
invade macrophages and exert anti-inﬂammatory properties by
interfering with the TLR-dependent pro-inﬂammatory responses,
as previously described for other pathogens (Wang et al., 2007;
Hajishengallis and Lambris, 2011; Dai et al., 2013). However,
we cannot rule out the possibility of a direct inhibition of TLR-
dependent cytokine secretion, or the direct interaction with a
“PGL receptor” on epithelial cells, is involved in the induction of
CCL2 and subsequent macrophage recruitment, as hypothesized
by Cambier et al. for M. marinum (Cambier et al., 2014). Finally,
it is important to keep in mind that the structure of the saccharide
domain of PGL is highly variable and species-speciﬁc (Figure 1).
Therefore, it remains to be seen whether the strategy involved in
immunomodulation is the same or varies for each PGL variant,
and whether a PGL variant is more active than others.
CONCLUSION: PLAYING HIDE-AND-SEEK WITH HOST
MACROPHAGES
From these data, it emerges that pathogenic mycobacteria utilize
DIM, on their own or in conjunction with PGL (depending on
mycobacterial strains) for diverting macrophages from their nat-
ural function and for establishing infection. Most of the research
has focused on the macrophage because its dialog with mycobac-
teria is thought to be the seminal step of the immune response.
The study of Cambier et al. marks an important step in under-
standing the functions of lipids, as it takes into account the full
repertoire of the innate immune system (Cambier et al., 2014).
However, several questions remain pending: for example, what is
the population of recruited macrophages? If we refer to the model
illustrating changes in macrophage polarization throughout the
infectious process (Lugo-Villarino et al., 2011), lipids might
mediate evasion of microbicidal functions of M1 macrophages in
the early stage of infection, whereas they might favor recruitment
of M2 macrophages with weak microbicidal competences later
on during infection. It also remains to be determined how lipids
behave within macrophages with distinct phenotype/polarization
in order to assess whether, by virtue of their pleiotropic effect,
they have an intracellular impact throughout the disease.
We anticipate that the identiﬁcation of the molecular mecha-
nisms involved in Mtb lipid effects will lead to the characterization
of signaling pathways that are modulated for the beneﬁt or detri-
ment of mycobacteria survival in the host. Therefore, we would
like to provide a framework to study the molecular mechanisms
governing mycobacterial DIM and PGL activity at the direct inter-
face with macrophages (Figure 2). We propose that DIM exert
more than a masking effect of cell wall exposed Mtb PAMPs
(Cambier et al., 2014) and play an active role through their
hydrophobic part to reshape macrophage activity (Figure 2A).
We also propose that PGL, on their part, act through their saccha-
ride domains as potential ligands for carbohydrate-recognizing
receptors expressed at the surface of macrophages (Figure 2B).
For the purpose of conciseness, we focused the current per-
spective on DIM and PGL, but we believe that in the near future
there will be a need for a broad assessment of mycobacterial lipids
and their overall effects in the immune system. Novel strategies
need to be devised in order to deal with the redundant role as

Mycobacterial lipids and immune evasion
FIGURE 2 | Putative molecular mechanisms through which DIM and
PGL remodel macrophage activity during the early steps of infection.
When mycobacteria encounter macrophages, they use cell surface
exposed PAMPs to recognize numerous plasma membrane PRRs, such
as TLR (e.g., TLR-2) and carbohydrate-recognition receptors (e.g., CR3 or
other lectin receptors). (A) During bacterial recognition, DIM exert a
masking effect on PAMPs, thereby preventing TLR-2 detection and
triggering of subsequent bactericidal and immune responses. DIM could
also insert into plasma membrane, changing its biophysical properties in
a manner that increases CR3-mediated bacteria uptake, and decreases
bactericidal functions. Likewise, DIM could insert within intracellular
membranes (e.g., phagosomal membranes) where they collaborate with
ESAT-6 to increase its membrane lytic activity, thereby inducing
membrane damage and consequently allowing mycobacteria to escape
into the cytosol. Altogether, DIM-mediated effects may lead to
mycobacteria replication and innate immune evasion. (B) Some PGL
species, such M. leprae PGL-1 and potentially Mtb PGL-Tb1, are able to
decrease host immune response either by direct inhibition of TLRs or by
taking advantage of lectin receptor (e.g., CR3) capacity to interfere with
TLR-triggered pro-inﬂammatory cytokine secretion (e.g., TNF-α). They may
also exploit these lectin receptors to promote mycobacterial uptake by
macrophages. In the case of PGL-mar, a putative “PGL receptor” at the
surface of epithelial cells has been proposed to be responsible for the
induction of CCL2, and the subsequent macrophage recruitment.
virulence or immunomodulatory factor among mycobacteria cell
envelope lipids. In this aspect, our group has undertaken the con-
struction of single and multiple lipid mutants to assess the role
of trehalose-derived lipids, sulfolipids, diacyltrehaloses and poly-
acyltrehaloses, and their respective contribution to the virulence
together with DIM (Passemar et al., 2014). Similarly, there is a
well-known redundancy among host PRRs that may hamper the
characterization of signaling pathways triggered by mycobacterial
lipids; our group has also made headways to develop techniques
for the simultaneous double-gene silencing in primary mononu-
clear phagocytes (Troegeler et al., 2014). Finally, PGL variants
merit careful consideration, as there is a strong potential for
variation at the functional level according to species. This is
particularly true for the assessment of permissive macrophage
recruitment toward the site of infection for both PGL-Tb1 and
PGL-1. Unlike the inducing effect by PGL-mar in the context
of zebraﬁsh infection (Cambier et al., 2014), both PGL-Tb1 and
PGL-1 inhibit the CCL2 secretion by macrophages (Reed et al.,
2004; Elsaidi et al., 2013). This divergence could be due to a dif-
ferential effect of PGL depending on cellular context, or more
interestingly, through a distinctive recognition by the involved
receptor according to the saccharide composition. To address this
type of question, the strategy developed by our team based on
the use of M. bovis BCG as surrogate might be a valuable tool to

enable the direct comparison of the effects of the PGL variants in

In conclusion, we believe that the development of micro-
biological tools and adequate research models, in combination
with multidisciplinary strategies, should open up new venues
to achieve a better understanding of the ever-evolving relation-
ship between host and pathogen. In many ways, the lipid at the
mycobacteria wall is just a starting point!
