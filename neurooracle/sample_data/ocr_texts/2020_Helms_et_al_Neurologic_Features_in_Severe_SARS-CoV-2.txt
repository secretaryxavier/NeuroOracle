Neurologic Features in Severe SARS-CoV-2 Infection
To the Editor: We report the neurologic features 
in an observational series of 58 of 64 consecu-
tive patients admitted to the hospital because of 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due 
to Covid-19. The patients received similar evalu-
ations by intensivists in two intensive care units 
(ICUs) in Strasbourg, France, between March 3 
and April 3, 2020.
Six patients were excluded because of paralytic 
neuromuscular blockade when neurologic data 
were collected or because they had died without 
a neurologic examination having been performed. 
In all 58 patients, reverse-transcriptase–poly-
merase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays of naso-
pharyngeal samples were positive for severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2). The median age of the patients was 63 
years, and the median Simplified Acute Physiol-
ogy Score II at the time of neurologic examina-
tion was 52 (interquartile range, 37 to 65, on a 
scale ranging from 0 to 163, with higher scores 
indicating greater severity of illness). Seven pa-
tients had had previous neurologic disorders, in-
cluding transient ischemic attack, partial epilepsy, 
and mild cognitive impairment.
The neurologic findings were recorded in 8 of 
the 58 patients (14%) on admission to the ICU 
(before treatment) and in 39 patients (67%) when 
sedation and a neuromuscular blocker were with-
held. Agitation was present in 40 patients (69%) 
when neuromuscular blockade was discontinued 
(Table 1). A total of 26 of 40 patients were noted 
to have confusion according to the Confusion 
Assessment Method for the ICU; those patients 
could be evaluated when they were responsive 
(i.e., they had a score of −1 to 1 on the Rich-
mond Agitation and Sedation Scale, on a scale of 
−5 [unresponsive] to +4 [combative]). Diffuse 
corticospinal tract signs with enhanced tendon 
reflexes, ankle clonus, and bilateral extensor 
plantar reflexes were present in 39 patients 
(67%). Of the patients who had been discharged 
at the time of this writing, 15 of 45 (33%) had 
had a dysexecutive syndrome consisting of in­
attention, disorientation, or poorly organized 
movements in response to command.

*	ARDS denotes acute respiratory distress syndrome, CSF cerebrospinal fluid, MRI 
magnetic resonance imaging, RT-PCR reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain 
reaction, and SARS-CoV-2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.
†	Some patients received propofol for less than 1 day.
‡	The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU [intensive care unit] (CAM-ICU) 
is a diagnostic algorithm for determining the presence or absence of delirium 
on the basis of four features: acute change or a fluctuation in mental status, 
inattention, disorganized thinking, and altered level of consciousness.
§	One of the three ischemic strokes had the appearance of subacute infarcts on 
MRI and probably existed before SARS-CoV-2 infection.
¶	The seven lumbar punctures were performed in seven of the eight patients 
who underwent brain MRI and electroencephalography (one lumbar puncture 
was contraindicated because of anticoagulation).
‖	The patient with oligoclonal bands with the same pattern in serum and the 
patient with elevated CSF IgG and CSF protein levels are different patients.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the 
brain was performed in 13 patients (Figs. S1 
through S3 in the Supplementary Appendix, avail-
able with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org). 
Although these patients did not have focal signs 
that suggested stroke, they underwent MRI be-
cause of unexplained encephalopathic features. 
Enhancement in leptomeningeal spaces was noted 
in 8 patients, and bilateral frontotemporal hypo-
perfusion was noted in all 11 patients who under-
went perfusion imaging. Two asymptomatic pa-
tients each had a small acute ischemic stroke 
with focal hyperintensity on diffusion-weighted 
imaging and an overlapping decreased apparent 
diffusion coefficient, and 1 patient had a sub-
acute ischemic stroke with superimposed in-
creased diffusion-weighted imaging and appar-
ent diffusion coefficient signals.
In the 8 patients who underwent electroen-
cephalography, only nonspecific changes were 
detected; 1 of the 8 patients had diffuse bifron-
tal slowing consistent with encephalopathy. 
Examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sam-
ples obtained from 7 patients showed no cells; in 
2 patients, oligoclonal bands were present with 
an identical electrophoretic pattern in serum, and 
protein and IgG levels were elevated in 1 patient. 
RT-PCR assays of the CSF samples were negative 
for SARS-CoV-2 in all 7 patients.
In this consecutive series of patients, ARDS 
due to SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with 
encephalopathy, prominent agitation and confu-
sion, and corticospinal tract signs. Two of 13 
patients who underwent brain MRI had single 
acute ischemic strokes. Data are lacking to deter-
mine which of these features were due to critical 
illness–related encephalopathy, cytokines, or the 
effect or withdrawal of medication, and which 
features were specific to SARS-CoV-2 infection.
