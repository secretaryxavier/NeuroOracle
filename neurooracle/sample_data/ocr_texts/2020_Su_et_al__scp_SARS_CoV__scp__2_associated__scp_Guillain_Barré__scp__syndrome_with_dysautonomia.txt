SARS-CoV-2–associated Guillain-Barré syndrome
with dysautonomia
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respi-
ratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is associated with Guillain-Barré
syndrome (GBS).1–8 We describe a patient with quadriplegic GBS with
dysautonomia preceded by mild COVID-19–induced diarrhea.
A 72-year-old man with coronary artery disease, hypertension,
and alcohol abuse presented to a tertiary hospital with symmetric par-
esthesias and ascending appendicular weakness. Seven days earlier he
had mild diarrhea, anorexia, and chills, without fever or respiratory
symptoms. This condition resolved in 5 days. Weakness began 6 days
after diarrhea, and the patient presented 1 day after neurological
symptom onset.
On admission, he was afebrile with normal vital signs. Mental sta-
tus and cranial nerves were normal. Strength was 4/5 for neck flexion,
and 3/5 for proximal upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Tendon
reflexes were absent. Sensation to light touch was diminished to
wrists and knees bilaterally.
Laboratory studies demonstrated a white blood cell (WBC) count
of 12 000 cells/μL (granulocytes 84%), sodium 143 mmol/L, potas-
sium 3.1 mmol/L, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 16 mg/dL, creatinine
0.77 mg/dL, alanine transaminase 38 IU/L, aspartate transaminase
29 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 76 IU/L, albumin 3.7 g/dL, and total bil-
irubin 0.8 mg/dL. Serum thiamine, vitamin B12, hemoglobin A1C, thy-
roid panel, creatine kinase, Lyme screen, and serum and urine protein
electrophoreses were normal. Anti-ganglioside GM1, GD1b, and
GQ1b and acetylcholine receptor binding, voltage-gated calcium
channel, antinuclear, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody titers
were negative. Nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) was positive. Chest X-ray showed mild bibasilar atelectasis
vs patchy consolidations. Computed tomography of the head was nor-
mal. Incompatible implant precluded magnetic resonance imaging.
On day 3, the patient developed respiratory distress with a nega-
tive inspiratory force of −20 cmH2O and vital capacity of 1350 mL.
He was transferred to the intensive care unit and intubated. He
remained afebrile and followed commands. Oxygen saturation was
normal on ventilator settings positive end-expiratory pressure 5 cm
H2O and fraction of inspired oxygen 30%. Chest X-ray was stable. He
was diagnosed with GBS and received intravenous immunoglobulin
2 g/kg between days 3 and 6. On day 4, he developed dysautonomia
with hypotension alternating with hypertension and tachycardia. On
day 6, his strength decreased to 1/5 for neck flexion, 1/5 for distal
upper extremities bilaterally, and 0/5 for proximal upper extremities
and throughout the lower extremities bilaterally. On day 8, he devel-
oped the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion
(SIADH), with serum sodium 134 mmol/L and osmolality 271 mOsm/
kg
correlated
with
urine
sodium
43 mmol/L
and
osmolality
731 mOsm/kg. He had no prior history of SIADH.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected on day 8 showed WBC 1 cell/μL
and protein 313 mg/dL; CSF SARS-CoV-2 PCR, Gram stain and culture,
herpes simplex, varicella zoster, and cytomegalovirus viral PCRs;
immunoglubulin G index; oligoclonal bands; and cytology were nega-
tive. On day 10, his oropharyngeal secretions increased, and chest
X-ray showed new right lower lobe consolidation. Sputum culture grew
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, an organism associated with ventilator-
associated pneumonia in immunocompetent hosts. WBC increased to
20 400 cells/μL (granulocytes 88%), with improvement to 9400 cells/μL
(granulocytes 69%) after 2 days on sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. On
day 12, strength improved to 3/5 for neck flexion and 2/5 throughout
all limbs bilaterally. Nerve conduction studies on day 13 showed dif-
fusely decreased velocities, conduction block, and absent F waves,
supporting demyelinating GBS (Table 1). Resting needle electromyogra-
phy was normal, but there was poor effort. On day 19, tracheostomy
and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes were placed. He did
not develop signs of active COVID-19 infection and repeat nasopha-
ryngeal SARS-CoV-2 PCR was negative on day 28. He remains in the
ICU with severe weakness.
We have described a patient with SARS-CoV-2–associated quad-
riplegic GBS who had preceding diarrhea and was otherwise asymp-
tomatic on presentation. Other patients with SARS-CoV-2–associated
GBS presented with symptoms of upper respiratory infection, and
some had a pre-existing diagnosis of COVID-19.2–8 Characterizing
SARS-CoV-2 clinical phenotypes has been hindered by limited testing,
and the prevalence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers is
likely underestimated. This case illustrates the importance of SARS-
CoV-2 testing in patients with GBS.
Dysautonomia and SIADH were prominent features in this
patient. To date, these have been uncommon in other patients with
SARS-CoV-2–associated GBS. An analysis of COVID-19 patients in
Wuhan, China, showed that those with central nervous system symp-
toms had lower lymphocyte and platelet counts and higher BUN levels
compared with those with peripheral nervous system or no neurologi-
cal symptoms.9 Although these laboratory values in the patient we
described are similar to those seen in the Wuhan cohort with periph-
eral nervous system or no neurologic complications, the underlying
pathophysiology predisposing certain COVID-19 patients to neurolog-
ical complications remains unclear. Continued investigation of neuro-
logical sequelae is needed.
