Abstract
Background: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a virulent bacillus causing tuberculosis, a disease responsible for million
deaths each year worldwide. In order to understand its mechanism of pathogenesis in humans and to help control
tuberculosis, functions of numerous Mycobacterium tuberculosis genes are being characterized. In this study we
report the dual functionality of tlyA gene product of Mycobacterium tuberculosis annotated as Rv1694, a 268 amino
acid long basic protein.
Results: The recombinant purified Rv1694 protein was found to exhibit hemolytic activity in vitro. It showed
concentration and time-dependent hemolysis of rabbit and human erythrocytes. Multiple oligomeric forms (dimers
to heptamers) of this protein were seen on the membranes of the lysed erythrocytes. Like the oligomers of
conventional, well-known, pore-forming toxins, the oligomers of Rv1694 were found to be resistant to heat and
SDS, but were susceptible to reducing agents like b-mercaptoethanol as it had abolished the hemolytic activity of
Rv1694 indicating the role of disulfide bond(s). The Rv1694 generated de novo by in vitro transcription and
translation also exhibited unambiguous hemolysis confirming the self assembly and oligomerization properties of
this protein. Limited proteolytic digestion of this protein has revealed that the amino terminus is susceptible while
in solution but is protected in presence of membrane. Striking feature of Rv1694 is its presence on the cell wall of
E. coli as visualized by confocal microscopy. The surface expression is consistent with the contact dependent
haemolytic ability of E. coli expressing this protein. Also, immune serum specific to this protein inhibits the contact
dependent hemolysis. Moreover, Rv1694 protein binds to and forms stable oligomers on the macrophage
phagosomal membranes. In addition to all these properties, E. coli expressing Rv1694 was found to be susceptible
to the antibiotic capreomycin as its growth was significantly slower than mock vector transformed E. coli. The S30
extract of E. coli expressing the Rv1694 had poor translational activity in presence of capreomycin, further
confirming its methylation activity. Finally, incorporation of methyl group of [3H]-S-adenosylmethionine in isolated
ribosomes also confirmed its methylation activity.
Conclusions: The Rv1694 has an unusual dual activity. It appears to contain two diverse functions such as
haemolytic activity and ribosomal RNA methylation activity. It is possible that the haemolytic activity might be
relevant to intra-cellular compartments such as phagosomes rather than cell lysis of erythrocytes and the self-
assembly trait may have a potential role after successful entry into macrophages by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Background
The complete genome sequence of the Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (M. tb), H37Rv, has been determined and
its bioinformatic analysis improved our understanding
of the life-cycle of this facultative, intracellular, human
pathogen [1]. Although re-annotation of the genome
sequence of M. tb strain, H37Rv, changed some assign-
ments, the significant portion of the annotation
remained unchanged [2].
Bioinformatic analysis has allowed us to predict the
function for 2058 proteins out of 3995 (52%) and more
than 150 of these have been experimentally identified in
mycobacterial function. Among the 1051 conserved
hypothetical proteins, 376 putative proteins showed no
similarity to any known protein and it is possible that
some of them may be specific to M. tb only [3-7]. In
H37Rv, among many virulence factors, it was predicted
that tlyA gene is a part of an operon containing at least
three other genes viz. the first being tlyA (Rv1694), sec-
ond is ppnk (Rv1695) and the third is RecN (Rv1696),
homologous to E. coli RecN [8]. Since H37Rv is a well
characterized pathogen, an obvious question surfaces
about the role of Rv1694, with respect to its pathogeni-
city and virulence because during the initial annotation,
Rv1694 was predicted to be a 268 amino acid long,
hemolytic protein, which may function as a virulence
determinant as it showed homology with the tlyA gene
products of swine pathogen Serpulina hyodysenteriae, a
causative agent of swine dysentery and almost identical
to tlyA of Mycobacterium leprae [9,10]. This annotation
was consistent with experimental observations that
described the presence of hemolytic molecules in M. tb.
For example, King and co-workers detected contact
dependent hemolytic activity in the virulent strain
H37Rv which was reduced by several fold in attenuated
strain H37Ra, and not present in vaccine strain BCG
[11]. Moreover, two more proteins of M. tb, which
showed homology with Phospholipase C of Pseudomo-
nas aeruginosa and 30% homology to hemolysin A, pre-
cursor of Vibreo cholerae, which have been reported to
possess hemolytic activity [12-14]. In addition, Wren et
al. showed the presence of tlyA homologues in M. tb,
Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium avium and
Mycobacterium bovis BCG, but appeared to be absent in
non-pathogenic strain Mycobacterium smegmatis. Inter-
estingly, introduction of the tlyA gene into Mycobacter-
ium smegmatis using a mycobacterial shuttle expression
plasmid increased the contact dependent hemolysis
orchestrated by it [8]. However, no further information
is available on Rv1694 until recent studies showed that
Rv1694 functions as a ribosomal RNA methyltransferase
[15]. The methylase activity resulted in methylation of
ribosomal RNA which can alter the susceptibility to
capreomycin, a macrocyclic peptide antibiotic. It has
been observed that mutations in the tlyA gene may
make the bacteria resistant towards capreomycin
[15,16]. Hence, the question arises as to whether the
tlyA is a hemolysin or a ribosomal methyltransferase or
it is a dually active molecule.
Multi-functionality for a protein can arise due to the
presence of distinct/separate domains to carry out an
individual function or upon post-translational modifica-
tion such as proteolytic cleavage which may result in
acquisition of a new function. In the present example
Rv1694 has been suspected to possess two entirely
diverse activities i.e. haemolytic and RNA methylation
activities, which is rather unusual. Since mycobacterium
can have a complicated external environment after entry
into macrophages, the role of an individual protein like
Rv1694 needs a thorough characterization in order to
decipher its location specific function during the initial
phase of infection. Such studies are important to prove
or disprove its diverse/distinct functions to correlate its
probable role in pathogenicity of M. tb. The present
study is aimed at answering the following questions viz.,
(i) Can this protein be present in two distinct locations
and perform two diverse functions? (ii) If yes, any other
molecule(s) assist this protein to perform these diverse
functions? (iii) How the hemolytic function is orche-
strated by it?
The answers to the above questions can be unambigu-
ously obtained only with the help of detailed characteri-
zation of Rv1694 as purified Rv1694, per se, must
exhibit the said activities under in vitro, conditions. In
this manuscript, we have presented several experimental
evidences which clearly show that the Rv1694 has mem-
brane destabilizing activity as well as the RNA methyl-
transferase activity.
Results
Homology of Rv1694 of M. tb
Rv1694, tlyA gene product of H37Rv, is an alkaline pro-
tein that has >40% similarity with other cytotoxins/
hemolysins. Initial annotation has referred the tlyA gene
product as a cytotoxin/hemolysin homologue and it was
classified as a hypothetical ‘pore forming hemolysin’.
The multiple sequence alignment of tlyA gene products
of other pore forming hemolysins is shown in Figure
1A. For example, the identity amounts to ~38% with
Serpulina hyodysenteriae and ~32% with Helicobacter
pylori [8-10]. In addition, the Rv1694 also contains a
motifs that align well with rRNA methyltransferase and
RNA binding proteins as it displays considerable homol-
ogy with FtsJ/RrmJ (~48% homology, 23 S rRNA methy-
lase) of E. coli as shown in Figure 1B [17,18]. Another
common feature seen in the alignment of large RrmJ

class was that only four residues, corresponding to the
K38-D124-K164-E199 tetrad in E. coli RrmJ, are invariant
and were common to several families of site specific
methyltransferases that modify 2′-hydroxyl groups of
ribose moieties of ribosomal RNA. Since Rv1694 also
has well conserved K69-D154-K182-E238 tetrad, it has
been re-annotated as rRNA methyltransferase [19]. Cur-
rently, the National Center for Biotechnology Informa-
tion, USA has listed the Rv1694 as a member of
COG1189 (clusters of the orthologous groups of pro-
teins) which were predicted to be rRNA methylating
enzymes. It is note worthy that both hemolysins of
S. hyodysenteria and H. pylori also have the K-D-K-E
tetrad (marked with a downward arrow ‘▼’) as shown in
Figure 1A. Hence, the tlyA gene product exhibits
homology with two diverse classes of proteins viz.
hemolysin/cytolysin
as
well
as
ribosomal
RNA
methyltransferases.
Cloning, expression and purification of Rv1694
The full-length gene of Rv1694 (828 bp) was cloned in
pT7Nc (without 6-his tag) and pET28a(+) (with
6-histidine tag at the carboxy terminus) vectors as
shown in Figure. 2A and was expressed in E. coli BL21
(DE3) CodonPlus-RIPL. The E. coli were routinely
induced with 1 mM IPTG at 28°C and significant
amount of the Rv1694 bearing the 6-histidine tag was
isolated from the soluble fraction with the help of Ni-
NTA affinity column. The purity was consistently found
to be >95% as judged by 12% SDS-PAGE (Figure 2B).
The average yield of the purified protein was ~1.0 mg
per liter of culture. Figure 2C shows the identification of
Rv1694 with immune rabbit serum raised against it. The
Circular-Dichroic spectrum of purified Rv1694 indicated
the presence of 23% of a-helix, 33% of b-sheet and 37%
of random coil (Figure 3A). We have also confirmed the
integrity of the protein by tryptic digestion and MALDI-
TOFF analysis which was in excellent agreement with
data base sequences present in ExPaSyhttp://au.expasy.
org/tools/peptide-mass.html (data not shown). The CD
data was also consistent with a homology model shown
in Figure 3B, which was built with Swiss-Model server
using 3hp7A.pdb as template which represents the puta-
tive hemolysin from Streptococcus thermophilus [20-22].

Rv1694 has hemolytic activity
E. coli has no natural homolog of Rv1694, thus, it was
not expected to exhibit any contact dependent hemoly-
sis of red blood cells. In order to confirm the hemolytic
activity of Rv1694 expressing E. coli, we have analyzed
both of our constructs (with and without 6-hisitidine
tag) for contact dependent haemolytic property. The
data in Figure 4A represents the contact dependent
hemolysis of rabbit RBCs (rRBC) in comparison to unin-
duced and mock vector (pET28a+) transformed E. coli.
Consistent hemolysis of rRBCs was observed in ~30 hrs
of incubation time.
We have also examined the specific activity of puri-
fied Rv1694, shown in Figure 4B. The amount of
Rv1694 needed for 50% hemolysis, in 24 hrs, was
~18.0 μmug/ml while the maximum lysis observable
was ~70%. The time taken to achieve hemolysis was
rather long but consistent with slow contact depen-
dent hemolysis observed in the published literature
mentioned earlier. The slow lysis could be due to slow
transfer/assembly of Rv1694 from E. coli to RBC
membrane,

to
conventional

was purified on Ni-NTA affinity column. Protein sample was
electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE and stained with coomassie
blue R-250. The purified Rv1694 routinely exhibited >95% purity.
(C) Immuno detection of Rv1694: Purified Rv1694 was
electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE and the immuno-probed with
Rv1694 specific immune rabbit serum (at 1:1000 dilution) and the
secondary antibody was anti-rabbit IgG HRP- antibody (1:2000
dilution). The specific protein band of Rv1694 can be seen at
30 kDa.

6-histidine tag fusion protein (0.5 mg/ml in 10 mM Na-Phosphate
buffer, pH 7.4) was used for obtaining CD spectra. CD data, as
interpreted from Yang’s calculation, shows that Rv1694 has 23%
a-helix, 32.8% b-sheet, 7.7% turns and 36.5% random coil. (B)
Model of Rv1694: Model of Rv1694 was built using the putative
hemolysin from Streptococcus thermophilus, using 3HP7.pdb as
template with the help of Swiss Model Server [33]. The Rv1694 has
a typical fold of a ribosomal RNA polymerase consisting of 7
b-sheets surrounded by 5 a-helices. Please note that the amino
acids 246-268(QTD...EGP) are not present in the depicted model.

hemolysins such as Aerolysin or Staphylococcal
a-hemolysin which assemble on target cells within
minutes as they are secreted from the corresponding
bacterium [23,24]. Since, Rv1694 contains two cysteine
residues; the role of these Cys residues in the hemo-
lysis was also examined in presence of reducing
agents. Interestingly, the hemolytic activity was
reduced by ~3.6 fold to that of the non-reduced form
as shown in Figure 4B. This observation suggests that
the hemolytic activity of Rv1694 is dependent on
intact disulfide bond(s).
The above mentioned data on haemolysis, shown in
Figure 4B, highlights that the Rv1694 is monomeric pro-
tein before binding to the cell membranes and it readily
oligomerizes after binding to target membranes. In
order to rule out any pre-existent, loose, oligomeric
aggregates responsible for the haemolysis of rRBCs in
our experiments, we have generated the Rv1694 by
in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) and exam-
ined for hemolytic property. The data in Figure 4C
shows the haemolytic activity of Rv1694 generated by
IVTT, which is unambiguous and consistent with the
slow hemolysis data shown in Figures 4A and 4B. We
have also examined the hemolysis of human RBCs and
it was observed that the human RBCs were also suscep-
tible to lysis by Rv1694 (data not shown).
Visualization of Rv1694 on E. coli surface
Since Rv1694 expressing E. coli showed contact depen-
dent hemolysis, it was important to localize by staining
the E. coli expressing the Rv1694 with rabbit antiserum
specific to it. The confocal microscopic pictures of
E. coli stained for the Rv1694 are shown in Figure 5A.
Strikingly, the Rv1694 was present on the outer cell wall
of E. coli as seen from the specific staining of the poly-
clonal antibody raised by us. It is important to note that
neither mock transformed E. coli (stained with Rv1694
specific immune serum) nor secondary antibody used in
the study showed any staining. These vital controls
unambiguously prove the presence of Rv1694 on the
cell wall.
We next examined whether the immune serum of
Rv1694 can inhibit the contact dependent hemolytic
activity of E. coli expressing the Rv1694. As shown in
Figure 5B, the hemolysis was reduced by about 50% in
comparison to the hemolysis in the absence of immune
serum. The observed inhibition of hemolysis by the
immune serum was specific as pre-immune serum of
the same rabbit had no effect on the contact dependent
hemolytic activity of the E. coli expressing the Rv1694.
These observations suggest that the Rv1694 was
expressed on the cell wall of E. coli and the anti-Rv1694
antibody neutralizes the contacts needed for the assem-
bly and lysis.
Figure 4 (A) Contact dependent hemolysis of Rv1694. Rv1694
(with and w/o His-tag) and mock vector transformed E. coli were
examined for contact dependent lysis of rabbit RBC. E. coli (~107)
cells and rabbit erythrocytes (~105) were mixed and briefly
centrifuged to ensure close contact between bacteria and RBC. The
resultant mixture of cells was incubated at 37°C for 24 to 30 hours.
Degree of lysis was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 540
nm of a cell-free supernatant. UI indicates uninduced E. coli and
groups labeled with 1-5 were harvested time in hour(s) from
induction (with 1.0 mM IPTG) time point. Error bars represent
standard deviation of two independent experiments. (B) Hemolytic
activity of the purified Rv1694: Specific hemolytic activity of
purified Rv1694 (40 μg/ml) was carried out by two-fold serial
dilution of Rv1694 which was mixed with rabbit RBC (1.5%). After
24 hrs of incubation, the absorbance was measured at 540 nm for
release of hemoglobin. At ~50% hemolysis, the protein
concentration was 18.0 μmug/ml. In presence of thiol-reducing
agent, the hemolytic activity was 3.6 fold lesser than the maximum
activity of Rv1694. Total haemoglobin release was obtained by
lysing the RBC with deionized water. Error bars represent standard
deviation from three independent experiments. (C) Hemolytic
activity of Rv1694 generated by coupled in vitro transcription
and translation: Rv1694 generated by coupled in vitro transcription
and translation (~5.0 out of 50.0 μl reaction mix) was mixed with
100 μl of 0.3% rRBC in a 96 well plate as described earlier and the
absorbance at 590 nm for rRBC lysis was noted every 10 minutes.
As a positive control, we have also translated staphylococcal a-HL
and followed its hemolysis.

Binding and oligomerization of Rv1694 on RBC
membranes
We further examined whether or not Rv1694 can form
ordered oligomers which must be present and responsi-
ble for the slow but consistent hemolysis observed by
us. Hydropathy plot analysis of Rv1694 primary
sequence has revealed that there are two probable trans-
membrane regions viz. amino acids 67-87 and 150-170.
To confirm the binding and oligomerization of Rv1694
to RBC membranes, we have incubated the Rv1694 with
rRBCs, isolated the membrane fragments and visualized
its oligomeric forms by SDS-PAGE. The Rv1694 showed
strong binding to rRBC membranes and formed stable
oligomers which were easily detectable with anti-6-histi-
dine antibody (Figure 6A). The oligomers of Rv1694
showed concentration dependency and the kinetics of
oligomerization on rRBC membranes was found to be
slow in comparison to well studied, conventional
hemolysins.
The data shown in Figure 6A and 6B lets us infer that
the Rv1694 can form oligomers ranging from dimers, to
heptamers based on the mobility identified with anti-
6-histidine antibody. The oligomers formed on RBC
membranes were found to be resistant to temperatures
up to 100°C and 4% SDS very much like the oligomers
of staphylococcal a-hemolysin (although very slight

Rv1694 localization (Green), middle panels show the DAPI stained bacteria (Blue) and right panels show the merged images. (B) Inhibition of
contact dependent hemolysis by Immune rabbit serum: Rv1694 transformed E. coli was incubated with and without pre-immune/immune
rabbit serum as described for Figure 4A. Error bars represent standard deviation of two independent experiments.

dissociation was found at 100°C, but that was relatively
insignificant), but significant dissociation of the oligomer
was observed in the presence of reducing agent. This
result suggests that the hemolytic activity of Rv1694 was
due to the formation of stable oligomers on target cell
membranes only and the intermolecular disulfide bond
may be necessary for the oligomerization.
Rv1694 binds to and oligomerizes on macrophage
phagosomal membranes
Earlier studies have suggested that the M. tuberculosis,
after entry into macrophages, appears to compromise
the integrity of phagosomal membranes for its survival.
To understand any possible role for Rv1694 in this pro-
cess, we have examined the binding and oligomerization
of Rv1694 on phagosomes isolated from RAW264.7 cells
for different time periods i.e. 10, 30, 60 min. In Figure
6C, the presence of LAMP-1, 120 kDa phagolysosome
glycoprotein protein marker, authenticates our phagoso-
mal preparation. The Rv1694 showed strong binding to
the phagosomal membranes and formed stable oligo-
mers, which are very similar to the ones seen on rRBCs
including their stability in 4% SDS and susceptibility to
near boiling temperatures under non-reducing condi-
tions. Moreover, unboiled samples prove the absence of
any pre-existing oligomer of Rv1694 added to phagoso-
mal preparation. In summary, all these observations sug-
gest that the Rv1694 has the ability to bind to target
membranes such as phagosomal membranes and can
form multimeric structures for destabilization. In this
process it appears that a disulfide bond seems to play a
key role.
Limited proteolysis of Rv1694
Limited proteolysis provides valuable information
regarding the existence of stable domains of proteins/
regions and also susceptible regions that might be pro-
tected against proteolysis upon interaction with other
proteins or cell membranes. Keeping this in mind, we
have digested the Rv1694 with Proteinase K in presence
and absence of membrane for different time periods and
examined the resultant protein fragments by SDS-
PAGE. The SDS-PAGE gels were stained with Coomas-
sie Brilliant blue and also by immuno blotting with anti-
6-histidine antibody. As shown in Figure 7A, after 30
min of Proteinase K digestion, there were two promi-
nent bands of size around 25 kDa and 14 kDa, which
seem to be resistant to further digestion as seen with
Coomassie brilliant blue staining. However, the cleavage
pattern of Rv1694, shown in Figure 7B, obtained with
anti-6-histidine antibody suggests that the amino term-
inal of the Rv1694 was more susceptible to proteases
such as Proteinase K. It should be noted that any clea-
vage at the carboxy terminus cannot be detected with
Figure 6 (A) Binding and oligomerization of Rv1694 on rRBC

with 2% rRBC for 30 min and the resultant blot was immuno
probed with anti-6-histidine-antibody. Lanes indicated with RBC,
Sup and numbers respectively indicate rRBC membrane, purified
Rv1694, supernatant of rRBC, rRBC incubated with 5.0 μg, 10.0 μg,

Rv1694 on RBC membrane in the absence of reducing agents:
Oligomerization of Rv1694 (10 μmug) on rRBC (2%) was carried out
as described in methods section. The samples were washed and
dissolved in 4% SDS and 5× laemmli sample buffer without b-
mercaptoethanol and immuno probed with anti-6-histidine-
antibody. Lane 1. Rv1694 purified protein; Lanes 2-5 show the

protein on the Phagosomal membrane: Aliquots were taken out
at indicated time points from the Rv1694 incubated phagosomal
preparations, electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE (non-reducing),
immuno probed with anti-6-histidine-antibody. Lane 1: Phagosomal
preparation alone; Lane 2: Unboiled Rv1694; Lanes 3 to 5: Unboiled

antibody to ascertain the phagosomal preparation. The data shown
is one of the three independent experiments.

the anti-6-histidine antibody. Limited proteolysis of
Rv1694, bound to the RBC membrane, has yielded the
pattern suggestive of inaccessibility of the amino termi-
nus as we could see the intact protein in the shorter time
frames (Figure 7C). The proteolytic patterns were also
consistent with the model of Rv1694 shown in Figure 3B.
As shown in Figure 3B, the two visible domains of
Rv1694 viz. N-terminal domain consisting of 1 to ~54
amino acids and the second domain of 67 to 281 amino
acids are connected by amino acid segment with two Arg
residues, which are generally susceptible to trypsin or
Proteinase K like enzymes. If a protease nicks the region
between two domains, it should result in a domain that is
smaller by 5 kD i.e. ~25 kD (molecular weight of Rv1694
with 6-histidine tag is 30 kD). In summary, the amino-
terminal of the Rv1694 protein was more accessible to
the Proteinase K in the soluble state that becomes inac-
cessible when bound to the target membranes.
Rv1694 is a ribosomal RNA methylase
In order to evaluate the ribosomal RNA methyltransfer-
ase activity of Rv1694, we attempted several approaches
as described below:
Capreomycin inhibits the growth of E. coli transformed
with Rv1694
In our first approach, we monitored the growth rates of
E. coli expressing the Rv1694 and mock vector
(pET28a+) transformed E. coli without or with capreo-
mycin (100 μmug/ml) as shown in Figure 8A. In the
presence of capreomycin, the mock vector transformed
E. coli growth was retarded by only ~10% while the
E. coli expressing the Rv1694 construct did not grow
efficiently (> 40% loss). We also ensured that these cul-
tures expressed the Rv1694 by examining for hemolysis
at each time point for the data plotted (data not shown).
This experiment confirms the Rv1694 mediated methy-
lation of ribosomal RNA of E. coli under in vivo condi-
tions, as the mock vector transformed control has
practically showed no dramatic retardation of growth in
the presence of capreomycin.
Capreomycin inhibits in vitro translation of S30 extract of
Rv1694 transformed E. coli
In the second approach, we also analyzed the in vivo
methylation activity of Rv1694 by coupled in vitro tran-
scription-translation with capreomycin. In this experi-
ment, we prepared the S30 extracts of E. coli expressing
the Rv1694 along with controls. The S30 extract was
supplemented with all necessary components to monitor
the translation of the S30 extract in the presence and
absence of capreomycin. We have used the supercoiled
plasmid of a-hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus as a

reporter to examine the translational activity of the S30
extract as staphylococcal a-hemolysin is very efficient in
inducing the lysis of rRBCs. Also, the kinetics of hemo-
lysis of a-hemolysin was well established and very fast
in comparison to the kinetics of lysis of Rv1694 [25].
Moreover, the assay is fast and reliable as the efficiency
of translation by way of lysis of RBCs can be compared
with the values reported in the literature and does not
require any specialized equipment or reagents.
We have carried out the in vitro transcription and
translation experiments at two different concentrations
of capreomycin (16 ng/ml and 80 ng/ml), in order to
closely match the observations reported earlier [15]. In
Figure 8B, in the absence of capreomycin, the transla-
tional efficiency of S30 extracts of Rv1694 expressing E.
coli and mock vector E. coli showed nearly identical
translational efficiency of the staphylococcal a-hemoly-
sin reporter (filled circles vs. open circles) and this value
was taken as 100% translation efficiency. At 16 ng/ml
capreomycin, the S30 extract made from Rv1694 expres-
sing E. coli showed reduced translation (~50% loss) i.e.
considerable loss of hemolysis (solid inverted triangles)
where as the mock vector transformed E. coli showed
no loss of translation (open triangles). At 80 ng/ml
capreomycin concentration, the S30 extract made from
Rv1694 expressing E. coli showed no translation of
reporter (solid squares), whereas the vector transformed
E. coli showed about 26% lysis (solid squares vs. open
squares) compared to the translation without capreomy-
cin. It should be noted that the E. coli is partially sensi-
tive to capreomycin at higher concentrations i.e. >80
ng/ml. This experiment, once again, confirms the ribo-
somal RNA methylation activity of Rv1694.
In vitro methylation activity of Rv1694 on ribosome
In addition to capreomycin sensitivity assays described
above, we have also examined the incorporation of
radioactive methyl group of S-adenosylmethionine
([3H]-SAM) into the ribosomal RNA by Rv1694. In this
assay, we have used crude ribosomes as substrate for
Rv1694 in the presence of the methyl group donor
([3H]-SAM) and judged the extent of methylation reac-
tion. Assay was carried out with and without Rv1694
and ribosomes under native and heat denatured condi-
tions. It was clear from Figure 8C that the native ribo-
some, in the presence of purified Rv1694, has 36.3%
more methylation in comparison to ribosomal prepara-
tion alone. However, heat denatured ribosomes, in the
presence of purified Rv1694, didn’t show any significant
incorporation of the methyl group of [3H]-SAM in com-
parison to the heat denatured ribosomes alone. This
result, once again, confirmed that the purified Rv1694
was also ribosomal RNA methylase and it transfers the
methyl group from S-adenosylmethionine to rRNA.

Discussion
The aim of the present study is to decipher the other
face of mycobacterial Rv1694 which has been attributed
with ribosomal RNA methylation activity.
The data presented in Figures 4, 5, 6, 7, which
assessed the activity of Rv1694 under in vitro conditions,
unequivocally, confirm the other feature of Rv1694 i.e.
its membrane destabilizing attribute. Firstly, the E. coli
harbouring the tlyA has clearly exhibited hemolysis
much like the mycobacterial strain studied earlier. This
observation also implies that the cellular localization of
Rv1694 is nearly same in both M. tb and E. coli which
may involve common transport mechanism. Noteworthy
feature of our confocal data was that the Rv1694 was
exported to the cell wall of E. coli despite the absence of
any signal sequence. Secondly, the purified protein also
exhibited unambiguous hemolysis under in vitro condi-
tions (Figure 4A) which was sensitive to the presence of
reducing agents. The hemolytic activity of the purified
protein was reduced drastically in the presence of redu-
cing agents indicating the need for the presence of an
intact disulfide bond. Moreover, Rv1694 irreversibly
binds to and oligomerizes on red blood cell membrane
and was resistant to heat and SDS very much like the
conventional hemolysins but unlike them, the oligomers
of Rv1694 dissociate in the presence of thiol-reducing
agents. While reducing agents abolish the activity by
90% and the residual activity seen in Figure 4A could be
due to the presence of higher order oligomers (around
pentamers) which were found to be un-dissociable.
Unfortunately, these oligomers were rigid and did not
fly well in MALDI-TOFF spectrometers for deeper ana-
lysis. Moreover, consistent with the haemolytic nature,
the data in Figure 6B and Figure 6C revealed the
Rv1694′s ability to bind to and oligomerize on isolated
phagosomal membranes also. This oligomerization was
once again sensitive to reducing agents. Our limited
proteolysis data also revealed that the amino terminus
was more exposed to proteases in solution while it was
found to be inaccessible when it was membrane bound.
Hence, a reasonable working model for the contact
dependent haemolytic property of E. coli expressing the
Rv1694 could be due to contacts between E. coli and
target membranes through the insertion of its amino
terminus in the target membrane while its carboxy ter-
minus could be anchored to host cell wall. Overall, the
hemolytic property of this protein was due to ordered
assembly of this protein on target cell membranes
through its hydrophobic pockets than due to any pre-
existing aggregate(s) as the Rv1694, generated by
in vitro transcription and translation, also exhibited
unambiguous hemolysis. Our data also rules out the
role of any unidentified protein complexing with the
Rv1694 for the observed haemolytic activity as the oligo-
mers seen in our SDS-PAGE gels were composed of
homo-oligomers of Rv1694 as the molecular weights of
the oligomers were consistent with the multimeric
forms of Rv1694. In support of this, the SDS-PAGE of
oligomers, after boiling in presence of reducing agents
(to dissociate the oligomers) has yielded the correspond-
ing monomeric Rv1694.
In general, more than one third of bacterial pore
forming toxins act as common virulence factors for the
host pathogenic bacteria. These toxins have two distinct
states: a water soluble form before oligomerization and
a transmembrane form after oligomerization and con-
version between these two states do not require any
assistance from chaperones but require a hydrophobic
milieu. On the other hand the data presented here on
Rv1694 is interesting as it does not have any classical
signal sequence like the conventional secreted forms of
hemolysins. In this regard, the data reported by Bloom’s
group had highlighted this possibility. These authors
have shown that the live BCG organisms were able to
orchestrate phagosomal membrane permeability which
can allow uptake of molecules upto 70 kD [26]. This
observation suggests the role of a hemolysin like or
membrane destabilizing molecule after successful entry
into macrophages. The need for the association of
Rv1694 with phagosome compartments is also impor-
tant in the context for understanding the MHC class I
presentation which requires antigen localized to the
cytoplasmic compartment of antigen-presenting cells. It
has been shown that the human CD8+ T cells recog-
nized epitopes of a 28-kD hemolysin (sequences of
Rv1694) from HLA*0201+ persons with latent tubercu-
losis infection [27]. Hence, the best role that can be
visualized for the Rv1694 would be limited to destabiliz-
ing the phagosomal compartments for which we have
shown the evidence in Figure 6C. For this activity, it is
essential that the Rv1694 must be present at or beneath
the surface of mycobacterial cell envelope. Upon con-
tact/entry with the host macrophage or a phagosomal
compartment, it can attach to the membrane for desta-
bilization. The contact dependent hemolysis observed by
us can indirectly suggest this possibility.
In addition to the haemolytic activity of Rv1694, our
preparations have shown an unambiguous ribosomal
RNA methyltransferase activity as well. Expression of
Rv1694 had resulted in susceptibility to capreomycin
(Figure 8). All these observations together summarily
suggest that the Rv1694 is dually active protein.
Conclusions
In summary, we have been successful in providing clear
answers to the questions mentioned earlier viz. (i) The

Rv1694 can be present in two distinct locations viz.
intracellularly to methylate the ribosomal RNA which
confers susceptibility to capreomycin and also at the cell
membrane to destabilize the target membranes upon its
contact. (ii) Based on the oligomeric bands and the dis-
sociation of the oligomers under reducing, boiling con-
ditions confirm that the Rv1694 might not be assisted
by any other protein (iii) The orchestration of hemolysis
by this protein involves a possible burial of its amino
terminus in the target membranes upon its contact
while its carboxy terminus can anchor with the host
bacterial cell wall. To the best of our knowledge, a dual
activity has not been demonstrated either for cytolysins
or for RNA methyltransferases using highly purified pre-
parations of proteins. Further studies are underway to
know the role of this protein in the context of bacterial
growth and survival to know the functions of Rv1694.
Methods
Materials
In vitro transcription and translation kit for E. coli T7
S30 Extract System for Circular DNA was purchased
from Promega Corporation, USA. E. coli BL21(DE3)
CodonPlus-RIPL was from Stratagene, USA. Anti-6-his-
tidine mouse IgG HRP labeled antibody (Clone F24-796)
from BD Biosciences, USA. Protease inhibitor cocktail
and Capreomycin was obtained from Sigma Aldrich,
USA. [Methyl-3H]-S-Adenosyl-L-methionine was pur-
chased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.,
USA. All animal experiments were performed after
obtaining necessary permission from Institutional Ani-
mal Ethics Committee.
Cloning, expression and purification of Rv1694
Rv1694 was cloned by PCR amplification from the geno-
mic DNA of M. tb strain H37Rv (01.Rv.2.10.17.x.DNA).
This gene was amplified by using gene specific primers
(forward
primer,
5′-TATATATccatggCTC-
GACGTGCCCGCG and reverse primer, 5′-TATATA-
gaattcTTACGGGCCCTCGCTAATCGC) and inserted
into pT7Nc expression vector made in our laboratory
[25]. The recombinant Rv1694 gene was confirmed by
DNA sequencing. Rv1694 gene was sub-cloned in
pET28(a+) (Kanr) expression vector between NcoI and
HindIII, which provides a carboxy terminal 6-histidine-
tag for purification by Ni-NTA resin. pET28(a+)-Rv1694
construct was transformed in the BL21(DE3) Codon-
Plus-RIPL E. coli cells. A well isolated, independent col-
ony was inoculated in 10 ml Luria Bertani (LB) medium
containing kanamycin (30 μmug/ml) and chlorampheni-
col (34 μmug/ml) and incubated at 37°C over night. The
over night culture was inoculated (1%) into 500 ml LB
at 28°C until OD600 reached 0.30 to 0.35. The culture
was then induced with 1 mM IPTG and was further
grown for another 6 hrs at 28°C. The cells were har-
vested by centrifugation and the pellet was re-suspended
in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 150 mM
NaCl) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme, 50 μmul protease
inhibitor cocktail per gram bacterial pellet, 1 mM PMSF
and incubated on ice for 30 min. The cells were soni-
cated and the lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for
20 min at 4°C. The supernatant was applied on a pre-
equilibrated Ni-NTA column and washed extensively
with 10-15 column volumes of equilibration buffer A
containing 10 mM imidazole. The column was then
washed with five column volumes of 50 mM and
75 mM imidazole containing buffer A. Bound His-tag
fusion Rv1694 protein was eluted with 200 to 250 mM
imidazole containing buffer A. The purity of the eluted
Rv1694 was examined by 12% SDS-PAGE and concen-
tration was estimated by the Bradford’s method [28,29].
Measurement of CD spectra of Rv1694
CD spectra of the native Rv1694 were recorded on a
JASCO-815 spectro-polarimeter, at 25°C, in the far UV
range of 180-280 nm at scan speed 50 nm/min with a
response time of 1 s and slit width 1 nm. A rectangular
quartz cell of 1 mm path length was used. All measure-
ments were made at a protein concentration of 0.5 mg/
ml. For each spectrum, fifteen scans were collected and
the averaged spectra were used for further analysis.
Measurements were made in 10 mM phosphate buffer
pH 7.5 and buffer scans recorded under the same condi-
tions were subtracted form the protein spectra before
further analysis.
Contact dependent hemolysis
Contact-dependent lysis of rabbit erythrocytes was car-
ried by employing a minor modification of the proce-
dure published earlier [11]. Rv1694 and control vector
transformed E. coli were grown in LB media (30 μg/ml
kanamycin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol) at 28°C till
the OD600 reached 0.3 to 0.35. The culture was
induced with 1 mM IPTG and harvested at different
time points. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in
25 mM Sodium Phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and 150 mM
NaCl and washed twice with the same buffer. For con-
tact dependent lysis, E. coli expressing the Rv1694 or
the control vector (~107) were mixed with rabbit ery-
throcytes (~105) in 1 ml same buffer and centrifuged
to ensure close contact between bacteria and red blood
cells. For contact dependent lysis with normal and
immune rabbit serum against Rv1694, we incubated
1:100 dilution of serum with E. coli (106) for 30 min at
25°C prior to incubation with rRBCs at 37°C for 24 to
30 hours. Release of hemoglobin from erythrocytes in
supernatant was estimated by measuring the absor-
bance at 540 nm.

Immuno-labelling of E. coli with Rv1694 specific immune
rabbit serum
Rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against purified
Rv1694. Rv1694 and mock vector transformed E. coli
were harvested at late log phage, washed twice and re-
suspended in PBS. Bacteria in PBS suspension was
incubated with 1:100 dilution of Rv1694 immune rab-
bit serum for 1.0 hour at room temperature and
washed thrice with PBS. Bacteria were resuspended in
PBS and incubated with 1:200 dilution of Cy2 conju-
gated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immuno Research
Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA) for 45 min and
with DAPI with 2-3 min, washed thrice with PBS.
A thin smear of PBS suspended bacteria was made
on the glass slide for observation with a confocal
microscope.
Coupled in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT)
In vitro translation of super coiled Rv1694-pT7Nc was
essentially carried out as described earlier by using
E. coli T7 S30 extract for circular DNA [25]. To inhibit
endogenous RNA polymerase, we added 1 μmul of a
50 μmug/ml solution of rifampicin in 50 μl reaction
volume prior to the addition of the DNA template to
the reaction mixture.
Hemolysis assays of purified and IVTT generated Rv1694
Purified Rv1694 (20-40 μg/ml) was two fold serially
diluted in 25 mM Sodium Phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 and
150 mM NaCl buffer, mixed with 1.5% rabbit red blood
cells (rRBC) or human red blood cells (hRBC) and incu-
bated at room temperature (25°C) for 24 hrs. The absor-
bance of the supernatant at 540 nm was measured.
IVTT generated protein (5 μl) was mixed with 100 μl of
0.3% rRBC in a 96 well plate and the absorbance at
590 nm for the RBC lysis was noted at every 10 min
time interval.
RBC membrane binding assay
Rv1694 (15.0 μmug or as mentioned) was mixed with
2% of the rabbit RBC in 25 mM Sodium Phosphate buf-
fer, pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl buffer and incubated at
room temperature at 37°C for 30 min (or for indicated
time). At the end of the incubation period, the RBCs
were pelleted at 200 × g, re-suspended and washed in
hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM
EDTA, 1 × protease inhibitor cocktail and 1 mM
PMSF). RBC membranes were collected by centrifuga-
tion (10,000 × g) and solublized with/without b-mercap-
toethanol in 4% of SDS at 100°C (or as indicated) for
5 min and electrophoresed on 8% SDS-PAGE. The
resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane and probed with anti-6-histidine antibody,
followed HRP labelled conjugate.
Phagosome preparation from RAW 264.7 cell line
RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage-like cells were grown in
DMEM with 10% FCS. The cells were washed with PBS,
pH 7.4, detached by scraping, resuspended in buffer
(0.25 M sucrose and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4) containing
1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), protease
inhibitor cocktail, and homogenized. Intact cells and
nuclei were removed by centrifugation (200 × g for
10 min). The supernatant was centrifuged at 1900 × g
for 10 min to pellet the crude phagosome and the pallet
was washed twice with PBS by centrifugation at 10,000 ×
g for 5 min at 4°C [30,31]. The phagosome pallet was
stored at -80°C if not used immediately.
Binding and oligomerization on phagosomal membranes
Rv1694 (15.0 μmug) was mixed with phagosomal pre-
paration containing 1.0 mM PMSF and protease inhibi-
tor cocktail and incubated on ice. Aliquots of 20.0 μmul
after each time point was taken out and washed twice
with PBS, pH 7.4, pallet was mixed with sample loading
dye without b-mercaptoethanol containing 4% SDS.
Unboiled and boiled samples were electrophoresed on
8.0% SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-6-histidine anti-
body. Same blots were stripped (100 mM Glycine-HCl,
pH 2.5, 20 mM Magnesium acetate and 50 mM KCl)
and re-probed with anti-LAMP-1 antibody (1D4B, BD
Biosciences, USA) and secondary goat anti-rat IgG HRP
labeled antibody (sc-2006, Santa cruz biotechnology,
inc., CA, USA).
Limited Proteolysis
Rv1694 was subjected to digestion with Proteinase K at
25°C by keeping the Rv1694: Proteinase K ratio 50:1 (in
solution) and 50:4 with 2% rRBC (for the membrane
bound Rv1694). At indicated time points, 10 μg equiva-
lent of the digested protein was taken and inactivated by
the addition of 5× Laemmli sample buffer containing
2 mM PMSF. For proteolysis of Rv1694 on the mem-
brane, equal volume of Proteinase K treated protein-
rRBCs mix were taken out at each time interval and
washed twice with hypotonic buffer (with 2 mM PMSF)
to remove unbound proteins and released hemoglobin.
The RBC membranes were solublized with 4% SDS at
50°C for 5 min. Both the samples (in solution and on
rRBC membrane) were boiled at 100°C for 5 min and
electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE.
Capreomycin sensitivity assays
Bacterial culture was grown in LB media with appropri-
ate antibiotic at 28°C and split into 2 parts at OD600
~0.3, and further grown with and without capreomycin
(100 μg/ml). After every hour, a small aliquot of culture
was withdrawn and OD600 was measured for the growth
analysis.

Preparation of S30 extracts
S30 extract was prepared by growing recombinant
Rv1694 expressing E. coli in LB media in presence of
appropriate antibiotic at 28°C and induced with
100 μmuM IPTG at OD600 of ~0.35. The bacteria were
harvested after 3 hrs. Cells were subjected to ultrasonic
disruption (40% amplitude, 10 times, pulse of 10 sec on/
off) in buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mM MgCl2,
60 mM NH4Cl, 6 mM 2-mercaptoethanol), and centri-
fuged for 30 min at 30,000 × g to obtain the supernatant
[32]. In vitro translation activity was measured in the
absence and presence of capreomycin at two concentra-
tions (16 and 80 ng/ml). We have used a-hemolysin
from Staphylococcus aureus as a reporter gene for the
quantitating the efficiency of translation of the riboso-
mal preparation. Lysis of rRBC, monitored at OD595, by
the in vitro generated a-hemolysin was the direct mea-
sure of the translation efficiency of the ribosomes in
presence of capreomycin [25].
In vitro methylation of ribosome
Ribosomes were prepared by ultracentrifugation of S30
extract of E. coli at 150,000 ×g for 1.0 hour at 4°C, as
described above. Methylation assay was carried out with
native and heat denatured ribosomes (at 65°C for
5.0 min). Reaction mixture contained 50 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.4, 3 mM Mg(OAc)2, 200 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM
dithiothreitol, 1.5 μmuM [Methyl-3H]- Adenosyl-L-
methionine (81 Ci/mmol), 18.0 μmug ribosome and 4.0
μmug purified Rv1694 protein in a total volume of 25.0
μmul. Incubation was carried out at 37°C, for 2.0 hours.
Reaction was terminated by extraction of RNA with
acidic phenol and chloroform followed by ethanol preci-
pitation [17]. Extracted rRNA was adsorbed on DE-81
anion-exchange membrane, washed with 100 mM Gly-
cine-HCl, pH 2.3 followed by ethanol and dried filters
were placed in scintillation fluid for radioactive counts
in Packard liquid Scintillation Counter, USA. Each reac-
tion was set-up in duplicate.
