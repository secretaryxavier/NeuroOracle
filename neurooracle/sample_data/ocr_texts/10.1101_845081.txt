ABSTRACT 
10 
Several virulence lipids populate the outer cell wall of pathogenic mycobacteria (Jackson, 
11 
2014). Phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), one of the most abundant outer membrane lipids 
12 
(Anderson, 1929), plays important roles in both defending against host antimicrobial programs 
13 
(Camacho et al., 2001; Cox et al., 1999; Murry et al., 2009) and in evading these programs 
14 
altogether (Cambier et al., 2014a; Rousseau et al., 2004). Immediately following infection, 
15 
mycobacteria rely on PDIM to evade toll-like receptor (TLR)-dependent recruitment of 
16 
bactericidal monocytes which can clear infection (Cambier et al., 2014b). To circumvent the 
17 
limitations in using genetics to understand virulence lipid function, we developed a chemical 
18 
approach to introduce a clickable, semi-synthetic PDIM onto the cell wall of Mycobacterium 
19 
marinum. Upon infection of zebrafish, we found that PDIM rapidly spreads into host epithelial 
20 
membranes, and that this spreading inhibits TLR activation. PDIM’s ability to spread into 
21 
epithelial membranes correlated with its enhanced fluidity afforded by its methyl-branched 
22 
mycocerosic acids. Additionally, PDIM’s affinity for cholesterol promoted its occupation of 
23 
epithelial membranes; treatment of zebrafish with statins, cholesterol synthesis inhibitors, 
24 
decreased spreading and provided protection from infection. This work establishes that 
25 
interactions between host and pathogen lipids influence mycobacterial infectivity and suggests 
26 
the use of statins as tuberculosis preventive therapy by inhibiting PDIM spread.

millennia (Comas et al., 2013). A result of this co-evolution is a choreographed response of 
32 
innate and adaptive immune cells culminating in the formation of granulomas, specialized 
33 
structures that permit bacterial replication and ultimately promote transmission (Ramakrishnan, 
34 
2012). A key strategy used by mycobacteria throughout infection is to avoid and manipulate host 
35 
immune pathways so as to afford the pathogen safe harbor in otherwise bactericidal myeloid 
36 
cells (Cambier et al., 2014a; Urdahl, 2014).  
37 
To better understand these host-pathogen interactions, we have taken advantage of the 
38 
optically transparent zebrafish larva, a natural host of the pathogen M. marinum (Ramakrishnan, 
39 
2020; Takaki et al., 2013). Infection of the hindbrain ventricle (HBV), an epithelium-lined 
40 
cavity, allows for the visualization and characterization of the cellular immune response (Davis 
41 
and Ramakrishnan, 2009), a response that is comparable to that seen in the mouse lung following 
42 
infection with M. tuberculosis (Srivastava et al., 2014). In both models, mycobacteria are 
43 
initially phagocytosed by tissue-resident macrophages and are eventually transferred to 
44 
monocytes which go on to form granulomas (Cambier et al., 2017; Cohen et al., 2018). 
45 
In order to reach growth-permissive cells, mycobacteria must first evade prototypical 
46 
anti-bacterial monocytes. In response to mucosal commensal pathogens, bactericidal monocytes 
47 
are recruited downstream of TLR signaling (Medzhitov, 2007). Screening of M. marinum genetic 
48 
mutants found that the cell surface lipid phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM) is required to avoid 
49 
this TLR-dependent immune response (Cambier et al., 2014b). In addition to evading immune 
50 
detection, PDIM is reported to promote pathogenesis in other ways, such as being required for 
51 
the relative impermeability of the mycobacterial cell wall (Camacho et al., 2001) and promoting 
52 
escape from phagolysosomes (Augenstreich et al., 2017; Barczak et al., 2017; Lerner et al., 2017; 
53 
Quigley et al., 2017). However, the molecular details underlying PDIM’s myriad pathogenic 
54 
functions remain unknown.   
55 
To accomplish mechanistic studies of virulence lipids, we and others developed 
56 
metabolic labeling strategies where unnatural metabolic precursors are fed to growing bacteria 
57 
(Siegrist et al., 2015). The unnatural metabolite contains a bioorthogonal functional group that 
58 
facilitates visualization of macromolecules in living bacteria (Sletten and Bertozzi, 2009). An 
59 
example is the labeling of trehalose containing lipids with azide-functionalized trehalose (Swarts 
60 
et al., 2012). Trehalose labeling is so robust that it has since been elaborated on with various 
61 
functional probes (Kamariza et al., 2018; Rodriguez-Rivera et al., 2017).

Here we have developed comparable chemical tools to monitor PDIM’s distribution 
63 
during infection, allowing us to better understand PDIM’s mechanism of action. By visualizing 
64 
PDIM during in vivo infection, we found that the first step in PDIM mediated pathogenesis is to 
65 
spread into epithelial cells in order to inhibit TLR signaling. Structure function analysis revealed 
66 
that PDIM’s inherent fluidity, afforded by its methyl-branched fatty acids, promoted occupation 
67 
of this host lipid niche. PDIM spreading was also dependent on the lipid content of host 
68 
membranes. Administration of the cholesterol lowering drug, atorvastatin (Lipitor), led to a 
69 
decrease in PDIM spreading, and subsequent resistance to mycobacterial infection. Our findings 
70 
provide a mechanistic explanation for the association of statin use with a decrease in TB 
71 
incidence (Lai et al., 2016a) and support their use as a TB preventative therapy.

RESULTS 
74 
Controlling Mycomembrane Composition by Chemical Extraction and Reconstitution  
75 
Due to the conserved synthesis of lipid intermediates, PDIM lacks unique biosynthetic 
76 
precursors to facilitate metabolic labeling (Onwueme et al., 2005). However, PDIM is removed 
77 
following petroleum ether extraction (Moliva et al., 2019), a technique previously used to 
78 
perform loss of function studies of outer mycomembrane lipids (Silva et al., 1985), as lipids can 
79 
be removed and added back with petroleum ether (Indrigo, 2003). Using this approach, we 
80 
hypothesized that we could chemically install a biorthogonal handle onto extracted PDIM and 
81 
use this modified lipid to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying PDIM’s contribution 
82 
to virulence. Similar to reports on M. tuberculosis and M. bovis, we validated that petroleum 
83 
ether extraction did not affect the growth rate of M. marinum in culture (Supplemental Figure 
84 
1A) and extracted lipids could be mixed with bacteria in petroleum ether followed by drying to 
85 
reconstitute these lipids into the mycomembrane (Figure 1A and Supplemental Figure 1B). 
86 
Similar to reports in macrophages (Indrigo, 2003), following infection of zebrafish (Figure 1B) 
87 
delipidated bacteria were attenuated for growth and this phenotype was rescued upon 
88 
reconstitution (Figure 1C and D).

2014b). TLR signaling leads to the recruitment of activated monocytes that can clear bacteria in 
95 
an inducible nitric oxide synthase-dependent fashion. PDIM-sufficient wildtype bacteria are not 
96 
detected by TLRs and instead recruit a comparable number of permissive monocytes 
97 
downstream of the chemokine CCL2 (Cambier et al., 2014b). However, since ∆mas and 
98 
∆mmpL7 lack proteins required for PDIM’s synthesis or export, the associated phenotypes could 
99 
be attributed to the missing proteins rather than to a lack of PDIM. To directly test if the 
100 
presence of PDIM on the bacterial surface is responsible for evasion of TLR-mediated immunity, 
101 
we performed a lipid-swap experiment. Wildtype and ∆mmpL7 M. marinum were either 
102 
untreated (control) or extracted and reconstituted with their native lipids or the lipids from the 
103 
other strain (Figure 1E). Petroleum ether extraction of wildtype bacteria completely removed 
104 
both dimycocerosic acid (DIM) containing lipids, PDIM and its metabolic precursor

phthiodiolone dimycocerosate (PNDIM, Supplemental Figure 1C) both of which were absent in 
106 
∆mmpL7 extracts (Supplemental Figure 1D). Following infection, wildtype control and wildtype 
107 
bacteria reconstituted with wildtype lipids grew normally whereas wildtype bacteria 
108 
reconstituted with ∆mmpL7 lipids were attenuated for growth (Figure 1F). Conversely, ∆mmpL7 
109 
bacteria were attenuated for growth, as expected, unless they were reconstituted with wildtype 
110 
lipids, in which case they grew at wildtype bacterial rates (Figure 1F). Using an antisense 
111 
morpholino to knockdown the TLR-adaptor MYD88 (Bates et al., 2007), we also found that the 
112 
dependence on TLRs to recruit monocytes to ∆mmpL7 bacteria was abolished with wildtype 
113 
lipids (Figure 1G). Taken together these experiments highlight the strengths of this chemical 
114 
approach. Not only does it recapitulate known phenotypes of PDIM genetic mutants, but it 
115 
directly links the mutant phenotypes to the absence of PDIM on the mycomembrane. 
116 
Furthermore, our data suggest that the PDIM present on the surface of the bacterium from the 
117 
onset of infection is required and sufficient to avoid TLRs, as mutants unable to replenish PDIM 
118 
on their surfaces become virulent when they are coated with wildtype lipids prior to infection.  
119 
 
120 
Synthesis of a Clickable, Biologically Active PDIM 
121 
Given the pathogenic importance of the pre-infection mycomembrane lipid content, we 
122 
hypothesized that labeling this pool of PDIM would allow us to observe characteristics 
123 
underlying its virulence mechanisms. Both PDIM and its biosynthetic precursor PNDIM are 
124 
present in the outer mycomembrane. The only difference between these lipids is their diol 
125 
backbones; PDIM has a methyl ether, while PNDIM has a ketone (Siméone et al., 2007). Either 
126 
lipid alone can promote infection in mice (Siméone et al., 2007), suggesting chemical flexibility 
127 
at this site with regards to virulence. Therefore, we converted the methyl ether of PDIM to an 
128 
alkyl halide with trimethylsilyl iodide (Jung and Lyster, 1977). Subsequent addition of sodium 
129 
azide provided azido-DIM (Figure 2A). Reconstitution of delipidated bacteria with lipids 
130 
containing azido-DIM, followed by a copper-free click reaction with the cyclooctyne fluorophore 
131 
DIBO-488 (Figure 2B) resulted in a ~100-fold increase in fluorescence (Figure 2C). Confocal 
132 
microscopy revealed the fluorescent signal to be membrane associated (Figure 2D, E), 
133 
suggesting azido-DIM incorporated into the mycomembrane. Importantly, we found that adding 
134 
back native DIMs or azido-DIM to DIM-depleted lipids prior to reconstitution (Supplemental 
135 
Figure 1E) followed by DIBO-488 labeling rescued DIM-depleted bacteria’s growth attenuation

(Figure 2F). Thus, with this approach we can generate bacteria with chemically functionalized 
138 
PDIM that retain their pathogenicity.

PDIM Spreads into Host Cell Membranes In Vivo 
141 
To visualize PDIM’s distribution, we infected zebrafish with blue-fluorescent M. 
142 
marinum that were reconstituted with azido-DIM followed by labeling with DIBO-488 (DIM-
143 
488). Immediately following phagocytosis, DIM-488 appeared to spread away from bacteria into 
144 
host membranes (Supplemental Figure 2A). Real-time imaging revealed that the spreading was 
145 
dynamic in nature, with DIM-488 deposits moving relative to host cells (Supplemental Movie 1). 
146 
To better visualize spreading of PDIM, we used the transgenic zebrafish line 
147 
Tg(mfap4:tdTomato) whose macrophages express the fluorescent protein tdTomato (Walton et 
148

al., 2015). As early as 3 hours post-infection (hpi), DIM-488 had spread into infected 
149 
macrophage membranes, at both phagosome (Figure 3A, arrows) and more distal membrane sites 
150 
(Figure 3A, arrow heads). Spreading increased across macrophage membranes by 3 days post-
151 
infection (dpi) (Figure 3B). Similar spreading was seen when azido-DIM was conjugated to 
152 
DIBO-647 (Supplemental Figure 2B, C), suggesting that the lipid, and not the fluorescent probe, 
153 
was responsible for this phenotype. To quantify the extent of PDIM spreading, we imaged the 
154 
entire HBV infection site and calculated the proportion of fluorophore labelled azido-DIM that 
155 
no longer localized with bacteria (Supplemental Figure 2D). Using this number as a proxy for 
156 
lipid spread, we saw an increase in spreading as infection progressed (Figure 3C). Spreading also 
157 
occurred following infection of THP-1 macrophages in culture (Supplemental Figure 2E). 
158 
These results were consistent with a recent report using cultured macrophages showing 
159 
that M. tuberculosis PDIM occupies their cell membranes (Augenstreich et al., 2019). 
160 
Nevertheless, we wanted to determine whether spreading was a true attribute of our labeled 
161 
PDIM or if it was an artifactual property due to our reconstitution method. To address this, we 
162 
used an established pan-glycolipid labeling method previously used to track the spread of 
163 
mycobacterial glycolipids into macrophage membranes (Beatty et al., 2000). Control and 
164 
reconstituted M. marinum were treated with periodate and then reacted with a fluorescent 
165 
hydroxylamine prior to infection (Beatty et al., 2000). We found that spreading of the total pool 
166 
of fluorophore-labeled glycolipids was equal between control and reconstituted bacteria 
167 
(Supplemental Figure 3A and B). Thus, reconstitution does not appreciably influence the 
168 
spreading dynamics of mycomembrane lipids. These data demonstrate that the introduction of a 
169 
chemically functionalized PDIM into the mycomembrane provides physiologically relevant 
170 
information regarding PDIM’s host distribution during in vivo infection. 
171 
We next wanted to understand how PDIM spreading might be promoting virulence. 
172 
While it is appreciated that mycobacterial lipids spread throughout macrophage membranes 
173 
(Beatty et al., 2000), the inability to track specific lipids in an in vivo setting has hampered 
174 
studies on the pathophysiological relevance of these observations. PDIM has been suggested to 
175 
interact with the protein substrates of the type VII secretion system ESX-1, including EsxA 
176 
(Barczak et al., 2017). PDIM and EsxA are both required for cytosolic escape from 
177 
phagolysosomes (Osman et al., 2020; Quigley et al., 2017; van der Wel et al., 2007), where 
178 
PDIM is suggested to enhance the pore forming activity of EsxA through its ability to infiltrate

180 
macrophage membranes (Augenstreich et al., 2017). Thus, we hypothesized that PDIM 
181 
localization would be dependent on EsxA secretion. Region of difference-1 M. marinum mutants 
182 
(∆RD1) which lack EsxA (Volkman et al., 2010), were reconstituted with DIM-488 prior to 
183 
zebrafish infection. There was no difference in DIM-488 spreading kinetics between wildtype 
184 
and ∆RD1 M. marinum (Supplemental Figure 3C), suggesting that EsxA does not influence

PDIM spreading.  Besides playing a role in cytosolic escape, PDIM spreading into macrophage 
186 
membranes has also been shown to promote phagocytosis of extracellular bacteria (Astarie-
187 
Dequeker et al., 2009; Augenstreich et al., 2019). To test this in vivo, we measured the rate of 
188 
phagocytosis of wildtype or ∆mmpL7 M. marinum following HBV infection by measuring the 
189 
number of discrete bacterial objects over time. As bacteria are phagocytosed, individual bacteria 
190 
can no longer be discerned by confocal microscopy and the number of discrete objects decreases. 
191 
There was no measurable difference in the rate of phagocytosis of wildtype or ∆mmpL7 bacteria 
192 
(Supplemental Figure 3D).  
193 
Given the discrepancy regarding PDIM’s role in promoting phagocytosis between the 
194 
cultured macrophage and zebrafish models, we wondered if the activation state of responding 
195 
monocyte/macrophage populations in zebrafish larvae was influencing their phagocytic 
196 
capacities. We know that PDIM-deficient bacteria recruit antimicrobial monocytes downstream 
197 
of TLR signaling, whereas wildtype bacteria recruit permissive monocytes downstream of 
198 
CCL2/CCR2 signaling (Cambier et al., 2014b). We also know that wildtype bacteria depend on 
199 
resident macrophages to produce CCL2 in order to recruit CCR2-expressing monocytes, whereas 
200 
PDIM-deficient bacteria recruit monocytes independent of resident macrophages (Cambier et al., 
201 
2017). Therefore, we wondered if PDIM plays a critical role in evading TLR detection in non-
202 
macrophage cell populations prior to any of its documented roles in directly modulating 
203 
macrophage biology. Upon closer examination, we observed DIM-488 deposits on zebrafish 
204 
epithelium at 24 hpi (Supplemental Figure 3E, arrows).  Imaging at 3 hpi we captured 
205 
extracellular bacteria having spread DIM-488 in the vicinity of an infected macrophage (Figure 
206 
3D). This ability to spread into epithelial membranes was confirmed in human A549 epithelial 
207 
cells in vitro (Supplemental Figure 3F). To address the timing of PDIM spread into epithelial and 
208 
macrophage membranes we imaged infected zebrafish at 2 hpi, prior to macrophage 
209 
phagocytosis, and at 4, 6, and 12 hpi by which time the majority of bacteria are phagocytosed. 
210 
Preceding any appreciable spreading onto macrophages, DIM-488 had already spread onto 
211 
epithelial cells by 2 hpi (Figure 3E yellow outlines and 3F). These data suggest that 
212 
mycobacteria spread PDIM onto epithelial cells prior to interactions with macrophages. To 
213 
confirm this observation, we depleted macrophages from zebrafish larva using clodronate-loaded 
214 
liposomes (Bernut et al., 2014). DIM-488 spreading still occurred in the absence of macrophages

(Supplemental Figure 3G). These data demonstrate that PDIM spreads onto epithelial cells 
216 
independent of and prior to macrophage phagocytosis.   
217 
 
218 
PDIM’s Fluidity Promotes Spread into Epithelial Cell Membranes  
219 
We sought to understand PDIM’s properties that facilitated its ability to spread into host 
220 
membranes. It is well established that increased membrane fluidity promotes membrane mixing 
221 
(Howell et al., 1972), leading us to ask if PDIM occupied membrane domains of high fluidity. 
222 
Previous studies from our lab found that the mycomembrane of Mycobacterium smegmatis is 
223 
relatively immobile by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of 
224 
metabolically labeled trehalose monomycolate (TMM) (Rodriguez-Rivera et al., 2017). We 
225 
confirmed this for M. marinum TMM. Using the metabolic label 6-azido-trehalose (Swarts et al., 
226 
2012) followed by reaction with DIBO-488 to track TMM (TMM-488), we found very little 
227 
recovery following photobleaching of TMM-488, with only around 40% of the labeled lipids 
228 
being mobile (Figure 4A–C, and Supplemental Figure 4A). When we assessed PDIM, we found 
229 
DIM-488 recovery to be very efficient, with a half-life of 3 seconds and around 95% of the 
230 
signal being mobile (Figure 4A–C, and Supplemental Figure 4B). Thus, PDIM-containing 
231 
mycomembrane domains have a uniquely high fluidity.  
232 
If high membrane fluidity facilitates membrane mixing, then TMM should not be able to 
233 
spread into host cells as efficiently as PDIM does. Indeed, we found that TMM-488 failed to 
234 
spread onto epithelial cells at 2 hpi. Only when phagocytosed within macrophages at 24 hpi was 
235 
TMM spreading detected (Figure 4D and Supplemental Figure 4C). Even in the absence of 
236 
macrophages, where bacteria have a prolonged contact time with epithelial cells, TMM-488 
237 
spreading was negligible (Figure 4E). Thus, mycomembrane fluidity appears to correlate with 
238 
the ability to spread into host epithelial membranes.  
239 
To determine if there is a causal relationship between fluidity and spreading, we used 
240 
FRAP to identify conditions that decreased PDIM’s recovery after photobleaching. Neither heat-
241 
killing nor mild chemical fixation (4% paraformaldehyde (PFA)) significantly reduced DIM-
242 
488’s recovery (Figure 4F, G and Supplemental Figure 5). However, fixation with 4% PFA + 1% 
243 
glutaraldehyde (GA), a more effective fixative for membrane-associated proteins (Huebinger et 
244 
al., 2018), resulted in an almost 80% reduction in the mobile fraction of DIM-488 (Figure 4F, G 
245 
and Supplemental Figure 5). PFA+GA treatment decreased DIM-488 spread onto epithelial cells

at 2 hpi (Figure 4H and 4I). Likewise, fixed DIM-488 did not spread into epithelial membranes 
248 
following a 24 h infection of macrophage-depleted zebrafish (Figure 4J). Nor did it spread onto 
249 
A549 epithelial cells after 24 h (Figure 4K). Together these results suggest that PDIM’s fluidity 
250 
promotes spreading into epithelial membranes.

PDIM’s Methyl-Branched Mycocerosic Acids Promote Fluidity and Spreading 
253 
To further test if PDIM’s high membrane fluidity is responsible for its spreading, we 
254 
sought to take advantage of our ability to alter PDIM’s structure. Lipid structure is known to 
255 
modulate membrane fluidity (Los and Murata, 2004). Saturated lipids form closely packed

assemblies giving rise to more rigid bilayers, while unsaturated lipids do not pack as tightly and 
258 
produce more fluid bilayers. Methyl branches on otherwise saturated lipids have also been shown 
259 
to increase membrane fluidity (Budin et al., 2018; Poger et al., 2014). Therefore, we 
260 
hypothesized that PDIM’s methyl-branched mycocerosic acids determine its fluidity. To test this, 
261 
we hydrolyzed PDIM with tetrabutylammonium hydroxide to isolate phthiocerol. We then 
262 
esterified phthiocerol with the saturated fatty acid lignoceric acid that resulted in straight chain 
263 
lipids of comparable length to mycocerosic acid. This phthiocerol di-fatty acid (PDIF) was then 
264 
treated similarly to PDIM (Figure 2A) to yield the azide-labeled PDIF, azido-DIF (Figure 5A).

FRAP studies confirmed that DIBO-488 labeled azido-DIF (DIF-488) was not as mobile as 
266 
DIM-488, with only ~50% in the mobile fraction (Figure 5B, C and Supplemental Figure 6A–C). 
267 
Upon zebrafish infection, DIF-488 failed to spread onto epithelial cells at 2 hpi (Figure 5D–F). 
268 
However, similar to other mycobacterial lipids (Beatty et al., 2000) including TMM (Figure 4A), 
269 
DIF-488 was capable of spreading into macrophage membranes at later timepoints (Figure 5F 
270 
and Supplemental Figure 6D, E). Thus, PDIM’s high fluidity mediated by its methyl-branched 
271 
lipid tails is the reason for its unique ability to spread into epithelial membranes. 
272 
 
273 
PDIM Spreading into Epithelial Membranes is Required to Evade TLRs  
274 
Is PDIM spreading into epithelial membranes required to inhibit TLR signaling? We first 
275 
evaluated monocyte recruitment towards infecting mycobacteria to address this question. 
276 
Wildtype M. marinum must be alive in order to stimulate resident macrophages to express CCL2 
277 
to recruit permissive monocytes as heat-killed bacteria failed to do so (Cambier et al., 2017). In 
278 
contrast, PDIM-deficient M. marinum do not depend on resident macrophages to recruit 
279 
bactericidal monocytes and do so in a manner independent of bacterial viability (Cambier et al., 
280 
2017). We now wondered if, in order for mycobacteria to gain access to resident macrophages, 
281 
PDIM must first spread into epithelial membranes to prevent recruitment of bactericidal 
282 
monocytes. We confirmed that heat-killed mycobacteria do not recruit monocytes (Figure 6A). 
283 
Likewise, PFA-treated bacteria which can also spread PDIM did not recruit monocytes (Figure 
284 
6A). However, monocyte recruitment towards PFA+GA treated bacteria, which do not spread 
285 
PDIM, phenocopied heat-killed ∆mmpL7 M. marinum; even though they are not viable, they 
286 
recruited monocytes to a similar extent as live bacteria (Figure 6A). Moreover, this monocyte 
287 
recruitment was now downstream of TLR signaling, as knockdown of MYD88 prevented 
288 
monocyte recruitment towards PFA+GA treated bacteria (Figure 6B). Taken together these data 
289 
demonstrate that PDIM spreading into epithelial membranes is required to prevent TLR-
290 
dependent recruitment of monocytes.  
291 
TLR signaling has been shown to recruit microbicidal monocytes that kill infecting 
292 
bacteria (Cambier et al., 2014b). Not only are PDIM-deficient bacteria killed but co-infected 
293 
PDIM-expressing bacteria are as well (Cambier et al., 2014b). This latter finding allowed us to 
294 
directly examine the link between PDIM spreading and bacterial killing by resultant TLR-
295 
signaled monocytes. We infected larvae with live red-fluorescent wildtype M. marinum along

with green-fluorescent wildtype M. marinum that were live (untreated), heat-killed, PFA treated, 
298 
or PFA+GA treated and then determined the burdens of the red fluorescent wildtype M. marinum 
299 
at 3 dpi. Only co-infection with PFA+GA treated bacteria caused attenuation of wildtype bacteria 
300 
(Figure 6C). Moreover, this attenuation was dependent on MYD88 (Figure 6D). Lastly, we asked 
301 
if PDIF, which is unable to spread into epithelial cells (Figure 4F), could rescue DIM-deficient 
302 
bacterial growth similarly to PDIM (Figure 2F). Consistent with the requirement for PDIM to 
303 
spread into epithelial cells to promote virulence, we found that reconstitution with PDIF does not 
304 
rescue bacterial growth (Figure 6E). Together these findings implicate PDIM spreading into 
305 
epithelial membranes in inhibiting TLR signaling and the resultant recruitment of microbicidal 
306 
monocytes that can kill infecting mycobacteria.

Host Cholesterol Promotes PDIM Spread and Mycobacterial Infectivity  
311 
We next asked if host lipids also influence PDIM spreading. Cholesterol has been 
312 
reported to modulate macrophage interactions with mycobacteria (Gatfield and Pieters, 2000). 
313 
However, three lines of evidence suggest a macrophage-independent relationship between 
314 
mycobacteria and cholesterol: 1) 36% of the lipid extracted from Mycobacterium bovis harvested 
315 
from necrotic mouse lung (where macrophages are sparse) was found to be host cholesterol 
316 
(Kondo and Kanai, 1976); 2) mycobacterial-associated cholesterol was isolated as a mixture with 
317 
PDIM (Kondo and Kanai, 1976); 3) M. tuberculosis grown in culture can sequester cholesterol to 
318 
its outer mycomembrane, a process dependent on mycomembrane lipids (Brzostek et al., 2009). 
319 
To test if host cholesterol interacted with PDIM to facilitate its spreading, we first grew wildtype 
320 
and ∆mmpL7 M. marinum in the presence of alkyne-cholesterol (Supplemental Figure 7A) for 48 
321 
h, followed by treatment with azide-conjugated alexafluor-647. We found that only wildtype M. 
322 
marinum could sequester cholesterol to their mycomembrane (Figure 7A–C). We next tested 
323 
whether cholesterol contributes to spreading of PDIM into host membranes. We depleted 
324 
cholesterol from A549 epithelial cells with methyl b-cyclodextrin (MßCD) which resulted in an 
325 
eight-fold decrease in cholesterol (Supplemental Figure 7B). This was associated with decreased 
326 
DIM-488 spreading (Supplemental Figure 7C). Importantly, in MßCD treated cells we could 
327 
restore cholesterol to untreated levels with water-soluble cholesterol, and this restored DIM-488 
328 
spreading (Supplemental Figure 7B, C). To test if host cholesterol facilitates PDIM spreading in 
329 
vivo, we treated zebrafish with statins, drugs that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting 
330 
step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Specifically, we used atorvastatin which was shown to lower 
331 
cholesterol in zebrafish (Maerz et al., 2019). Following 24 h of treatment, atorvastatin decreased 
332 
cholesterol levels in the larvae by 25%, and co-treatment with water-soluble cholesterol restored 
333 
cholesterol levels (Figure 7D). Atorvastatin treatment also decreased DIM-488 spreading onto 
334 
epithelial cells (Figure 7E and F), suggesting that PDIM’s interaction with cholesterol promotes 
335 
spreading into epithelial membranes in vivo. 
336 
Hypercholesteremia has been shown to exacerbate mycobacterial infection in mice and 
337 
humans (Martens et al., 2008; Soh et al., 2016), and studies suggest the utility of statins both in 
338 
TB treatment and prevention. When used in mice, statins decreased the duration of TB therapy 
339 
by one month (Dutta et al., 2016), and studies of health care databases found that statin use is 
340 
associated with decreased incidence of TB (Kim et al., 2019; Lai et al., 2016b). Accordingly, we

infection. First, we showed that statin treatment reduced bacterial burdens in the zebrafish 
344 
(Figure 7G). Next, to evaluate if statins prevented infection, we infected zebrafish with 1-3 
345 
bacteria, similar to the infectious dose in humans (Bates et al., 1965; Wells et al., 1948), and 
346 
evaluated their ability to establish infection. This infectivity assay previously found that PDIM-
347 
deficient M. marinum established infection at a reduced frequency (Cambier et al., 2017). We 
348 
treated zebrafish with atorvastatin for 24 h prior to infection with 1-3 bacteria and continued 
349 
daily atorvastatin treatment for the 3-day assay period. At 3 dpi, atorvastatin treatment decreased 
350 
wildtype M. marinum’s infectivity by 50% (Figure 7H). Moreover, restoring cholesterol levels 
351 
by co-treating with water-soluble cholesterol restored wildtype M. marinum’s infectivity (Figure 
352 
7H). This result confirmed atorvastatin reduces infectivity by lowering cholesterol rather than to 
353 
its other effects on physiology and metabolism. However, this protective low-cholesterol state 
354 
could be due to antimicrobial effects independent of PDIM spread. Altered cholesterol flux can 
355 
have pleotropic effects on immunity (Tall and Yvan-Charvet, 2015), and mycobacteria have been 
356 
shown to use cholesterol as a carbon source (Pandey and Sassetti, 2008).  
357 
To test the alternative hypothesis that atorvastatin’s protection is not through disrupting 
358 
the PDIM-TLR axis we evaluated the infectivity of PDIM-deficient ∆mmpL7 M. marinum. 
359 
Consistent with previous reports (Cambier et al., 2017), ∆mmpL7 M. marinum exhibited 
360 
decreased infectivity compared to wildtype bacteria (Figure 7I). In agreement with our model 
361 
that atorvastatin acts through modulating PDIM spread, we found that atorvastatin treatment did 
362 
not further decrease ∆mmpL7’s infectivity (Figure 7I). However, PDIM-deficient bacteria exhibit 
363 
such a severe virulence defect, any further attenuation due to other low-cholesterol-dependent 
364 
antimicrobial mechanisms may not be possible. To address this concern, we took advantage of 
365 
the fact that ∆mmpL7’s virulence defect is reversed in the absence of host TLR signaling (Figure 
366 
7I, Cambier et al., 2014b). In this condition where PDIM-deficient bacteria are fully virulent, 
367 
they should become attenuated by any non-PDIM-associated antimicrobial mechanisms caused 
368 
by atorvastatin. However, atorvastatin still did not decrease ∆mmpL7’s infectivity in MYD88-
369 
depleted hosts (Figure 7I). Finally, we showed that atorvastatin decreased the infectivity of 
370 
wildtype M. marinum in a MYD88-dependent fashion (Figure 7I). These data strongly support 
371 
the idea that atorvastatin acts to disrupt the PDIM-TLR axis. Only in conditions where PDIM is 
372 
present on bacterial surfaces and when host TLR signaling is intact will lowering cholesterol 
373 
provide a protective effect. Collectively, these data demonstrate that statins reduce mycobacterial

infectivity by reducing host cholesterol, and thereby PDIM’s infiltration of epithelial 
375 
membranes. 
376 
 
377 
DISCUSSION 
378 
Molecular Koch’s postulates are a guiding set of principles used to characterize bacterial 
379 
virulence factors (Falkow, 1988; 2004; Ramakrishnan, 2020). Genetic analyses are the mainstay 
380 
of assigning pathogenic functions to specific virulence factors, including those not directly 
381 
encoded by the genome. Virulence lipids are often assigned their pathogenic roles from studies 
382 
of bacterial mutants lacking proteins involved in the lipid’s biosynthesis or transport. Thus, these 
383 
functions can be directly attributed only to the biosynthetic protein, and not the lipid per se. 
384 
Here, by combining bioorthogonal chemistry with the zebrafish model of TB, we more 
385 
rigorously satisfy molecular Koch’s postulates to describe PDIM’s role in virulence. PDIM’s 
386 
inherent fluidity and the abundance of cholesterol in epithelial membranes influenced PDIM’s 
387 
ability to infiltrate the host lipid environment. This occupation of epithelial membranes by PDIM 
388 
mediated subversion of TLR signaling at the site of infection, thus enabling mycobacteria to gain 
389 
access to non-activated immune cells (Figure 8). 
390 
The role epithelial cells play in priming innate immunity is appreciated in several models 
391 
of bacterial pathogenesis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are both 
392 
recognized by TLR-2 on human epithelial cells leading to the production of inflammatory 
393 
cytokines (Soong et al., 2004). In zebrafish these responses result in bacterial clearance (Cambier 
394 
et al., 2014b), highlighting this pathway as a conserved response to infection. In contrast, human 
395 
epithelial cells infected by mycobacteria have no significant change in global transcription, 
396 
suggesting minimal immune detection (Reuschl et al., 2017). Our data now demonstrate that 
397 
PDIM plays a role in silencing epithelial cell responses, promoting uptake by non-activated 
398 
macrophages.  
399 
Previous models suggest PDIM facilitates a passive evasion of TLRs by masking 
400 
underlying TLR ligands (Cambier et al., 2014b; 2017). This model was based on findings that 
401 
PDIM-expressing mycobacteria were rendered growth-attenuated if co-infected with TLR-
402 
stimulating bacteria (Cambier et al., 2014b). While our current model suggests a more active role 
403 
for PDIM, we still find that TLR-stimulating bacteria cause attenuation of wildtype bacteria. 
404 
Specifically, bacteria unable to spread PDIM caused attenuation of bacteria that can spread

PDIM (Figure 6B and C). These findings argue that PDIM’s influence over innate immune 
407 
signaling is spatially restricted. PDIM appears to only inhibit TLR signaling at membrane sites 
408 
where it has spread, emphasizing the need for PDIM localization on the bacterial surface prior to 
409 
spreading into epithelial membranes. Once spread, the potential for PDIM to disrupt membrane 
410 
protein signaling is intriguing. Several biophysical properties of membranes are known to 
411 
mediate membrane protein function (Los and Murata, 2004), and PDIM has been implicated in 
412 
altering host membrane structure (Augenstreich et al., 2019). Furthermore, TLRs have been 
413 
shown to aggregate into cholesterol rich lipid domains to facilitate downstream signaling events 
414 
(Ruysschaert and Lonez, 2015). How PDIM’s affinity for cholesterol promotes spread and 
415 
whether this association disrupts TLR-cholesterol lipid domains is yet to be determined.  
416 
The finding that PDIM’s methyl-branched mycocerosic acids are required for virulence 
417 
suggests pathogenic mycobacteria have evolved a lipid-based immunomodulatory strategy 
418 
similar to that seen at host barrier tissues. While predominant across prokaryotes, methyl-
419 
branched fatty acids are only found in certain secretions of higher eukaryotes. In particular, 
420 
vernix caseosa, a white wax that covers neonates during the third trimester of gestation, is

implicated in promoting normal gut development and microbial colonization (Nishijima et al., 
422 
2019). The fetus swallows a significant amount of vernix shed in the amniotic fluid, in increasing 
423 
amounts as term birth approaches. Premature infants are exposed to substantially less vernix and 
424 
have increased rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (Ran-Ressler et al., 2011). In a rat model of 
425 
necrotizing enterocolitis, feeding premature pups methyl-branched lipids led to a decrease in 
426 
disease development and a shift from a pro-inflammatory to an anti-inflammatory gut 
427 
environment (Ran-Ressler et al., 2011). These studies implicate lipid-based immunomodulation 
428 
as playing a key role in tissue-barrier homeostasis, dampening immune responses to allow for 
429 
proper microbial colonization. Mycobacteria appear to have adapted this strategy of using 
430 
methyl-branched lipids as an immunomodulatory mechanism to establish infection and thereby 
431 
ensure their evolutionary survival. 
432 
Systemic cholesterol metabolism in humans influences the lung environment, including 
433 
the abundance of cholesterol in lung epithelial membranes (Fessler, 2017). Therefore, 
434 
cholesterol-promoted PDIM spreading may also influence M. tuberculosis transmission. While a 
435 
clinical trial is currently underway evaluating the use of statins alongside standard TB therapy 
436 
(Karakousis et al., 2019), our data instead argue for the use of statins as a TB preventative 
437 
therapy.

*Since preparing this manuscript we have found that AFDye 488 DBCO (Click Chemistry Tools, 
486 
Cat# 1278) and AFDye 647 DBCO (Click Chemistry Tools, Cat# 1302) are suitable alternatives 
487 
to the DIBO fluorophores. The DBCO dyes can be used with the same concentrations and 
488 
labeling protocols presented in this manuscript for the DIBO dyes (Unpublished data).

Procedures and materials for synthetic chemistry: All reactions were performed in dry 
491 
standard glassware fitted with rubber septa under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen unless 
492 
otherwise stated. Preparative thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed with Millipore’s 
493 
1mm and 0.2mm silica gel 60 pre-coated glass plates. Analytical TLC was used for reaction 
494 
monitoring and product detection using pre-coated glass plates covered with 0.20 mm silica gel 
495 
with fluorescent indicator; visualized by UV light and 10% CuSO4 in 1.3M phosphoric acid in 
496 
water. Reagents were purchased in reagent grade from commercial suppliers and used as 
497 
received, unless otherwise described. Anhydrous dichloromethane (DCM) was prepared by 
498 
passing the solvent through an activated alumina column.

513 
 
514 
Wildtype M. marinum was grown in GAS medium without Tween-80 to an OD600 of 1.2.  
515 
Bacteria were pelleted, frozen and lyophilized on a Labconoco FreezeZone 4.5 plus. Bacterial 
516 
lipids were then extracted by stirring lyophilized pellet in petroleum ether for 1 h at 23 ºC. 
517 
Bacteria were allowed to settle, and solvent was collected. Remaining bacteria were re-extracted 
518 
3-5 times. The solvent extract was then passed through a 0.2µm PTFE filter, and crude lipids 
519 
were concentrated under reduced pressure. Crude lipid extracts were separated by preparative 
520 
TLC in the solvent system 98:2 petroleum ether:ethyl acetate. The band correlating to PDIM at 
521 
an Rf = 0.4 was isolated. Preparative TLC was repeated twice more to further purify PDIM.

Zebrafish Husbandry and Infections  
602 
Wild-type AB (Zebrafish International Resource Center), and Tg(mfap4:tdTomato) (Walton et 
603 
al., 2015) lines were maintained in buffered reverse osmotic water systems. Fish were fed twice 
604 
daily a combination of dry feed and brine shrimp and were exposed to a 14 h light, 10 h dark 
605 
cycle to maintain proper circadian conditions. Zebrafish embryos were maintained at 28.5 ºC in 
606 
embryo media which consisted of the following dissolved in Milli-Q water (%weight/volume): 0. 
607 
0875% sodium chloride, 0.00375% potassium chloride, 0.011% calcium chloride, 0.00205% 
608 
monopotassium phosphate, 0.00089% disodium phosphate, and 0.0493% magnesium sulfate. 
609 
Embryo media was then buffered to pH 7.2 with sodium bicarbonate. Embryos were maintained 
610 
in 0.25 mg/ml methylene blue (Sigma) from collection to 1-day post-fertilization (dpf). 0.003% 
611 
PTU (1-phenyl-2-thiourea, Sigma) was added from 24 h post-fertilization (hpf) on to prevent 
612 
pigmentation. Larvae (of undetermined sex given the early developmental stages used) were 
613 
infected at 48 hpf via the hindbrain ventricle (HBV) using single-cell mycobacterial suspensions 
614 
of known titer. Number of animals to be used for each experiment was guided by pilot 
615 
experiments or by past results with other bacterial mutants and/or zebrafish. On average 15 to 40 
616 
larvae per experimental condition were required to reach statistical significance and each 
617 
experiment was repeated at least three times. Larvae were randomly allotted to the different 
618 
experimental conditions. The zebrafish husbandry briefly described above and all experiments 
619 
performed on them were in compliance with the U.S. National Institutes of Health guidelines and 
620 
approved by the Stanford Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.  
621 
 
622 
Bacterial Strains and Methods  
623 
M. marinum strain M (ATCC BAA-535) and ∆mmpL7 mutants (Cambier et al., 2014b) 
624 
expressing either TdTomato, Wasabi, or EBFP2 under the control of the msp12 promoter were 
625 
grown under hygromycin (Thermo-Fisher) selection in 7H9 Middlebrook’s medium (Difco) 
626 
supplemented with 10% OADC (Fisher), 0.2% glycerol, and 0.05% Tween-80 (Sigma). Where

642 
100nM PMA (phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, Sigma) in growth media and incubated at 37ºC 
643 
and 5% CO2 for 24 h. One day prior to infection, the media on THP-1s was replaced with fresh 
644 
growth media and the cells were incubated at 33ºC and 5% CO2 for 24 h, cells were then 
645 
infected with M. marinum at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2 in growth media. Infection 
646 
was allowed to progress for 6 h prior to washing twice with PBS and replacing with growth

chamber slides (Thermo-Fisher) at a density of 50,000 cells per well in growth media and 
650 
incubated at 37ºC and 5% CO2. Day of infection cells were moved to 33ºC and 5% CO2 for 3 h, 
651 
and then were infected with M. marinum at a MOI of 5 and incubated at 33ºC and 5% CO2 for 
652 
24 h. Infected THP-1s and A549s were then imaged as described below.

Extraction and reconstitution of M. marinum 
655 
Extraction. 1 liter of M. marinum were grown in GAS medium plus Tween-80 to an OD600 of 
656 
1.2. Bacteria were pelleted in a glass 50mL conical tubes (Fisher) of known weight, frozen and 
657 
lyophilized. The dry bacteria in 50mL conical tubes were then weighed and the dry bacterial 
658 
weight was calculated. 25mL of petroleum ether were then added to the bacteria, and the conical

tube was capped with a PTFE lined lid (Sigma) and the suspension was vortexed for 3min. An 
660 
additional 25mL of petroleum ether was added and the sample was centrifuged for 3min at 
661 
1000xg at 4ºC. The extract was then saved or discarded depending on the downstream 
662 
experimental applications and the bacteria were extracted once more as above. For total lipid 
663 
extractions (not used for reconstitution), bacteria were treated with 1:1 chloroform:methanol for 
664 
12 h at 60ºC. Extracts were filtered, back extracted with water to remove water soluble 
665 
contaminants, dried under reduced pressure and used for downstream experiments.   
666 
 
667 
Reconstitution. Prior to extractions the following calculation was used to determine the amount 
668 
of lipids to add back to each pellet. 
669 
 
670 
(23mg lipid/gram dry bacteria)*(weight in grams of dry bacteria)/(0.75 reconstitution efficiency)  
671 
 
672 
Where 23mg of lipid per gram of dry bacteria is the experimentally determined average amount 
673 
of lipid removed during petroleum ether extraction of bacteria grown in these conditions (Figure 
674 
S1B, initial extraction) and the 0.75 reconstitution efficiency was also experimentally determined 
675 
(Figure S1C). If reconstituting with DIM variants, 30% of the above weight consists of DIMs 
676 
and the remainder will consist of DIM-depleted petroleum ether lipid extracts. Following two 
677 
rounds of petroleum ether extraction as detailed above, bacteria were immediately mixed with 
678 
pre-determined lipid mixtures (or no lipid at all for delipidated bacteria) in petroleum ether (2-3 
679 
mls) followed by extended drying under reduced pressure. Dried bacteria were then rescued into 
680 
7H9 media supplemented with 10% OADC, and 0.2% glycerol (prep media) and subjected to 
681 
single cell preparation protocol.

For more thorough details, as well as rationale and explanation of the following protocol see 
685 
Takaki et al., 2013. Bacteria were washed once with 15mL of prep media followed by 
686 
resuspension in 500µl of prep media. Bacteria were then passed through a 27-gauge needle 10 
687 
times, followed by the addition of 1ml of prep media and centrifugation at 100xg for 3min. 1ml 
688 
of supernatants were saved. This process was repeated 3-5 times. Collected supernatants were 
689 
then passed through a 5.0µm acrodisc versapor membrane syringe filter (VWR). The filtrate was

then pelleted at 16,000xg for 2min, pellets were resuspended in prep media to a concentration of 
691 
around 1x10^8-9 bacteria per ml, aliquoted and stored at -20C for future use, or immediately

Metabolic labeling of M. marinum with 6-TreAz 
695 
Expression and Purification of TreT: TreT was expressed and purified utilizing a similar method 
696 
as previously reported (Urbanek et al., 2014). Top10 E. coli expressing the tret gene from 
697 
Thermoproteus tenax (pBAD plasmid, AraC control) were streaked onto a Lysogeny broth (LB) 
698 
agar plate supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. A single 
699 
colony was picked and used to inoculate 5 mL of LB liquid medium containing 100 µg/mL 
700 
ampicillin. The starter culture was placed in a shaking incubator (175 rpm) at 37 °C for 16 h. The 
701 
starter culture was then transferred to a 1 L solution of sterilized Terrific broth (TB) 
702 
supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampicillin in a sterilized 2 L Fernbach culture flask. The flask 
703 
was shaken (175 rpm) at 37 °C. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached between 0.6 and 0.9 
704 
(typically 4-5 h post inoculation), TreT expression was induced by adding 1 mL of 1 M 
705 
arabinose solution in sterile water (1 mM final concentration). The flask was again shaken (175 
706 
rpm) at 37 °C for another 20 h. The culture was then transferred to a polypropylene bottle and 
707 
pelleted for 15 minutes at 4,000 x g at 4 °C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was 
708 
suspended in 45 mL of lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.4) 
709 
and run through a homogenizer 5 times utilizing ice to keep the solution cool. Once 
710 
homogenized, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation pelleting for 20 minutes at 21,000 x g at 
711 
4 °C and filtering through a 0.45 µm Teflon syringe filter. To the clarified lysate (generally about 
712 
50 mg/mL protein content as measured with absorbance at 280 nm) was then added 5 mL of pre-
713 
washed (lysis buffer) Ni-NTA resin slurry (Qiagen). The suspension was mixed on an orbital 
714 
shaker for 60 – 90 minutes at 4 °C and then transferred to a glass column (BIO-RAD 
715 
EconoColumn). Non-His-Tagged proteins were eluted with lysis buffer until the absorbance at 
716 
280 nm matched background levels utilizing 50 – 100 mL of lysis buffer. His-tagged TreT was 
717 
eluted with elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.4) in 
718 
multiple 2.5 mL increments, until protein elution was determined complete by absorbance at 280 
719 
nm. Buffer exchange to a storage/reaction buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) was 
720 
performed with a desalting column (PD-10, GE Healthcare) and the protein was transferred to a

722 
storage. Storage of the enzyme at 4 °C and at this concentration yields active protein that does 
723 
not have significant losses in activity even after 12 months of storage under these conditions.  
724 
 
725 
Synthesis and Purification of 6-Azido-6-deoxy-trehalose (6-TreAz): To a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube 
726 
was added 200 µL of a 100 mM solution of 6-azido-6-deoxy-glucose (final concertation 20 mM), 
727 
100 µL of a freshly-prepared 400 mM solution of UDP-glucose (final concentration 40 mM), 
728 
100 µL of a 200 mM solution of MgCl2 (final concentration 20 mM), and 300 mL of reaction 
729 
buffer (50 mM Tris, 300 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Then, 300 µL of TreT solution in storage/reaction 
730 
buffer was added (final concentration 300 µg/mL) and the reaction vessel was closed and mixed 
731 
gently by inverting the tube. The reaction was heated to 70 °C for 60 – 90 minutes with shaking 
732 
at 400 rpm and then cooled on ice before further manipulation. The reaction contents were 
733 
transferred to a pre-washed Amicon centrifugal filter with a nominal molecular weight limit 
734 
(NWML) of 10 kDa. The filter was washed with DI water (2 x 1 mL) to facilitate maximal 
735 
recovery. The upper chamber was discarded and 1 g of prewashed mixed-bed ion-exchange resin 
736 
(DOWEX) was added to the filtrate and the slurry was equilibrated for 60 – 90 minutes. The 
737 
suspension was filtered, and the resin was rinsed with 3 – 5 mL of DI water. Analysis by TLC 
738 
(5:3:2 n-butanol: ethanol: DI water) and/or LC-MS equipped with a Supelco aminopropyl 
739 
column [4.6 x 250 mm, 5 µm] (isocratic 80% ACN in DI water, 0.5 mL/min flowrate) indicated 
740 
full and complete conversion of 6-azido-6-deoxy-glucose to 6-azido-6-deoxy-trehalose with high 
741 
purity as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), which matched previously reported 
742 
spectra. 
743 
 
744 
Synthesis and Direct utilization of 6-TreAz for labeling Mycobacterium marinum: To facilitate 
745 
easier production and labeling of M. marinum with 6-TreAz, the reaction was performed as 
746 
above but 6-TreAz was not isolated prior to labeling. Upon reaction completion, the reaction was 
747 
cooled on ice to bring the vessel back to ambient temperature. The 10 mM stock of 6-TreAz was 
748 
then added to cultures of Mycobacterium marinum to a final concentration of 50 µM.

Periodate-hydroxylamine staining of mycobacterial surfaces 
753 
Surface-exposed terminal oxidizable carbohydrates were labeled with hydroxylamine following 
754 
periodate oxidation. Lyophilized control or reconstituted M. marinum were washed twice with 
755 
PBS and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium acetate (Sigma), pH 5.5 containing 1 mM sodium 
756 
periodate (Sigma). Following a 20-min incubation at 4°C with gentle rotation, 0.1 mM glycerol 
757 
was added to stop the reaction. Cultures were washed three times with PBS and then subjected to 
758 
single cell preparation. Following single cell preparation, pellets were transferred to a 96-well 
759 
plate and then incubated with PBS containing 1 mM Alexa-647 hydroxylamine (Thermo-Fisher). 
760 
Following a 2 h incubation at 23 ºC, the cultures were washed 5 times with PBS and twice with 
761 
prep media.

763 
Copper-free click chemistry of M. marinum  
764 
Following reconstitution or metabolic labeling, bacteria were treated for single cell preparation. 
765 
Bacteria were then transferred to 96-well v-bottom dishes and were washed twice with PBS 
766 
using centrifugation at 3000xg for 3min between washing. Bacteria were then stained with either 
767 
5µM DIBO-488 (Thermo-Fisher), or 30µM DIBO-647 (Thermo-Fisher) in 200µl PBS for 90min 
768 
at 23 ºC protected from light. Bacteria were then washed 5 times in PBS followed by 2 washes in 
769 
prep media. Bacteria were then aliquoted and stored at -20C for future use. Staining efficiency 
770 
was evaluated by flow cytometry on a BD-Accuri C6 Plus and analysis was performed using the 
771 
FlowJo software package. Staining was also evaluated by microscopy with a 60x oil-immersion 
772 
Plan Apo 1.4 NA objective on the Nikon A1R confocal microscope.

MYD88 morpholino and liposome injections 
775 
To generate MYD88 knockdown zebrafish larvae, the MYD88 morpholino 
776 
5’GTTAAACACTGACCCTGTGGATCAT3’ (Bates et al., 2007) was diluted to 2mM in 0.5 x 
777 
tango buffer (Thermo Scientific), containing 2% phenol red sodium salt solution (Sigma). 1 nl of 
778 
the morpholino mixture was injected into the 1-4 cell stage of the developing embryo. Lipo-PBS 
779 
and lipo-clodronate (http://clodronateliposomes.org) were diluted 1:10 in PBS and injected into 
780 
2-dpf-old larvae in ~10 nl via the caudal vein.

Confocal microscopy and image-based quantification of infection  
784 
Larvae were embedded in 1.5% low melting point agarose (Thermo-Fisher) and a series of z 
785 
stack images with a 2µm step size was generated through the infected HBV.  For infected THP-1 
786 
and A549 cells, a series of z stack images with a 1µm step size was generated. Images were 
787 
captured using the galvo scanner (laser scanner) of the Nikon A1R confocal microscope with a 
788 
20x Plan Apo 0.75 NA objective. Higher resolution images were generated using a 40x water-
789 
immersion Apo 1.15 NA objective. Bacterial burdens were determined by using the 3D surface-
790 
rendering feature of Imaris (Bitplane Scientific Software). Spread lipid images were generated 
791 
by subtracting the bacterial surface from the lipid channel. 3D surface-rendering was then done 
792 
in Imaris on both the total lipid and spread lipid images to generate a percent spread value.  
793 
 
794 
Macrophage and Monocyte hindbrain recruitment assay 
795 
For the macrophage recruitment (Figure 1G): 2 dpf zebrafish were infected in the HBV with M. 
796 
marinum at the dose reported in the figure legends. At 3 h post infection, the number of total 
797 
myeloid cells in the HBV was quantified using differential interference contrast microscopy 
798 
using a 20x Plan Fluor 0.75 NA objective on Nikon’s Ti eclipse inverted microscope. For 
799 
quantification of monocytes (Figure 5A and B): 2 dpf zebrafish were injected in the caudal vein 
800 
with 200µg/ml of the nuclear stain Hoechst 33342 (Thermo-Fisher) 2 hours prior to HBV 
801 
infection. Hoechst is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore will label circulating 
802 
monocytes but will not label brain resident macrophages (Cambier et al., 2017). At 3hpi blue-
803 
fluorescent cells in the hindbrain was quantified similar to above macrophage recruitment assay. 
804 
 
805 
Co-infection Experiments 
806 
Around 40-50 tdTomato expressing wildtype M. mairnum were co-infected with an equal 
807 
number of wasabi expressing M. marinum into the HBV. At 3 dpi the bacterial volume of the 
808 
wildtype tdTomato expressing M. marinum was quantified as described above (Confocal 
809 
microscopy and image-based quantification of infection). 
810 
 
811 
Infectivity Assay  
812 
3 days post fertilization larvae were infected via the hindbrain ventricle with an average of 0.8

815 
infected or uninfected, based on the presence or absence of fluorescent bacteria.  
816 
 
817 
Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments  
818 
FRAP experiments were performed using the galvo scanner (laser scanner) of the Nikon A1R 
819 
confocal microscope with a 60x oil-immersion Plan Apo 1.4 NA objective. Photobleaching was 
820 
performed with the 405 nm laser for 200ms on a region of interest (ROI) encompassing ~1μm 
821 
from one pole of a single bacteria. A series of images was taken every second over the course of 
822 
31 seconds, one prior to bleaching. Labeled cells were mounted on a slide and coverslip in 
823 
0.75% low melting agarose. NIS Elements software (Nikon) was used to analyze the FRAP data 
824 
to extract the fluorescence recovery kinetics. Briefly, the first image before photobleaching was 
825 
used to generate an ROI for the entire cell and a second ROI was generated in the photobleached 
826 
area. Total fluorescence intensities in both the whole cell area and the bleached area were 
827 
extracted and normalized to correct for photobleaching of the dyes due to acquisition. The 
828 
normalized fluorescence intensities of the bleached area were then fitted to a non-linear 
829 
regression with a one-phase association, with the plateau values from each sample plotted to 
830 
represent the mobile fraction. 
831 
 
832 
Alkyne-cholesterol labeling of M. marinum 
833 
Wildtype or ∆mmpL7 M. marinum expressing wasabi fluorescent protein were grown in 7H9 
834 
medium supplemented with 10% OADC, 0.2% glycerol with or without 0.005% alkyne-
835 
cholesterol for 48 h. Bacteria were then washed 3x with PBS prior to the copper-click reaction 
836 
with AlexaFluor-647 Azide. For copper click: 400µM BTTP (Click Chemistry Tools) and 
837 
200µM copper sulfate (Sigma) were dissolved in PBS and allowed to complex for 20 minutes. 
838 
30µM AlexaFluor-647 Azide (Thermo-Fisher) and 1.2mM sodium ascorbate (Sigma) were then 
839 
added to the solution. Bacterial pellets in 96-well v-bottom plates were resuspended in 50µl of 
840 
the solution and were incubated at 23 ºC protected from light for 45 minutes. Bacteria were then 
841 
washed 5x in PBS prior to imaging on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope with a 60x oil-
842 
immersion Plan Apo 1.4 NA objective. Nikon elements software was used to determine 
843 
fluorescent intensities of wasabi and cholesterol signals calculated from line profiles drawn 
844 
perpendicular to bacterial membranes at least 0.5µm from either pole.

Cholesterol depletion and infection of A549 epithelial cells 
847 
A549 cells were seeded  at 50,000 cells per 8-well Nunc Lab-Tek II chambered coverglass or at 
848 
100,000 cells per well in a 24 well plate. Cells were incubated at 37 ºC for 48 h. Cells were 
849 
washed 1x in PBS followed by treatment with 10mM methyl-ß cyclodextrin (Sigma), 1mM 
850 
water-soluble cholesterol (Sigma), or a combination of 10mM methyl-ß cyclodextrin and 1mM 
851 
water-soluble cholesterol in serum free DMEM media. Cells were treated for 1 hour at 33 ºC 
852 
followed by 3 washes with PBS. Cells plated on chambered coverglass were infected with azido-
853 
DIM labeled M. marinum at an MOI of 5 for 24 h at 33 ºC followed by imaging on a Nikon A1R 
854 
confocal microscope with a 20x Plan Apo 0.75 NA objective. 2µm z-stacks were generated 
855 
through the infected cells. Azido-DIM spreading was calculated similar to above (Section: 
856 
Confocal microscopy and image-based quantification of infection). Cells plated on 24-well plates 
857 
were rescued in DMEM + 10% FBS for 3 h at 33 ºC.  Cells were then harvested for 
858 
quantification of cholesterol levels.  
859 
 
860 
Atorvastatin treatment of zebrafish larvae 
861 
At 48 h post fertilization, 0.5µM atorvastatin (Sigma), or 10µM water-soluble cholesterol 
862 
(Sigma), or both were added to zebrafish water containing 1% DMSO. Control fish were 
863 
incubated in water with 1% DMSO only. Zebrafish were incubated for 24 h prior to infection or 
864 
to cholesterol quantification. Drugs were replenished every 24 h until experiment endpoint. 
865 
 
866 
Quantification of cholesterol in zebrafish and A549 epithelial cells 
867 
Cholesterol was quantified using the Total Cholesterol and Cholesterol Ester 
868 
Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay Kit (BioVision). For zebrafish, 8 larvae were euthanized, 
869 
transferred to a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube and excess water was removed. A solution of 
870 
chloroform:isopropanol:NP-40 (7:11:0.1) was added and the sample was sonicated in a water 
871 
bath for 1 hour. Samples were then centrifuged at 16,000xg for 10min and supernatants were 
872 
transferred to a fresh tube and were allowed to dry in a 60 ºC water in a chemical fume hood. For 
873 
A549 epithelial cells, chloroform:isopropanol:NP-40 (7:11:0.1) was added directly to cells in a 
874 
24 well plate. Cells were scrapped and solution was transferred to a 1.5ml Eppendorf tube and 
875 
was centrifuged at 16,000xg for 10min and supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube and

Statistics 
881 
Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 8.4.3 (GraphPad): When appropriate 
882 
D'Agostino-Pearson normality test was done to determine if all of the groups in a particular data 
883 
set were of a gaussian distribution which then guided the subsequent statistical test performed 
884 
(Supplemental Table 1). Where the n value is given and not represented graphically in the figure, 
885 
n represents the number of zebrafish used for each experimental group (Figure 7H and I).
