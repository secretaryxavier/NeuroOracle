Abstract
Objective: This study evaluated the effect of superpulse CO2 laser irradiation and deglazing of porcelain
surfaces on the shear bond strength (SBS) of metal orthodontic brackets, and compared it with two conventional
etching techniques. Methods: Forty-eight Feldspathic porcelain fused to metal specimens embedded in cylin-
drical acrylic resin tubes were fabricated, and all the specimens were divided into four groups. In Group 1, the
specimens were roughened with a diamond bur and etched with hydroﬂuoric acid (HFA) gel for 4 min. In Group
2, the specimens were roughened with a bur and irradiated by a CO2 laser with a 2 W power setting for 20 sec.
In Group 3, the specimens were only irradiated by a CO2 laser. In Group 4, the porcelain surface was
sandblasted with 50 lm aluminum oxide. Before bonding, the bracket silane was applied on the porcelain
surfaces. SBS was evaluated by a Universal testing machine (Zwickroll, Germany). The remaining adhesive
after the bond failure was evaluated using an adhesive remnant index (ARI). Statistical analysis was conducted
by analysis of variance (ANOVA), Tukey, and Kruskal–Wallis tests. Results: ANOVA revealed signiﬁcant
differences in SBS among the four groups ( p < 0.001). Group 1 demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher bond strength
(13.13 – 2.47) when compared with the other groups. Group 2 showed higher bond strength (9.60 – 1.91) when
compared with group 4 (6.40 – 1.67) ( p = 0.016). Group 1 displayed the highest ARI scores among the groups.
Conclusions: Deglazing combined with HFA etching produced the highest bond strength, but CO2 laser
irradiation provided adequate bond strength and allowed for elimination of the HFA step. Deglazing is not
recommended as a preliminary step before CO2 laser conditioning.
Introduction
O
ne of orthodontists’ problems is the need to bond
orthodontic brackets to artiﬁcial surfaces such as por-
celain, rather than the normal tooth surface.1–4 It has been
proven that conventional acid etching is not effective in
preparing the porcelain surface for the mechanical retention
of orthodontic brackets.5,6
During the past few years, a number of methods have
been introduced to overcome this problem.7–9 One of these
techniques is deglazing the porcelain surface by roughening
the surface with a diamond bur, or microetching the surface
with aluminum oxide particles and after that bonding the
bracket with or without a coupling agent.5,10 Whereas some
laboratory studies have concluded that mechanical or che-
mical abrasion to deglaze the porcelain surface is necessary
for enhanced bond strength,11–14 others report no advantage
to deglazing, and suggest silane bonding.15,16 In a number of
studies,17–19 silanes have been used to increase the bond
strength to either glazed or roughened dental porcelain.6
Chemical preparation of the previously deglazed porcelain
surface has been suggested.5 Application of orthophosphoric
acid (OFA) as one of these chemical agents failed to present
sufﬁcient bond strength for clinical purposes.20,21 Hydro-
ﬂuoric acid (HFA), on the other hand, seemed to be able to
produce bond strength of acceptable values.4,20,21 It has even
been reported that airborne-particle abrasion and acid etching
with HFA increase the surface area of ceramic surfaces and
create an irregular topography that enhances the potential for
micromechanical retention of the adhesive cement.1

With the introduction of the laser, the idea of using it as a
means of reinforcing bond strength has become popular. In
previous studies, the efﬁcacy of different types of lasers on
porcelain surface preparation has been evaluated.5,22–26
Some studies claimed that Nd:YAG laser with appropriate
parameters can be used as an alternative method for por-
celain etching.22,23 The results on the efﬁcacy of Er:YAG
laser in porcelain conditioning is more controversial.22,24,25
Two studies evaluated the effect of CO2 laser irradiation of
porcelain surfaces on the bond strength of metal orthodontic
brackets.5,26 Akova et al. 5 concluded that superpulse CO2
laser irradiation provided adequate bonding strength between
metal brackets and porcelain surfaces. Ahrari et al.26 evalu-
ated the effect of fractional CO2 laser conditioning of por-
celain surfaces on shear bond strength (SBS) of orthodontic
brackets. This study recommended laser treatment as a suit-
able alternative to HFA for deglazed feldspathic porcelain.
Considering the challenge for orthodontists in preparation
of adequate bond strength to the porcelain surfaces and the
fact that there are few studies5,26 that evaluate the effect of
new techniques such as CO2 laser eradiation in this regard,
this study aimed to compare the effect of four different
methods of porcelain surface treatment on the SBS of or-
thodontic metal brackets.
Materials and Methods
For this experimental study, 48 porcelain fused to metal
specimens (Ceramco, Dentsply, York, PA; Heraus Kulzer,
Hanau, Germany) were fabricated. Each specimen was
formed in the form of a disc by the same operator. Felds-
pathic porcelain was placed on 3 mm nickel-chromium disc
to produce 5-mm-thick specimens with a radius of 8 mm. A
vacuum dental furnace (model: Centurion VPC, Ney Dental,
Inc., Burlington, NJ) was used to ﬁre the porcelain. The
porcelain for the alloy had a heat up rate of 55C/min to a
peak ﬁring temperature of 960C and 0 min hold. All
specimens were embedded in cylindrical acrylic resin tubes
(Cold cure acrylic, Acropars, Marlic Inc., Iran) with a
mounting jig. The mounting jig was used to align the di-
rection of debonding force parallel to the surface of the
porcelain during shear strength measurements. Metal stan-
dard edgewise maxillary central incisor brackets with 0.022
slot (American Orthodontics, Sheboygan, WI) and a surface
area of 12.09 mm2 was placed on the porcelain surface.
Before bonding the brackets, the surface area border on
which the bracket was to be placed later was drawn by
waterproof marker on the specimens so that the area that had
to be treated could be controlled.
All the specimens were divided into four groups by sys-
tematic random sampling. The groups were divided as follows:
Deglazed + HFA group (Group1): The specimens were
roughened with a diamond bur (863 Grit; Drendell and
Zweilling, Berlin, Germany) to remove the glaze and
then etched with 9.6% HFA gel (Porcelain Etch Gel,
Pulpdent Corp., Watertown, MA) for 4 min, rinsed with
distilled water for 30 sec, and then air dried for 15 sec.
Deglazed + CO2 group (Group2): The specimens were
roughened with a diamond bur to remove the glaze, and
then irradiated by superpulse CO2 laser (Ultradream
pulse V, Daeshin enterprise, Hungary) with a 2 W
power setting in the superpulse mode (15 msec, 2 Hz)
for 20 sec as suggested by Akova et al.5 via contacting
the laser probe on the porcelain surface.
CO2 group (Group 3): The specimens were only irradiated
by CO2 laser as was done with the second group,
without removing the glaze.
Sandblasted group (Group 4): The porcelain surface was
sandblasted (Micro-etcher, Sandblaster, Masel, 2701
Bartram road, Bristol, USA) with 50lm aluminum ox-
ide at 80psi for 5 sec. In order to remove the remnants of
aluminum oxide, after the sandblasting procedure, all the
specimens were cleaned with compressed air for 20 sec.
In the four groups, a silane coupling agent (Silane Bond
Enhancer; Pulpdent Corp.) was applied after porcelain
conditioning. Then, the brackets were bonded with light-
curing orthodontic adhesive according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Transbond XT, 3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA).
The excess resin was removed by an explorer and the each
surface was cured with light curing device (L.E.D. curing
unit, Smartlife IQ2, Dentsply, Milford, USA) for a total of
40 sec from mesial, distal, occlusal, and gingival directions
(10 sec each).
The specimens were then placed in an incubator (Vafaei,
Iran) in water at 37C for 24 h, and then SBS was evaluated
by Universal testing machine (Zwickroll, Germany) with a
crosshead speed of 1 mm/sec. During the debonding pro-
cedure, the bonded surface of the porcelain was parallel to
the direction of force application, and the blade of the In-
stron was placed against the wing of the bracket. The shear
force on the specimen was continued until debonding oc-
curred. The maximum load applied to the surface (in
Newtons) before debonding occurred was then divided by
the cross-sectional area of the bracket (12.09 mm2) so that
the results were obtained in megapascals (MPa). The pro-
cess of applying the shear forces against the brackets and
porcelain surface treatment was accomplished by operators
who were blinded to the study.
After debonding the brackets, the porcelain specimens
were examined under a stereomicroscope (SZ 40, Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan) of · 20 magniﬁcation to assess the mode of
failure. Adhesive remnants indexes (ARI) were graded as
suggested by Artun and Bergland27:
Grade 0: no adhesive remnant on former bracket site
Grade 1: adhesive remnants covering £50% of the former
bracket site
Grade 2: adhesive remnants covering > 50% of the former
bracket site
Grade 3: all adhesive left behind on the former bracket
site
Statistical analysis
To compare mean SBS among different groups of the
study, statistical analysis was conducted by means of one
way analysis of variance (ANOVA). At the next step (post-
hoc), in order to compare the groups two by two, Tukey test
with a correction in p value was used. Kruskal–Wallis and
Mann–Whitney tests were used to compare the ARI scores.
The statistical signiﬁcance level was established at 0.05. All
the statistical analysis was performed by SPSS software
(Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Version 11.5,
SPSS, Chicago, IL).

Results
The descriptive statistics of the shear bond strength in all
four groups are summarized in Table 1. ANOVA revealed
signiﬁcant differences in SBS among the four groups
( p < 0.001). Two by two comparison of the mean SBS in the
study groups is outline in Table 2. Multiple comparisons by
Tukey test demonstrated that the highest bond strength was
in the deglazed + HFA group (Group 1) and that the lowest
was in the sandblasted group (Group 4).
The distribution of ARI scores is shown in Table 3.
Kruskal–Wallis showed that there were signiﬁcant differences
among the four groups (p< 0.001) regarding the ARI scores. In
the deglazed+ HFA group (Group 1), an increased frequency
of ARI score 2 was reported. In the deglazed+ CO2 group
(Group 2), a higher frequency of ARI score 1 was present, and
none of the failures occurred in ARI scores of 2 or 3. In the
sandblasted and CO2 laser groups (Groups 3 and 4), most of
the bond failures happened at ARI scores of 0. No ARI scores
of 3 were reported in any of the specimens (Fig. 1).
Discussion
Because of the chemical properties of bonding agents as
well as the glazed surfaces of porcelain, bonding orthodontic
brackets to porcelain surfaces has always been an issue for
orthodontists.5 Conventional methods such as acid etching
provide an inadequate bond strength for orthodontic brackets
and, therefore, are not as effective.7 A number of alternative
methods have been suggested to overcome this problem, such
as deglazing and roughening the porcelain surface with a
diamond bur, microetching the surface with aluminum oxide
particles, conditioning the porcelain surface with the appli-
cation of silane, and, most recently, lasers.5,10,13,14,18,21–26
Some of the previous studies22–25 have evaluated the ef-
fect of Nd:YAG and Er:YAG lasers on porcelain surface
treatment for efﬁcient bracket bonding, whereas some other
studies5,26 have assessed the effectiveness of CO2 laser for
this purpose.
During the process of heat induction of porcelain surfaces
with a focused CO2 laser, conchoidal tears, a typical effect
of surface warming, appear. It is said that these tears provide
mechanical retention between the composite resin and por-
celain.5,28 Considering several advantages CO2 lasers pro-
vide, such as time saving and biocompatibility,5 their
effectiveness on the SBS of orthodontic brackets was
compared with that of sandblasting and HFA etching in our
study. The deglazed + HFA group (Group 1) demonstrated
signiﬁcantly higher bond strength (13.13 – 2.47) when
compared with other groups; whereas the deglazed + CO2
group (Group 2) showed higher bond strength (9.60 – 1.91)
when compared with the sandblasted group (Group 4)
(6.40 – 1.67) ( p = 0.016).
According to Reynolds,29 a minimum bond strength of
6–8 MPa is required for efﬁcient clinical orthodontic bonding,
whereas 13 MPa has been considered the maximum autho-
rized strength between porcelain and adhesive to prevent
cohesive porcelain fracture.30 In our study, the mean SBS in
the deglazed+ HFA group (group 1) was 13.13, which is not
only higher than the values reported for other groups, but also
higher than the maximum authorized strength between por-
celain and adhesive.30 The values reported in the rest of the
groups in our study were well within acceptable limits.
The effectiveness of different types of lasers on porcelain
surface treatment has been evaluated in previous studies.5,22–26
It has been proven that CO2 wavelength is absorbed
almost totally by porcelain, suggesting that it as a good
candidate for porcelain surface treatment.5,28 Some inves-
tigators5,26 used the CO2 laser as the present study, and
reported satisfying results in SBS as a result of conditioning
the porcelain surface by CO2 laser. Akova et al.5 studied the
effect of conventional CO2 laser with the output energy of
2 W on the bond strength of orthodontic brackets to porce-
lain surfaces, and reported that the average debonding force
was 6.26 – 0.58 MPa. All the samples in their study were
deglazed by grinding. It has been stated that this method has
the capability of introducing microcracks along the porce-
lain and, therefore, is not recommended by some investi-
gators.5,7 Ahrari et al.26 used a fractional CO2 laser with
different output energies on glazed and deglazed porcelain
surfaces. This study showed that deglazing followed by CO2
laser treatment at 10 W produced the highest mean bond
strength (11.4 MPa), whereas the glazed surfaces treated by
CO2 laser at 20 W yielded the lowest SBS value (4.4 MPa).

ZARIF NAJAFI ET AL.

In our study, laser irradiation with an output energy of 2 W
was used for treating the porcelain surface. The power of the
laser used in the study of Akova et al.5 was also 2 W, which
was obtained from a pilot study comparing the effect of 2, 3,
5, 10, and 15 W powers on surface bond strength. That pilot
study found that output energies other than 2 W were not
suitable for porcelain surface treatment and produced surface
cracks, which could reduce the fracture resistance of porce-
lain. However, in the study of Ahrari et al.,26 porcelain sur-
faces were irradiated with the different powers of 10, 15, and
20 W, using a fractional CO2 laser device. Their results in-
dicated that the bond strengths of the aforementioned groups
were not signiﬁcantly different from each other.
In the present study, the deglazed and laser-irradiated group
(Group 2) showed higher SBS than the group only irradiated
by laser (Group 3), but the difference was not statistically
signiﬁcant. This ﬁnding is in agreement with that of Akova
et al.5 who did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant differences between the
SBS of glazed and deglazed surfaces. Ahrari et al.,26 however,
reported that the SBS of the deglazed and laser-irradiated
group was higher than that of the glazed group, and concluded
that CO2 laser can produce higher bond strength on deglazed
porcelain when compared with HFA. The difference between
the results of the present study and the study of Ahrari et al. can
be attributed to different parameters and duration of laser ap-
plication. The specimens in the latter study were treated with a
fractional CO2 laser in dynamic mode for 10sec, with an
output energy of 10mJ, a frequency of 200 Hz, and powers of
10 and 15W, which were different from the parameters used in
our study [2W power setting in the superpulse mode (15 msec,
2 Hz) for 20sec]. Moreover, the bond strength of the speci-
mens treated by HFA were lower in the study of Ahrari et al.26
than in our study, which may be related to different etching
time (2 vs. 4 min). In the study conducted by Ahrari et al.,26
the type of bracket and adhesive used was the same as our
study; moreover, none of the specimens were thermocycled,
whereas in the study conducted by Akova et al.,5 a different
type of bracket and adhesive was used and the specimens
underwent thermocycling prior to SBS testing. However, the
results of our study were mostly in agreement with the results
of Akova et al., rather than with those of Ahrari et al. There-
fore, it can be deduced that surface conditioning techniques as
well as laser parameters play a more crucial role in the bond
strength of brackets to ceramic surfaces than do the afore-
mentioned factors.
Deglazing may increase the risk of crack propagation and
probability of porcelain fracture during debonding,31 and the
aesthetic characteristics may be irreversibly damaged by the
roughening process.32 Considering the comparable bond
strength of the glazed and deglazed porcelain surfaces ir-
radiated by laser in the present study, grinding the porcelain
surface before bonding in cases in which CO2 laser is to be
applied cannot be justiﬁed.
The ﬁndings of the present study indicate that porcelain
treated with either CO2 laser irradiation or sandblasting can
yield bond strength values within the acceptable clinical
range. Considering the need for rinsing and drying the
porcelain surface following the application of HFA, it is
obvious that a more time-consuming process is required
when working with HFA (*4 min) than when working with
CO2 laser (20 sec). Moreover, HFA requires extra care to
avoid soft tissue damage.
The evaluation of the remaining composite after the
shear bond test showed that none of the specimens had an
ARI score of 3, which means that in none of the experi-
mental groups did the entire adhesive remain on the por-
celain surface. The highest frequency of an ARI score of 2
was found in the deglazed + HFA group (Group1), which
had the highest reported SBS as well. It can be concluded
that HFA produces the best wettability of porcelain sur-
face. This ﬁnding could also indicate that more time is
needed to remove the remaining adhesive from the por-
celain surface treated by HFA than with CO2 laser after
bracket debonding.
It has been proven that adhesive failure during debonding
is preferred to cohesive failure, because the latter may lead
to porcelain fracture.33 If the bond strength between the
porcelain and composite resin is > 13 MPa, the risk of co-
hesive fracture increases.30 This is in agreement with the
results of our study, because in the deglazed + HFA group
(Group 1), the reported bond strength was > 13 MPa, and all
of the bond failures were cohesive, whereas in the CO2 and
FIG. 1.
After debonding the brackets, we found three modes of bond failure in the porcelain specimens under the
stereomicroscope. (A) Adhesive remnant index (ARI) 0: no adhesive remnant on the former bracket site. (B) ARI 1:
adhesive remnants covering £50% of the former bracket site. (C) ARI 2: adhesive remnants covering > 50% of former
bracket site.
CO2 LASER AND PORCELAIN CONDITIONING

sandblasted groups (Groups 3 and 4) most of the bond
failures were adhesive. A higher frequency of adhesive
failure in the latter two groups compared with HFA can be
attributed to the lower bond strength.
It is highly recommended that further in vivo studies be
conducted to obtain further information regarding different
surface treatment procedures.
Conclusions
The results of this study indicated that HFA provides a
higher-than-recommended SBS, whereas CO2 laser irradia-
tion with or without porcelain deglazing provides adequate
bond strength between metal brackets and porcelain sur-
faces. Therefore, considering the more time-consuming
process required for porcelain etching with HFA, possible
soft tissue injuries, and the excessive mean bond strength,
CO2 laser can be recommended as an appropriate substitute
for HFA in porcelain surface treatment, with a diminished
risk of porcelain fracture. Considering the comparable bond
strength in the laser-treated groups with or without porcelain
deglazing, and the risks engendered by deglazing on the
integrity of porcelain, deglazing is not recommended prior
to CO2 laser irradiation. Moreover, based on the results of
the ARI scores, albeit HFA provides the best porcelain
surface wetting, complete adhesive removal following a
bond failure will be more time-consuming.
