Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, is one of the most successful 
pathogens of humans. It has evolved several adaptive skills and evasion mechanisms to hijack the 
immunologically educated host to suit its intracellular lifestyle. Here, we show that one of the unique 
PPE family member proteins of M. tuberculosis, PPE2, can limit nitric oxide (NO) production by 
inhibiting inos gene transcription. PPE2 protein has a leucine zipper DNA-binding motif and a functional 
nuclear localization signal. PPE2 was translocated into the macrophage nucleus via the classical 
importin α/β pathway where it interacted with a GATA-binding site overlapping with the TATA box 
of inos promoter and inhibited NO production. PPE2 prolonged intracellular survival of a surrogate 
bacterium M. smegmatis in vitro as well as in vivo. This information are likely to improve our knowledge 
of host-pathogen interactions during M. tuberculosis infection which is crucial for designing eơective 
anti-TB therapeutics.
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a successful intracellular pathogen that has developed several adaptive skills and 
evasion mechanisms to hijack host defense processes1. Complete genomic sequencing of M. tuberculosis H37Rv 
genome revealed the presence of two novel gene families that comprise almost 10% of the coding capacity of 
the genome2,3. Tese are designated as pe and ppe genes and are characterized by the presence of conserved 
Proline-Glutamate (PE) and Proline-Proline-Glutamate (PPE) residues near the start of their coding sequences 
respectively2,4. Tese genes are found to be unique to Mycobacterium genus, both pathogenic and non-pathogenic 
but are particularly abundant in pathogenic species such as M. tuberculosis2. Tough initially speculated to be var-
iable antigens, these genes appear to be critical modulators of host responses by employing diverse mechanisms 
and appear to be associated with the evolution of mycobacterial pathogenicity2,3.
A NCBI conserved domain database search predicted PPE2 to be a member of the orthologous group 
COG5651, members of which are involved in cell motility and secretion5,6. While analyzing the sequences of 
the PPE family proteins of M. tuberculosis, we identiﬁed presence of a monopartite nuclear localization signal 
(NLS) at the C-terminal region (473–481 aa) and a leucine zipper motif (319–340 aa) in PPE2 protein, typical to 
eukaryotic transcription factors. Several plant pathogenic bacterial eﬀector proteins are known to be targeted to 
diﬀerent subcellular organs including the nucleus and most of the nucleus targeted proteins are characterized by 
the presence of functional NLSs7. For example, VirD2 and VirE2 proteins of Agrobacterium tumefaciens contain 
bipartite NLS which are secreted into host cells via the type IV secretion system. VirD2 binds the A. thaliana 
importin-α​ subunit KAPα​1 in a manner dependent on the presence of the C-terminus-proximal NLS that uti-
lizes the classical nuclear import pathway8. Similarly, AvrBs3, AvrXa5, AvrXa7, AvrXa10 and PthA proteins of 
Xanthomonas spp., contain monopartite NLS which allows them to be localized into the plant nucleus and regu-
late plant gene expression during infection7,9. Tese transcription activator-like (TAL) eﬀectors are characterized 
by a central DNA-binding region consisting of a nearly identical tandem of 34 amino acid repeats, followed

by a classic monopartite NLS and an acidic transcriptional activation domain9. Nuclear targeting of bacterial 
eﬀector proteins and subsequent pathology of the host cells appears to be an emerging pathogenic mechanism of  
bacteria7,9,10. However, in animals, few bacterial proteins are known to be targeted to the nuclei though bioinfor-
matics analyses predicted many pathogenic bacterial proteins to contain putative NLSs, but in most cases, their 
pathophysiological functions are yet to be demonstrated10,11. Accordingly, we speculated nuclear localization of 
PPE2 where it may modulate transcription by binding to the regulatory regions of host genes.
Expression of PPE2 is up-regulated in M. tuberculosis during hypoxia and nitric oxide (NO) stress as well as 
in DosS-null mutants upon exposure to NO12,13 and also when resident inside the macrophage environment13. 
Interestingly, homologs of PPE2 are absent in non-pathogenic mycobacteria but a homolog of PPE2 present in M. 
leprae (PPE12) lacks the predicted NLS or DNA-binding domain as found in M. tuberculosis PPE2. Tis indicates 
a possible role of this protein in protecting the bacterium during NO stress. Indeed, earlier we found that PPE2 is 
a secretory protein and in infected macrophages, PPE2-null mutants allowed higher production of nitric oxide14. 
Te potential mechanisms by which NO may aﬀect antimicrobial activity are protean. NO and other RNI can mod-
ify bacterial DNA, protein, and lipids at both the microbial surface and intracellularly. NO can deaminate as well 
as directly damage bacterial DNA by generating abasic sites and strand breaks15. Tough, the role of NO in human 
infection is debatable, several lines of evidences suggest that NO plays a contributory role in human host defense 
against tuberculosis1,16. At low pH, NO bactericidal eﬀects are shown to be boosted16. Peripheral blood monocytes 
and alveolar macrophages from the lungs of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis express higher levels of 
iNOS17,18. Interestingly, it has been observed that in vitro tolerance of mycobacteria to NO/ROIs is strain-, dose- 
and time-dependent, with pathogenic strains being more resistant than non-pathogenic stains16. Terefore, it 
appears that pathogenic strains may employ certain defensive strategies to counter the toxic eﬀects of NO and its 
diﬀerent oxidation products. Our earlier studies demonstrated that macrophages infected with PPE2-null mutant  
M. tuberculosis can produce higher levels of NO as compared to macrophages infected with wild-type strain14 
suggesting that PPE2 may help the bacteria to inhibit NO production and could be a virulent factor. In this man-
uscript, we found that PPE2 mimics a eukaryotic transcription factor that translocates into the nucleus and binds 
to upstream regulatory sequences of iNOS, modulating transcription driven by its promoter.
Results
PPE2 contains a functional NLS sequence important to translocate to nucleus. 
Te sequence 
analysis of PPE2 (Rv0256c) predicted a strong monopartite nuclear localization signal as well as presence of a 
leucine zipper motif at the C-terminal region of PPE2 with 100% probability of nuclear transport (Fig. S1). We 
found that the monopartite NLS present in PPE2 is biologically functional, since transiently expressed GFP-
tagged PPE2 in RAW 264.7 macrophages could be localized into the nucleus, whereas truncated mutants without 
the NLS signal (Δ​NLS-PPE2) failed to do so (Fig. 1A,B). Similarly, when the positively charged arginine residues 
in the monopartite NLS were replaced by neutral alanine residues, the mutant PPE2 (MutNLS-PPE2) also failed 
to be localized inside the nucleus.
Nuclear import of PPE2 involved classical importin α​/β​ since ivermectin19 was able to block its nuclear import 
(Fig. 1C,D) and PPE2 with intact NLS sequence directly interacted with importin α​/β​ but not Δ​NLS-PPE2 or 
MutNLS-PPE2 (Fig. 1E). Tese data suggest that PPE2 translocates to the nucleus by utilizing the traditional 
nuclear import pathway like VirD2 of Agrobacterium7–9, AvrBs3 of Xanthomonas7,9 rather than a ‘piggyback’ 
mechanism ofen utilized by some proteins lacking typical NLS like Iκ​Bα​20 for their nuclear import.
Nuclear translocation of PPE2 is important for inhibition of nitric oxide in activated macrophages.  
Earlier, we found that in infected macrophages, PPE2-null mutants allowed higher production of nitric oxide14, 
indicating a role of PPE2 in inhibiting NO production. Macrophages expressing wild-type PPE2 could sig-
nificantly inhibit formation of LPS-stimulated nitrite, but not the cells transfected with Δ​NLS-PPE2 or 
MutNLS-PPE2 (Fig. 2A). Since NO is predominantly produced by the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in 
macrophages, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed to compare LPS-induced inos transcript levels in these 
groups and PPE2 was found to strongly inhibit inos gene transcription (Fig. 2B,C). When a luciferase reporter 
gene driven by the inos promoter was transfected to RAW 264.7 macrophages stably expressing wild-type PPE2 
(pCX4Neo-PPE2) (Fig. S2), luciferase activity was found to be signiﬁcantly inhibited upon stimulation with LPS 
as compared to those cells harbouring truncated PPE2 (pCX4Neo-Δ​NLS-PPE2) (Fig. 2D), suggesting a role of 
PPE2 in inhibiting transcription from the inos promoter.
PPE2 binds to iNOS promoter. 
As PPE2 was predicted to contain a leucine zipper DNA-binding motif, we 
speculated that PPE2 probably binds to some crucial regulatory element of the promoter important for inos gene 
transcription. In addition to major role played by NF-κ​B and IRF-121, binding sites of several other transcription 
factors linked to iNOS regulation are found to be conserved that include GATA-122. Using Alibaba2.1 (http://
wwwiti.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/-grabe/alibaba2)23, we found at least ﬁve putative GATA-1 binding sites in the 5′​
-upstream region of the transcriptional start site. Interestingly, one of the putative sequences (−​16 to −​25) was 
found to be overlapping with the TATA box close to the transcription initiation site (Fig. 3A). We observed a spe-
ciﬁc and concentration-dependent binding of recombinant PPE2 protein to the GATA-1-binding oligonucleotide 
proximal to the TATA box of inos promoter (Fig. 3B). Speciﬁcity of binding was further conﬁrmed by a supershif 
using anti-PPE2 antibody (Fig. 3C, lane 3). PPE2 could also speciﬁcally interact with a consensus GATA element 
(Fig. 3D) but failed to interact with cognate oligonucleotides to IRF-1 (Fig. 3E) as well as NF-κ​B (Fig. 3F). We 
also observed speciﬁc binding of PPE2 with the GATA-1 binding oligoneucleotide proximal to the inos TATA 
box when nuclear extract prepared from the stable cells expressing wild-type PPE2 (mostly translocated to the 
nucleus (Fig. S2)) was used in EMSA (Fig. 3G). A supershif was observed when anti-PPE2 antibody was incu-
bated with these nuclear extracts (Fig. 3G, lane 5) but not with those of macrophages harbouring the backbone

vector indicating that PPE2 when present inside nucleus can interact with cognate oligonucleotides to GATA-1 
(Fig. 3G, lane 3). Retarded bands were also observed in control extracts (Fig. 3G, lanes 2 and 4) presumably due 
to presence of native GATA-1 protein in the control extracts.
PPE2 was responsible for better survival of the bacilli inside the cells. 
Next, we examined whether 
migration of PPE2 in the nucleus and reduction in NO production in turn facilitated intracellular survival of the 
bacilli inside macrophages. When peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice and RAW 264.7 murine mac-
rophages were infected with Msmeg-PPE2, they produced signiﬁcantly low levels of NO as compared to cells 
infected with M. smegmatis expressing either Δ​NLS-PPE2 (Msmeg-Δ​NLS-PPE2) or backbone vector pVV16 
(Fig. 4A,B). Also there is an inverse correlation between the levels of NO production and bacterial survival 
inside macrophages as Msmeg-PPE2 survived for signiﬁcantly longer time period inside both the peritoneal 
macrophages (Fig. 4C) and RAW 264.7 macrophages (Fig. 4D) producing lower levels of NO as compared to 
Msmeg-Δ​NLS-PPE2 or Msmeg-pVV16. Similarly, M. smegmatis survived signiﬁcantly longer in RAW 264.7 
macrophages stably expressing wild-type PPE2 but not Δ​NLS-PPE2 (Fig. 5B) and this observation was well 
correlated with the levels of NO produced in these cells. Upon infection, the RAW 264.7 macrophages stably 
expressing wild-type PPE2 produced signiﬁcantly lower amount of NO as compared to macrophages expressing 
Δ​NLS-PPE2 (Fig. 5A).
Lower expression may be attributed to the presence of translocated PPE2 in the nucleus which is presuma-
bly leaked into cytoplasm from the arrested endosomes24,25 containing the invading mycobacteria. To test this

antibody or anti-PPE2 antibody. About 50 μ​g of the cell extract from each group was used as input control. All

hypothesis, we examined localization of PPE2 in infected macrophages over a period of time. In RAW 264.7 
macrophages infected with M. smegmatis expressing wild-type PPE2 (Msmeg-PPE2), PPE2 was found to be colo-
calized with an early endosome marker EEA1 at around 1 hour post-infection, but at 6 hour post-infection, most 
of the PPE2 protein was found to be localized in cytoplasm as evident from its co-localization with a cytoplasmic 
marker tubulin (Fig. S3A). Te leaked cytoplasmic PPE2 then translocates to the nucleus as we also observed 
prominent PPE2 staining along with DAPI (a nuclear marker) at 6 hour post-infection (Fig. S3). As expected, no 
PPE2-speciﬁc staining was detected in cells infected with M. smegmatis harbouring the backbone vector pVV16 
(Msmeg-pVV16) (Fig. S3B). We further conﬁrmed presence of PPE2 in the nucleus of C57BL/6 peritoneal mac-
rophages infected with Msmeg-PPE2 by Western blotting (Fig. S4A) and confocal microscopy (Fig. S4B).
NO produced by the activated macrophages plays an important role as a cytotoxic eﬀector molecule against 
various pathogens including mycobacteria at least in mice model of infection1,15, though its role in human infec-
tion is highly debatable16. To understand a direct role of NO in the survival of M. smegmatis, we next pre-treated 
the C57BL6 peritoneal macrophages with either sodium nitropruside (SNP), a known NO donor (or aminogua-
nidine (AG), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase26,27 before infection with Msmeg-PPE2 or Msmeg-Δ​NLS-PPE2 
or Msmeg-pVV16 and intracellular survival of these strains were examined. Te control cells were lef in medium 
alone. As expected, Msmeg-PPE2 survived better than Msmeg-Δ​NLS-PPE2 or Msmeg-pVV16 in untreated cells 
which also correlated well with the levels of NO induced during infection (Fig. 6). However, in the presence of 
high levels of NO in SNP-treated cells, all the recombinant strains showed poorer CFU counts whereas inhibition

a constitutive CMV promoter. Cells were either cultured in medium alone or stimulated with LPS +​ IFN-γ​ for 
24 hours. Te relative expression of inos-driven luciferase was normalized to β​-Galactosidase expression. Data

of NO production in macrophages by AG allowed survival of Msmeg-Δ​NLS-PPE2 and Msmeg-pVV16 similar 
to Msmeg-PPE2 (Fig. 6). Tese results indicate that NO was responsible for the killing of mycobacteria in mac-
rophages. Terefore, it appears that mycobacteria evolved strategies to check NO production in macrophages by 
targeting inos using PPE2 protein.
Next, C57/BL6 mice were infected intraperitoneally with either Msmeg-PPE2 or Msmeg-Δ​NLS-PPE2 
or Msmeg-pVV16 and bacterial loads as well as iNOS induction was quantitated. Bacterial loads were found 
to be signiﬁcantly higher in spleen, liver and lungs in mice infected with Msmeg-PPE2 as compared to mice 
infected with Msmeg-Δ​NLS-PPE2 or Msmeg-pVV16 at both day 2 (Fig. 7A,C and E) and day 7 (Fig. 7B,D 
and F). Te increased bacterial load in Msmeg-PPE2-infected mice was found to be associated with decreased 
levels of inos expression in these mice whereas opposite was found to be true for Msmeg-Δ​NLS-PPE2- or 
Msmeg-pVV16-infected control mice (Fig. 8). Tese data suggest an important role of PPE2 in inhibiting iNOS/
NO induction and conferring survival advantages to mycobacteria.
Discussion
Te studies presented herein hint a putative pathophysiological role of M. tuberculosis protein, Rv0256c (PPE2), 
which inhibits the production of iNOS at the transcriptional level and thus NO production in macrophages. 
Inhibition of NO production could be one of the mechanisms by which the bacilli create a favorable environment

inside the macrophages to favor their survival. Although tuberculosis is multifactorial and there is no single factor 
reported to be exclusively responsible for the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis, a wealth of literature argues the 
importance of NO in the killing of M. tuberculosis.
We reported earlier that PPE2 is expressed during active pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis28. Our studies indi-
cate that PPE2 contains a physiologically active NLS as well as a DNA-binding leucine zipper motif that trans-
locates into host cell nucleus and inhibits gene transcription driven by the inos promoter and promotes better 
survival of M. smegmatis expressing PPE2 in vitro as well as in vivo (Figs 1, 2, 4, 5 and 7; Fig. S5). Upon infection, 
PPE2 appears to be localized in endosomes earlier during infection, but later on was found to be translocated to 
the nucleus probably by leaking into the cytosol and then binding to importin-α​ via its NLS. Several mycobac-
terial proteins are known to escape into the cytosol from the arrested phagolysosome29,30. Another possibility 
is that mycobacteria themselves can escape directly into the cytosol from phagolysosomes to release virulent 
proteins for modulating host functions31–33. Interestingly, PE_PGRS6234, PE5 and PE1535 can also inhibit inos 
gene transcription in macrophages. However, the mechanisms are not well understood. Tough the bacterium 
lacks classical virulence factors such as toxins, typical to several other bacterial pathogens, it employs vast array of 
factors to modulate multiple host cellular processes to favor its intracellular survival1. Te ability to modulate host 
cellular processes through functional mimicry is a powerful tool, usually achieved through homologous enzymes 
that have been subverted for the beneﬁt of pathogen and ofen have considerable similarities with the cognate 
host proteins at the primary amino acid sequence levels particularly around their active or regulatory sites36,37. 
Typical examples are serine threonine kinase YpkA, cysteine protease YopJ from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis38 and 
also inositol phosphatase SopB from Salmonella dublin39. Interestingly, we did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant sequence 
homology of PPE2, a leucine zipper protein, with zinc-ﬁnger containing GATA-binding factor, the cognate target 
DNA sequence of which it speciﬁcally binds, suggesting a functional mimicry at the tertiary level. Such con-
vergent evolution is perhaps intriguing as it requires sculpting the available genes and proteins encoded by the

bacteria to perform a new function rather than obtaining a foreign homologous sequence through horizontal 
gene transfer36,37. Since a GATA-1 consensus sequence was present overlapping with inos TATA box, we speculate 
that PPE2 protein possibly sterically inhibit recruitment of transcription machinery by directly competing with 
binding of TATA binding protein. Such direct competition mechanism of transcriptional repression is widely 
prevalent in bacteria such as the LacI repressor protein of lac operon40. However, inhibition of transcription by 
direct competition is though demonstrated in eukaryotes, their ability to do so under physiological conditions 
is arguable. For instance, chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factors (COUP-TFI and II, also 
known as Ear 2 and 3) are widely conserved orphan nuclear hormone receptors that have binding speciﬁcity 
similar to those of RAR, VDR, and SF-1 receptors41. When COUP-TF factors are overexpressed in transfection 
assays, activation by SF-1 of vertebrate CYP17 promoter is found to be inhibited42. However, during MHC-I

promoter repression, COUP-TFII antagonizes the activity of NF-κ​B from non-overlapping sites, suggesting a 
mode of repression that is independent of direct competition43. Terefore, alternative mechanisms in which PPE2 
may inhibit transcription by binding to non-overlapping GATA-1 sites present in the upstream region of the inos 
promoter cannot be rule out. It will be interesting to further investigate in this direction.

Mande, NCCS, Pune, India using a forward primer (5′​-CGAGATCTATGACCGCCCCGATCTGGAT-3′​)  
and a reverse primer (5′​-GCGAATTCTCACTCCACCCGGGTCGCTGA-3′​) appended with BglII and 
EcoRI sites (underlined) as described earlier28. The amplicon was cloned into the BglII and EcoR1 site of 
a mammalian expression vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA) in frame with the EGFP pro-
tein. The recombinant clones were confirmed by sequencing and expression of the recombinant protein 
was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-GFP (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and anti-PPE2 antibody

raised in mouse and anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was used as secondary antibody. For 
affinity purification of the recombinant PPE2 protein, the gene was amplified from BAC-Rv329 (A5) 
using a forward primer (5′​-CGAGAGCTCATGACCGCCCCGATCTGGATGG-3′​) and a reverse primer  
(5′​-GCAGAATTCTCACTCCACCCGGGTCGCTGAGT-3′​) and cloned into the SacI and EcoR1 site of a T7 
polymerase driven Escherichia coli expression vector pRSET A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in frame with an 
N-terminal histine tag to facilitate puriﬁcation using metal aﬃnity puriﬁcation resins. All the recombinant clones 
were conﬁrmed by PCR and sequencing and expression of the recombinant protein was conﬁrmed by SDS-PAGE 
analyses afer induction. Te pRSET A vector containing the PPE2 gene was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) 
pLysS cells and a primary inoculum was prepared from a single transformed colony. Te primary culture was 
inoculated into 800 ml terriﬁc broth in the presence of chloramphenicol (35 μ​g/ml) and ampicillin (100 μ​g/ml). 
Te culture was grown in a shaker incubator till the absorbance reached to about 0.5. Expression of the recombi-
nant protein was induced by adding IPTG to a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mM and incubation was continued further 
for 16 hours at 18 °C in a shaker incubator to favor soluble expression of the protein. Cells were then harvested by 
centrifugation and the pellets were suspended in lysis buﬀer (PBS containing 5% glycerol, 0.3% sodium lauroyl 
sarcosine). Te cell suspension was then sonicated and the lysate was centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 30 minutes. 
Te soluble recombinant protein present in the supernatant was allowed to bind with the TALON resin (Clontech, 
USA) for an hour, loaded into a column and washed with washing buﬀer (PBS containing 5% glycerol and 20 mM 
Imidazole). Te resin-bound protein was eluted using elution buﬀer (PBS containing 5% glycerol and 200 mM 
imidazole). Eluted samples were loaded onto an SDS-PAGE gel to conﬁrm the presence of the recombinant PPE2 
protein. Te PPE2-positive fractions were pooled together and dialyzed against PBS containing 5% glycerol to 
remove imidazole from the protein samples. Te concentration of the puriﬁed protein was estimated using Micro 
BCATM Protein Assay Kit from Termo Scientiﬁc (Rockford, IL, USA) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Generation of NLS mutants of PPE2 using site directed mutagenesis. 
Site directed mutagenesis  
was performed to generate NLS mutants of PPE2 using QuickChangeTM Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Strategene, 
CA, USA) according to manufacturer’s protocol. A forward primer (5′-GCCCGAGGAACAGGTTCAACCG

CAGCTCGGCCGCGGTTACGAATACCTGG-3′​) and a reverse primer (5′-CTGCGGTTGAACCTGT 
TCCTCGGGCCCAGGTATTCGTAACCGCG GCCGAG-3′​) were used to delete the nuclear localization signal 
(NLS) in order to obtain NLS-truncated mutant Δ​NLS-PPE2. Te amino acids in the predicted monopartite NLS 
(RRRRPKIKQ) were numbered from 1–9 respectively (R1R2R3R4P5K6I7K8Q9). Functionally important positively 
charged amino acids were mutated to neutral alanine residues. For stepwise mutagenesis following primer sets 
were used-
A. For mutations in position 4 and 6:
Mut 4, 6 Forward: 5′​-CGCAGCGGCGTCGGGCACCAGCAATCAAACAGCTCGGC-3′​
Mut 4, 6 Reverse: 5′​-GCCGAGCTGTTTGATTGCTGGTGCCCGACGCCGCTGCG-3′​
B. For mutations in position 1, 2 and 3 Mut 1, 2, 3 Forward: 5′​ GAACAGGTTCAACCGCAGGCGGCTGCGG 
CACCAGCAATCAAAC-3’ Mut 1, 2, 3 Reverse: 5′​-GTTTGATTGCTGGTGCCGCAGCCGCCTGCGGTTGAA 
CCTGTTC-3′​. Tese primers were used sequentially to generate the NLS mutant protein (Mut-NLS-PPE2) where 
all the 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 positions containing arginine (R) and lysine (K) residues were replaced by alanine (A) residues. 
All the mutant clones were conﬁrmed by automated DNA sequencing.
Generation of PPE2-speciƤc polyclonal antibody in mice. 
Polyclonal antibody was generated against 
the full length PPE2 protein in BALB/c mice. Te experimental protocols were approved by and performed as per 
the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) of Vimta Labs Ltd, Hyderabad (protocol num-
ber: PCD/CDFD/15). Mice were immunized with 100 μ​g of recombinant PPE2 protein in incomplete Freund’s adju-
vant subcutaneously. Two booster doses of the recombinant protein (100 μ​g/animal) in incomplete Freund’s adjuvant 
were injected subcutaneously at 21 day intervals. Mice were sacriﬁced at day 75 and sera were collected. Te sera 
were checked for the presence of PPE2 speciﬁc antibody by Western blotting. Whole cell extracts from clinical and 
laboratory strains of M. tuberculosis were used to determine the speciﬁcity of the generated antibodies.
Cell culture. 
Peritoneal macrophages were harvested from C57BL/6 mice (about 4–6 week old) maintained 
in the animal house facility of Vimta Labs Ltd, Hyderabad. In brief, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml 
of 4% thioglycolate and sacriﬁced afer 4 days using CO2 asphyxiation. Te adherent macrophages were cultured 
with Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Hyclone, GE Healthcare, Pittsburg, USA) containing 10% 
FBS and 1X antibiotic-antimycotic solution and 1X MEM vitamin (all from Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA). Te 
RAW 264.7 macrophages were cultured in DMEM (Hyclone) containing 10% FBS, 1X antibiotic-antimycotic 
solution and 1X MEM vitamin.
Generation of stable transfectants of RAW 264.7 macrophages. 
Te wild-type PPE2 as well as the 
NLS-mutants of PPE2 constructed earlier were cloned into pCX4neo vector at EcoRI and HpaI restriction sites 
with a 3X FLAG-tag appended to the forward primer. Tese pCX4neo clones containing PPE2 and its mutants 
were co-transfected in PLAT-E cells using Lipofectamine 2000 along with VSVG and VSVG-P vectors. Te 
medium was changed afer 5 hours and the culture was lef for 70 hours. Te supernatant containing recombinant 
viruses were collected and ﬁltered through 0.44 μ​m ﬁlter. Te RAW 264.7 macrophages pre-treated with 5 μ​g/ml 
polybrene for 1 hour were infected with these viruses and the positive clones were selected using geneticin (G418 
sulphate, Invitrogen). Te stable cells were frozen in 10% DMSO in FBS. Te protein expression was conﬁrmed 
using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as well as with anti-PPE2 polyclonal antibody.
Cloning and transformation of PPE2 and NLS-mutants of PPE2 in Mycobacterium smegmatis.  
Te PPE2 open reading frame was ampliﬁed from BAC-Rv329 (A5), and cloned and expressed in M. smegmatis 
strain mc2155 as described previously45. Te clones were conﬁrmed by restriction digestion and sequencing. Te 
expression of protein was conﬁrmed by Western blotting using polyclonal antibody generated against PPE2.
Measurement of Nitric oxide (NO) in culture supernatants. 
Te accumulated nitrite resulting from NO 
production by the stimulated macrophages in culture was measured using Griess reagent. Brieﬂy, 100 μ​l of Griess rea-
gent [1% sulfanilamide in 2.5% H3PO4 and 0.1% naphtylethylenediamine in 2.5% H3PO4] was added to 100 μ​l of culture 
supernatants as described earlier46. Te absorbance was measured at 570 nm in a spectrophotometer. Te nitrite content 
in the samples was calculated based on a standard curve prepared from known concentrations of sodium nitrite.
Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). 
Total RNA was 
isolated from the RAW 264.7 macrophages using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the 
manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was carried out using 2 μ​g of total RNA using Moloney Murine 
Leukemia Virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed using 
inos speciﬁc primer pairs provided in a gene-speciﬁc relative RT-PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, USA). 18 S rRNA 
was used as an internal control using the primers supplied with the kit. For detecting inos transcripts, RT-PCR 
was performed using inos gene speciﬁc primers (forward, 5′​-TCCAGAAGCAGAATGTGACC-3′​ and reverse, 
5′​-GGACCAGCCAAATCCAGT-3′​ to amplify 120 bp region) and a house keeping gene β​-actin (forward, 5′​
-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACCA-3′​ and reverse, 5′​-CGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAGGGGGG-3′​ to amplify 
244 bp region) was used as an internal control.
Infection of macrophages and CFU count. 
About 0.5 million macrophages were infected for 4 hours with 
M. smegmatis strains harbouring either the wild-type PPE2 or Δ​NLS-PPE2 or the backbone vector (pVV16) at 10 
multiplicities of infection. Te free suspended bacteria were removed by washing the cells with DMEM. Cells were

harvested at various time points and lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100 containing 1X PBS. Serial dilutions of cell extracts 
were plated on 7H10 plates supplemented with 10% ADC (HIMEDIA, India) and 25 μ​g/ml Kanamycin, 50 μ​g/
ml Hygromycin. Plates were incubated at 37 °C and colonies were counted afer 4–6 days as described earlier47.
In vivo infection studies. 
Bacterial loads in liver, lung and spleen were evaluated at diﬀerent time points 
afer intraperitoneal infection of 4–6 weeks old mice C57/BL6, maintained in animal house facility of Vimta 
Labs, Hyderabad, with 50 ×​ 106 M. smegmatis bacteria expressing either the wild-type PPE2 or Δ​NLS-PPE2 or 
harbouring the backbone vector (pVV16). Afer day 2 and day 7, lung, liver and spleen were aseptically removed 
from euthanized animals from each group. Organs were homogenized in sterile saline containing 0.05% Tween 80 
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and plated on 7H10 plates supplemented with 10% ADC (HIMEDIA, India) and 25 μ​g/ml 
Kanamycin, 50 μ​g/ml Hygromycin to count bacterial colonies as described earlier47. Experiments were performed 
as per the guidelines and protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee.
Confocal microscopy. 
RAW 264.7 macrophages were transfected with the wild-type (EGFP-PPE2) or 
mutant constructs (EGFP-MutNLS-PPE2, EGFP-Δ​NLS-PPE2) in 4 chamber glass slides (BD Falcon, Bedford, 
MA USA) or on coverslips. In some experiments afer 5 hours of transfection, cells were treated with 10 μ​M 
ivermectin. At 24 hours post-transfection, cells were ﬁxed in 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and washed 5 
times with PBS. Te ﬁxed cells were then mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing DAPI (Vector 
Laboratories, Inc. Burlingame CA). The nuclear transport of GFP-tagged PPE2 was visualized under LSM 
510META confocal microscope using 40X oil-immersion objective (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To detect GFP, 
the cells were excited at 488 nm and emission was recorded using 505 nm long pass ﬁlter.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). 
EMSA was carried out as described earlier48. 
For EMSA analyses, the following oligonucleotides were used as probe or competitor: NF-κ​B consensus 
[AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC], IRF-1 consensus [CACTGTCAATATTTCACTTTCATAATG], 
GATA consensus [CACTTGATAACAGAAAGTGATAACTCT], inos specific putative GATA-1 bind-
ing element [(proximal) GGGGTATAAATACCTGATGGCTGCTGCCAG], inos specific proximal NF-κ​B 
[CCAACTGGGGACTCTCCCTTTGGGAACA]. Te single stranded oligonucleotides were annealed with the 
respective complimentary oligonucleotides by incubating at 95 °C for 10 minutes in 100 mM NaCl and gradually 
cooling to room temperature. Te double stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ​32P]-ATP using 
T4 polynucleotide kinase. For competition studies, 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled oligonucleotides was 
incubated along with the labeled probes. EMSA was performed as described earlier. Brieﬂy, diﬀerent amounts of 
recombinant PPE2 or nuclear extracts prepared from RAW 264.7 macrophages stably expressing vector (pCX-
4neo) or wild-type PPE2 (pCX4neo-PPE2) following the protocol as described earlier45,48 were incubated with 
1 ng of 32P–end-labelled oligonucleotide in a binding buﬀer (20 mM HEPES, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 
5% glycerol for 30 minutes at room temperature). Te DNA-protein complex was resolved on a 7% native poly-
acrylamide gel using TGE running buﬀer (25 mM Tris, 190 mM Glycine, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.3). Te speciﬁcity of 
the binding was determined by competition with 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe. For supershif assay, 
Protein A-puriﬁed mouse anti-PPE2 antibody was added to the binding reaction to a ﬁnal concentration of 10 μ​g  
per binding reaction. Te gel was dried at 80 °C for 1 hour and exposed to imaging plate (FujiFilm) overnight. 
Visualization of the radioactive bands was carried out using STARION phosphor imager (FujiFilm FLA-9000).
Luciferase and β-Galactosidase reporter assays. 
About one million RAW 264.7 macrophages stably 
expressing control vector, wild-type PPE2 or Δ​NLS-PPE2 were transfected with 2.5 μ​g inos-luc (Kind gif from 
Prof. E.D Chan, University of Colorado, Denver) and 0.5 μ​g pCDNA-LacZ plasmids using Lipofectamine LTX 
along with plus reagent (3 μ​g) and at 8 hour post-transfection, cells were stimulated with 3 μ​g/ml LPS plus 10 ng/
ml IFN-γ​. Cells harvested at 24 hour post-stimulation were lysed with reporter lysis buﬀer (Promega, Madison, 
WI, USA) and protein concentration was estimated with Micro BCATM Protein Assay Kit following the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. About 50 μ​g protein in 20 μ​l lysis buﬀer was mixed with 100 μ​l of luciferase substrate 
reagent (Promega). Te light emitted was measured using TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Biosystems, CA, USA). 
For β​-Galactosidase reporter assay, 100 μ​g of protein was used. Te β​-Galalactosidase was quantitated using 
β​-Galactosidase reporter assay kit (Roche Applied Science) following the manufacturer’s protocol as described 
earlier45. Te results were expressed as relative luciferase units normalized to β​-Galalactosidase activity.
Pull down assay. 
One mg of RAW 264.7 macrophages lysate prepared using whole cell lysis buﬀer (Tris-HCl pH 
7.4 20 mM, NaCl 150 mM, Triton X-100 1%, Sodium pyrophosphate 2.5 mM, β​-Glycerophosphate 1 mM, EDTA 1 mM, 
EGTA 1 mM, Na3VO4 1 mM, PMSF 1 mM, protease inhibitor cocktail) was incubated overnight with 20 μ​l bed volume 
of the Talon beads bound to recombinant full-length or mutant PPE2 protein. Te beads were spinned down and 
washed 5 times with whole-cell lysis buﬀer. Te washed beads were resuspended in 100 μ​l of the lysis buﬀer and boiled 
with 6X loading dye and Western blotting was performed using anti-importin-α​ antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Te 
blot was reprobed with anti-PPE2 antibody. About 50 μ​g of the lysate from each group was used as input control.
Reverse transcription qPCR for inos mRNA quantiƤcation. 
Reverse transcription qPCR was car-
ried out as described earlier49,50. In brief, total RNA was isolated from various tissues of the infected animals 
using TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, Bangalore, India) as per manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration 
and purity was assessed using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, DE, USA). 
Quality of the isolated RNA was assessed by measuring the RIN (RNA integrity number) value using the RNA 
6000 Nano LabChip Series II Assay in a 2100 Bioanalyzer System (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). 
About 2 μ​g total RNA with RIN value of >​7.5 were used for generation of ﬁrst strand cDNA using First Strand 
cDNA synthesis kit (Termo Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA USA) using OligodT18 primers as per manufacturer’s

instructions. Te cDNA reactions were diluted to 50 μ​l in nuclease-free water (Invitrogen Life Technologies), 
aliquoted and stored at −​20 °C till further use.
Real time qPCR reactions were carried out in duplicate for each sample using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Tli 
RNaseH Plus, DSS Takara Bio India Pvt. Ltd, India) in a 20 μ​l reaction volume containing each primers at 500 nM 
ﬁnal concentration. Reactions were temperature cycled, and SYBR green levels were measured using a CFX-96 
system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Berkeley, California). Te initial target concentration for each gene was calcu-
lated by relative standard curve method using a pool of experimental sample cDNA as calibrator. Te level of 
expression for inos mRNA in each sample was normalized to corresponding GAPDH levels. All the primers were 
synthesized from Euroﬁns Genomics India Pvt. Ltd (Bangalore, India). Te sequences of the primers for mouse 
inos and gapdh were used were as follows:
inos Forward Primer: 5′​-GCCAATGAGGTACTCAGCGT-3′​;
inos Reverse Primer: 5′​-CTGCTCCTCGCTCAAGTTCA-3′​
gapdh Forward Primer: 5′​-ACAACTTTGTCAAGCTCATTTCC-3′​
gapdh Reverse Primer: 5′​-GATAGGGCCTCTCTTGCTCA-3′​
Te annealing temperatures for inos and gapdh primer pairs were 60 °C and 56 °C respectively.
Statistical analyses. 
For multiple group comparisons, one way ANOVA test was performed. Individual 
statistics of unpaired samples was performed by the t-test. Calculations were performed using GraphPad Prism, 
version 5.02. p <​ 0.05 was considered to be signiﬁcant.
