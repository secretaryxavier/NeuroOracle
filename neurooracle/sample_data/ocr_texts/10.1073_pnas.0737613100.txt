The tubercle bacillus parasitizes macrophages by inhibiting phago-
some maturation into the phagolysosome. This phenomenon un-
derlies the tuberculosis pandemic involving 2 billion people. We
report here how Mycobacterium tuberculosis causes phagosome
maturation arrest. A glycosylated M. tuberculosis phosphatidyl-
inositol [mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM)] inter-
fered with the phagosomal acquisition of the lysosomal cargo and
syntaxin 6 from the trans-Golgi network. ManLAM speciﬁcally
inhibited the pathway dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
activity and phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate-binding effectors.
These ﬁndings identify ManLAM as the M. tuberculosis product
responsible for the inhibition of phagosomal maturation.
T
he molecular mechanisms controlling phagolysosome bio-
genesis are of significance both as fundamental membrane
trafficking processes and as targets affected by microbes para-
sitizing host phagocytic cells (1). These two aspects are interre-
lated, because bacterial pathogens that affect vesicular traffick-
ing provide a means of dissecting the phagosomal maturation
pathway. One of the model systems in this context is the
mycobacterial phagosome (2). Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a
highly adapted pathogen that infects and parasitizes macro-
phages. The ability of this bacterium, also referred to as the
tubercle bacillus, to multiply and persist in the host phagocytic
cells is central to its unrivaled notoriety as a pathogen infecting
2 billion people worldwide and causing close to 3 million
deaths annually (3). No toxins with a discrete, defined function
have been identified in this pathogen thus far despite over a
century of research. Nevertheless, certain properties of M.
tuberculosis, such as the ability to survive and persist in macro-
phages, have been singled out as the marquee determinants of
its pathogenicity (2, 4).
The persistence of the tubercle bacillus in macrophages relies
on an arrest of mycobacterial phagosome maturation (2, 5–7), a
phenomenon referred to in the classical literature as the inhi-
bition of phagosome-lysosome fusion (4). The phagosome mat-
uration arrest allows M. tuberculosis to avoid degradative and
antigen-presenting organelles in the host macrophage. The
major defining features of the unique M. tuberculosis phagoso-
mal compartments (MPC) are fewer or less-active H-ATPase
molecules (6) and a conspicuous absence of the mature lysoso-
mal hydrolases such as cathepsin D (5, 8). Mycobacterial phago-
somes also show aberrant trafficking of plasma membrane
markers (5), and ‘‘taco’’ (9), a factor identical to the previously
characterized generic phagocytosis protein coronin (10) that
seems to be important for the uptake of mycobacteria (11). The
abnormal clearance of these early phagosomal markers repre-
sents a consequence rather than the cause of the maturation
arrest (11).
Organelle biogenesis and maintenance of compartmental
integrity in eukaryotic cells depends on multicomponent mem-
brane trafficking systems including vesicle tethering and fusion
machinery. The basal apparatus needed for membrane docking
and fusion is composed of a complex of cognate soluble N-
ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor
(SNARE) molecules contributed by both the donor and accep-
tor membranes (12, 13). In combination with other regulatory
factors, e.g., small GTPases from the Rab family (12) and their
effectors such as the membrane tethering molecule early endo-
some autoantigen 1 (EEA1) (14), SNAREs define the preferred
organellar fusion events in vivo (13). We reasoned that the
acquisition, retention, or exclusion of compartment-specific
SNAREs determines the permissive phagosomal interactions
with other organelles in the process of phagosome biogenesis and
maturation. Here we report a critical SNARE alteration asso-
ciated with M. tuberculosis phagosome maturation arrest that
contributes to the isolation of mycobacterial phagosomes from
the sorting organelles that deliver membrane and luminal com-
ponents necessary for conversion of a phagosome into the
phagolysosome. We also report the identification of a glycosy-
lated phosphatidylinositol product of virulent M. tuberculosis as
a cis-acting inhibitor interfering with a sorting pathway that
delivers lysosomal hydrolases and H-ATPase from the trans-
Golgi network (TGN) to the phagosome.
Materials and Methods
Cell and Bacterial Culture, Treatment with Inhibitors, and Phagosome
Purification. J774 cells were maintained in DMEM5% FBS. M.
tuberculosis var. bovis bacillus Calmette–Gue´rin harboring
phsp60-gfp or phsp60-dsRed was grown in Middlebrook 7H9
broth. J774 cells were treated with brefeldin A (BFA, 5 gml)
for 1 h at 37°C or with 100 nM wortmannin 10 min after
phagocytosis (15). Phagocytosis was synchronized for 1 h at 4°C
followed by a shift to 37°C. Phagosomes were isolated and
characterized as described (7).
Preparation of Lipoarabinomannan-Coated Latex Beads. Latex beads
were coated for 2 h at 37°C in 50 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6, with
purified mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan (ManLAM) or
phosphatidylinositol mannoside (PIM) from virulent M. tuber-
culosis as described (15, 16). The glycolipids were prepared by J.
Belisle (Colorado State University, Fort Collins).

mgml) (15) were performed at 0.58 psi (1 psi  6.89 kPa) for
0.2 sec by using an Eppendorf Injectman system followed by
recovery for 2 h.
Fluorescence Microscopy. Macrophages were fixed (3.7% parafor-
maldehyde), permeabilized (0.2% saponin), and incubated with
primary antibody followed by secondary Alexa 568- or Alexa
488-conjugated antibody. LysoTracker red DND-99 staining was
carried out as described (15). Colocalization was determined by
unbiased counting (15, 17) meeting published morphological
characteristics (15). Colocalization was quantitated by evaluat-
ing 100 phagosomes from four separate monolayers per ex-
perimental point.
7-Nitrobenzofurazan (NBD)-C6-Sphingomyelin Acquisition. NBD-C6-
sphingomeylin acquisition was monitored as described (18).
NBD-C6-ceramide (Molecular Probes) was complexed with
0.034% defatted BSA in DMEM (DMEM-Ceramide) to gener-
ate an equimolar ratio of ceramide and BSA (5 M each) (19).
Macrophages were infected with latex beads or M. bovis bacillus
Calmette–Gue´rin-dsRed. After 10 min chase, cells were incu-
bated with DMEM-Ceramide for 30 min at 4°C. Before shifting
to 37°C, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing
excess BSA (0.34%) to back-exchange probe transported to the
plasma membrane.
Western Blot Analysis. Equal amounts of MPC and latex bead
phagosomal compartments (LBC) (by protein) were separated
by SDSPAGE, transferred to poly(vinylidene difluoride) mem-
branes, and probed with primary antibodies followed by horse-
radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and visual-
ization was performed by using the ECL Western blotting
system.
Antibodies. The antibodies used were immature cathepsin D
(Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY), furin (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), lysobisphosphatidic acid (from J. Gruenberg,
University of Geneva, Geneva), lysosome-associated membrane
protein (LAMP, Development Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa
City), Rab 9 (from S. Pfeffer, Stanford University, Stanford,
CA), Rab 11 (Transduction Laboratories), syntaxin 3 (from A.
Hubbard, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore), syntaxin 6
(StressGen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada, and Transduc-
tion Laboratories), syntaxin 8 (from W. Hong, Institute of
Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore), syntaxin 13 (from R.
Scheller and R. Prekeris, Stanford University), and V0-16kDa
(16-kDa subunit of the vacuolar H-ATPase, from M. Skinner,
University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada).
Statistical Analysis. Statistical significance was calculated by using
Fisher’s protected least significant difference post hoc test
(ANOVA) (SUPERANOVA 1.11, Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA).
Results
SNARE Dynamics on Phagosomes. Isolated LBC and purified my-
cobacterial phagosomes (MPC), prepared from infected mac-
rophages as described (7, 15), were probed for plasma membrane
and endosomal SNAREs. Both LBC and MPC contained but
gradually cleared syntaxin 3, a plasma membrane SNARE (Fig.
1A). Syntaxin 13, associated with endosomal recycling (20), was
present on phagosomes and was cleared slowly from LBC and
somewhat faster from MPC (Fig. 1 A and B Inset). Syntaxin 8,
a target SNARE that overlaps with Rab 5 on early endosomes
(21) and plays a functional role in fusion at a later endosomal
stage (22), was examined also. Syntaxin 8 was acquired by both
MPC and LBC. Relative to LBC, MPC displayed a delay in the
early acquisition of syntaxin 8 (Fig. 1A). These observations
show that phagosomes undergo remodeling involving plasma
membrane and endosomal SNAREs and that some of these
processes are preserved on mycobacterial phagosomes, albeit
with exceptions (e.g., the early time points with syntaxin 8).
Exclusion of Syntaxin 6 from Mycobacterial Phagosomes. Syntaxin 6
participates in the vesicular traffic between the TGN and the
endocytic pathway (23, 24). The bulk of syntaxin 6 in macro-
phages colocalized with the TGN marker furin (Fig. 1 C–E).
Latex bead phagosomes gradually accumulated syntaxin 6 over
time (Fig. 1 A and B, LBC). In contrast, syntaxin 6 was
completely absent from mycobacterial phagosomes at all time
points (Fig. 1 A and B, MPC). MPC did not acquire syntaxin 6
even 24 h postformation (Fig. 1B). Syntaxin 6 acquisition was
also examined by immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1 F–J).
Latex bead phagosomes accumulated syntaxin 6, forming dis-
tinct ring structures (Fig. 1H). In contrast, syntaxin 6 was
excluded from MPC (Fig. 1 I and J).
The exclusion of syntaxin 6 from the mycobacterial phago-
some suggests that, in contrast to the model phagosomes (LBC),
MPC do not fully communicate with TGN, a major biosynthetic
and sorting organelle in the cell. In support of this interpretation
was the absence on MPC of Rab 9 (Fig. 1K), a small GTPase
controlling mannose 6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) recycling
from the endocytic organelles back to the TGN (25). In contrast
to Rab 9, both MPC and LBC acquired Rab 11 (Fig. 1K), a small
GTPase controlling recycling from endocytic organelles to the
plasma membrane (26). The late appearance of Rab 9 on LBC
is consistent with a slow maturation of hydrophobic latex beads
into phagolysosomes, which is normally completed only after
several hours (27). The reported exclusion of cathepsin D (28),
M6PR (29), and H-ATPase (6) from mycobacterial phago-
somes now can be explained by a block in trafficking between the
TGN and MPC, because these markers originate in the TGN.
Inhibition of Phagosomal Interactions with the Biosynthetic Pathway
Alters Phagosome Maturation. BFA induces disruption of the
Golgi and results in the inhibition of cargo traffic to the
endosomal network (30). Acquisition of syntaxin 6 by latex bead
phagosomes was reduced in BFA-treated macrophages (Fig.
1L), which indicates that syntaxin 6 acquisition by phagosomes
depends on a functional Golgi apparatus. BFA also reduced (see
Supporting Text, which is published as supporting information on
the PNAS web site, www.pnas.org) the amount of the 43-kDa
immature form of cathepsin D in phagosomes by 70% (Fig. 5,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS web
site), indicating disruption of the delivery of the lysosomal
hydrolases from the TGN to the phagosome. Interference with
the biosynthetic pathway also precluded delivery of the 16-kDa
transmembrane subunit of the V0-ATPase (V0-p16) (Fig. 6,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS
web site) and accumulation of the late endosome-specific marker
lysobisphosphatidic acid (Fig. 5). As a control, the recruitment
of the endosomal SNARE syntaxin 8 was not affected in
cells treated with BFA (Fig. 1L), showing that the BFA-
mediated effect was specific for the trafficking of the TGN
SNARE syntaxin 6 and the cargo molecule cathepsin D to the
phagosome.
In contrast to the loss of syntaxin 6, LBC from BFA-treated
cells acquired LAMP-2 and syntaxin 8 identically to LBC in
untreated cells (Fig. 1L). These observations indicate that BFA
treatment specifically interrupts the interactions between the
TGN and newly formed phagosomes, whereas LAMP-2 delivery
(from endosomes) remains unaltered. This is consistent with a
finding that BFA treatment does not affect the acquisition of the
early endosomal markers such as syntaxin 13 (31). These obser-
vations affirm the presence of two independent pathways con-
tributing to phagosomal interactions, one deriving from the
endosome and the other coming (directly or via an intermediary

compartment) from the TGN. The contribution of the BFA-
sensitive pathway to proteolytic function of phagosomal or-
ganelles was also investigated by monitoring fluorescence of
biotinylated FITC-casein bound to avidin beads after phagocy-
tosis in BFA-treated and control macrophages (Fig. 7, which is
published as supporting information on the PNAS web site). A
quantitative analysis of casein degradation and removal from
phagosomes, as monitored by reduction in FITC fluorescence
associated with phagosomes, was reduced by 50% (P  0.05) in
BFA-treated cells demonstrating the functional significance of
traffic from the biosynthetic pathway to phagosomes.
Phagosomal Acquisition of Golgi-Derived Sphingomyelin. Hackstadt
et al. (18) reported the acquisition of Golgi-derived sphingomy-
elin by Chlamydia trachomatis inclusion bodies. Following es-
tablished protocols (18), macrophages were loaded with the
membrane-permeant precursor C6-ceramide conjugated to the
fluorophore NBD, which is converted into NBD-sphingomyelin
in the Golgi apparatus (19). The delivery of NBD-C6-
sphingomyelin to latex bead phagosomes followed a linear
course (1–4 h) (Fig. 2 A, D, G, and J). The fluorescence label in
this experiment was delivered from the Golgi and not the plasma
membrane (e.g., via endosomes), because the cells were incu-
bated in the presence of defatted BSA, which extracts sphingo-
myelin from the plasma membrane (18, 32). The delivery of
NBD-C6-sphingomyelin to phagosomes was reduced signifi-
cantly (35% vs. 70%) by treating the cells with BFA (Fig. 2 B, E,
H, and K). Mycobacterial phagosomes displayed similar prop-
erties to that of latex bead phagosomes in BFA-treated cells (Fig.
2 C, F, I, and K). These observations are consistent with a
maturation block preventing the delivery of material from the
TGN to the M. tuberculosis phagosome.
M. tuberculosis ManLAM Inhibits the Accumulation of Syntaxin 6 and
Cathepsin D by Latex Bead Phagosomes. M. tuberculosis produces an
array of bioactive lipids that have been implicated, with varying
capacities, in pathogenesis of tuberculosis (33). The most prev-
alent class of compounds, in addition to mycolic acids that
dominate the mycobacterial cell wall, are the modified phos-
phoinositides closely mimicking mammalian phosphatidyl-myo-
inositols (Fig. 3 A–C; ref. 34). M. tuberculosis glycosylated
phosphoinositides, including the heavily glycosylated ManLAM
(Fig. 3A) and its mono- and dimannosylated precursor PIM (Fig.
3B), have been reported to intercalate into endomembranes of
the infected macrophage (35). It was shown recently that Man-
LAM inhibits acquisition of EEA1 (15). We tested whether
ManLAM interfered with the TGN-to-phagosome sorting path-
way uncovered here by examining the acquisition of syntaxin 6

and immature cathepsin D (Fig. 3). ManLAM, purified from
virulent M. tuberculosis H37Rv, and its biosynthetic precursor
PIM were used to coat latex beads according to established
procedures (16). Phagosomes containing ManLAM beads re-
cruited less syntaxin 6 relative to control beads (Fig. 3 D, E, H,
I, and L). Unlike ManLAM, coating latex beads with PIM did
not reduce syntaxin 6 acquisition (Fig. 3M). This difference was
not due to a less-efficient coating with PIM, because latex beads
coated with PIM exhibited biological activity manifested by
increased acquisition of syntaxin 4 (Fig. 3M). This observation
indicates that ManLAM but not its less glycosylated precursor
PIM specifically interferes with syntaxin 6 acquisition.
ManLAM-coated beads also accumulated less immature ca-
thepsin D relative to uncoated beads (Fig. 3 F, G, and J–L),
demonstrating that ManLAM directly interferes with the deliv-
ery of the lysosome-destined cargo such as M6PR-bound lyso-
somal hydrolases. Similar to the effects of ManLAM on syntaxin

6 acquisition, this glycosylated phosphatidylinositol inhibited
immature cathepsin D delivery by 40% (Fig. 3L). The effect of
ManLAM on syntaxin 6 recruitment and immature cathepsin D
accumulation cannot be attributed to alterations in phagocytosis
of beads, because ManLAM-coated beads recruited syntaxin 8
at levels indistinguishable from uncoated control beads (data not
shown). These findings are consistent with a model in which M.
tuberculosis glycosylated phosphatidylinositol ManLAM acts as
an inhibitor, causing a block in the syntaxin 6-dependent delivery
of cargo destined for phagolysosomal compartments.
ManLAM Inhibits the Sorting Pathway from TGN to Phagosomes
Dependent on Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase (PI3-Kinase) and EEA1. In
considering potential mechanisms of the interference of mycobac-
terial phosphatidylinositides with phagosomal maturation, we in-
vestigated the role of PI3-kinase. PI3-kinase is critical for the
delivery of cathepsin D to endosomal organelles (36). Cells were
allowed to phagocytize latex beads for 10 min, treated with the
PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, and tested for the delivery of
syntaxin 6 to phagosomes. Syntaxin 6 acquisition by LBC was
inhibited by wortmannin (Fig. 4 A and B). The effect of wortmannin
was limited to syntaxin 6, because levels of syntaxin 8, syntaxin 13,
and LAMP-2 were not reduced (Fig. 4 A and B). Wortmannin did
not reduce LAMP accumulation by LBC (Fig. 4A), in keeping with
phagosomes intersecting with at least two distinct pathways: (i) in
the first pathway, syntaxin 6 controls post-Golgi delivery of M6PR-
bound hydrolytic enzymes in a PI3-kinase-dependent manner (36,
37); and (ii) in the second pathway, phagosomes receive marker,
such as LAMPs, in a PI3-kinase-independent manner (37), possibly
indirectly via endosomes. Collectively, our data demonstrate that
mycobacteria interfere with the syntaxin 6-dependent trafficking
from the TGN, primarily affecting the acquisition of membrane and
cargo components, the delivery of which depends on PI3-kinase
activity.
Syntaxin 6 interacts with EEA1 (38), a tethering molecule, which
in turn is recruited to organelles via association of its FYVE domain
with the phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI3P), generated after
activation of PI3-kinase on membranes that are ear-marked for
fusion (39). We reasoned that if the EEA1-syntaxin 6 interaction is
an essential prelude to membrane tethering and fusion involving
phagosomes, then microinjection of an inhibitory EEA1 antibody
would interfere with the formation or function of the syntaxin
6-EEA1 complexes and affect acquisition of syntaxin 6 by phago-
somes. Latex bead phagosomes displayed a marked reduction in
syntaxin 6 accumulation in cells injected with anti-EEA1 relative to
phagosomes in control cells (Fig. 4C). Microinjecting cells with
control rabbit IgG did not reduce syntaxin 6 accumulation relative
to uninjected cells (Fig. 4C). Anti-EEA1 antibody also reduced
immature cathepsin D staining (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these studies
demonstrate that PI3-kinase, syntaxin 6, and EEA1 (Fig. 4D) play
a role in the delivery of lysosomal components to the phagosomes.
The M. tuberculosis product ManLAM interferes with this pathway
and blocks delivery of cargo from TGN to the mycobacterial
phagosome.
Discussion
Organellar membrane lipid domains have been shown to play a
role in M. tuberculosis phagosome biogenesis (15, 40). Recently,
a specific host cell phosphatidylinositol, PI3P, has been impli-
cated in phagosomal maturation in macrophages (15, 41, 42).
Because M. tuberculosis produces modified phosphatidylinositols
that closely resemble the mammalian lipid equivalents (Fig. 3
A–C), we tested their effects on phagosome maturation. Here we
identified the glycosylated M. tuberculosis phosphatidylinositol
ManLAM as an inhibitor made by this organism responsible for
a block in delivery of lysosomal constituents from the TGN to
mycobacterial phagosomes. These findings represent identifica-
tion of a specific M. tuberculosis product as an inhibitor of a
discrete intracellular trafficking pathway.
The arrest of M. tuberculosis phagosome maturation is one of
the best defined pathogenic determinants in tuberculosis. This
phenomenon has been modeled previously based on presumed
abnormal interactions with the endocytic pathway, characterized
by the exclusion of late endosomal and lysosomal markers such
as H-ATPase (6), M6PR (29), and cathepsin D (5, 43).
However, these essential effector components of the late endo-
somal and lysosomal organelles, as shown here, are delivered to
the phagosomes from the TGN. Our data demonstrate that the
exclusion of syntaxin 6 but not other endosomal syntaxins
reflects the presence of a block in trafficking between the TGN
and the M. tuberculosis phagosome that is not indirect, e.g., via
endosomes. This is an important distinction, because the traf-
ficking between the TGN and early endosomes is also regulated
by syntaxin 6 (24). Because syntaxin 6 is present on model

from TGN to phagosomes. (A) Western blot analysis of puriﬁed LBC. Cultures
were treated with 100 nM wortmannin (WM) 10 min after bead uptake by J774
cells and incubated with the inhibitor for 10 min before processing. LBC (5 g of
protein) were analyzed with antibodies against syntaxin (Syn) 6, syntaxin 8,
syntaxin 13, and LAMP. (B) Quantitation of relative intensities of bands from a
representative experiment shown in A (n  3 experiments). (C) Microinjection of
anti-EEA1 antibody reduces accumulation of syntaxin 6 and immature cathepsin
D on latex bead phagosomes. Shown is quantitation of syntaxin 6 (n  525
phagosomes) and immature cathepsin D (iCatD; n  794 phagosomes) colocal-
ization with latex bead phagosomes (30 min postinfection) in cells injected with
anti-EEA1, control IgG, and uninjected control cells. The data are means  SE of
three separate experiments. *, P  0.01. (D) Model of the inhibitory action of
ManLAM. ManLAM disrupts the trafﬁcking between the TGN and phagosomes.
This phospholipid, structurally an analog of mammalian phosphatidylinositols
(PI; see Fig. 3 A–C), blocks the PI3P-dependent (PI3P) steps in trafﬁcking.

MICROBIOLOGY

phagosomes and absent from mycobacterial phagosomes, these
findings define the TGN-to-phagosome trafficking pathway as
the sorting mechanism targeted by ManLAM.
The exclusion of syntaxin 6 from MPC precludes efficient
delivery of lysosomal enzymes and proton-pump subunits to
mycobacterial phagosomes. Syntaxin 6 exclusion from MPC also
provides the mechanism for the absence of M6PR from myco-
bacterial phagosomes (29) and prevention of the assembly of a
complete and functional H-ATPase complex (6). Because these
are salient characteristics of the M. tuberculosis phagosome that
render it compatible with the long-term survival of this pathogen
in the macrophage, the interference of ManLAM with the
sorting pathway between the TGN and the phagosome is a
critical event in M. tuberculosis phagosome maturation arrest.
Our studies show direct interactions of phagosomes with the
biosynthetic pathway in delivery of cargo from the TGN. This may
seem to challenge the phagosome–endosome interaction model as
the proposed pathway of macrophage maturation (44). However,
the two models are not necessarily in conflict, because our obser-
vations indicate that there are at least two distinct pathways for
delivery of lysosomal proteins and membrane components to the
phagosomes. (i) The first one delivers M6PR-bound hydrolytic
enzymes, in a manner that is sensitive to wortmannin and depends
on the PI3-kinase hVPS34 (36). (ii) The second pathway is PI3-
kinase-independent and is responsible for the delivery of the
integral membrane proteins such as LAMPs (37). This dichotomy
is illustrated further by the findings that phagosomal lysobisphos-
phatidic acid acquisition and phagosome acidification are reduced
markedly by wortmannin (15), whereas LAMP levels are not
affected. Our data are consistent with the inhibition of the PI3-
kinase-dependent pathway from the TGN as having a major role in
the M. tuberculosis phagosome maturation arrest. This does not
preclude additional phagosomal interactions with the endocytic
pathway, which may be operational or potentially affected by
mycobacteria, as evidenced by a delay in MPC acquisition of
syntaxin 8 (see Fig. 1A). At present, it is not known whether the
observed anomalous acquisition of syntaxin 8 during early time
points has any effects on MPC maturation. However, because it has
been shown that syntaxin 8 plays a functional role in late endosomal
fusion (22), its delayed acquisition may contribute to the mycobac-
terial phagosome maturation block.
In this study we found that phagosomes containing latex beads
coated with the M. tuberculosis cis-acting inhibitor ManLAM
undergo reduced syntaxin 6 acquisition. These results, and
additional studies showing the importance of PI3-kinase and
EEA1 (15), indicate that ManLAM alters phagosome matura-
tion by blocking the syntaxin 6-dependent delivery of cargo from
the TGN. This pathway depends on (i) PI3P generation and
accessibility (15), (ii) the tethering factor EEA1, which recog-
nizes and binds to PI3P on organellar membranes via its FYVE
domain (45), and (iii) EEA1–syntaxin 6 interactions (38). The M.
tuberculosis glycolipid ManLAM interferes with this cascade
(Fig. 4D). Based on this information, ManLAM biosynthesis can
be considered as a prime target for development of new anti-
tuberculosis drugs, with intracellular localization-altering prop-
erties, that will empower the innate and immune defenses of the
host to eliminate intracellular M. tuberculosis.
