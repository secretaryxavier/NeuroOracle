ABSTRACT:
The cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is produced by peripheral
immune cells as well as glia and neurons within the brain; it plays a major role
in immune to brain communication and in modulation of neural, neuroen-
docrine, and behavioral systems during illness. Although previous studies
demonstrated that excess levels of IL-1 impaired memory processes and
neural plasticity, it has been suggested that physiological levels of IL-1 are
involved in hippocampal-dependent memory and long-term potentiation
(LTP). To examine this hypothesis, we studied IL-1 receptor type I knockout
(IL-1rKO) mice in several paradigms of memory function and hippocampal
plasticity. In the spatial version of the water maze test, IL-1rKO mice dis-
played signiﬁcantly longer latency to reach a hidden platform, compared
with wild-type controls. Furthermore, IL-1rKO exhibited diminished contex-
tual fear conditioning. In contrast, IL-1rKO mice were similar to control
animals in hippocampal-independent memory tasks; i.e., their performance
in the visually guided task of the water maze and the auditory-cued fear
conditioning was normal. Electrophysiologically, anesthetized IL-1rKO mice
exhibited enhanced paired-pulse inhibition in response to perforant path
stimulation and no LTP in the dentate gyrus. In vitro, decreased paired-pulse
responses, as well as a complete absence of LTP, were observed in the CA1
region of hippocampal slices taken from IL-1rKO mice compared with WT
controls. These results suggest that IL-1 contributes to the regulation of
memory processes as well as short- and long-term plasticity within the
hippocampus. These ﬁndings have important implications to several condi-
tions in humans, which are associated with long-term defects in IL-1 signal-
ing, such as mutations in the IL-1 receptor accessory protein-like gene,
which are involved in a frequent form of X-linked mental retardation.

INTRODUCTION
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a pleiotropic cytokine produced
by many types of cells, including immune cells in the
periphery, as well as glia and neurons within the brain
(Dinarello, 1996). IL-1 signaling is mediated by a com-
plex system, which includes the cytokines IL-1 and IL-
1, as well as IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), which
functions to block the effects of IL-1. Although many
types of IL-1 receptors and receptor accessory proteins
have been identiﬁed (Loddick et al., 1998), the IL-1 re-
ceptor type I appears to mediate all the known biological
functions of IL-1.
In addition to its role in immunoregulation of inﬂam-
matory processes, IL-1 plays a major role in modulation
of neural, neuroendocrine, and behavioral systems dur-
ing illness (Rothwell and Luheshi, 2000). Thus, many
immune challenges induce the production and secretion
of brain IL-1, which directly produces changes in neuro-
transmitter and neuroendocrine systems, fever, and sick-
ness behavior symptoms (Besedovsky and del-Rey, 1996;
O’Connor and Coogan, 1999; Yirmiya et al., 2000;
Dantzer, 2001). At pathophysiological levels, IL-1 can
also produce detrimental effects on learning and memory
processes (Oitzl et al., 1993; Gibertini et al., 1995; Aub-
ert et al., 1995; Pugh et al., 2001). These effects appear to
be speciﬁc for the consolidation of memories that depend

on the hippocampus, whereas hippocampal-independent memo-
ries are not altered (Pugh et al., 2001). IL-1 also inhibits long-term
potentiation (LTP), a model system for the neural mechanism
underlying memory (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993), in several hip-
pocampal pathways (Bellinger et al., 1993; Katsuki et al., 1990;
Cunningham et al., 1996; Murray and Lynch, 1998; O’Connor
and Coogan, 1999; Vereker et al., 2000).
Although most of the evidence gathered so far indicates that the
effects of IL-1 on neural plasticity and memory processes are det-
rimental, recent evidence suggests that, at least under some circum-
stances, IL-1 may actually be required for the normal physiological
regulation of hippocampal plasticity and learning processes: IL-1
gene expression in the hippocampus was reported to be substan-
tially increased during LTP, both in vitro and in vivo, and blocking
IL-1 receptors with IL-1ra impaired the maintenance of LTP
(Schneider et al., 1998, Coogan et al., 1999b); IL-1ra also im-
paired memory in the water maze and passive avoidance para-
digms, whereas IL-1 administration facilitated memory in the
passive avoidance test (Yirmiya et al., 2002). The particularly high
expression of IL-1, IL-1ra, and the proteins belonging to the IL-1
receptor family in the hippocampus (Loddick et al., 1998) may
underlie the effects of IL-1 within this structure.
To examine further the hypothesis that IL-1 signaling pathways
are involved in the physiological mechanisms underlying learning,
memory, and neural plasticity, we used IL-1 receptor type I knock-
out (IL-1rKO) mice (Labow et al., 1997).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Subjects were male IL-1rKO mice and their 129/Sv  C57BL/6
wild-type (WT) controls (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME).
Subjects were 2–4-month-old. Animals were housed in an air-condi-
tioned room (23  1°C), with food and water ad libitum, for several
weeks before the beginning of the experiments. The behavioral exper-
iments were conducted during the ﬁrst half of the dark phase of a
reversed 12-h light/dark cycle. The experiments were approved by the
Hebrew University Committee on Animal Care and Use.
Measurement of Learning and Memory in the
Water Maze
The water maze consisted of a round tank, 1.6 m in diameter,
ﬁlled with water mixed with nontoxic gouache paint to make it
opaque. In the spatial memory experiment, mice were trained to
ﬁnd the location of a hidden platform (16 cm in diameter), sub-
merged 1 cm below the water surface, using extra maze visual cues.
Training consisted of three trials per day, with a 1-h break between
trials, for 3 days. On the fourth day of the experiment, the platform
was removed and a probe trial was conducted: mice were placed in
the maze for 60 s, in which the number of crosses over the former
position of the platform as well as over an equal area at the center of
the maze was recorded. In the nonspatial memory experiment, the
platform was elevated 1 cm above the water level and therefore was
visible. Mice were tested over four trials, separated by a 1-h inter-
val. The experiments were conducted using a random protocol in
which the entrance point to the maze was varied randomly between
trials, and the platform remained in a permanent position. The
illumination, sound, and distal visual cues on the walls and ceiling
were controlled and kept constant throughout the experiment. A
video camera above the pool was connected to a computerized
tracking system that monitored the latency to reach the platform,
the path length, and the swimming speed in each trial (VP118
tracking system, HVS Image, Hampton, UK). Mice were dried
under a red light heating lamp, after each trial. The results of the
learning phase were analyzed by a two-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) with the strain as a between-subjects factor and the
trials as a within-subjects, repeated-measure factor. The probe test
results were analyzed by Student’s t-test.
Measurement of Learning and Memory in the
Fear-Conditioning Paradigm
The fear conditioning apparatus consisted of a gray colored
square conditioning cage (30  30  30 cm) with one transparent
wall, to permit observation. The grid ﬂoor of the cage was wired to
a shock generator and a scrambler (Coulbourn Instruments, PA).
The mice were placed in the cage for 120 s. A pure tone (2.9 kHz)
was then sounded for 20 s, followed by a 2-s, 0.5-mA foot-shock.
This procedure was then repeated; 30 s after the delivery of the
second shock, the mice were returned to their home cage; 48 h
later, fear conditioning was assessed by a continuous measurement
of freezing (complete immobility), the dominant behavioral fear
response (Fanselow, 2000). The mice tested for contextual fear
conditioning were placed in the original conditioning cage, and
freezing was measured for 5 min. The mice tested for the auditory-
cued fear conditioning were placed in a different context consisting
of a triangular-shaped cage with no grid ﬂoor. As a control for the
inﬂuence of the novel environment, freezing was measured for 2.5
min in this new cage; a 2.9-kHz tone was then sounded for 2.5
min, during which conditioned freezing was measured. Freezing
was also measured during the ﬁrst 120 s of the conditioning trial,
before the tone and shock administration, in order to assess possi-
ble strain differences in baseline freezing. The results of the con-
textual- and cued-conditioning tests were analyzed by Student’s
t-test and two-way ANOVA, respectively.
Measurements of Hippocampal Activity and
Plasticity In Vivo
IL-1rKO and WT mice were anesthetized with urethane (21%
solution: 1.2 g/kg, i.p.) and placed in a stereotactic apparatus. A bipo-
lar 125-m concentric stimulating electrode was placed in the per-
forant path (PP) (Coordinates: 0.5 mm anterior to lambda, 2.5 mm
lateral to the midline; depth, 1.95–2.05 mm). A glass pipette (diam-
eterof2-3m),containinga2MNaClsolution,wasinsertedintothe
dentate gyrus (DG) of the dorsal hippocampus, using an hydraulic
micro-drive(coordinates:2.0mmposteriortobregma,1.0mmlateral
to the midline; depth, 1.8–2.2 mm). Electrode position was opti-

mized to record maximal population spike (PS) in response to 100-s
pulse stimulation of the PP. Evoked responses were ampliﬁed, ﬁltered
at 1 Hz-1 kHz, and stored for later analysis.
After electrode insertion, recording was allowed to stabilize for
25 min. Baseline ﬁeld potential responses in the DG to PP stimu-
lation were recorded using stimulus intensity that was 50% of the
intensity that evoked maximal asymptotic spike amplitude. This
stimulus intensity was found to be similar in the IL-1rKO and WT
control groups. Input-output relations were later examined, using
three stimulus intensities (1, 2, or 3 V).
To assess short-term plasticity, paired-pulse responses were
obtained thereafter. A twin pulse stimulus was delivered at three
interstimulus intervals (ISIs) (15, 30, and 60 ms), and averages
of ﬁve successive responses to a given stimulus intensity were
quantiﬁed as the ratio of the second over the ﬁrst response.
Because IL-1rKO mice displayed a larger PS to the same stim-
ulus intensity at baseline, we conducted a second experiment in
which stimulus intensities given to IL-1rKO mice were adjusted
to elicit baseline PS size comparable to that of controls. To
assess long-term plasticity, LTP was induced by applying high-
frequency stimulation (HFS) (ﬁve trains of eight 0.4-ms,
400-Hz pulses spaced 10 s apart. Stimulus intensity was 1.5 V).
10 measurements, 10 s apart were taken and averaged every 5
min, and LTP was computed as the change in the evoked re-
sponses measured during 60 min post-HFS, in comparison to
pre-HFS responses. Data was collected and analyzed using
Power Lab and Data Analysis software. The results were ana-
lyzed by a two-way ANOVAs, with the strain as a between
subjects factor and the stimulus intensity or ISI or time after
HFS as a within-subjects, repeated measure factor.
Measurements of Hippocampal Activity and
Plasticity In Vitro
Hippocampal slices (350 m) were prepared from IL-1rKO
and WT mice. Experiments were performed in a submerged
slice chamber, heated to 30–32°C and superfused at a rate of 2
ml/min with standard artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (ACSF) con-
taining (in mM): 124 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.24 KH2PO4, 2 MgSO4,
2.5 CaCl2, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 glucose. pH 7.4. The ACSF
was saturated with a 95%O2/5%CO2 gas mixture (ﬂow rate,
0.4 L/min). A bipolar stimulating electrode (25-m nichrome
wires) was placed in the stratum radiatum of CA1 or in the
molecular layer of the DG. Test stimulation of 100-s pulse
duration was delivered every 30 s, with intensity adjusted such
that evoked responses were approximately 40% of maximal
response. The extracellular recording electrode containing 0.75
M NaCl (2–4 M) was placed in the stratum radiatum of the
CA1 region for excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) re-
cording. LTP was induced by theta burst stimulation (TBS) of
the Schaffer collaterals (10 trains of 4 pulses at 100 Hz separated
by 200-ms ITIs at the same intensity as the test stimulation).
The results were analyzed by two-way ANOVA, with the strain
as a between subjects factor and the stimulus intensity or ISI or
time after TBS as a within-subject, repeated measure factor.
RESULTS
Learning and Memory in the Water Maze
IL-1rKO mice displayed a slower rate of learning in the spatial
memory paradigm, i.e., starting from the third trial and through-
out the rest of the experiment the latencies to reach the platform
were signiﬁcantly longer in IL-1rKO than in their WT controls
(F(8,112)  3.465, P  0.001) (Fig. 1a). Compared with controls,
IL-1rKO mice displayed signiﬁcantly slower speed of swimming
(average speed  22.37 and 16.86 cm/s, respectively; F(1,13) 
15.371, P  0.002), suggesting that they have motor impairments.
However, these impairments cannot account for the slower rate of
learning, because the learning deﬁcit was also observed with respect
to the path length to reach the platform, which provides a mea-
surement of learning that is not dependent on speed (F(8,104) 
2.364, P  0.02) (Fig. 1b). In addition, in a 60-s probe test,
IL-1rKO mice demonstrated a signiﬁcantly smaller number of
crosses over the former position of the platform compared with
their WT controls (t(14)  2.414, P  0.02) (Fig. 1c). However,
no difference between the two strains was found for crosses over the
center of the maze (P  0.45). In contrast with these ﬁndings, in
the nonspatial memory paradigm (visible platform) IL-1rKO mice
showed no difference from WT controls (P 	 0.5) in either the
latency to reach the platform (Fig. 1d) or the path length (data not
shown).
Learning and Memory in the Fear Conditioning
Paradigm
IL-1rKO mice exhibited impaired contextual fear conditioning,
i.e. they displayed a signiﬁcantly shorter freezing time than their
WT controls (F(1,38)  4.73, P  0.05) in the original condi-
tioning context, 48 h after they received a shock there (Fig. 2a).
This difference cannot be attributed to an inherent diminished
tendency to freeze, because IL-1rKO mice displayed normal audi-
tory cued fear conditioning (Fig. 2b), i.e., the tone presentation
had a signiﬁcant effect on both groups (F (1,23)  123.5, P 
0.0001), but there were no strain differences in either the condi-
tioned freezing to the tone that was previously paired with foot
shock (P 	 0.5), or the baseline freezing time in the different
context (P 	 0.5).
Hippocampal Neural Responses and Plasticity In
Vivo
Baseline neural activity
At each stimulus intensity, the EPSP slope was similar in both
groups (Fig. 3a), whereas the PS size was enhanced signiﬁcantly in
the IL-1rKO mice compared with WT controls (F(5,57) 
86.183, P  0.0001; Fig. 3b).
Paired-pulse responses

interactions in the DG at the local circuit level, we examined the

responses to a paired-pulse stimulation applied to the PP. In con-
trol mice, the EPSP response to the second of the two stimuli was
reduced to 92% at a 15-ms ISI. This suppression was reversed to
facilitation at 30 and 60 ms ISIs. In contrast, in the IL-1rKO mice,
the response to a second stimulus was signiﬁcantly suppressed at
both 15 and 30 ms ISIs. This suppression was reversed to a minor
facilitation only at the longest (60 ms) ISI (Fig. 3c). These ﬁndings
were reﬂected by a signiﬁcant difference between the two groups
over all ISIs (F(5,12)  18.54, P  0.0001).
In another experiment, we precluded a possible effect of the
stimulus intensity on the observed responses, by repeating the mea-
surements at two different intensities (1 or 2 V). Moreover, to
control for the signiﬁcant difference in the basal PS size between
the control and the IL-1rKO mice, we adjusted the basal PS size in
the IL-1rKO mice to that of the WT mice by applying lower
stimulus intensities (0.8 or 1.2 V). The same pattern of results was
maintained in all cases (F(11,30)  18.21, P  0.0001) (Fig. 3d).
Long-term potentiation
In control mice, HFS produced LTP of both EPSP slope
(Fig. 3e) and PS amplitude (data not shown), which lasted for
more than 60 min (EPSP  55.88  4.83%; PS  80.42 
7.96%). In contrast, no LTP was produced in the IL-1rKO
mice. To ensure that the absence of LTP in these mice was not
due to the difference in the basal PS size, we tested another
IL-1rKO group in which basal PS size was adjusted to that of
the control mice (IL-1rKO-Adj). Still, no potentiation was ex-
pressed in these mice (Fig. 3e).

Hippocampal Responses and Plasticity In Vitro
The basal properties of EPSPs in stratum radiatum of the CA1
region were examined in hippocampal slices taken from IL-1rKO
and control mice. The dynamic range of the EPSPs was larger in
slices taken from IL-1rKO mice than that of the control mice;
consequently, the maximal EPSP was larger than that of the con-
trol mice (Fig. 4a). We then examined paired pulse paradigms at
different intervals in CA1 region. Figure 4b shows representative
traces of paired pulse responses measured in CA1. Unlike the ﬁnd-
ing in the DG in vivo, there was no apparent paired-pulse depres-
sion in either the control or the IL-1rKO mice in vitro. However,
paired pulse facilitation in CA1 of IL-1rKO mice was signiﬁcantly
reduced compared with controls (F(1,38)  5.42, P  0.05) (Fig.
4c). We then examined the LTP of EPSPs in the CA1 region of the
hippocampal slices in response to TBS of the Schaffer collaterals.
Potentiation could not be produced in slices taken from IL-1rKO
mice under these testing conditions (Fig. 4d).
DISCUSSION
The present study demonstrates that IL-1rKO mice display se-
vere deﬁcits in spatial and contextual memory, but not in nonspa-
tial and auditory-cued memory. IL-1rKO mice also exhibited
marked deﬁcits in ability to express both short-term and long-term
hippocampal plasticity in the DG in vivo and in CA1 area in vitro.
These mice are shown to have no IL-1 receptor type I expression;
they are reported to display no obvious developmental or immu-
nological defects, but to have a defective response to IL-1 and
IL-1 (Labow et al., 1997). Along with the impaired short-term
plasticity, the behavioral ﬁndings support our hypothesis that sig-
naling via the IL-1 receptor is critically involved in normal memory
functioning and in synaptic plasticity.
In IL-1rKO mice, the baseline PS size was signiﬁcantly larger
than in WT controls. In addition, IL-1rKO mice exhibited greater
paired-pulse inhibition in the DG and diminished paired-pulse
facilitation in the CA1. These ﬁndings suggest that the lack of IL-1
signaling leads to increased baseline excitability, concomitantly
with a marked expression of local circuit inhibition. IL-1rKO mice
also showed a complete absence of LTP. Adjustment of baseline PS
size in the IL-1rKO mice to the level seen in the control mice did
not restore the ability to initiate LTP, indicating that their lack of
plasticity is not due to a technical, ceiling effect. The effects of the
IL-1rKO on basic synaptic properties, both in vivo and in vitro
indicate that IL-1 has constitutive effects on synaptic interactions
in the hippocampus, and that the lack of LTP may be only second-
ary to this on-going effect. The locus of effect of IL-1 on the
hippocampal synapse is still unclear, and it may involve an effect on
inhibitory network activity. A comparison between the results of
the in vivo and the in vitro experiments yields some interesting
observations. While the basic phenomenon, that of a total lack of
short and long-term potentiation is replicated in the in vitro exper-
iments, indicating that these ﬁndings are not speciﬁc to the DG
but can also be seen in CA1 region, other important effects of
IL-1rKO were not similar. It should be noted that in the slice
experiments we measured only population EPSPs; thus, we are
unable to determine whether the large difference in population
spike size between the control and the IL-1rKO mice is maintained
in vitro. The DG in vivo expressed a large paired pulse depression
in the IL-1rKO mice, an observation that was not shared by the in
vitro CA1 recording. This may be due to the presence of longitu-
dinal inhibitory pathways in vivo, which are activated by the paired
stimulation, and are not found in the slice, which does not main-
tain these inhibitory connections.
LTP is divided into an induction phase, which in the DG and in
CA1 area depends on activation of NMDA receptors, and a late,
maintenance phase, which depends on protein synthesis (Bliss and
Collingridge, 1993). Application of IL-1ra was shown to have no
effect on LTP induction but could suppress LTP maintenance,
only when applied during this phase (Schneider et al., 1998; Coo-
gan et al., 1999b). Because of the complete blockade of short term

potentiation, it is impossible to evaluate the selective inﬂuence of
IL-1 deﬁciency on LTP maintenance in IL-1rKO mice.
The present ﬁndings that disruption of IL-1 signaling impairs
memory is consistent with our recent report that blockade of IL-1
signaling, using IL-1ra impaired memory in the water maze and
passive avoidance paradigms (Yirmiya et al., 2002). However, sev-
eral previous studies reported that exogenously applied IL-1 im-
pairs LTP (Murray and Lynch, 1998; O’Connor and Coogan,
1999; Vereker et al., 2000). Moreover, most of the studies on the
effects of IL-1 on learning and memory reported detrimental
effects (Oitzl et al., 1993; Gibertini et al., 1995; Aubert et al.,
1995; Pugh et al., 2001). The combination of our results and these
other ﬁndings suggests an inverted U shape for the inﬂuence of
IL-1 on memory and synaptic plasticity. Thus, basal physiological
levels of IL-1 may be essential for memory and plasticity, whereas
higher levels of IL-1 can be detrimental. An inverted U-shape curve
has been demonstrated both for the effects of IL-1 on other pro-
cesses (Ling et al., 1998) and for the inﬂuence of other substances
on memory and plasticity. For example, low doses of corticoste-
rone are essential, whereas high doses are detrimental for spatial
memory and hippocampal plasticity (Diamond et al., 1992; Con-
rad et al., 1999).
The results of the present study indicate that IL-1 plays a role in the
normal functioning of the hippocampus. The possibility that systemic
knockout of IL-1 receptors may have some indirect inﬂuences on the
hippocampus cannot be ruled out. However, we have preliminary
results showing that mice with transgenic overexpression of IL-1ra
(IL-1raTG) within the brain (under glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein
[GFAP]promoter)alsodisplaymemorydeﬁcits(Goshenetal.,2002),
suggesting the involvement of central, rather than peripheral IL-1 in
memory processes. The behavioral results show dissociation between
the disrupted spatial and contextual memory, which depends on nor-
mal hippocampal functioning, and the intact nonspatial and auditory
cued memory, which do not require the hippocampus (Morris et al.,

1982; Maren, 2001). The electrophysiological ﬁndings corroborate
these behavioral results by showing impairments in short-term and
long-termplasticityinthehippocampus.Theseﬁndingsareconsistent
withpreviousreportsdemonstratingthat(1)IL-1mRNAlevelswere
increasedinthehippocampusduringLTP(Schneideretal.,1998);(2)
hippocampal LTP maintenance is disrupted after blockade of IL-1
receptors with IL-1ra (Schneider et al., 1998; Coogan et al., 1999b);
(3) hippocampal-dependent memory in the water maze and passive-
avoidance paradigms are impaired by IL-1ra, while hippocampal in-
dependent learning is intact (Yirmiya et al., 2002); (4) in humans, the
levels of IL-1ra are signiﬁcantly correlated with endotoxin-induced
impairment in declarative memory (Reichenberg et al., 2001), which
also depends on normal hippocampal functioning (Tulving and
Markowitsch,1998);(5)thepreviouslyreporteddetrimentaleffectsof
IL-1 on memory were particularly evident in hippocampal-dependent
tasks (Oitzl et al., 1993; Gibertini et al., 1995; Pugh et al., 2001).
Together,theseﬁndingssuggestthatIL-1exertsitsinﬂuenceonmem-
ory functioning and neuronal plasticity within the hippocampus.
The effects of IL-1 on spatial memory and hippocampal plastic-
ity may be mediated by various neural mechanisms, as IL-1 is
known to inﬂuence the secretion of several neurotrophins, hor-
mones, and cellular agents (Gadient et al., 1990; Huwiler and
Pfeilschifter, 1994; Lee et al., 1995; Kamiguchi et al., 1995; Bese-
dovsky and del-Rey, 1996; Ishida et al., 1997), which are involved
in hippocampal memory (Kumon et al., 1996; Holscher et al.,
1996; Conrad et al., 1999; Selcher et al., 1999) and plasticity
(Diamond et al., 1992; Kelly et al., 1998; Coogan et al., 1999a,b;
Lu et al., 1999; Xie et al., 2000). The deﬁcits in memory and
synaptic plasticity that accompany the impairment in IL-1 signal-
ing may also result from effects of IL-1 during brain development.
For example, it is possible that the lack of IL-1 during critical
developmental periods leads to impairment in the formation of
normal local circuit in the hippocampus, which results in abnor-
mally enhanced feedback inhibition in these mice. IL-1 is already
detectable in the embryo (De los Santos et al., 1996) and the
placenta (Hu et al., 1992), and it has a direct inﬂuence on neuronal
differentiation. IL-1 increases the number of progenitor cells con-
verting into neurons and the number of extending neurons (Potter
et al., 1999); it also increases the survival and induces the pheno-
type of dopaminergic neurons in mesencephalic progenitor cell
cultures (Akaneya et al., 1995; Ling et al., 1998). Furthermore,
IL-1 enhances the expression and secretion of trophic factors that
inﬂuence brain development, including NGF (Gadient et al.,
1990), CNTF (Kamiguchi et al., 1995), and neurotrophin-3
(Ishida et al., 1997).
The importance of IL-1 signaling in spatial memory and in
short-term and long-term hippocampal plasticity is consistent with
the results of several recent studies in humans, demonstrating that
mutations in the IL-1 receptor accessory protein-like gene are in-
volved in X-linked mental retardation (Carrie et al., 1999; Jin et
al., 2000). In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), speciﬁc IL-1 gene family
polymorphisms have been shown to be associated with increased
prevalence and early onset of sporadic disease (Nicoll et al., 2000).
Furthermore, in the brain of AD patients the production of both
IL-1 and IL-1ra is elevated, and has been shown to interact with
most of the genetic and environmental risk factors for AD (e.g.,
progression of -amyloid plaques, apolipoprotein E, normal aging,
and head trauma) (Yasuhara et al., 1997; Mrak and Grifﬁn, 2000).
Finally, we recently demonstrated that a transient increase in
plasma IL-1ra (but not IL-1) levels is associated with endotoxin-
induced memory deﬁcits in healthy volunteers (Reichenberg et al.,
2001). Thus, in humans, changes in IL-1 signaling, caused by
genetic, pathological, or environmental factors, may lead to cogni-
tive impairments.
In conclusion, the results of the present study support to the
notion that normal physiological levels of IL-1 have a role in some
aspects of memory formation, presumably by its inﬂuence on hip-
pocampal activity and plasticity. These results suggest that IL-1 is
not only a mediator of illness-associated immune responses and
neuroimmune interactions, but it may also have a critical role in
normal cognitive function.
