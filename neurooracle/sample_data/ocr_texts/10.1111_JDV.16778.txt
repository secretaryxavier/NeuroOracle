Abstract
The cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 patients have been increasingly reported, but not summarized, and the
potential mechanisms remain to be investigated. Herein, we performed a comprehensive review of literatures (from
inception to 30 May 2020) using PubMed, CNKI, medRxiv and bioRxiv with the terms “((novel coronavirus) OR (2019
novel coronavirus) OR (2019-nCoV) OR (Coronavirus disease 2019) OR (COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2)) AND ((Dermatol-
ogy) OR (skin) OR (rash) OR (cutaneous))” and “((ACE2) OR (Angiotensin-converting enzyme)) AND ((skin) OR (epidermis)
OR (dermis)).” Totally, 44 articles met the inclusion criteria. A total of 507 patients with cutaneous manifestations were
summarized, and 96.25% patients were from Europe. The average age of the patients was 49.03 (range: 5–91) with a
female ratio of 60.44%. The skin lesions were polymorphic, and erythema, chilblain-like and urticarial lesions were most
common, occurring on an average of 9.92 days (range: 1–30) after the onset of systemic symptoms. The receptor of
SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, was found to be expressed on skin, mainly on keratinocytes. Our review systematically presented
the clinical characteristics of 507 patients and showed that skin might be the potential target of the infection according
to ACE2 expression. More work should be done to better understand the underlying pathogenesis.

Introduction
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was ﬁrstly reported in
Wuhan, China, as an etiological agent causing a new infectious
respiratory disease (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19).1
SARS-CoV-2 spread rapidly worldwide through human-to-hu-
man transmission and COVID-19 has been declared as a pan-
demic emergency by World Health Organization (WHO) on
March, 2020. By 30 May 2020, 5 701 337 patients were con-
ﬁrmed as COVID-19 cases and 357 688 patients were dead.
The main clinical manifestations of COVID-19 were fever,
cough, fatigue, sputum production, dyspnoea and muscle
aches.2,3 The diarrhoea, olfactory and gustatory impairments
caused by COVID-19 were also reported but less common.4,5 An
increasing number of literatures on cutaneous manifestations of
COVID-19 patients have been recently reported, suggesting that
skin lesions could be a potential clinical characteristic of
COVID-19. Various viewpoints about the mechanisms inducing
the skin rash in COVID-19 patients have been proposed6,7: (i)
Whether the virus could infect through an open wound of skin;
(ii) Whether skin manifestations were related to immune
responses; (iii) Whether skin manifestations were caused by a
new prescribed medication. However, the researches on the
pathogenesis of cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 have
not been performed yet. Given that angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a crucial functional receptor of SARS-CoV-
2,8–12 exploration of the ACE2 expression in skin tissues could
facilitate to clarify the mechanisms involved in cutaneous mani-
festations of COVID-19. Herein, to gain an in-depth under-
standing of the COVID-19, we summarized the publications
related to the cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 cases and
the ACE2 expression in skin tissues.

Methods/literature search
A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
(PRISMA) guidelines. We searched in the Medline database
(PubMed), CNKI (https://www.cnki.net/), medRxiv (https://
www.medrxiv.org/) and bioRxiv (https://www.biorxiv.org/) with
the combined terms “((novel coronavirus) OR (2019 novel coro-
navirus) OR (2019-nCoV) OR (Coronavirus disease 2019) OR
(COVID-19) OR (SARS-CoV-2)) AND ((Dermatology) OR
(skin) OR (rash) OR (cutaneous))” and “((ACE2) OR (Angio-
tensin-converting enzyme)) AND ((skin) OR (epidermis) OR
(dermis)).” Searches were limited to the publications before 30
May 2020. Case reports, clinical analysis and fundamental
research discussing the cutaneous manifestations and expression
of ACE2 in skin were included. Unavailable articles, review arti-
cles, expert consensus, medical hypothesis articles and the arti-
cles focusing on the below aspects were excluded: the skin
problems of medical staff caused by using protective equipment,
the effects of the epidemic on the use of immunosuppressive
agents and other drugs in dermatology, the effects of dermato-
logical instruments, and the effects resulted from the treatment
of COVID-19 transmission. The cases with clinical diagnosis of
the disease (suspected cases) were included in addition to the
cases conﬁrmed of COVID-19 by viral nucleic acid detection,
viral gene sequencing and serum antibody tests (Fig. S1).
Results
Study selection and study population
Data from 164 papers were collected. After screening, 120 of
them were excluded. We recruited 44 articles, including 38 case
reports (Table S1) and six publications of ACE2 expression in
skin tissues (Table S2).
Cutaneous manifestations of COVID-19 patients
Lu et al.13 reported a COVID-19 case with urticaria as the ﬁrst
cutaneous manifestation on March 19, 2020. Subsequently,
Recalcati et al.14 from Italy, Zhang et al.15 from China and Boua-
ziz et al.16 from France summarized 18, 7 and 14 cases, respec-
tively. In Spain, Fernandez-Nieto et al.17 and Galvan et al.18
conducted a nationwide case collection survey and reported 19
and 375 COVID-19 cases with cutaneous manifestations, respec-
tively. However, 17 and 141 of the cases were clinically con-
ﬁrmed rather than diagnosed without etiological evidence,
respectively.
In
addition,
73
sporadic
cases
have
been
reported.7,19–49 By 30 May 2020, a total of 507 cases of COVID-
19 accompanied by skin manifestations were reported. And 488
out of 507 (96.25%) patients were from Europe.
Basic information
Among the 450 patients reported the basic information, the ratio
of male to female was 178/272. The mean age of patients was
49.03 (range: 5–91). According to a previous study of COVID-
19 in China, male patients accounted for about 53%, and the
average age was 49.54.50 Thus, we assumed that the incidence of
skin lesions in COVID-19 patients was regardless of ages and
genders.
The onset of skin manifestations
Eighty-eight of the 507 patients provided the information on the
onset of skin manifestations. Among them, lesions occurred on
average 9.92 days (range: 1–30) after the onset of systemic symp-
toms including fever, cough, dyspnoea, diarrhoea and fatigue. In
addition, the longest incubation of lesions was 30 days,17 and it
was noteworthy that 13 patients (14.77%) had skin lesions as the
ﬁrst symptom.17,25,26,29,31,45,47,49
Clinical manifestations
All 507 patients had descriptions on their clinical manifestations.
We found that the skin symptoms of COVID-19 patients were
polymorphic. The most common skin lesion was erythema,
which was observed in 224 patients (44.18%) and distributed on
patients’ trunk, extremities, ﬂexural regions, face and mucous
membranes. Moreover, the erythema lesions were also conﬁned
to speciﬁc sites, such as the heels14 without other triggers such as
exposure. Chilblain-like lesions were described in 100 (19.72%)
patients. Urticaria-like lesions were presented in 83 patients
(16.37%) and distributed on patients’ trunks or dispersed widely
on their bodies.18 In addition, other manifestations such as
vesicular (66, 13.02%), livedo/necrosis (31, 6.11%) and pete-
chiae (8, 1.58%) were described. Signiﬁcantly, 227 patients
(44.77%) complained of signiﬁcant pruritus.
Among the 507 patients, 431 had the information of system-
atic symptoms. Fever was the most common and presented in
327 patients (75.87%). Other symptoms including cough (299,
69.37%), fatigue or asthenia (252, 58.47%), dyspnoea (201,
46.64%), headache (131, 30.39%), gastrointestinal symptoms
(116, 26.91%) and anosmia or ageusia (96, 22.27%) were also
described.
Skin manifestations and COVID-19 severity
The severity of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients presenting
cutaneous manifestations varied. Zhang et al.15 reported seven
COVID-19 patients with critical symptoms. All the patients had
extremity ischaemia with varied severity, which was manifested
as cyanosis, purpura, hemophysallis, and dry gangrene. In addi-
tion, the skin of two patients become darker than usual after
treatment, which might be related to severe symptoms, multiple
organ damage and drug treatment.51 We speculate that the skin
changes in these patients might be caused by multiple organ
damages or systemic ischaemia, suggesting a severe condition.
For the remaining cases, Only ﬁve patients had clear informa-
tion about the severity of COVID-19, including one mild, two
ordinary and two severe cases, according to the diagnostic

criteria.52 Furthermore, Recalcati et al.14 argued that the skin
manifestations of COVID-19 patients were similar to other skin
diseases caused by viral infection, and not related to the severity
of pneumonia. According to a study by Galvan et al.,18 pseudo-
chilblain, vesicular lesions, urticarial lesions, maculopapular
lesions and livedoid/necrotic lesions were associated with pro-
gressively increasing disease severity.
Laboratory examinations
Due to the harsh conditions and equipment constraints during
the
COVID-19
epidemic,
only
23
patients
performed
histopathological examination. All the 23 patients showed
inﬂammatory features without speciﬁc pathological changes,
such
as
lymphocyte
inﬁltration.20,24,40,41
Amatore
et
al.25
described that no virally induced cytopathic alterations or
intranuclear inclusions were present. Sanchez et al.,34 Fernan-
dez-Nieto et al.39 and Ahouach et al.35 performed RT-PCR on
skin biopsy specimen, and results were negative for SARS-CoV-
2. None of the remaining patients underwent virus detection for
skin lesions.
The peripheral blood examination was performed on 39
patients. The most common outcomes were lymphocytopenia
(30 patients, 76.92%), C-reaction protein elevation (13 patients,
33.33%), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) elevation (18
patients, 46.15%). In the seven critical patients reported by
Zhang et al.,15 D-dimer was signiﬁcantly increased, and platelet
count was normal. Fibrinogen and ﬁbrin degradation product
(FDP) were increased in six patients, and prothrombin time
(PT) was prolonged in four patients. Two patients showed
thrombocytopenia, corresponding to a skin lesion that includes
petechiae.21
Complications
Ten patients had the complication of hypertension, and six
patients had diabetes. In a study by Galvan et al.,18 the number
of smokers reached 44, accounting for 11.73% of a total of 375
cases.
Prognosis
For the prognosis of all 507 patients, only two cured and 13 dead
cases were clearly described. In the seven critical patients, ﬁve
patients died and the two others were still under treatment after
26 days of follow-up, and the causes of death were circulatory
failure resulted from severe hypoxaemia and respiratory acido-
sis.15 In addition, a 71-year-old male patient died due to his
advanced age and multiple underlying diseases.26 In a study by
Galvan et al.,18 there were 369 survival and six dead cases.
According to the description of the symptoms, we speculated
that most of the patients had a relatively good prognosis and the
reported death rate was 2.56% (13/507).
For skin lesions, 39 patients resolved spontaneously or with
some basic medication within a week, and other cases did not
provide details data. It remains to be discussed whether seven
patients develop skin lesions after taking a drug that targets
COVID-19. Although some drugs, such as paracetamol, hydrox-
ychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir, were commonly used with
rare adverse reactions, it is still debatable whether the skin
lesions were caused by viral infections or adverse drug reac-
tions.20,33,48,53
All the information of the 507 COVID-19 patients was sum-
marized in Table 1.
SARS-CoV-2 entry factors expressed in skin
To our acknowledgement, no studies regarding the mechanisms
of devolvement of cutaneous rash in COVID-19 patients have
been carried out. Thus, we only summarized the studies linked
to the expression of ACE2 in skin tissues. Sungnak et al.11
reported that expression of ACE2 in skin tissues was not detect-
able in scRNA-seq data sets. However, the ARCHS4 database
(https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/archs4/gene/ACE2) showed that
ACE2 was expressed mainly in keratinocytes and basal cells in
skin tissues. Furthermore, the expression of ACE2 has been
investigated by bulk samples of human skin54 and in epidermal
stem cells.55 ACE2 immunoreactivity was detected by immuno-
histochemistry (IHC) in the cells of the basal layer of the epider-
mis extending to the basal cell layer of hair follicles, sebaceous
gland cells as well as the smooth muscle cells surrounding the
sebaceous glands, and the cells of the eccrine glands in normal
skin.56,57 Recently, scRNA-seq was applied to analyse the ACE2
mRNA expression in different cell types in skin tissues.58 Higher
ACE2 expression was identiﬁed in keratinocytes mainly in differ-
entiating keratinocytes and basal cells compared with the other
cells of skin tissues. The results were further conﬁrmed by IHC,
which showed the ACE2-positive keratinocytes in the stratum
basal, the stratum spinosum and the stratum granulosum of epi-
derma. In addition, Li et al.59 found that CD8+ T-cell enrich-
ment had signiﬁcant positive correlations with the ACE2
expression in the skin.
Discussion
Infection with SARS-CoV-2 causes a broad spectrum of clinical
syndromes, ranging from mild pneumonia to acute respiratory
distress syndrome. Although cutaneous manifestations are rare,
the number of COVID-19 patients with skin involvement has
been reported to be increased. However, up to date, no in vitro
or in vivo experiments have been performed to conﬁrm whether
SARS-Cov-2 could spread through skin. In this review, we found
that ACE2 was expressed in the skin, especially in keratinocytes.
This provides an evidence for percutaneous infection or the
entry of virus into patients through skin tissue. Furthermore,
SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in blood samples from 22%
patients.60 Thus, it is possible that the ACE2 expression in skin
cells could be induced by viral infection via hematogenous dis-
semination, especially for the patients who were in a state of

viraemia. More biopsy specimens should be collected to detect
whether the presence of virus in skin lesions to conﬁrm it.
According to our review, erythematous rash is the most com-
mon feature among 507 patients. However, the mechanisms of
erythema development in the COVID-19 patients remain
unclear. It has been found that herpes simplex virus (HSV)
could cause a subset of erythema multiforme (EM) lesions (her-
pes-associated EM (HAEM)).61 After infection by HSV, the
DNA of HSV would be fragmented and the DNA fragments
could be transported to distant skin sites by peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMC). The HSV-speciﬁc CD4+ Th1 cells
could be recruited by the viral antigen to skin and initiate an
inﬂammatory cascade, which induces the development of
HAEM. For SARS-CoV-2 infection, although no studies have
reported virus in skin lesions, hyperactivated CD4+ and CD8+ T
cells were found in peripheral blood from patients by ﬂow
cytometry. Moreover, the concentration of CCR4- and CCR6-
positive Th17 in CD4 T cells was increased. CCR4 has been
implicated in the migration of T cells into skin, and its ligand,
CCL17, is expressed on cutaneous endothelial cells.62 Thus, the
virus-speciﬁc T cells in circulation could migrate into skin tis-
sues. In addition, lymphocyte inﬁltration has also been observed
in the skin lesions of COVID-19 patients. These ﬁndings sug-
gested that the skin rash might be caused by the virus-speciﬁc T
cells.
Urticaria is another common feature among those COVID-19
patients who presented rashes. Previous studies hypothesized
that viral IgM and IgG could cross-react with mast cell IgE and
cause the mast cell degranulation subsequently.63 SARS-CoV-2-
speciﬁc IgM and IgG can be detected in patients.64 Thus, the
cross-reaction between SARS-CoV-2 antibodies with mast cell
IgE might result in degranulation of mast cell and wheal growth.
Chilblain-like lesions, ischaemic lesions and ecchymotic acral
lesions were also observed in COVID-19 patients. It has been
reported that blood coagulation is altered in COVID-19 patients
and the acro-ischaemia might be associated with the hypercoag-
ulation status in severe COVID-19 patients.15 Recently, these
types of skin lesions were also found in asymptomatic or mildly
symptomatic patients, probably caused by a coagulation disorder
or a hypersensitivity reaction.17,65 Unfortunately, the mecha-
nisms of cutaneous manifestations are only hypothetical at pre-
sent. Interestingly, it is likely that the incidence of skin rashes
among COVID-19 patients varied in different countries. Only
eight cases were reported in China whereas 488 cases were from
Europe. A study in China reported that only two of 1,099
patients showed skin lesions,66 whereas Recalcati et al.,14 an Ital-
ian dermatologist team, described that skin changes occurred in
18 of the 88 conﬁrmed COVID-19 patients, and Hedou et al.67
reported that the incidence of cutaneous manifestations associ-
ated with COVID-19 infections in France was 4.9% based on a
prospective study of 103 cases. It is unclear that whether the dif-
ference was caused by missed diagnoses and unreported cases, or
regional differences.
It is noteworthy that skin rashes are also observed in general
population. For example, in a population-based study, up to 1%
of the general population in the USA and Europe suffered from

chronic urticarial at some point in their lifetime.68 The ratio was
signiﬁcantly higher in Asia, which was about 9–20%.69 Urti-
caria-like lesions were presented in 16.37% COVID-19 patients
with skin manifestation in our study. Therefore, we could not
rule out that the cutaneous lesions of COVID-19 patients were
merely an incidental phenomenon based on the population inci-
dence.
Conclusions
In conclusion, our review summarized the clinical characteristics
of skin lesions in COVID-19 patients and the possible mecha-
nisms by reviewing the ACE2 expression in skin tissues. However,
we should acknowledge that lots of questions regarding COVID-
19 remain unexplored. More clinical data should be collected,
and more researches should be carried out for a better under-
standing of the cutaneous manifestations caused by COVID-19.
